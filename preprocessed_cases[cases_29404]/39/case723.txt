kimberli hirst,an employee of american forensic nurses,afn,brought a fair employment and housing act feha claim against the city of oceanside city,alleging she was sexually harassed by an oceanside police officer,gilbert garcia,while she was providing phlebotomist services on behalf of the oceanside police department.the jury found hirst proved her claim and awarded her million in damages against the city.after reducing the amount for which garcia was found responsible,the court entered judgment in hirst favor for million.
the city moved for a new trial and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov.in the new trial motion,the city contended the damages award was unsupported by the evidence.in the jnov motion,the city argued hirst was not entitled to recover under the feha because she was not a city employee,special employee,or a person providing services pursuant to a contract under government code section,subdivision j 
the court denied the jnov motion,but granted the new trial motion finding the damage award was excessive.the court ordered a new trial on both liability and damages because the issues are so interrelated that damages can not be separated from the facts underlying liability.
hirst did not appeal from the new trial order,but the city appealed from the denial of its jnov motion,contending hirst had no standing to recover damages on her feha claim against the city.we determine the evidence supports that hirst was a person providing services pursuant to a contract and therefore she was entitled to recover against the city for its employee sexual harassment,subd.j.based on this conclusion,we do not reach the additional asserted ground for standing whether hirst was a special employee of the city.we affirm the court order denying the jnov motion and remand for further proceedings under the court new trial order.
factual and procedural background 
under the applicable review standard,we summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to hirst.see begnal canfield,th.in the discussion section,we describe additional evidence regarding the business and employment relationships among the city,afn,and hirst.
afn provides phlebotomy services for law enforcement agencies that need blood samples drawn from suspects for intoxication testing and other purposes.in,afn entered into a contract with san diego county county,requiring afn to supply personnel to perform blood draws on an basis at locations throughout the county,including the oceanside police department.
in august,afn hired hirst,a certified and trained phlebotomist,to work on an basis in the north county area.about one month later,while hirst was performing these blood drawing services for the oceanside police department,oceanside police officer garcia began making graphic sexual comments to her,and then repeated these comments during the next several months.these comments included garcia telling hirst i like to bend you over and fuck you in the ass and i want to watch you give me a blow job and you have a nice ass.hirst did not immediately report these comments because as a new employee she was concerned about her job and was afraid of police officer retaliation.
in about may,hirst afn supervisor,terry johnston,questioned hirst about garcia,stating that garcia has been saying really nasty things about you of a sexual nature.at that point,hirst broke down and disclosed officer garcia harassment.johnston responded that he would need to report the conduct,but hirst was adamant she did not want to report because she was afraid of retaliation.she just wanted it to go away.johnston continued discussing the issue with hirst,insisting he would need to report the conduct.at one point,a contract reserve officer overheard these conversations,and volunteered to report the conduct to an oceanside police sergeant.
shortly after,the reserve officer reported the conduct.in response,garcia supervisor ordered him to stay away from hirst,and began an investigation.upon learning of the harassment,afn president and chief executive officer communicated with the oceanside police department in an effort to ensure garcia would be appropriately controlled and disciplined.the afn president also counseled hirst regarding safety measures.
during the next several months,garcia engaged in several additional acts of harassment retaliation against hirst,including driving by and staring at her in a menacing way,kicking open a security gate in a dark area of the police station while letting hirst into the station,making an intimidating comment about hirst while she was at the station for a blood draw,and driving by her vehicle and mouthing the words fuck you.
in september,a city human resources manager prepared a report concluding that officer garcia had sexually harassed hirst and setting forth numerous factual findings supporting this conclusion.the report stated that officer garcia sexual harassment of hirst was inexcusable in the workplace hirst made it clear that she was offended by his statements and that officer garcia continued conduct unreasonably interfered with her work environment and caused her to feel intimidated and offended.the manager concluded there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a finding that officer garcia engaged in sexually derogatory and suggestive statements and graphic verbal commentary and hostile work environment sexual harassment under the standards established by the city internal harassment and discrimination prevention policy.the substantiated evidence in this investigation also indicates a high likelihood that officer garcia actions meet the elements necessary to establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment sexual harassment under the california fair employment and housing act feha.
based on this report,the oceanside police department put garcia on administrative leave.the police chief recommended termination,and this decision was affirmed by the city manager.garcia termination became final after he unsuccessfully challenged the termination at an arbitration hearing.
about one year later,hirst sued the city she initially alleged seven causes of action,but only her feha sexual harassment claim remained by the time of trial.hirst theory was that garcia sexually harassed her and that the city was liable either because garcia was her supervisor or because the city knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take immediate corrective action,subd.j.
at trial,hirst presented the evidence summarized above regarding the harassment,and also presented evidence regarding the city failure to promptly prevent the continuing harassment and her emotional distress resulting from garcia conduct.she additionally presented an expert,a human resources consultant,who testified that once the city learned of the harassment,it failed to take reasonable and timely steps to prevent continued harassment and retaliation against hirst.the expert also opined that hirst had standing under the feha to bring the sexual harassment action against the city.
in defense,the city agreed that garcia had committed most of the alleged improper conduct but argued it was not liable under the feha because hirst lacked standing to recover as she was not a city employee or a person providing services pursuant to a contract garcia conduct was not severe and pervasive garcia was not hirst supervisor as would be necessary to make the city strictly liable and the city responded timely and appropriately once it learned of the allegations.the city expert,an employment attorney,opined that the city fulfilled its feha obligations to address and prevent the harassment and hirst had no standing under the feha because she was not an employee,special employee,or an independent contractor.
at the conclusion of the evidence and arguments,the court gave the jury a special verdict form containing numerous questions.the first question asked was kimberli hirst an employee of the city of oceanside,a special employee of the city of oceanside,or a person providing services under a contract italics added.the jury answered yes to this question.the jury was also asked whether officer gilbert garcia,as kimberli hirst supervisor,engage d in harassing conduct or did city of oceanside know or should have known of the conduct and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action italics added.the jury also answered yes to this question.
in responding to the remaining questions on the verdict form,the jury found hirst was subjected to unwanted harassing conduct because she was a woman the harassment was severe or pervasive a reasonable woman would have considered the work environment to be hostile or abusive hirst considered the work environment to be hostile or abusive and the harassing conduct was a substantial factor in causing harm to hirst.the jury found hirst p ast loss was and her f uture loss was.the jury found afn was at fault for the harm,but this fault was not a substantial factor in causing hirst harm.the jury attributed percent fault to officer garcia for causing the harm.the jury found hirst was not at fault for the harm.
the court entered judgment against the city on this verdict for million.the city then moved for a new trial on grounds of excessive damages and moved for a jnov on the grounds that plaintiff has no standing under the feha,and as a matter of law,no other reasonable conclusion is legally deducible from the evidence.
the court denied the jnov motion,but granted the city new trial motion,stating it was convinced after hearing,reviewing and weighing all of the evidence that the damages awarded were clearly exorbitant.the court found a majority of the claimed damages were not legally compensable because they were for litigation stress hirst testimony regarding her emotional distress was not credible the only medical expert in the case testified that hirst did not need any medication or future treatment and hirst counsel had improperly urged the jury to award damages that would send the city a message,even though punitive damages can not be awarded against a public entity.the court found a new trial on liability and damages was necessary because the issues were intertwined.
the city appealed from the order denying its jnov motion,but hirst did not appeal from the new trial order 
discussion 
the city contends the court erred in denying its jnov motion because hirst had no standing to recover on her feha harassment claim.in resolving this contention we initially describe the standards governing jnov motions and legal standing under the feha.we next summarize the evidence relevant to the standing issue.we then explain our conclusion that hirst had standing to recover against the city for garcia harassment because she was a person providing services pursuant to a contract under section,subdivision j.
jnov review standards 
on appeal from the denial of a jnov motion,an appellate court must review the record de novo and make an independent determination whether there is any substantial evidence to support the jury findings.pacific corporate group holdings,llc keck th,trujillo north county transit dist.th,trujillo.this review is limited to determining whether there is any substantial evidence to support the jury verdict.begnal canfield,supra,th at.the court must accept as true the evidence supporting the verdict,disregard conflicting evidence,and indulge every legitimate inference to support the verdict.ibid.if sufficient evidence supports the verdict,a reviewing court must uphold the court denial of the jnov motion.ibid.if the appellant raises purely legal questions,we conduct a de novo review.wolf walt disney pictures television th,trujillo,supra,th at.

ii.standing to recover for sexual harassment under feha 
the feha establishes a comprehensive scheme intended to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek and hold employment free from prohibited discrimination and harassment.although the feha generally protects only employees and applicants,the provisions prohibiting harassment contained in section,subdivision j are intentionally broader.at the relevant times,section,subdivision j provided that an employer may be held liable for its employee harassment of an employee,an applicant,or a person providing services pursuant to a contract,subd.j,italics added.
the courts have interpreted the term employee used in this code section to include a special employee,which is a worker employed by one entity who is also considered an employee of a second entity if that borrowing entity exercises certain power of control over the employee.bradley department of corrections rehabilitation th,see state ex rel.of california highway patrol superior court cal th,fn,alvarado marsh tilley steel cal d.in determining this special employment status,the main factor is the second entity right to control job performance.alvarado,supra,cal th at.other relevant factors include whether the individual was paid by and could be discharged by the second employer,was a skilled worker with substantial control over operational details,was engaged in the second employer usual business,and used the second employer tools and equipment.id.at.the administrative regulations define one type of employee that comes within this special employment status individuals compensated by a temporary employment agency who are assigned to work for a contracted employer,tit,subd.b see mathieu norrell th.
the second relevant category a person providing services pursuant to a contract is specifically defined in section,subdivision j 
for purposes of this subdivision,a person providing services pursuant to a contract means a person who meets all of the following criteria 
a the person has the right to control the performance of the contract for services and discretion as to the manner of performance.
b the person is customarily engaged in an independently established business.
c the person has control over the time and place the work is performed,supplies the tools and instruments used in the work,and performs work that requires a particular skill not ordinarily used in the course of the employer work.
a person is defined to include one or more individuals,partnerships,associations,corporations,limited liability companies,legal representatives,trustees,trustees in bankruptcy,and receivers or other fiduciaries,subd.d.
an employer may also be liable for the sexual harassment committed by nonemployees on employees,applicants,or persons providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace if the employer,or its agents or supervisors,knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action,subd.j,italics added.however,i n reviewing cases involving the acts of nonemployees,the extent of the employer control and any other legal responsibility that the employer may have with respect to the conduct of those nonemployees shall be considered.ibid.
iii.relevant facts regarding hirst employment status 
under the contract between afn and the county,afn agreed to provide employees to perform phlebotomy services at law enforcement and health care locations throughout the county.the contract required the employees to comply with state administrative regulations applicable to blood draws and be certified to perform the blood draws.the contract further required the phlebotomy services to be performed under the direct supervision of a sworn law enforcement officer or a crime lab forensic staff member.under the contract,afn employees were required to provide all necessary materials to perform the blood draws.
the contract specifically stated that afn is an independent c ontractor,and neither afn nor afn employees shall be deemed to be employees of the county.the contract required afn to obtain all employees required to perform its obligations under the agreement,and stated the employees shall be at afn sole cost and expense the contract further stated that afn shall perform its obligations according to its own means and methods of work which shall not be subject to control or supervision by county except as to the results of the work.the contract also provided that neither afn nor any of its employees shall be entitled to any benefits to which county employees are entitled,including without limitation,overtime,retirement benefits,workers compensation benefits and injury leave.
the evidence at trial showed the contract implementation was consistent with these provisions.afn had approximately certified employees in the san diego area.afn trained its employees,and they were supervised by an afn supervisor and manager.afn had the authority to hire and fire the employees,and the county had no authority over these matters.each month,an afn supervisor prepared a schedule determining which afn phlebotomist would be assigned to which shifts for which agencies.when a law enforcement officer needed a blood draw,the officer would contact his law enforcement agency dispatch,which would contact afn dispatch,which would contact the afn phlebotomist on call.the afn phlebotomist would then travel to the site where the blood draw was needed.the phlebotomist would be paid by afn according to the number of blood draws completed each month.
afn phlebotomists were not permitted to enter secure law enforcement facilities without an escort.a law enforcement officer would meet the afn phlebotomist at the security gate and take the phlebotomist to the room where the blood draws were performed.the officer would tell the afn phlebotomist whether the test was still needed,and whether it was voluntary or forcible,whether the suspect was cooperative.the afn phlebotomist then drew blood as he or she saw fit according to the worker applicable medical training,with the officer observing the procedure.at all times,the officer would provide supervision and maintain security of both the suspect and the phlebotomist.
once the blood draw was complete,the afn phlebotomist and the officer who witnessed the draw would sign a form confirming that the draw had occurred.this form was necessary for the phlebotomist and afn to receive compensation for the work performed.the officer would then escort the afn phlebotomist out of the facility.a typical afn phlebotomist site visit took about minutes from start to finish.
in her testimony,hirst confirmed these procedures applied to her work at the oceanside police station.hirst brought the equipment and relied on her own expertise when performing blood draws.but a law enforcement officer was always present when she was drawing blood.she was escorted into the station by a police officer,who would unlock an outside gate to allow her to enter the facilities.the officer had complete responsibility over the suspect and the environment under which the blood draw was administered,and hirst had authority over the blood draw once the suspect was in a position that allowed a safe blood draw.the procedure would take about five to minutes depending on the cooperation of the suspect.
iv.analysis 
at trial,hirst contended she was entitled to recover against the city for unlawful sexual harassment because she was either a special employee or a person providing services pursuant to a contract under section,subdivision j.although both parties presented expert evidence on these issues,our legal analysis is primarily a matter of statutory interpretation.the jury answered yes to the special verdict question whether hirst was an employee of the city of oceanside,a special employee of the city of oceanside,or a person providing services under a contract.italics added.thus,for purposes of reviewing the court denial of the jnov motion on the standing issue,we must uphold the court order if the evidence supported any one of these statutory categories.
as explained below,we conclude hirst fell within the person providing services pursuant to a contract category,and therefore need not reach the special employee question,subd.j.the record shows hirst was providing services to the city pursuant to a contract during the time she was sexually harassed by a city employee.afn and the county entered into a contract requiring afn to provide employees for phlebotomist services to law enforcement agencies throughout the county.afn hired hirst to fulfill the obligations of this contract,and hirst blood drawing services for the oceanside police department were specifically performed pursuant to the terms of the contract.the jury found garcia sexually harassed hirst when she was performing these contractual services.
the city argues hirst did not satisfy the providing services pursuant to a contract category because this phrase has been specifically defined in the statutes,and she does not fit each of the elements of this definition.as stated above,section,subdivision j defines a person providing services pursuant to a contract as one who has the right to control the performance of the contract for services and discretion as to the manner of performance is customarily engaged in an independently established business and has control over the time and place the work is performed,supplies the tools and instruments used in the work,and performs work that requires a particular skill not ordinarily used in the course of the employer work,subd.j a c.
the facts showed hirst satisfied this statutory definition.when she was dispatched to the oceanside police department,hirst exercised her own professional judgment in implementing the blood drawing services.although the police department closely monitored this work,this was purely a function of its law enforcement obligation to control the suspect,ensure hirst safety,and preserve the validity of the blood evidence.see alvarado,supra,cal th at.there is no evidence the oceanside police department had employment authority over hirst,other than to secure the environment in which this work was performed.this type of supervision does not create an employment relationship or negate a worker independent contractor status.see ibid.further,hirst was customarily engaged in the phlebotomist business,and this business was not a usual part of the city public duties.hirst also brought equipment to perform these services and did not use the city property or rely on its expertise,and the evidence showed the blood drawing work was not a skill ordinarily possessed by the city law enforcement personnel.
at trial,the focus of hirst argument was not that she was personally described by these provisions she instead argued she was entitled to trigger feha protection because afn came within the statutory definition.the city does not dispute that afn was a person providing services pursuant to a contract under the section,subdivision j definition.but the city argues afn status can not be attributed to hirst because she is not the person who contracted for the work and instead was merely the employee of the independent contractor.
this view is unsupported.afn is a corporation that must act through its agents.see black bank of america th.as a business entity,afn does not personally provide the phlebotomist contractor services its services are performed by individuals including hirst acting on afn behalf.it would be unreasonable to conclude the legislature would have intended that afn had standing but those who actually performed the services pursuant to a contract were barred from recovery
