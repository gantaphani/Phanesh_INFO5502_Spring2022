hans evers performed medical consulting services for the united states social security administration ssa until ssa terminated his contract following a verbal altercation evers had with an ssa supervisor.evers initially sought administrative relief for the contract termination and for the subsequent rejection of three bids he placed on other ssa contracts.dissatisfied with the results,evers filed suit in the northern district of illinois,alleging constitutional tort claims against ssa officers for violating his fifth amendment rights to procedural and substantive due process.evers complaint also sought judicial review of ssa for violating his rights and for failing to follow federal regulations governing the suspension,termination,and debarment of government employees.the district court dismissed evers claims and some of his regulatory claims,finding that the contract disputes act,et,divested it of jurisdiction over those claims because they related to evers contract with ssa.two years later,after a bench trial,the district court dismissed the remainder of the case as moot.because the district court lacked jurisdiction,we affirm both dismissals.
hans evers,a neurologist,worked as a medical consultant for ssa pursuant to a contract awarded in december.the initial contract period ran from january through december,and the contract carried four renewal options.ssa exercised all four options,and evers began work under the final renewal term in january.
on august,a verbal altercation took place between evers and lillie brown,an ssa employee who was responsible for monitoring and training contractors.brown concluded that evers had erred by commenting on a issue in a case,and went to discuss the matter with evers.when brown explained her observation to evers,he confronted her in a loud shouted to brown that she was incompetent to address the issue,that she should leave his work area,and that her interference with his work should be investigated.brown immediately reported evers outburst,and later that day an ssa director told evers to leave the building because brown feared for her personal safety.evers left,and sent brown an that apologized for his angry.three days later,evers received a letter from an ssa contract specialist,advising him that his work under his contract was being stopped while ssa investigated the incident.around the same time,evers sent a letter to ssa explaining his version of the events.
on august,evers met with ssa officials to discuss what had transpired.the next day,reggie poskocimas,a contracting officer for ssa,wrote evers a letter stating that ssa was terminating evers contract for cause due to the incident with brown.poskocimas letter referred to the termination and clauses in evers contract,which permitted ssa to remove evers if ssa determined him unfit to perform due to d isorderly conduct,use of offensive language,quarreling,intimidation by words or actions or fighting or participating in disruptive activities which interfere with the normal and efficient operations of the government.the letter also cited a clause that made all disputes subject to the contract disputes act,and advised evers that he could either appeal his contract termination to the general services administration board of contract appeals gsabca within days,or he could file an action on his claim in the united states court of federal claims within months.see,a.
a few weeks later,evers elected to appeal poskocimas termination decision to the gsabca.in his complaint to the gsabca,evers alleged tort claims for retaliatory discharge and intentional interference with an existing contract,violations of his constitutional rights to substantive and procedural due process,and a failure by ssa to follow federal regulations when terminating him.in november,the gsabca explained that it did not have jurisdiction to consider constitutional violations or torts,nor could it decide the asserted regulatory claims because they had never been submitted to a contracting officer for decision.as a result,the gsabca asserted its jurisdiction over only the challenge to the suspension and termination of evers contract the gsabca dismissed the other claims without prejudice.the gsabca offered evers a choice he could voluntarily withdraw the appeal of his contract claim without prejudice before november,or he could continue to litigate the propriety of his suspension and termination before the gsabca.evers gave untimely notice that he wished to withdraw,and the gsabca dismissed evers appeal,with prejudice,in december.
while evers gsabca appeal was pending,he submitted bid proposals in response to three solicitations for ssa contracts.poskocimas,who had terminated evers,was also responsible for awarding these contracts,and rejected evers bids.poskocimas sent evers a letter stating that ssa had awarded the contracts to other doctors and inviting evers to submit future bids.when evers asked poskocimas why his bids were rejected,poskocimas sent evers a second letter,which explained that evers quotes were rejected based on his past contract performance,specifically,his actions on august,which led to termination of the contract for cause.
evers filed three protests one for each rejected bid with the general accounting office gao in january.evers claimed that ssa had engaged in an unfair and secret process when denying his bids.one month later,ssa filed a response with the gao,explaining that it rejected evers bids because,pursuant to federal regulations,it presumed him to be nonresponsible due to the termination of his previous contract for cause.see b.eventually,evers and ssa agreed that ssa should have nonetheless referred his quotes to the small business administration sba before determining that he was not a responsible bidder the gao dismissed the protests based on ssa representation that it would refer the quotes to sba.
in late march,evers filed a complaint in the northern district of illinois against ssa,poskocimas,brown,and several other ssa officers.counts i and ii of the complaint alleged constitutional torts against the ssa officers under bivens six unknown named agents of the federal bureau of narcotics,d.see also davis passman,d.specifically,count i alleged that the officers violated evers fifth amendment right to procedural due process by pinning a badge of infamy on evers without a meaningful opportunity for review.evers claimed that he had a property interest in the remaining five months of his contract with ssa,and he alleged that he had liberty interests in the renewal of his contract and in not having his contract terminated under circumstances calling into question his good name,reputation,honor,and integrity evers argued that he was denied these interests without notice or hearing when the officers summarily suspended him,terminated his contract,and denied his bid requests.count ii of the complaint alleged that the ssa officers deprived evers of his fifth amendment right to substantive due process because terminating his contract was an overreaction to the august claimed that the officers engaged in administrative tyranny so arbitrary that it shocks the conscience.count iii called for judicial review of ssa under the administrative procedure act,for violating evers rights,and also alleged that ssa failed to follow federal regulations when it suspended evers contract and excluded him from receiving future work.evers requested a myriad of remedies including,among others,million in damages,review of the administrative record,declaratory relief,a reversal of the order and contract termination,and that ssa provide good references to potential employers if evers applied for work in the future.
in late june,the district court ruled on a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment filed by ssa and its officers,and on a motion for summary judgment on count iii filed by evers.first,the district court dismissed all claims relating to the termination of evers contract,pursuant to the contract disputes act.the district court explained that the contract disputes act outlines a distinctive procedure for resolving a ll claims by a contractor against the government relating to a contract quoting a.the court reasoned that evers constitutional claims related to the termination of his contract because the source of the rights upon which evers bases his claim is his contract with the ssa and the alleged wrongful termination of that contract.consequently,the court held that it lacked jurisdiction over counts i and ii of the complaint,as well as over evers request in count iii for a reversal of his suspension and termination,which the court deemed was really a request for specific performance on the contract.next,the court explained that the constitutional torts alleged against the ssa officials in counts i and ii were improper bivens actions because the comprehensive system of remedies for resolving government contract suits via the contract disputes act precludes a private cause of action for an alleged constitutional violation.
the district court then turned to the for summary judgment on the remaining claims in count ssa had violated federal regulations when it denied evers bids for the three subsequent contracts.on those claims,the district court found that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether ssa actions constituted a de jure suspension de facto debarment.the case proceeded to a bench trial in march.
in september,the district court determined that the controversy between evers and ssa had become moot.after thoroughly analyzing each of the eleven forms of relief requested in count iii of the complaint,the district court concluded e ven if the court were to find that evers was de jure suspended de facto debarred as alleged,there would be no change in evers present status.the court added,if evers does apply for contracts in the future and is not awarded such contracts,evers retains the right to challenge those actions the district court also noted that evers medical license had been suspended in for his failure to complete requirements,and the court explained that this suspension further limited its ability to fashion a remedy.evers timely appealed from both the june and september orders.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,evers argues that the district court should not have dismissed the majority of his claims pursuant to the contract disputes act because the claims were not contractual in nature.evers also contends that the district court decision to dismiss the bivens claims was predicated on its erroneous assumption that the contract disputes act barred jurisdiction.finally,evers disputes the district court dismissal of his remaining claims as moot.

the parties agree that the contract disputes act applied to evers services contract with ssa in fact,the contract contained a clause stating all disputes would be resolved subject to the contract disputes act,and evers initially pursued relief as contemplated under the statute by filing an appeal with the gsabca.we must therefore determine whether the claims in evers complaint in the district court related to his contract with ssa.if so,the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because the contract disputes act is precisely drawn to preclude such claims from being entertained by federal district courts.
the interpretation of the relating to a contract language in the contract disputes act is a question of first impression in our circuit.other circuits have determined whether a claim relates to a contract based upon the source of the plaintiff rights and the relief sought by the plaintiff.see b b trucking,postal,cir en banc the contract disputes act bars district court jurisdiction if the court determines that a plaintiff claims against a government agency are essentially contractual in nature.the classification of a particular action as one which is or is not essentially contractual depends both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claim,and upon the type of relief sought or appropriate.internal citations and quotation marks omitted lader,at t he determination of whether an action is at its essence a contract action for purposes of the parallel provisions of the tucker act,a,depends both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims,and upon the type of relief sought or appropriate quoting megapulse,lewis,alteration in original see also applied united states,congress decision to limit the applicability of the act procedures to those claims relating to a contract indicates that the claim at issue must have some relationship to the terms or performance of a government contract.campanella,at rmi titanium westinghouse,cir.the sixth circuit has also explained that,t he plaintiff title or characterization of its claims is not controlling.a plaintiff may not avoid the jurisdictional bar of the contract disputes act merely by alleging violations of regulatory or statutory provisions.b b trucking,at quoting rmi titanium,at see also united states.
bearing this persuasive authority in mind,we will determine whether each of evers claims related to his ssa contract by examining the facts alleged in the complaint to ascertain the source of evers rights and the forms of relief requested or appropriate to vindicate those rights.in conducting our analysis,we also adopt the view that the characterization or labeling of claims by the pleader is not controlling.see b b trucking,at,at.so evers can not escape the precisely drawn remedial framework outlined by the contract disputes act merely by styling his complaint as one for redress of constitutional torts and regulatory violations rather than as one for breach of a tactic,albeit crafty pleading,will not suffice.see b b trucking,at rmi titanium,at.
