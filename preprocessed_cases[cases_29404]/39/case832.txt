the false claims act hereafter sometimes referred to as the act,et imposes treble damage liability on one who,among other things,k nowingly presents or causes to be presented to an officer or employee of the state or of any political subdivision thereof,a false claim for payment or approval,subd.a.where the attorney general initiates litigation under the act,or intervenes in an action initiated by a private party,the attorney general may move to dismiss the case on a showing of good cause,subd.e a.
in this matter,we conclude good cause for dismissal exists where the attorney general establishes that the false claims act cause of action is without merit.we further conclude that the submission of a claim for payment on a contract allegedly entered into in violation of state contracting laws,where the state was fully aware of and instigated the alleged violations,does not contravene the act.

good cause for dismissal 
in this matter,the attorney general elected to intervene and thereby assume control of the litigation.following allied successful demurrer to the complaint,acs sought to file an amended complaint,which the trial court rejected.the court concluded the decision to file an amended complaint was in the hands of the attorney general and directed the attorney general to file either an amended complaint,or a motion to dismiss.the attorney general chose the latter.
acs argues the attorney general failed to establish good cause for dismissal.according to acs,good cause requires consideration of the best interests of the parties and the public purposes behind the act,whereas the attorney general relied on a purported lack of merit in the false claims act cause of action.acs argues the primary purpose underlying the of the public not furthered by dismissal of the action.
the question of what is meant by good cause under the act is a matter of statutory interpretation,which we consider de novo.see employees union pacific motor freight th,d.acs argument is based on section,subdivision c,which reads a person may bring a civil action for a violation of this article for the person and either for the state of california in the name of the state,if any state funds are involved,or for a political subdivision in the name of the political subdivision,if political subdivision funds are exclusively involved.the person bringing the action shall be referred to as the qui tam plaintiff.once filed,the action may be dismissed only with the written consent of the co
