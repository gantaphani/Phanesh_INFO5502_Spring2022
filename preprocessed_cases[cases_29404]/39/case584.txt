in this government contract case,the contractor seeks damages based on a claim of constructive acceleration.following a trial,the court of federal claims ruled that the contractor had failed to prove that the government constructively accelerated its performance.fraser const.united states,fed.cl.because the trial court decision is based on factual findings that have not been shown to be clearly erroneous,we affirm.
in,the army corps of engineers was engaged in a flood control project on the south fork zumbro river in rochester,minnesota.in connection with the project,the corps contracted with fraser construction company to excavate material from the bottom of silver lake,a shallow reservoir located along the river.the price of the contract was.the project was scheduled to begin on may,and to be completed by september of that year.before the project began,the water level in the lake was to be lowered by approximately eight feet to facilitate excavation of the lake bottom.at that water elevation most of the lake would normally be dry,except for a small stream running through the lakebed.
fraser intended to divert the stream into a trench along the edge of the dry lakebed and to construct an earthen dike to confine the water to the trench.the dike was originally designed to withstand a water flow rate of cubic feet per second cfs.that rate of water flow was substantially higher than the average flow rate for silver lake,although the flow rate varied considerably and would occasionally reach much higher levels.the evidence at trial showed that a water flow in excess of the flow the dike was designed to handle could destroy the dike and flood the lakebed.according to statistics from the geological survey,a water flow of more than cfs could be expected to occur,on average,approximately times per year during the months of june,july,and august.
in comments accompanying the acceptance of fraser construction progress schedule,in which fraser described its plan for conducting the work,the corps pointed out that the diversion system fraser had selected will be susceptible to damage by flow amounts which are anticipated to occur during the may to august time frame.delays due to such flows are not justification for extension of the contract completion date.
the corps concerns turned out to be well founded.because of wet weather in the region,silver lake began to experience high water flows shortly after the project started.on may,before fraser diversion dike was completed,the flow rate reached cfs,which damaged the dike and flooded the work site.fraser spent much of the next two weeks repairing the dike,work that fraser asserts was made more difficult than anticipated because high water flows continued through that period,rather than receding as fraser had expected.after the dike was repaired,excavation work resumed,but between june and june the project was again flooded,with the peak flow rate reaching cfs.the mean daily flow rate for that time period was twice as high as was considered normal.recurrent high water flows continued during july and into august.
the contract between fraser and the corps specified that severe weather would be a ground for a time extension.on june,steve nelson,fraser project manager,made a request to sheldon edd,the government contracting officer,for a time extension based on weather conditions and high water flows.edd dealt with and for the most part informally granted extensions immediately however,edd stated that he would deal at a later date with requests based solely on high water flow conditions.
on june,fraser president,rick penz,submitted fraser first written request for an adjustment in time and money based on the high water flows.in the letter,penz stated that the excavation site became flooded as a result of high water flows on may,june,and june.he stated that it was fraser position that the flow rates on the first two occasions were within what has to be considered the usual nature inherent to this site and we do not request an equitable adjustment for the extra work involved as a result of those flows.with respect to the june event,however,he said that fraser considered the flow rate on that occasion to be high enough to justify an adjustment in time and dollar amount for the contract.in the june letter,penz characterized the high flow problem as a differing site condition.
the corps replied to the june letter four days later,asking fraser to provide further information regarding the request,such as what fraser had anticipated about the site,what was different about the site,and how fraser was damaged.that same day,the corps sent fraser a letter demanding that the company improve its progress and threatening to terminate the contract due to delays in the project.a copy of that letter was sent to fraser bonding company.the government contends that the letter was sent not only because the project was significantly behind schedule,but also because fraser subcontractor had refused to haul away the soil excavated from the lakebed due to the subcontractor concern that the soil contained contaminated material.
on june,fraser sent the corps a revised completion schedule in which it took the position that,up to that point,of the scheduled work days had been affected by weather and the effects of extreme conditions.assuming a day extension,fraser contended it was still on schedule to complete the work within the contract period as extended.fraser explained that it intended to use a drag line so as to continue excavating materials even while the lakebed was wet.
edd and nelson met on july to negotiate extensions for days.according to nelson notes,edd stated at that time that the corps would not recognize extensions based on high water conditions in the zumbro river,as the corps considered it to be fraser responsibility to ensure that the lakebed did not become inundated.a week later,nelson advised edd that the excavation site had been flooded again,and edd replied that fraser should have anticipated the conditions and had to continue working.
on july,leon mucha,a corps representative,responded by letter to fraser june request for a price adjustment in the contract.he denied the request on the ground that fraser should have anticipated the risk that the dike would be destroyed based on the frequency of peak flows high enough to overtop the dike.mucha letter referred to the corps earlier statement that fraser should anticipate failure of its dike in the event of significant rainfall,that restoration of the diversion system was fraser responsibility,and that delays caused by river flows would not be considered justification for extension of the contract completion date.nonetheless,the parties agreed on a modification to the contract for days in which the completion date was extended by calendar days.the day extension was granted based on a finding that there were work days in june based on a work week on which,because of adverse weather conditions,work was not feasible at the disposal site.
in a july meeting with corps representatives,fraser for the first time asserted a claim of constructive acceleration in addition to its claim of a differing site condition.fraser contended that extensions granted after the fact were not sufficient to compensate the company for the extra expenses it had incurred in dealing with the high water flows,because upon being told that it would not receive time extensions for days of high flow or that those extensions would be dealt with at a later time,it was forced to continue operations at a substantial additional cost.
in response to the oral claim of constructive acceleration,the corps advised fraser that it had not accelerated the contract.the corps added that although it was required to grant time extensions for high flow conditions,it was not required to grant monetary relief for such conditions.
on july,mucha requested a revised schedule for completing the work.penz replied on july with a revised schedule that incorporated six rainout days in july.the following day,fraser again contended that it had encountered abnormal weather and noted that it was continuing to press its claims of differing site condition and constructive acceleration.fraser again requested an additional time extension but did not specify how much additional time was warranted.in response,the corps asked fraser to specify the time periods for which it believed it was entitled to an extension and the reasons it believed there had been government acceleration.
in its response to the corps request for information,fraser replied that the extremely adverse weather conditions that we have encountered this year have led to severe delays and completely unforeseen working conditions.we believe we are entitled to equitable adjustments of both our contract sum and our contract time you do not believe you have to pay us any more money,and you have made an offer of a few days time extension to compensate us for our delays we also believe that your refusal to grant us appropriate time extensions,your complaints about our progress and threats to terminate our contract on account of our progress constitutes constructive acceleration.
during august,the parties negotiated a further time extension for days in july.as a result of the negotiations,the contract was modified to extend the completion date to september.the corps explained that it had agreed to reopen the adverse weather days for june for renegotiation.the corps then agreed to all of fraser claims for days except for june,which the corps said was an affected date only because the original excavation cofferdam was not adequate nor according to the submitted plan,and it was over topped,creating a wet excavation site.according to the corps,nelson agreed to exclude june from the days.the corps explained that the criteria it used for calculating adverse weather delays included the day of a rain as well as any period after that rain when the disposal area was too wet and muddy for the trucks to dump or if the material in the lake excavation was too wet or muddy for excavation or hauling as a direct result of the rain and excluded any effect that was solely attributed to the or inadequacy of the contractor diking system.
in an august letter,fraser contended that the extensions for days were not sufficient to resolve its constructive acceleration claim.fraser explained that when high water flows persisted for days,with our temporary dikes overtopped,you gave us no time extensions unless it happened to be raining or it was physically impossible to dump at the disposal site.when the water subsided,but it was still too wet to work,you gave us no time extensions,unless it happened to be raining because of your threats of termination and consistent demands,we have worked almost continuously this summer.what we should have done is simply shut down the entire operation until the waters receded to levels that were more nearly normal.
in late september,the parties agreed upon a further modification of the contract,which extended the completion date to october,based on an adjustment for days of severe weather in august.once again,the corps explained that extensions were granted for days of rain as well as any periods after a rain when the disposal area was too wet and muddy for the trucks to dump or if the material in the lake excavation was too wet or muddy for excavation or hauling as a direct result of the rain and excluded any effect that was solely attributed to the overtopping or inadequacy of the contractor diking system.
on september,fraser sent the corps another letter summarizing its position regarding constructive acceleration.fraser contended that when the heavy rains and high water came,the corps had given fraser only a minimal number of days of time extension and then only for direct downtime during and immediately after a rainfall.you gave us no allowance whatsoever for high water or high flow problems.because you were not granting us time extensions equal to the actual delays we were enduring,we had no choice except to accelerate our work and attempt to work under circumstances where we should simply have shut down.
after completing the contract,fraser submitted its claim of constructive acceleration to the contracting officer.fraser contended the denial of reasonable extensions for high water flow conditions during the contract period entitled it to an additional over the contract price.according to fraser,the consistently high water flow caused repeated flooding of the excavation area.because the corps forced us to work through the flooding,we were never able to implement our original excavation plan also,the consistently high water levels made the site impossible to dewater effectively.without dewatering,we incurred substantially increased costs working at the site and handling the excavated material.
the contracting officer denied fraser claim on february.the contracting officer noted that fraser had declined to identify the specific days for which it believed additional time extensions should have been granted,and that instead fraser had relied on its general contention that it had been forced to work through flood conditions.the contracting officer,however,found that the conditions at the work site did not constitute a flood,and that fraser therefore was not entitled to any contract extension beyond the days of additional time granted in the four contract modifications.with respect to the inundation of the work site,the contracting officer observed that if fraser had designed its dike to protect against foreseeable peak flow rates,it would not have experienced any problems due to overtopping of the dikes.
fraser subsequently filed this action in the court of federal claims.the trial court initially granted summary judgment in favor of the government on three grounds the contract did not recognize a right to an extension based on high water flows alone,but only for unusually severe weather fraser was granted all the extensions of time it sought and was not otherwise accelerated and fraser was negligent in the design of its dike,and for that reason fraser was not entitled to time extensions attributable to high water flows.on appeal,we reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for trial.we held that the contract time extension clause was broad enough to cover high flow conditions.we also held that there were genuine issues of material fact with respect to the granting of time extensions and whether fraser problems were attributable to inadequacies in the design of its dike.fraser constr.united states,wl.july.
following an trial,the trial court ruled that fraser had not established the government liability based on constructive acceleration.the court first found that fraser should have anticipated high peak flows of the sort that occurred during the summer of and should have anticipated that its dike would be overtopped and damaged delays resulting from poor dike design,the court concluded,were not excusable.second,the court found that fraser had inaccurately advised the corps that its dike had a capacity of only cfs when its capacity was actually significantly greater according to the court,because the corps was given inaccurate information as to the capacity of the dike it was reasonable for the corps to conclude that the destruction of the dike was foreseeable and thus was the cause of the inundation of the work site.third,the court rejected fraser arguments that the time extensions the corps granted were not granted on a timely basis and that the corps emphasis on the need for fraser to adhere to the contract schedule constituted a constructive notice to accelerate.the time extensions that fraser received,the court found,exhausted the full extent of its relief under the contract.from that ruling,fraser took this appeal.
a claim of acceleration is a claim for the increased costs that result when the government requires the contractor to complete its performance in less time than was permitted under the contract.the claim arises under the changes clause of a contract the basis for the claim is that the government has modified the contract by shortening the time for performance,either expressly in the case of actual acceleration or implicitly through its conduct in the case of constructive acceleration,and that under the changes clause the government is required to compensate the contractor for the additional costs incurred in effecting the change.see john cibinic,ralph nash,administration of government contracts ed.
a claim of constructive acceleration ordinarily arises when the government requires the contractor to adhere to the original performance deadline set forth in the contract even though the contract provides the contractor with periods of excusable delay that entitle the contractor to a longer performance period.although different formulations have been used in setting forth the elements of constructive acceleration,the requirements are generally described to include the following elements,each of which must be proved by the contractor that the contractor encountered a delay that is excusable under the contract that the contractor made a timely and sufficient request for an extension of the contract schedule that the government denied the contractor request for an extension or failed to act on it within a reasonable time that the government insisted on completion of the contract within a period shorter than the period to which the contractor would be entitled by taking into account the period of excusable delay,after which the contractor notified the government that it regarded the alleged order to accelerate as a constructive change in the contract and that the contractor was required to expend extra resources to compensate for the lost time and remain on schedule.see norair eng g united states,compressing these five requirements into three essential elements excusable delay,an order to accelerate,and acceleration with attendant costs lanthier,cch,at,wl commercial contractors,cch,at,wl hemphill contracting,cch,at,wl eng.mcnutt constr,cch,at,wl eng.cibinic nash,supra,at.
the trial court held that fraser failed to prove several of the elements necessary to establish constructive acceleration.first,the court held that fraser failed to prove that the problems it encountered arose from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the contractor,within the meaning of the default clause of the contract.with respect to that issue,fraser concedes that it was foreseeable that during the performance period there would be peak flows on the river that would result in overtopping its dike,and that each overtopping event would likely require that the dike be rebuilt.fraser contends,however,that it was unforeseeable and that it was beyond fraser control and not the result of its fault or negligence that water levels would remain high for days,causing inundation of the work site for lengthy periods.instead,fraser argues,it was reasonable to expect that following each high peak flow the water would recede quickly and that fraser would be able to resume working in dry conditions.
fraser argument,in essence,is that although the high water conditions it experienced at the work site were causally related to the repeated overtopping of its dike,and although it is responsible for the direct,foreseeable consequences of the overtopping of its dike,it should not be held responsible for the continued high water conditions that prevailed for days after each overtopping.those conditions,fraser argues,lasted much longer than could reasonably have been foreseen and therefore should have been treated as grounds for excusable delay.the trial court rejected fraser argument,holding that because it was foreseeable that fraser dike would be overtopped several times during the summer of,fraser assumed the risk that the effects of those foreseeable overtoppings including the inundation of the worksite for lengthy periods and the difficulties resulting from the wet worksite did not provide fraser with a contractual basis for claiming an entitlement to a period of excusable delay extending throughout the summer.thus,under the trial court analysis,even though there were abnormally high average daily water flows in the zumbro river throughout much of the summer of,those high flow levels did not constitute an independent basis for excusable delay,because if fraser had constructed its dike system to survive foreseeable peak flow events,the high average daily flows would have been contained and would not have presented problems for the excavation project.
the question whether the high water levels following periods of high peak flows were unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the contractor,within the meaning of the default clause,is a difficult one.there is no question that the high peak flows were foreseeable and that they were,as the trial court stated,the genesis of most,if not all,of fraser difficulties.that does not mean,however,that fraser is necessarily chargeable with all events that are traceable to the overtopping of the dike,including unforeseeable levels of high water during extended periods following the overtopping and destruction of the dike.we need not decide whether high water conditions during the performance period could provide a separate basis for time extensions under any circumstances,however,because we conclude that the court did not commit clear error in finding that,even apart from the foreseeability of the high water conditions,fraser proof of constructive acceleration failed in other regards and thus it did not prove that it was entitled to compensation for constructive acceleration under the circumstances of this case 
the corps granted time extensions totaling calendar days to fraser during the course of the project.in order to prevail on its claim of constructive acceleration,fraser was required to prove that the delays it encountered were not adequately remedied by the additional days it received.fraser makes several arguments in support of its contention that the day extension was inadequate that the various extensions granted during the course of the contract were not granted on a timely basis and therefore were of no use to fraser that fraser was entitled to suspend performance during the entire summer of and that it was not required to identify particular days on which it was entitled to receive an extension but did not and that the corps forced fraser to continue working despite the high water conditions,thus compelling it to accelerate its performance.the trial court found against fraser on each of those points.
timeliness of the extensions 
constructive acceleration can be found if the government demands prompt performance while simultaneously denying extensions for excusable delays or granting them only belatedly.see norair,at where the government refuses for whatever reason to tell the contractor until the end of the project just what delay is excusable and what is not,the contractor is under considerable additional pressure to accede to a request because it does not know whether it will be found liable for liquidated damages.
grants of time extensions,however,need not be immediate.constructive acceleration requires that the government be afforded an opportunity to grant or deny a time extension on account of the delay.greulich,cch,at,wl eng.m ere failure to grant an extension at the time will not constitute a constructive order to accelerate.norair,at.in mcnutt construction,cch,at eng,for example,a time extension was sought on june and granted on august.the board of contract appeals held that in the absence of evidence to the contrary,there was no reason that such an interval was an unreasonable amount of time.see also mckenzie eng g,cch,at,wl.
fraser argues that many of the time extensions that it was ultimately granted were of no use to it because the extensions were not granted on a timely basis.the trial court,however,found against fraser on that issue.according to the court,the record contains no indication that the corps granting of time extensions was tardy in any way or that the corps deviated at all from the standard procedures used to grant time extensions.to the contrary,the court found that corps representatives participated in daily discussions with fraser about the days to be granted,and that the days of each month for which
