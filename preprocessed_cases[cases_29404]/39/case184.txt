habitat education center,a nonprofit enterprise dedicated to promoting environmental quality,sued the forest service to obtain judicial review of the service decision to allow several thousand acres of a national forest in wisconsin to be logged.there are other parties on both sides of the case,but,with one exception mentioned later,they can be ignored.habitat asked for and was granted a preliminary injunction against the issuance of the permit to the company that had been the high bidder for the logging contract.the judge required habitat to post a injunction bond,pursuant to rule c of the civil rules,which provides that the court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.there is an exception if the applicant for the preliminary injunction is a federal agency or officer but it has no application to this case.
habitat asked the judge to reconsider the bond order.it argued that a nonprofit enterprise at least one devoted to so great and general a good as the protection of the environment should not have to post an injunction bond.the judge declined to rescind or modify the order.neither it nor the judge refusal to rescind or modify it was immediately appealable.true,an order denying an injunction bond,a supersedeas bond as security for a stay of execution of judgment,or any other request for security to protect a litigant,is immediately appealable,cohen beneficial industrial loan.in re carlson,cir olympia equipment leasing western union telegraph,cir in re unr industries,cir atlantic fertilizer chemical italmare,cir.such an order is a classic collateral order,which is to say an order belonging to that small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen beneficial industrial loan,supra,at.
but orders to post an injunction bond and that is the order challenged by this appeal or other security generally are not appealable immediately,in re carlson,supra caribbean trading fidelity nigerian national petroleum,cir hitachi zosen clearing,tek matik,cir trustees of hospital mortgage group compania aseguradora interamericana panama,cir per curiam,because they are less likely to inflict irreparable harm.swift.packers compania colombiana del caribe.in re carlson,supra,at.indeed,when setting the amount of security,district courts should err on the high side.if the district judge had set the bond at million,as abbott requested,this would not have entitled abbott to that sum abbott still would have had to prove its loss,converting the soft numbers to hard ones.an error in setting the bond too high thus is not serious.the fee for a solvent firm such as mead johnson or its parent bristol myers squibb to post a bond,a standby letter of credit,or equivalent security is a very small fraction of the sum involved.a n error in the other direction produces irreparable injury,because the damages for an erroneous preliminary injunction can not exceed the amount of the bond.mead johnson abbott laboratories,cir emphasis in original.
there is however an exception for a case in which the bond is both higher than necessary and beyond the plaintiff financial capacity,and thus inflicts irreparable harm without justification.see friends of the earth,brinegar,cir save our sonoran,flowers,cir.in such a case the bond order meets the criteria for a collateral order.but not in this case.
eventually the judge dissolved the preliminary injunction that he had granted to habitat,granted the forest service motion for summary judgment,and dismissed the suit.habitat appealed the dismissal it is the appeal before us and generally when a final judgment or other order is appealed,the appellant can challenge any interlocutory ruling that adversely affects him.in re salem,cir kurowski krajewski,cir jacksonville port authority adams,and charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,ed.the order to post an injunction bond or refuse to rescind the order was such a ruling.
even when an interlocutory order is immediately appealable,the party adversely affected by it can wait and challenge it later,on appeal from the final judgment,provided of course that the order has become moot in the meantime.kurowski krajewski,supra,at.far from becoming moot,the order making habitat post a bond is likely to bite harder than when it was entered.when the security takes the form of a surety bond,the initial cost is the surety fee.the bonding company promises to pay any damages for losses caused by the injunction should the party who got the injunction and thus caused the loss in this case,habitat fail to pay the damages in such a case,indeed,the injured party can proceed against the surety directly.habitat did use a surety it deposited with the court.the cost to habitat was thus the time value of that amount.had the preliminary injunction not been vacated,that would have been the only cost to habitat.but now it faces the possibility of having to pay damages to the forest service,though only up to the bond limit of.coyne delany capital development board,cir global naps,verizon new england,cir sprint communications.cat communications int l,cir nintendo of america,lewis galoob toys,cir national kidney patients ass sullivan.
it could be argued that unless and until damages are assessed,habitat has incurred no loss and therefore lacks standing to appeal.but it has incurred a loss a loss of the use of.every day that a sum of money is wrongfully withheld,its rightful owner loses the time value of the money.suppose no damages are ever assessed against habitat and so eventually the court returns the that it is holding there would be no procedural vehicle to enable habitat to recover the loss of the time value of its money.therefore it had standing to challenge the bond order on appeal from the final judgment.see sprint communications.cat communications int l,supra,at.
a genuine oddity about the appeal is that it is from a judgment namely the dismissal of the suit that the appellant is not challenging,but only from an interlocutory order.a cleaner approach would have been for habitat to designate its appeal as an appeal from the bond order.for it became final and therefore appealable when the suit was dismissed,since at that point the order was no longer interlocutory.but the oddity of habitat approach has no jurisdictional significance.
on to the merits of habitat challenge to the bond.the winning bidder had bid.the preliminary injunction,which was entered on january,prevented the logging from being undertaken for at least a year,because logging in this forest is done only in winter,when the ground is hard.the injunction was dissolved on may,but we are told without contradiction that the rules of the forest service require that the project be rebid.an affidavit submitted by the forest service in the district court stated that the project would be rebid in early october,but as far as we able to determine,as of the date of oral argument april of this year it had not yet been rebid.
we are not persuaded by habitat argument that nonprofit entities,at least those devoted to public goods of great social value,such as the protection of the environment,should be exempted from having to post injunction bonds.the argument flies in the face of rule c,which not only contains no such exception but also states flatly that the court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.the language of rule c was even more emphatic before changed in it read no restraining order or preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applic
