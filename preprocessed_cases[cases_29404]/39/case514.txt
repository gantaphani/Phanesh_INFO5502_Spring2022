this is a government contract case.it arises because logicon,now known as northrop grumman information technology,northrop,acted as a middleman between a software developer and the united states army.logicon purchased certain software from the developer and then leased it to the military,effecting the lease by way of a delivery order under a contract between logicon and the united states air force.
but before the air force issued the delivery order,and apparently before the army had even received or tested the software,logicon asked the army to sign a letter of essential need,which logicon drafted,reciting that the software was essential to the operation of,and integral to,certain army computer systems.apparently based only on a sales presentation,an army employee signed the letter,and the air force issued the delivery order.the army later determined that the software did not function as expected and was not compatible with its systems and needs,so the army declined to renew the lease after the first renewal term.
logicon,by then known as northrop,filed suit against the united states in the united states court of federal claims,claiming that the united states breached a contained in the letter of essential need and incorporated by reference into the contract between the the software was essential to the army computer systems and,according to logicon understanding,was not acquired merely on a test or research and development basis.the court of federal claims granted summary judgment to the united states,holding that there could be no breach of warranty because the letter of essential need did not form part of the contract,and,in any event did not warrant what northrop contends it warranted.northrop appealed,and we heard oral argument on june.because the court of federal claims correctly determined that the alleged warranty was not incorporated by reference into the parties contract,we affirm.
