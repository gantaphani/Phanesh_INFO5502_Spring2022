this case grows out of a program of the advanced research projects agency and the defense airborne reconnaissance office together,arpa,both agencies of the united states department of defense,to build a,unmanned surveillance aircraft.the program,known as tier ii,required production of both an aircraft and a ground station,which would be used to control the aircraft in flight and to receive the data from its various sensors.
the tier ii program had four phases.after soliciting interest from contractors,arpa would choose five proposals for funding in phase.the various contractors selected for phase would receive funding to produce a detailed design for a prototype aircraft and ground station.the amount to be awarded in phase was insufficient to allow the contractors to earn a profit.in phase,arpa would select two of the five contractors chosen in phase.the two contractors selected for phase would produce and test a prototype aircraft and ground station.in phase,arpa would select one of the two contractors participating in phase.the winning contractor selected in phase would further refine and test their design and produce a number of demonstration aircraft and ground stations.in phase,the winning contractor would produce a larger number of operational aircraft and ground stations,the ultimate number to be determined by congressional appropriations.
arpa set out various performance goals for the aircraft and ground station.however,none of the performance goals were fixed requirements.arpa advised potential bidders that they could trade off various goals against others.the only fixed requirement arpa set out was that the final production aircraft have a price not greater than million.
grob is a german company that specializes in manufacturing aircraft from composite materials.it has manufactured a number of glider and aircraft,some of which have set world records for high altitude flight.however,it has never manufactured a jet aircraft.is an american defense contractor specializing in aerial surveillance technology,military communications,and systems integration.is organized into several discrete divisions,two of which,the greenville division and the melpar division,are involved in this case.
during the grob and together developed and built an aircraft called the egrett for the west german government.the egrett was a manned,aircraft designed to fly at feet with an ability to stay at that altitude for to hours.though a technical success,the egrett never went into production after the collapse of east germany,the surveillance of which was the main mission of the egrett.however,the two companies signed an agreement to work together to develop and sell the egrett to other customers who might be interested in such an aircraft.
in early grob learned,through its consultant williams,about the tier ii program.grob approached about working together to submit a bid to arpa.initially rebuffed grob advances.though the egrett had been a technical success,animosity apparently developed between the two companies towards the end of the egrett project.furthermore,did not think that grob could build the sort of aircraft that arpa would want,namely one that had jet propulsion.retired brigadier general lawrence mitchell,an employee,had discussed the tier ii program with major general ken israel,the head of the defense airborne reconnaissance office.based on those discussions,mitchell told his superiors at that arpa would likely want a jet aircraft,which grob had never before produced.
changed its mind about working with grob on the tier ii project in april of.klaus fischer of grob arranged a demonstration of the egrett in germany for harry berman,a senior arpa official.ernest pennington of attended the demonstration and reported that berman was wowed by the egrett and was considering offering grob a contract right then and there.pennington reported these events and recommended that seek to,keep grob in our camp as long as possible.shortly thereafter brian cullen,the general manager of greenville division,proposed to grob that the two companies work together on the tier ii program.
the two companies agreed that,because of its experience with defense contracts,would have responsibility for drafting the bid to be submitted to arpa.executives from the two companies met in greenville,texas in early may,to plan their bid for the tier ii project.at that meeting,alan doshier,an executive,mentioned that the melpar division of would be working with,an american defense contractor,on another tier ii bid.it is not clear just what doshier said about melpar involvement to the grob executives,who were insisting that work with grob exclusively.grob executives,principally klaus fischer,continued to insist that grob and work with each other exclusively.dutch meyer of evidently assured the grob executives that would work with grob exclusively.burkhart grob,the owner of grob,finally settled the issue of exclusivity in a letter to brian cullen on june.grob insisted that the relationship between his company and be exclusive.cullen agreed to exclusivity in his reply to grob letter.
while the two companies were settling the issue of exclusivity,they were also continuing to work on the design of the aircraft to be included in their proposal to arpa.at a meeting in germany,peer frank,grob chief engineer,presented proposals for both a modified egrett aircraft and an entirely new jet.the grob executives left the meeting in germany with the understanding that the proposal would include both the modified egrett and the new jet design.however,made only cursory mention of the new jet design in the final proposal to arpa.furthermore,never informed grob of mitchell conclusion regarding arpa likely preference for a jet aircraft.
fourteen groups submitted proposals for phase of the tier ii program.the bid was not among the five bids picked for phase.the winning bids came from such companies as loral,northrup grumman,westinghouse,raytheon,and lockheed.one of the winning bids was submitted by and the melpar division of.the bid was later chosen as one of the two participants in phase,and later won the final competition by being picked as the sole participant in phase of the program.
aggrieved that it had lost,and that another division of had won when had promised it exclusivity,grob sued in august of.grob asserted that failure to honor its agreement to work with grob exclusively,its failure to share information about arpa desire for a jet,and its failure to include grob plans for a new jet aircraft in the final proposal to arpa constituted breach of contract,breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing,tortious interference with a prospective business opportunity,and fraud.
the district court tried the case to a jury.after the close of all the evidence,the district court decided that it would not submit the issue of grob lost profits to the jury because they were too speculative and uncertain.thus,the jury form instructed the jury to consider only grob bid preparation costs as actual damages for the various claims it asserted.the jury found for grob on its fraud claim and for on the remainder of grob claims.the jury awarded grob in actual damages and million in punitive damages.
following the jury verdict,grob moved to have the district court impose a constructive trust on profits from the tier ii program.the district court denied grob a constructive trust on the grounds that had not been unjustly enriched at grob expense.the
