environmental,teg entered into a contract with the united states department of housing and urban development hud.pursuant to the contract,teg agreed to perform asbestos abatement work at the geneva towers,an apartment complex,in san francisco.after the contract work was completed,teg submitted a claim to the contracting officer in which it sought an equitable adjustment in the contract price.in support of its claim,teg asserted that it had been required to perform excessive cleaning and that it had been required to remove excessive quantities of asbestos.after the contracting officer denied the claim,teg filed suit in the united states court of federal claims under the contract disputes act of.
teg complaint in the court of federal claims contained three counts.in count one,teg alleged breach of contract based upon hud not permitting teg to perform the contract work in accordance with its original work plan.in count two,teg alleged that hud breached the contract by requiring what it characterized as extraordinary and unnecessary cleaning of the surfaces of the buildings.finally,in count three,teg alleged that it was entitled to additional compensation under the contract based upon its removal of excessive quantities of asbestos.teg sought a combined breach of contract and equitable adjustment recovery in the amount of approximately million.
in due course,the parties filed for summary judgment.the court granted summary judgment for the government on counts one and two of the complaint and for teg on count three of the complaint,united states,slip op.at.teg now appeals from the court decision granting the government motion for summary judgment on its two claims of breach of contract.finding no error in the court of federal claims decision,we affirm 
background 
the geneva towers were two apartment buildings in san francisco.hud acquired the buildings in and decided to implode them to make way for new development,slip op.at.however,the buildings contained asbestos,which had to be removed before implosion.id.hud solicited bids on a contract for asbestos abatement and teg was awarded the contract on may,for a fixed price of.the contract required that the abatement be complete on or by december,and provided for liquidated damages of per day of delay.after several extensions,the deadline for finishing the abatement was changed to february,slip op.at.however,teg did not finish the abatement work until march,causing hud to assess in liquidated damages against it,slip op.at.this delay was purportedly caused at least in part by disagreements between teg and hud over contract requirements.specifically,the parties disagreed as to i whether the contract required teg to abate asbestos in the pores and cracks of the geneva towers surfaces and ii whether teg was required to comply with the contract specifications rather than teg work plan.
we begin with the facts relevant to the first point of contention between the parties,which concerns the level of asbestos abatement required by the contract count two of the complaint.
the original contract specifications provided two separate abatement standards,one for friable and one for materials.friable materials are capable,when dry,of being crumbled,pulverized,or reduced to powder by hand pressure,slip op.at.the original asbestos abatement standard was set forth at section,c of the contract,which provided as follows 
friable materials applied to concrete,masonry,wood and nonporous surfaces,including but not limited to,steel structural members decks,beams and columns,pipes and tanks,shall be cleaned to a degree that no traces of debris or residue are visible.nonfriable materials applied to concrete,masonry,or wood shall be cleaned until no residue is visible other than that which is embedded in the pores,cracks,or other small voids below the surface of the material.
thus,the original specifications established a stringent visibility standard for friable materials and a less stringent standard,one which allowed the contractor to leave asbestos in the pores and cracks,for materials.the original section,c likely provided the stringent visibility standard for friable materials because they are more likely to become airborne and thus pose a health risk.
in the course of the bidding process,prospective bidders,including teg,raised questions about which standard applied to the concrete on the exterior of the buildings.during a conference call concerning the prospective contract,teg representative noted,it a significant difference,because on one it has to be clean to a degree there no trace on the other,it clean to a degree that material can still be embedded in pores,cracks and voids.
in response to the questions raised during the bidding process about the original asbestos abatement standard,the government modified the standard.the revised section,c set forth a single standard for all materials and provided as follows 
materials applied to concrete,masonry,wood and nonporous surfaces,including,but not limited to,steel structural members decks,beams and columns,pipes and tanks,shall be cleaned to a degree that no traces of debris or residue are visible by the observation services contractor.
thus,the revised section,c abolished the old standard applicable for materials that stated that it was acceptable to leave materials in pores and cracks.instead,a standard requiring that there be no visible asbestos,similar to the original standard for friable materials,was adopted for all materials 
as noted by the court of federal claims,trade practice and custom in the asbestos abatement field includes presuming that any debris and residue contains asbestos,slip op.at.the court based its finding on the american society for testing material astm standard for asbestos abatement,which provides,any residue,dust,or debris found during the inspections is assumed to contain asbestos id.
the parties second disagreement concerns whether the contract specifications or teg work plan controlled the terms of teg performance count one of the complaint.
section c of the contract specifications states that the contractor will provide a work plan for approval.the relevant portion of section c provides 
contractor s work plan submit for approval a detailed plan of engineering controls and the work procedures to be used in the removal,repair,or encapsulation of materials containing asbestos.
for all projects submit 
names of superintendent,foremen,project manager and other key personnel,and their day time and emergency telephone and pager numbers.
detailed description of the method to be employed in order to control pollution,including negative air equipment calculations.
personal air monitoring procedures.

k.a contingency plan,in the event of a major contamination incident caused by fire on or off the floor being abated,a large breech in the work area containment barrier,the opening of stairwell doors,breakage of the buildings exterior windows or sabotage.such a plan will focus on how to maintain safety and order when the building is occupied by building occupants,the public and other building users.
pursuant to this provision,hud requested that teg submit its work plan on april.on april,teg submitted a first version of its work plan.in response to deficiencies pointed out by hud and atc associates,atc,hud asbestos engineer and technical advisor for the contract,teg revised the work plan several times in late april and early may of.two weeks after the initial submittal of the work plan,teg was awarded the contract.
disputes arose during contract performance as to whether the work plan or the contract specifications governed performance.teg pointed out discrepancies between the two documents in a letter dated june.for example,teg noted in the letter that it had not closed vertical pipe cavities,as required by the specifications,because the work plan required the cavities to remain open in order to complete the project.the discrepancies between the work plan and the contract specifications led to the issuance of a stop work order.after over a month of disputes,hud accepted a value engineering change proposal vecp from teg that made changes to the contract specifications to bring it more in line with the work plan.work then continued under the revised specifications.
the court of federal claims issued an opinion on august,evaluating the parties for summary judgment.the court outlined three issues before it,corresponding to each of teg three claims i whether the contract required the removal of asbestos residue in pores and cracks ii whether teg was required to follow the contract specifications rather than its work plan and iii whether teg was entitled to compensation for removing what it alleged were excessive quantities of asbestos,slip op.at.
the court began with the issue of the removal of asbestos residue from the pores and cracks in the surfaces of the geneva towers,slip op.at.the court noted that the language of the contract required that a materials applied to concrete,masonry,wood and nonporous surfaces shall be cleaned to a degree that no traces of debris or residue are visible,slip op.at.based on this language,the court identified two issues to be decided.first,it had to decide if the contract required the removal of asbestos within pores and cracks.second,it had to determine what debris or residue meant.
beginning with whether the contract required the cleaning of pores and cracks,the court found that any material applied to a porous surface would necessarily enter any pores or cracks.thus,it found that pores and cracks were in fact part of the surface of the material,slip op.at.further,the court reasoned that material could be visible within pores or cracks.id.therefore,the court concluded,the contract required that the pores and cracks of the porous surfaces of the geneva towers be cleaned of all visible traces of asbestos,slip op.at.
turning to the question of what debris or residue meant,the court of federal claims found that there was no definition in the contract.industry standards clarified,however,that any residue,dust,or debris found during an inspection was assumed to contain asbestos.id.thus,the court reasoned,teg was required to remove any residue,dust,or debris found.the court concluded that the contract required that teg remove all material containing more than asbestos and that teg remove all visible traces of asbestos,including materials recessed in pores or cracks.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government on the abatement standard issue,slip op.at.
addressing the issue of whether teg work plan or the contract specifications governed teg performance,the court of federal claims noted that the parties agreed that there were conflicting provisions of the work plan and the contract specifications,slip op.at.continuing,the court pointed out that one of the reasons for requiring strict compliance with contract specifications is to prevent low bidders from using substandard materials,slip op.at.the court also pointed out that the government awards contracts to those bidders whose bid conforms to the specification,slip op.at.the court found that generally the purpose of contract work plans is to enable the government to determine whether or not the contractor is able to perform,slip op.at citing john cibinic,ralph nash,formation of government contracts ed.further,the court noted that when sealed bids are used,as was the case with the geneva towers contract,the contract can not be modified after bids are received the only criterion for contract award other than the bid responsiveness to the specifications is bidder responsibility,slip op.at.the court of federal claims reasoned that if,as teg argued,hud had negotiated to replace the conflicting portions of the contract specifications with teg work plan,then it would have been violating these rules governing contracts made through the solicitation of sealed bids and the contract would be void,slip op.at.the court concluded that the work plan was not incorporated into the contract,slip op.at.the court therefore denied teg motion for summary judgment and granted the government on the work plan issue,slip op.at.
finally,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment in favor of teg on its claim,in count three of the complaint,that it was entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract price by reason of having removed excessive quantities of asbestos.as seen,the government has not appealed the court grant of summary judgment on the e xcess quantities claim.teg appeals the court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government on the breach of contract claims in counts one and two of the complaint.we have jurisdiction over teg appeal pursuant to a.

under court of federal claims rule c summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.castle united states.we review the grant of summary judgment by the court of federal claims de novo.barron bancshares,united states.contract interpretation is a question of law,which we also review de novo.id.
on appeal,teg argues that the court of federal claims erred in holding that hud applied the proper cleaning standard for abatement under the contract.teg argues that the contract at section,c required that materials be cleaned from surfaces so that no traces of debris or residue were visible.teg contends that surfaces are not defined in the contract,but that from common usage dictionaries it is apparent that that they include only t he,outside,or exterior boundary of a thing outermost or uppermost layer or area.appellant br.at quoting a definition found in random house webster college dictionary ed.teg argues that the pores and cracks are not part of the surface because they are not on the of the concrete.industry definitions of debris and residue refer to visible particles that have settled in a work area or on an abated surface.thus,teg argues,the dust in the pores and cracks of the concrete of the buildings was not debris or residue on a surface and therefore not required to be removed.
teg supports its argument by pointing to what it says was hud own interpretation of the contract.first,teg argues that even hud recognized that its observation services contractor,kellco environmental services,kellco,which was responsible for observing the abatement process,enforced the visibility standard of section,c in a fanatical way by requiring abatement of asbestos in the pores and cracks.teg points to an email authored by a hud employee in which kellco is described as having interpreted what the contract says on a fanatical mode.second,teg recites a portion of a letter to hud from atc,which purported to clarify the visual inspection standard set forth in section,atc stated in the letter that r esidue recessed within the pores and cracks of the concrete substrate is not expected to be extracted.third,teg draws attention to a letter from hud stating that hud had gone beyond federal standards for asbestos abatement on the geneva towers project as well as deposition testimony to the same effect.in addition,teg claims that the court erred by failing to consider several pieces of evidence including the atc opinion and an expert opinion rendered by andrew oberta,the task group chairman of the astm committee on asbestos management,to the effect that it would be unreasonable to require a contractor to chisel or grind away concrete to extract imbedded material even if it was asbestos containing material.oberta further opined that he did not believe that the contract required abatement beyond industry standards.
teg also argues that the government interfered with its work plan,which was a part of the contract.in support of its argument,teg points out that the work plan was physically attached by hud to the contract.further,teg contends that under federal acquisition regulation far c,see c,the work plan,which is a representation or a statement of a bidder,was incorporated into the contract.teg also contends that it was required to proceed under the work plan under far,and that therefore the work plan was part of the contract.the court of federal claims erred,teg argues,in finding that the work plan merely required that the contractor provide certain information because the contract itself required that the work plan comprise a detailed plan for engineering control and the work procedures to be used.the court of federal claims reliance on the cibinic and nash government contracts treatise was misplaced,teg contends,because the section cited by the court pertained to the determination of a contractor responsibility and not its work plan.
the government defends the court of federal claims interpretation of the contract provisions concerning the level of abatement,arguing that the contract plain language requires abatement of all traces of visible debris and residue.in support of this interpretation,the government notes that section,c was amended to exclude any distinction between the abatement standard for friable and materials.the revised section eliminated provisions that allowed materials to remain in pores and cracks and instead applied a visibility standard to all materials.the government argues that even if we accept teg arguments concerning the abatement of asbestos on surfaces,the contract requires abatement of all asbestos that has been applied to surfaces,including asbestos that seeps into pores and cracks after application to the surfaces.the evidence presented by teg concerning trade usage and custom should be disregarded,the government urges,because it is not directed to interpreting a particular term,but rather the abatement standard as a whole.additionally,the government contends that trade usage can not create an ambiguity in an otherwise unambiguous contract.the government also argues that the court did not err by not considering the atc opinion and oberta opinion because these sources could not be used to contradict the plain meaning of the contract.
the government argues that the court of federal claims correctly found that the work plan was not incorporated into the contract.the government notes that in order for a document to be incorporated into a contract,there must be an express reference in the incorporating document.although sections j and k of the contract incorporated certain materials by reference,they did not incorporate the work plan,the government notes.the work plan,the government argues,was merely a submittal that was meant to show that teg was capable of doing the work.the government claims that this is demonstrated by the fact that hud never approved the work plan.even if the work plan had been approved,the government contends,that approval would not have waived compliance with the contract specifications.the government argues that if we were to hold that the work plan trumped the contract itself,we would be allowing bidders to underbid competitors and then use materials and procedures.the government also argues that far c and,which were cited by teg for the proposition that external documents are incorporated into government contracts,are not applicable to work plans.see c.finally,the government urges that teg efforts to have parts of its work plan incorporated into the contract through the vecp show that the work plan was not incorporated into the contract it would have been unnecessary to have the contract modified through the vecp if the work plan were already a part of the contract.

the parol evidence rule provides a further limitation on the use of extrinsic evidence in interpreting contracts.under the parol evidence rule,extrinsic evidence a written agreement may not be used to add to or otherwise modify the terms of a written agreement in instances where the written agreement has been adopted by the parties as an expression of their final understanding.barron bancshares,at citation and quotation marks omitted.however,extrinsic evidence such as prior agreements and documents will be considered part of a contract when they are incorporated into the contract.see cal.fed.sav.loan ass united states.one common way to incorporate extrinsic evidence is through an integration clause that expressly incorporates the extrinsic evidence.mcabee constr.united states.although the parol evidence rule bars the use of extrinsic evidence to supplement or modify a written agreement,the rule does not bar the use of extrinsic evidence to interpret the terms of a contract when the plain and ordinary meaning is not clear from the contract itself.see restatement second contracts cmt.b corbin on contracts cibinic,nash nagle,supra,at.armed with these rules,we turn to the issues teg raises on appeal.
we consider first teg claim that the court of federal claims erred in holding that it was required to clean debris and residue from pores and cracks of the geneva towers under the contract abatement standard.as seen,the provision of the contract containing the abatement standard for the geneva towers project,section,c,provided 
materials applied to concrete,masonry,wood and nonporous surfaces,including,but not limited to,steel structural members decks,beams and columns,pipes and tanks,shall be cleaned to a degree that no traces of debris or residue are visible by the observation services contractor.
the court of federal claims correctly identified two issues raised by the abatement standard.first,we must determine whether this standard requires the removal of asbestos within pores and cracks.second,we must determine what debris or residue means.
based upon the plain language of the abatement standard,we conclude that the court of federal claims did not err in ruling that teg was required to remove asbestos within pores and cracks
