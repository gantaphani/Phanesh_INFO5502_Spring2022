in this action arising in the eastern district of virginia,plaintiffs nish and goodwill services,incorporated collectively nish,appeal the district court award of summary judgment to secretary of defense cohen and secretary of the army caldera secretaries,the defendants below.nish sought a declaratory judgment with respect to the proper interpretation of the act rs act,particularly its applicability to the operation of military mess hall facilities at fort lee,virginia.the district court concluded that the rs act applies to the operation of such facilities,and therefore nish was not entitled to negotiate the contract for mess hall services at fort lee.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
the rs act,was enacted in to enlarge economic opportunities of the blind,by giving blind persons priority to operate vending facilities on federal property.this appeal focuses on a amendment to the rs act,by which the term vending stand in was changed to vending facility,and by which the statutory definition of vending facility was set forth as including automatic vending machines,cafeterias,snack bars,cart services,shelters,and counters.id.in this appeal,we specifically deal with the meaning of the statutory term cafeterias,and we must decide whether that term encompasses military mess hall facilities.
the factual predicate for this litigation is straightforward.nish is a nonprofit agency designated in the code of federal regulations,see,to represent other nonprofit agencies employing the severely disabled in the production of items and services for purchase by government agencies under the javits wagner act,jwod act in november,nish expressed interest in an anticipated replacement contract for mess hall services at fort lee.subsequently,on june,before nish had made a formal proposal on the fort lee contract,the virginia agency for the blind contacted officials at fort lee to convey its interest in bidding for the same contract,in accordance with the provisions of the rs act.at the time the competing interests became apparent,fort lee mess hall services contract had not been placed upon the procurement list mandated by a of the jwod act.
in an effort to reconcile application of the rs act with the provisions of the jwod act,the contracting officer responsible for food service operations at fort lee contracting officer sought assistance and advice from various sources,including fort lee legal staff,the army training and doctrine command tradoc,and the army office of the principal assistant responsible for contracting.in addition,the contracting officer consulted a november,memorandum prepared by the general counsel of the department of defense dod,as well as a march,memorandum from the deputy assistant secretary of the army for procurement.these memoranda discuss and analyze the applicability of the rs act to dod military dining facilities,and they also address the application of army regulation,which implements the rs act within the army.
using these guideposts,the contracting officer determined that the mess hall facilities at fort lee were cafeterias under the terms of the rs act,specifically,primarily because they were prepared food serving lines with table seating facilities.decl.of terry hyatt contracting officer.having concluded that the rs act applied to fort lee food service requirements,the contracting officer then ascertained that it was inappropriate to negotiate an acquisition contract with nish to provide mess hall services at fort lee.after being informed of the contracting officer final decision,nish commenced this proceeding in the district court,seeking,inter alia,a declaration that the rs act does not apply to contracts to provide military mess hall services.from the adverse ruling below,nish takes this appeal.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
nish contends that the jwod not the rs to and controls the award of the mess hall services contract at fort lee.the jwod act governs,according to nish,because a third competition in contracting application of the rs act in this instance.a brief overview of all three statutes is therefore in order.
the rs act was enacted by congress with the purpose of providing employment opportunities and encouraging the economic of blind persons.see committee of blind vendors district of columbia.as we have noted,the rs act was amended in,effectively establishing a cooperative program that gives contracting priority to blind persons operating vending facilities on federal property.see committee of blind vendors,at citing a b.
the amendment directs the department of education doe to promulgate regulations to ensure that,whenever feasible,one or more vending facilities are established on all federal properties,and that priority in their operation is given to licensed blind persons.see b.the secretary of doe is authorized to oversee implementation of the rs act through the commissioner of the rehabilitative services administration commissioner.id.e.among the duties assigned to the secretary of doe is the designation of state licensing agencies slas,which are authorized to issue licenses to blind citizens for the operation of vending facilities on federal property for the sale of newspapers,magazines,tobacco products,foods,beverages,and other items.id.a.the virginia agency for the blind,as well as the various intervenors in this litigation,are slas designated by the secretary of doe to participate in contracts under the rs act.
the jwod act was enacted in,and it established an independent federal agency now known as the committee for purchase from people who are blind or severely disabled committee.see supra note.the primary objective of the committee is to provide training and employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have severe disabilities.see barrier,eckard.the committee is required to publish the procurement list,consisting of commodities and services that it considers suitable for purchase by the government from qualified nonprofit agencies for the blind and disabled.see a.the procurement list is generally a mandatory procurement source for the federal government,a government agency wishing to obtain a commodity or service listed by the committee is required to obtain the item from the qualified agency at the price established by the committee.see id.the jwod act offers a sheltered environment,permitting individuals with disabilities to work for entities such as plaintiff goodwill services.by comparison,the rs act takes a slightly different tack by encouraging blind persons to be entrepreneurial and to run their own businesses.
nish position on appeal,however,hinges primarily upon a third statute,the competition in contracting act,cica.cica,enacted in,requires that the military use full and open competition when contracting for property or services,except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by statute.id.a.the jwod act,for example,embodies procurement procedures explicitly exempted by cica.see id.f d.nish maintains that,because the rs act does not specifically encompass military mess hall facilities,and does not authorize procurement,its auspices do not provide a similar statutory procurement procedure.thus,according to nish,cica precludes the rs act from governing the contract for mess hall services at fort lee.
since the facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute,the district court decided the questions of law by way of summary judgment.we review its decision de novo.see providence square,cir.in this instance,the district court,ruling in favor of the secretaries,held that the mess hall facilities at fort lee are cafeterias on eligible federal property,and that licensed blind organizations,such as the virginia agency for the blind,are thereby accorded the favorable treatment prescribed by the rs act.
the rule to be applied here is that enunciated by the supreme court in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.when a statute,in this instance,the rs act,is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.accordingly,when an agenc
