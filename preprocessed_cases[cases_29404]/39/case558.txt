pseg nuclear,and public service electric and gas company collectively pseg appeal the decision of the united states court of federal claims holding that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over pseg breach of contract claims.power light united states,florida power i.because we hold that the court of federal claims possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the claims under the tucker act,a,we reverse.
background 
the breach of contract claims asserted in this case stem from contracts entered into between pseg and the department of energy doe under the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa or the act.congress enacted the nwpa in january in order to provide for collection and storage of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel collectively snf by the doe.under its scheme,section of the act authorized the doe to enter into contracts with companies who generate or hold snf provided that the companies pay into a fund used to pay for snf collection and storage.the act states in pertinent part 
a contracts 
in the performance of his functions under this chapter,the secretary of energy is authorized to enter into contracts with any person who generates or holds title to radioactive waste,or spent nuclear fuel,of domestic origin for the acceptance of title,subsequent transportation,and disposal of such waste or spent fuel.such contracts shall provide for payment to the secretary of fees pursuant to paragraphs 
and sufficient to offset expenditures described in subsection 
contracts entered into under this section shall provide that 
a following commencement of operation of a repository,the secretary shall take title to the radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel involved as expeditiously as practicable upon the request of the generator or owner of such waste or spent fuel and 
b in return for the payment of fees established by this section,the secretary,beginning not later than january,will dispose of the radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel involved as provided in this subchapter.

the doe engaged in an administrative hearing process to create a single contract with identical terms the standard contract for use with all parties contraction under section.the contract included the terms required by the nwpa and also many additional terms.in general,the contract required companies with snf to pay a fee that the doe would use to develop an snf storage facility and to collect and maintain the snf at the facility beginning in,utility companies with snf entered into contracts based on the standard contract and started paying into the fund while the doe,presumably,began preparations to start collecting and disposing of the companies snf 
once it became clear that the doe would not be prepared to begin snf collection by the january,date in the standard contract,the contracting utility companies,including pseg,brought suit for breach of the standard contract.to date,the government asserts that such claims have been filed.
one provision of the nwpa discusses judicial review of doe actions taken pursuant to the nwpa.this provision,section,states 
a jurisdiction of united states courts of appeals 
except for review in the supreme court of the united states,the united states courts of appeals shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action 
a for review of any final decision or action of the secretary,the president,or the commission under this part 
emphasis added.
in several cases,courts of appeals have asserted jurisdiction under section over claims brought challenging doe actions under the nwpa.the first of these cases was general electric uranium united states department of energy.in that case,the plaintiff alleged that the doe abused its discretion when setting fees under its authority under section a of the nwpa.although section a fell within title iii of the act and section was in title i and only conferred the courts of appeals with jurisdiction over agency actions under this part,the circuit held that it possessed jurisdiction over the case.the court reasoned that doe rule setting the fee under section a was well within the class of agency actions reviewable under section a a.id.the court based this determination on three considerations the structure and language of the nwpa evinced congressional intent to vest the courts of appeals with jurisdiction over cases such as this one relevant legislative history did not compel a contrary result and policy considerations supported the conclusion.id.subsequently,the circuit exercised original jurisdiction over several cases brought under the nwpa challenging agency actions without any discussion of its jurisdictional limits under the statute 
subsequently,the doe began to see claims under the standard contract for its failure to begin collecting snf from the power companies by january.the doe initially issued a regulation which stated that it does not have an unconditional statutory or contractual obligation to accept nuclear waste beginning january,in the absence of a repository or interim storage facility constructed under the act.final interpretation of nuclear waste acceptance issues.however,in indiana michigan power department of energy,the circuit held that,contrary to doe regulation,the agency was obliged to begin accepting snf on january,even in the absence of a repository,however,the court held that no remedy was available to the companies until after the deadline had passed.the court jurisdiction over the case was not at issue.
the doe proceeded by arguing that its failure to perform was an unavoidable delay under the contract and was therefore not compensable.a group of power companies sought a writ of mandamus from the circuit requiring the doe to comply with indiana michigan and begin snf collection by the contracted deadline.in northern states power united states department of energy,the court held that this mandamus request was not proper because the companies had adequate remedies under the standard contract.however,so that the companies would be able to enforce the terms of the contract to effectuate the doe duty,the court issued a writ of mandamus forbidding the doe from claiming,in proceedings under its contracts,that its failure to perform was unavoidable because a repository was not available.
soon after issuing the northern states power opinion just discussed,the circuit issued an unpublished opinion clarifying its jurisdictional position in the case.in the opinion,the court sought to reiterate that the opinion merely describes the nature of the doe obligation,which was created by the nwpa and undertaken by the doe under the standard contract.it does not place the question of contract remedies in this court,nor set up this court as a source of remedies outside the standard contract.states power dep t of energy,wl,at.may.shortly thereafter,several power companies with nwpa standard contracts,including pseg,filed claims for breach of contract and damages for the doe failure to meet the january,deadline in the court of federal claims.
another company,wisconsin electric power,however,continued to seek remedies at the circuit.power dep t of energy.wisconsin electric sought a writ of mandamus that the nwpa required both monetary and remedies for breach of the standard contract.the company claimed the circuit had jurisdiction under two bases its authority to enforce its prior mandates,or directly under section of the nwpa.the court held that it did not have jurisdiction under its authority to enforce prior mandates because while t hose mandates prohibit the doe from interpreting the nwpa and its contracts with utilities in a manner that would relieve the department of its unconditional obligation to begin disposing of snf on january,they expressed no opinion about the relief the doe would have to provide for breach of that obligation.id.at.the court also refused to assert jurisdiction under section of the nwpa directly because while the statute grants the court jurisdiction over cases seeking review of final action taken by the agency pursuant to the nwpa,and the agency failure to take any action required by the nwpa,a contract breach by the doe d
