propellex corporation propellex appeals from the final decision of the armed services board of contract appeals board that sustained the final decision of the contracting officer denying in part propellex claim for additional compensation under two contracts between propellex and the department of the army armament,munitions and chemical command army for the production and delivery of gun primers.propellex,asbca,cch,at,wl.propellex sought recovery under a modified total cost method.the board denied propellex appeal because it concluded,inter alia,that propellex had failed to establish that it was impracticable for it to prove its actual losses directly,which is one of the requirements for recovery under the total cost method.id.at.because the decision of the board is supported by substantial evidence and is free of legal error,we affirm.
background 
the army awarded propellex two fixed price contracts,contract no.the contract and contract no.the contract,for the production and delivery of a specified number of mk primers.the contract also called for the production and delivery of a specified number of mk primers.a primer is a component of a gun shell.a shell generally includes a projectile and a propellant charge.the primer is an explosive device that ignites the propellant charge in the shell.the propellant charge in turn propels the projectile.a key component of a primer is black powder.
both the contracts required that propellex furnish the primers in lots.the contract called for propellex to furnish the mk primers in nine separate lots and the mk primers in one lot.the contract called for propellex to furnish mk primers in five separate lots.under each contract,before the army would accept a lot for delivery,propellex was required to submit samples of the primers in the lot to the naval surface warfare center nswc in indian head,maryland,for,inter alia,testing of the moisture content of the black powder contained in the primers.under the contracts,the moisture content of the black powder in the primers could not exceed a certain level.to ensure compliance with this requirement,propellex performed its own moisture analysis on the black powder before sending the primers to nswc for testing.
in september of,propellex sent to nswc for testing samples of primers from lot six of the contract.following testing,the army determined that the sample primers did not comply with the requirements of the contract because the moisture content of their black powder exceeded what was allowed under the contract.as a result,the army rejected the lot.the army stated that the excess moisture in the primers was the fault of propellex,and it directed propellex to resolve the problem.
in response to the army rejection,propellex conducted an investigation to determine the cause of the alleged moisture in the primers.although primer production continued during the investigation,propellex diverted a number of its production employees to investigate the moisture problem.propellex kept records of the tests it performed.however,the records did not include the number of employees,labor hours,or amount of materials involved in the testing.during the investigation,which spanned a period of two years,the army also rejected lots,and of the contract for excess moisture and other defects.
on february,after propellex had completed its investigation,it notified the army that it had not found any evidence indicating that the moisture content of the black power in its primers was above the level specified as acceptable in the contracts.it suggested that the army determine if there was a defect in its testing procedures.
on april,propellex consultant,edward williams,and the defense contract management agency quality assurance engineer,bryan nussbaum,observed nswc testing of samples from lot five of the contract.over the next few months,they further observed and analyzed nswc testing procedures.as a result of their observations and analysis,they found defects in the procedures.eventually,the army accepted all of the primers that propellex produced under the contracts.
on september,propellex filed a claim with the contracting officer,seeking an equitable adjustment under the and contracts in the total amount of.in its claim,propellex sought to recover the costs it incurred in conducting the moisture investigation,as well as certain costs it incurred in testing the moisture content of its primers prior to delivery to the army it also sought to recover unabsorbed overhead costs,claim preparation costs,and consulting expenses.the contracting officer acknowledged that nswc had committed errors in its testing of primer samples and that the army was therefore responsible for some of the additional costs propellex had incurred.the contracting officer determined that propellex was entitled to a recovery in the amount of.however,she denied the balance of propellex claim 
based on a review of the request for equitable adjustment,the supporting documentation available to the contracting officer and all other relevant facts,it is the contracting officer decision that the government was and is responsible for only a small portion of the claimed amounts.based on insufficient data to further support damages claimed by propellex,the contracting officer finds an equitable adjustment in the amount of due to propellex as a result of the equitable adjustment claim under contracts and.
propellex timely appealed the contracting officer final decision to the board under the provisions of the contract disputes act of,cda.
following a hearing,the board granted propellex appeal with respect to entitlement,finding that nswc had not conducted the primer acceptance tests in accordance with contract testing requirements.propellex,at.as a result,the board awarded propellex,plus interest,for claim preparation costs and consulting expenses.id.at.however,the board denied in toto propellex claims for the cost of the moisture investigation and for unabsorbed overhead costs.id.
in denying propellex claim for the cost of the moisture investigation,the board observed that propellex had advanced the claim using a modified total cost method.id.at.the board stated that to recover under the total cost method,a contractor must prove the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly the reasonableness of its bid the reasonableness of its actual costs and lack of responsibility for the added costs.id.citing servidone constr.united states.the board noted that in using a modified total cost method to prove its claim,propellex adjusted its bid for possible understatement and excluded some of the costs for which it admitted responsibility.id.at.nevertheless,the board determined that propellex had failed to establish the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly and the lack of responsibility for the added costs.id.at.it therefore denied propellex claim for additional compensation for increased costs under the contracts.id.propellex has timely appealed the board decision we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
we review the board decision under the standard set forth in the cda 
the decision of the agency board on any question of law shall not be final or conclusive,but the decision on any question of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside unless the decision is fraudulent,or arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
b.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.grumman data.dalton,quoting frank dep t of.
we have stated that the preferred way for a contractor to prove increased costs is to submit actual cost data because such data provides the court,or contracting officer,with documented underlying expenses,ensuring that the final amount of the equitable adjustment will be just not a windfall for either the government or the contractor.dawco,united states,overruled on other grounds by reflectone,dalton.as noted,propellex advanced its claim using the modified total cost method.the modified total cost method is a modification of the total cost method.under the total cost method,the measure of damages is the difference between the actual cost of the contract and the contractor bid.see raytheon white.before a contractor can obtain the benefit of the total cost method,it must prove the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly the reasonableness of its bid the reasonableness of its actual costs and lack of responsibility for the added costs.servidone,at.the modified total cost method is the total cost method adjusted for any deficiencies in the contractor proof in satisfying the requirements of the total cost method.id.at.in boyajian united states,the court of claims described the use of a modified total cost method 
t he total cost method was used as only a starting point with such adjustments thereafter made in such computations as allowances for various factors as to convince the court that the ultimate,reduced,figure fairly represented the increased costs the contractor directly suffered from the particular action of defendant which was the subject of the complaint.
id.at citation omitted.before the board,propellex sought recovery under a modified total cost method by adjusting its bid for possible understatement and by excluding from the computation of its claim some of the costs for which it admitted responsibility.see propellex,at.however,under its modified total cost method claim,propellex still had the burden of proving the four requirements for a total cost recovery set forth above.the modified method simply was a way of easing that burden somewhat.see raytheon,at servidone,at.
the board found that propellex proof of the reasonableness of its bids for the contract and the contract was adequate total cost method requirement two.in addition,the board noted that the government did not question the total costs propellex incurred in performing the two contracts total cost method requirement three.propellex,at.the board determined,however,that propellex had not established the impracticability of proving its added costs directly total cost method requirement one or that it was not responsible for the added costs total cost method requirement four.id.
in addressing the impracticability requirement,the board noted that propellex witnesses testified,and its expert agreed,that propellex did not segregate and record,and could not estimate,the labor hours and costs of the black powder moisture investigation.id.the board further noted that the hours and costs attributable to the moisture investigation were commingled with all labor hours and costs of contract performance,so that propellex could not prove its costs directly.id.yet,the board observed,propellex expert found no difficulty in approximating certain costs not attributable to the moisture investigation.id.the board also observed that,in connection with its case on entitlement,propellex had documented its investigative efforts.id.the board concluded that s uch evidence did not establish the impracticability of proving propellex claimed losses directly.id.with respect to the fourth requirement for use of the modified total cost method,the board stated that t he most serious failure of propellex modified total cost proof was that it did not exclude from the claim amounts costs under both contracts and not attributable to black powder moisture investigation id.the board added that it had attempted to reconstruct from the record a reasonable approximation of those costs,but had found that the evidence did not permit such an approximation.id.accordingly,the board concluded that propellex claim under a modified total cost method failed because propellex had not established the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly and the lack of responsibility for the added costs.id.
on appeal,propellex challenges both of these rulings.first,it argues that the board erred in concluding that it had not established the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly.second,it contends that the board erred when it concluded that the record did not allow for the removal of certain costs from propellex modified total cost claim.because substantial evidence supports the board conclusion that propellex did not establish the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly and because the board decision is otherwise free of legal error,we affirm the decision of the board.under these circumstances,it is not necessary for us to decide the issue of whether propellex satisfied the fourth requirement of the total cost method.
propellex argues that the board conclusion that it failed to establish the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly is legally incorrect and not supported by substantial evidence.it acknowledges that,under the modified total cost method,a contractor must establish the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly requirement one and must identify and remove costs that are unrelated to its claim requirement four.it states that it complied with requirement four by identifying some costs not related to the moisture investigation and by removing them as required.it then asserts that the board improperly penalized it for complying with this requirement when it held that since propellex was able to estimate some costs not related to the moisture investigation,it should have been able to estimate the costs related to the moisture investigation as well.propellex contends that the board reasoning is inconsistent with the principles underlying the total cost method and constitutes reversible error because it makes it impossible for any contractor to satisfy all the requirements for a total cost recovery.propellex states 
according to the board,offering proof to satisfy the fourth element of a total cost claim,as propellex did,eliminates a contractor ability to satisfy the first it can not prove its actual losses directly.put another way,the board unwittingly eviscerated this long admittedly not for calculating damages.
propellex also argues that the board decision is not supported by substantial evidence.it contends that the evidence of record establishes that propellex accounting system did not track the costs associated with the moisture investigation.it notes that the board itself recognized that the costs of the moisture investigation had been commingled with all other costs and could therefore not be separately computed.propellex states that the costs unrelated to the moisture investigation that it did eliminate from its claim were captured by its accounting system.it contends that,unlike those costs,the costs related to the moisture investigation were not captured and thus could not be separately computed.finally,propellex contends that our decision in servidone supports its contention that it was entitled to use the modified total cost method to prove its claim.
for its part,the government argues that substantial evidence supports the board finding that propellex failed to establish the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly.noting that propellex expert witness was capable of identifying and segregating some of the extra costs for which propellex was responsible,it asserts that propellex had the capability of estimating the costs it incurred in connection with the moisture investigation.the government also argues that,in any event,propellex kept detailed records of the moisture investigation,from which it should have been possible for it to estimate the costs it incurred in connection with the investigation.
we agree with the government that substantial evidence supports the board finding that propellex failed to demonstrate the impracticability of proving its actual losses directly.the evidence shows that propellex could have set up its accounting system to track the costs of the moisture investigation and that it failed to do so.at trial,propellex controller,bert nordman,testified that he could have set up an account within propellex cost accounting system to segregate the actual costs of the moisture investigation,but did not do so 
q.why did you open a separate account for propellex to record the costs relating to the extra eff
