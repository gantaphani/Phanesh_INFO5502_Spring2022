communications,appeals from the decision of the general services administration board of contract appeals the board denying claim for restitution based on the government alleged breach and repudiation of contract or the government unjust enrichment.communications,gsbca may.we have jurisdiction under g a.because we agree with the board that the government did not breach or repudiate its contract with,and that the government was not unjustly enriched,we affirm the board decision.
in,the general services administration gsa awarded and sprint separate and concurrent ten year contracts the contracts to provide telecommunications services to the government.the contracts permitted the government to assign particular federal customers to each contractor network,and to assign target shares of contract revenues to and sprint.at the start of the contracts,the government assigned target revenue shares of for and for sprint.the contracts also provided that the contractors revenue targets were subject to change,pursuant to a price redetermination and service reallocation process scheduled for and,the fourth and seventh years of the contract.these processes required and sprint to compete against each other for additional contract revenue shares,with of each company network revenue at risk for reassignment to the other company.for the process,the government decided to maintain the original target revenue split of and.
in october,the government issued a concept paper outlining the format for the price redetermination and service reallocation process,the process at issue in this case.the concept paper described three possible outcomes for the competition between and sprint could win a target revenue allocation of for itself and for sprint of target share could be transferred to sprint target share or gsa could maintain the existing target shares,as it did for the competition.the government did not identify which federal agencies might be reallocated as a result of the competition.and sprint were required to respond to the concept paper by submitting price proposals for generic scenarios of service reallocation,without regard to which particular agency might be transferred from one company network to the other.the government concept paper further stated it is the government intent that all required transitions be accomplished within a maximum of months unless otherwise notified by the government the government reserves the right to adjust the transition timeframes based on actual agencies services and features to be allocated.at the time of the competition,revenue share had increased to approximately.while it stood to gain an additional of revenue under the competition,was more concerned about its competitive positioning with respect to sprint,including the potential loss of of its revenue share to sprint.to avoid this loss,submitted an aggressive final price proposal offering the government escalating discounts over the remaining life of the contract.
the government determined that proposal was better than sprint and that the treasury department treasury,including the internal revenue service irs,should transfer from sprint network to in order to achieve the new target revenue shares.however,at a government meeting held on november,members of treasury expressed concerns about the feasibility of the transition,insisting that no transition work could occur during the tax season,from december through may.in spite of treasury concerns,on december,the government presented with modification for execution.modified contract by incorporating the terms of the government concept paper and responsive proposal.in addition,stated the following agency will transition from network b sprint network to network a network department of treasury,including irs service.executed the modification on december,without being informed about treasury conditions for and concerns about the transition.
the transfer of treasury to network was plagued with difficulties and delays.in the fall of,frustrated irs officials drafted a service level agreement sla designed to focus attention on resolving specific problems with network transfer and provision of services.the sla provided that it does not change the contract rather,it makes more definite the expectations of the parties the sla set forth specific ways that should improve its performance,stating that 
n o further treasury data services will be transitioned until all problems with are resolved to irs satisfaction and only after submission of a transition plan approved by treasury and gsa.
executed the sla on november.in the spring of,the treasury department advised that it would not permit any further network transitions.at this point in time,revenue share was sprint share was.up until this time,and through the remaining term of,the government received the discounts provided for by modification.
on july,advised gsa by letter that 
asserts a possible right to breach damages and to an equitable adjustment in the contract price.this right would be based on the government failure to both implement the contractually mandated year service reallocation to of of network b traffic and to comply with its contractual responsibilities for the transition of the department of the treasury from network b to network a where such failures prevent from receiving the revenue share promised by.
on august,submitted a certified claim to the contracting officer,requesting,inter alia,reimbursement,plus interest,for the discounts that the gsa has incorrectly taken from billings by after the signing of modification.claimed that various treasury organizations delayed for long periods flatly refused to transition to network.as a result,argued,the government received the benefit of discounts without providing in exchange the promised transfer of treasury within six months.the contracting officer denied claim and determined that the failure to transition treasury within six months was fault.the government then issued a claim against for damages.
filed a complaint with the board on february,seeking restitution of the discounts given to the government.after holding a trial,the board denied claim in its entirety.communications,gsbca may,the board opinion.the board concluded that the government did not breach its contract with and that the difficulties in transitioning the treasury department were as much the fault of as the government.id.at.on this basis,the board also denied the government claim against.
appeals,arguing that it is entitled to partial restitution of the discounts it gave to the government because the government breached its contract with by withholding material information about the anticipated difficulties of transitioning treasury the government repudiated the contract with by terminating any further transition of treasury in the spring of the government was unjustly enriched by receiving all of the promised discounts without providing the quid pro quo of a complete transfer of treasury within six months.we address each of these arguments in turn.
