this is an appeal from the final judgment of the united states court of federal claims court of federal claims on a matter of statutory construction.the court of federal claims ruled in favor of the united states,kingdomware,united states,and kingdomware technologies,kingdomware appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the final judgment of the court of federal claims.
kingdomware is owned and controlled by a veteran.the department of veterans affairs va certified kingdomware as a small business in september and recertified kingdomware in september.
it has long been the policy of the united states to promote small businesses,including small businesses owned and controlled by veterans.congress has expressed this policy through the small business act,ch,and stated its expectation that small businesses generally will receive a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property and services for the government a.veteran owned small businesses vosbs and service disabled veteran owned small businesses sdvosbs are expressly recognized in the small business act.id.q.
the policy directive to promote small businesses lies within the statutes and regulations that guide government contract formation.the general policies and procedures for government contracting are contained in the federal acquisition regulation far,ch,which implements the office of federal procurement policy act of,ch.certain contract regulations are established agency by agency,and contract regulations specific to the va are stated in the veterans affairs acquisition regulation vaar,ch.
the overarching policy of the far generally demands that c ontracting officers shall provide for full and open competition.b.the federal supply schedule fss exists as one of the tools for achievement of the overarching policy.the fss was established by the general services administration gsa to provide government agencies with a simplified process for obtaining commercial supplies and services at prices associated with volume buying.id.a.fss contractors agree to provide goods and services on the fss at stated prices for given periods of time,thus permitting agencies to buy supplies and services directly from the fss,rather than using traditional full and open competition contract tools for such purposes.fss contracts are deemed to satisfy the conditions of full and open competition.id.a.
unless otherwise specified by statute or regulation,an agency has wide discretion to decide the method of contracting to use,including the fss.tyler constr.grp.united states.the far specifies as a matter of contracting priority that an agency is encouraged to obtain goods and services from fss contractors before purchasing from commercial sources,which include privately owned vosbs and sdvosbs.the gsa considers its fss program to be the premier acquisition vehicle in government,accounting for of overall procurement spending.for vendors getting on schedule,general services administration may.
the far explicitly states that an agency placing an order against the fss is exempt from requirements of the small business programs under far part.see a,a,b.this exemption does not affect the va obligation under a otherwise to set aside contracts for competition among small businesses.although gsa awards most fss contracts,it may authorize other agencies to award schedule contracts and publish schedules.id.d.gsa has specifically delegated authority to the va to procure medical goods and services under the va federal supply schedule program.id.for other goods and services,the va uses the gsa fss program.as a matter of policy,the va encourages vosbs and sdvosbs to participate in the fss program.press release,of veterans affairs,statement on va veteran owned small business contract.purchasing goods and services through the fss is important to the va and to vosbs in,the va used fss contracts for of its total spending,and of these fss expenditures went to vosbs.kathleen miller,dispute simmers between va and veteran owned small businesses.post,at.
in,congress amended the small business act to establish an aspirational goal of awarding of government contracts to sdvosbs.g.history shows this goal was not satisfied.for the fiscal year,sdvosbs received but of federal contract funds.the state of veterans employment hearing before the comm.on veterans affairs,cong.statement of angela styles,adm r fed.procurement.and the va awarded only of its contracts to sdvosbs in,in,and in,the veterans entrepreneurship act of,the veterans federal procurement opportunity act of and,the veterans earn and learn act hearing before the subcomm.on benefits of the comm.on veterans affairs,cong.statement of leo mackay,deputy sec y of veterans affairs.
congress again amended the small business act in to focus on sdvosbs.the act grants discretionary authority a contracting officer may award to contracting officers,to award contracts of restricted dollar amounts to sdvosbs when the contracting officer estimates receipt of a fair and reasonable price,and otherwise to award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to sdvosbs if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that not less than small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair market price.the discretionary authority to award contracts beyond the limited dollar amount specified for contracts requires satisfaction of the rule of two,a procedure throughout the government in connection with award of contracts set aside for competition restricted to small businesses.
history again showed a failure to achieve the goal of the small business act to award of government contacts to sdvosbs only of government contracts went to sdvosbs in,at.consequently,in congress returned to the subject of preferences for businesses owned and controlled by veterans,enacting a statute specifically and only directed to the.while the small business act and previous amendments contained provisions relating only to sdvosbs,the veterans act expanded the reach of the small business provisions to include both vosbs and sdvosbs.
in particular,congress mandated that the secretary of the va shall establish a goal for each fiscal year for participation in va contracts by vosbs,and shall establish a goal for participation in va contracts by sdvosbs which shall not be less than the goal set by the small business act,which remained at.a.
the veterans act of,codified at,gives contracting officers in the va certain specific tools in subsections b,c,and d for achieving the goals to be set by the secretary.as the house report accompanying the statute explained g iven this new set of acquisition tools,there should be no reason for va not to meet the veteran and veteran small business contracting goals,at.
for va acquisitions for amounts less than what is called the simplified acquisition threshold currently,b states that a contracting officer of the va may use procedures other than competitive procedures.contracts under can thus be to vosbs and sdvosbs without regard to the marketplace competitiveness of the price.second,for contracts worth up to,va contracting officers may use procedures other than competitive procedures to grant contracts to vosbs and sdvosbs if the particular business concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity and in the estimation of the contracting officer,the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the united states.c.the authority given to va contracting officers in subsections b and c of is expressly for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a.third,congress also authorized use of restricted competition procedures by va contracting officers.thus,in addition to the noncompetitive methods authorized in subsections b and c,congress specified as follows in subsection d 
d use of restricted competition.except as provided in subsections b and c,for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a,and in accordance with this section,a contracting officer of the va shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the united states.
id.d reciting the rule of two within the if clause.
as an assist for achieving the goals under subsection a,congress ordered the va in subsection i to give contracting priority to sdvosbs and vosbs over other small business entities.id.i.thus,sdvosbs and vosbs enjoy primary opportunities over other small businesses.
the va promulgated regulations for d.unlike that subsection,which does not distinguish between vosbs and sdvosbs,the va provided a separate regulation for each group,repeating in each regulation the statutory language that the contracting officer shall award contracts according to the rule of two.providing for sdvosbs providing for vosbs.the regulations further specify that contracting officers must give preference to sdvosbs over vosbs,and if only one sdvosb makes an offer at a fair and reasonable price,the contracting officer should make the award to that offeror thus converting the rule of two to a rule of one.id.if no acceptable offer is made by a sdvosb,the contracting officer shall withdraw the sdvosb and process the procurement as a vosb.id.if only one vosb makes a fair and reasonable price offer,the contract officer should make the award to that offeror,and if no acceptable offer is made,the contracting officer shall process the procurement under other small business programs.id.in the preamble to the regulations,the va expressed its view that d does not apply to fss task or delivery orders and that the va would continue to follow gsa guidance regarding applicability of cfr part of the far,small business programs,which states that do not apply to far part fss acquisitions.in practice,the va has continuously and consistently interpreted d as not affecting its authority to place orders under the fss,and as granting it the flexibility to achieve the subsection a goals by any of the three methods.
history has proven true the prediction made in the legislative history of.the act did not become effective until days after its enactment on december,and as a result was not fully implemented until the fiscal year.for that year and thereafter,the secretary set goals well beyond the previous goal for sdvosbs,and achieved well beyond his stated goals,as shown below.

this suit arises from the following undisputed facts.in early,the va decided to implement an emergency notification service in several of its medical centers.the va contracting officer chose to use the gsa fss to procure the needed services,and awarded the contract to a fss vendor which was not a vosb.on march,kingdomware,a certified sdvosb and qualified fss contractor,filed a bid protest with the government accountability office gao.kingdomware challenged the contract award as illegal on the ground that d always bars the va from using the fss without first invoking the rule of two and if satisfied,awarding the contract pursuant to the rule of two.the va argued that subsection d requirement to invoke this rule of two applies only when the va determines that this is necessary to meet the established contracting goals.the gao,relying on its opinion in a previous case,aldevra,cpd,rejected the va argument,and issued a recommendation decision that the va cancel the contract award already made and the requirement as a sdvosb,kingdomware,b,cpd.may.
the va soon after responded to the gao and kingdomware,announcing that it would not acquiesce in gao recommendation decision.the va was on firm ground in refusing to accept the gao decision.although agencies often follow gao recommendations in bid protest decisions given the gao long experience and special expertise in such matters,cms contract mgmt.servs.massachusetts hous.fin.agency,internal citation omitted,these recommendations are not binding on an agency.see honeywell,united states,noting that the provisions of the competition in contracting act do not compel procuring agencies to obey the recommendation of the comptroller general internal citation omitted.by enforcing its interpretation of d,the va set the stage for kingdomware retreat to the united states court of federal claims.
kingdomware filed its complaint on march.the parties stipulated to the facts as presented here and for summary judgment.both parties claimed victory on the plain meaning of d.kingdomware argued that the word shall in the statute is an unambiguous imperative that the secretary can never use the fss where the rule of two may be satisfied.the va responded that kingdomware view writes out of the statute its obligation to set the goals for vosb contract awards because a mandatory requirement for all contracts would obviate the need for the secretary to establish goals.the va argued that all the words in have to be accounted for,and that for the purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a language in subsection d gives clear meaning to the shall imperative to use the rule of two procedure d properly understood only compels the va to conduct a rule of two analysis when the secretary determines that doing so is necessary to meet the goals set by him under subsection a.
the court of federal claims reasoned that kingdomware interpretation of d is not supported by the plain language of the statute because it does not account for the mandatory requirements of the section and the command that the rule of two procedure be used for purposes of meeting the goals.without addressing the va plain meaning interpretation,the court of federal claims ruled that the nature of the statute clouds the clarity plaintiff would attribute to the phrase shall award in subsection d of the act,and renders the act ambiguous as to its application to other procurement vehicles,such as the fss.kingdomware.at.
having found ambiguity in subsection d under the first step of the analysis laid out in chevron,natural resources defense council,d,the court of federal claims then assessed the reasonableness of the va consistent interpretation of the statute,which was first expressed in the preamble of the regulations promulgated for the act after notice and comment rulemaking,and since articulated in policy statements,see,press release,of veterans affairs,statement on va veteran owned small business contract,and in litigation.because the regulations themselves do not expressly state that the subsection does not apply to the fss,the court declined chevron deference to the va interpretation.but since the regulations only recite statutory language verbatim,and that language was found ambiguous,and because the regulations are wholly silent as to what role the fss might play in meeting the goals set by the secretary,the court considered granting deference under skidmore swift,to the clear statement of the va interpretation in the regulations preamble.
the court of federal claims concluded that the va interpretation has many of the blazemarks favoring deference under skidmore.first,the va view that does not apply to the fss has been consistent over time,reflecting a uniform administrative and litigation stance by the.second,the va view is not directly in conflict with the words of the statute or the regulations,both of which are silent on the role of the fss in meeting the secretary goals.also,the legislative history of the statute expressed an intent that the va retain the option to award contracts to sdvosbs and vosbs,and would exercise reasonable judgment in meeting the required goals alongside the va obligation to satisfy small business awards to other groups,such as women owned businesses.cong.rec.third,the va interpretation as stated in the preamble of the regulations is crystal clear and was made in the context of notice and comment rulemaking.finally,the court noted that the va interpretation is consistent with the traditional relationship between for small businesses and the fss as found in the far,namely that agencies are not required to implement small business programs before or while using the fss.the court of federal claims thus found the va interpretation sufficient to warrant deference.accordingly,the va for summary judgment was granted.
kingdomware timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction over the appeal under a.
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.dominion,united states.in reviewing an agency action in a bid protest case,we generally apply the administrative procedure act arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or without observance of a procedure required by law standard of review.a,d impresa construzioni geom.domenico garufi united states.here,since there are no factual or mixed factual and legal issues,and the only question is one of statutory construction,we apply the chevron standard.see dominion,at.
chevron requires a reviewing court to determine by statutory construction,at the first step,whether congress has spoken to the precise question at issue.at.if so,the unambiguously expressed intent of congress prevails.id.at.if,however,congress has not spoken to the issue at hand,or has done so ambiguously,the question for the court at step two is whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.if so,the agency view of the law prevails.the interpretative exercise begins with the language of the statute,santa fe,green,d,and uses traditional tools of statutory construction,including the statute text,structure,and legislative history,and the relevant canons of interpretation.delverde,srl united states.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.chevron,at.
in the case before us,congress did speak directly to the question of the secretary authority to use the rule of two for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a,stating that for such purposes the secretary shall use the rule of two procedures.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that kingdomware interpretation of d does not account for,and undercuts,the secretary mandatory authority to set the goals for contracts to vosbs,and therefore is not a reasonable interpretation.by directly tying the mandatory rule of two contracting procedure set forth in subsection d to the achievement of the goals set pursuant to subsection a,congress intent is clear.congress intended the va to meet the goals set by the secretary.to meet the goals,the secretary shall use rule of two procedures,may use the subsection b and c contract tools,and may elect to use the fss at other times so long as the goals are met.we perceive no ambiguity in,which is the end of the matter,for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.
kingdomware argues that the mandatory language of d shall award requires the va to conduct a rule of two analysis in all cases other than those covered by subsections b and c,including those cases where the va would prefer to order against the fss.kingdomware points out that congress used language almost identical to that in in the veterans act,but importantly,changed the permissive term may to the mandatory term shall.it invokes the canon of construction that a change in legislative language generally gives rise to a presumption that congress intended to change the meaning of the law.see midwest of cannon falls,united states.
according to kingdomware,the legislative history of the act also supports its interpretation of d.kingdomware cites legislative history suggesting that the act was passed following frustration with agencies failure to meet the permissive vosb contracting goals of the and acts,and that congress,in passing the act to apply solely to the va,expect ed the va to set the example among government agencies for contracting with vosbs,at.
kingdomware also points to legislative history wherein the bill sponsor,john boozman,explicitly noted the change in language from may to shall in d,stating that t he bill will essentially change what has been a may to a shall in terms of goals,the native american veteran home loan act,the veteran owned small business promotion act of and four draft bills hearing before the subcomm.on econ.opportunity of the comm.on veterans affairs,cong.statement of john boozman,member,comm.on veterans affairs.
finally,kingdomware notes that in the report accompanying the legislation,the committee on veterans affairs stated that small businesses owned and controlled by veterans and veterans should routinely be granted the primary opportunity to enter into va procurement contracts,at emphases added.according to kingdomware,this is evidence that congress intended the va to determine whether the rule of two was satisfied for every contract before it could look to the fss.
kingdomware assigns no substantive meaning to the phrase for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a,and instead contends that the words only state the objective for rule of two awards,to meet the secretary goals.kingdomware is adamant that the for purposes words have no limiting effect.but kingdomware does not explain why congress intended shall to continue as an imperative after the secretary goals are achieved,or why congress intended for the goals to be set not by the secretary,but by whatever success vosbs have under the rule of two in the marketplace.
looking first to the text of the statute,the va notes that the mandatory language of subsection d shall award is preceded by the phrase for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a.while kingdomware maintains that this phrase is merely hortatory,the va argues that it must be given effect,and that,read as a whole,the provision mandates a rule of two analysis only for those contracts the va has decided are necessary for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a.
under a,the va is required to set vosb contracting goals with a mandatory statutory floor.the va points out that it retains significant discretion under this subsection to set the numerical value of these goals.according to the va,this discretion would be meaningless,and the provision of a would be rendered superfluous,if it were required to apply the rule of two for every contract.under kingdomware interpretation of,the goal would be whatever number the rule of two produces,regardless of the secretary preference.
responding to kingdomware argument that shall in the statute is necessarily entirely imperative because may limited the rule of two in the statute,the va explains that shall in subsection d exists to distinguish may with regard to the procedures of subsections b and c.in support,the va cites the legislative history of the act which explains clearly that congress preferred use by the secretary of the rule of two over the permissive noncompetitive procedures,at.the va thus reads subsection d in context with subsections b and c to give meaning to shall that does not preclude use of the fss.
the va also asserts that kingdomware reading of shall conflicts with its multiple small business contracting responsibilities.according to the va,if it were to follow subsection d rule of two in every instance,in addition to respecting the contracting priorities of subsection i,it would be unable to meet other small business contracting goals specified by the small business act.moreover,the va points out that under the small business act,including the veterans act amendments,agencies have always retained the discretion to use the fss in lieu of following the rule of two.see a,b.it argues that a single wording may in the veterans act to shall in the act without further explicit guidance as to how the provisions of the act interact with the fss is insufficient evidence that congress intended to disrupt the existing scheme here.according to the va,kingdomware interpretation would lead to the untenable result wherein the va is unable to use the fss for even routine and minor purchases.
despite its consistent practice of retaining the discretion to forego the rule of two when using the fss,the va notes that since the passage of the act it has consistently set and exceeded ambitious vosb contracting goals.this is evidence,in the va view,that its interpretation is consistent with the aims of congress in passing the act,as expressed in the legislative history.
it is a bedrock principle of statutory interpretation that each word in a statute should be given effect.see qizhuo meissner,an endlessly reiterated principle of statutory construction is that all words in a statute are to be assigned meaning,and that nothing therein is to be construed as surplusage.see also ariad,eli lilly,concluding that a party proposed statutory interpretation violat ed the rule of statutory construction that congress does not use unnecessary words.
kingdomware interpretation of subsection d assigns dispositive weight to the command term shall,but ignores additional statutory language stating that this mandate is for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a.under kingdomware interpretation,the statute mandate requiring the va to conduct a rule of two analysis would apply to every competitive contract contemplated by the va without any regard for the vosb contracting goals set under subsection a,despite the provision explicit reference to these goals.indeed,kingdomware conceded at oral argument that under its interpretation of d,the va must continue to apply a rule of two analysis for every contract even after it has met the goals set under a.oral argument at.further,as the va points out,if d requires the agency to conduct a rule of two analysis for every contract irrespective of the goals set under subsection a,this provision is itself made superfluous.because kingdomware plain meaning interpretation of d reads the words for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a out of the statute and makes the mandatory statutory provision unnecessary,it can not stand.
the statutory scheme as a whole links the rule of two mandate denoted by the word shall in subsection d to the goals set under subsection a.the mandate is,therefore,the required procedure for meeting these goals.it is fully consistent with subsection a,which requires the va to set goals for contracting with vosbs,but grants the va considerable discretion to set the value of these goals.accordingly,the agency need not perform a vosb rule of two analysis for every contract,as long as the goals set under subsection a are met.the correct reading of the statute according to its plain meaning puts the shall in subsection d in harmonious context with the discretionary may provisions of subsections b and c,and assures that the goals of subsection a will be set by the secretary,not the success or failure of the rule of two in the marketplace.
congress enacted out of frustration with the failure of agencies to achieve the aspirational goals of for sdvosbs.in hearings leading up to the veterans act,the prime reason for failure to achieve the goals was the discretionary,not mandatory,nature of the goals,at.as boozman observed,changed what had been a may to a shall in terms of goals.congress chose the va to set the example among government agencies by imposing on it the obligation to meet the goals set by the secretary for both categories of small businesses.id.indeed,congress anticipated that with the contracting tools provided in,the va would be able to meet,if not exceed its contracting goals,while at the same time fulfilling the goals it has set for other small business entities.cong.rec,the goals for veteran and veteran owned businesses are not in any way intended to prevent attainment of other goals.
as it stands,there is no reason to compel the secretary to set aside any contract for a rule of two inquiry before using the fss notwithstanding his goals,as kingdomware requests.the va has consistently met the mandatory goals for procurement from sdvosbs and vosbs in each year since the veterans act of went into force,and kingdomware does not contend otherwise.the secretary has complied with his statutory mandate to both set goals and meet them,and,accordingly,the va contracting officer decision not to set aside the contracts at issue was not arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to the law.
conclusion 
for the reasons provided above,we affirm the final decision of the court of federal claims in favor of the.
each side shall bear its own costs.
the majority holds that the veterans act does not require the department of veterans affairs va to conduct a rule of two analysis in every procurement,as long as the va satisfies its annual small business participation goals.i do not construe the veterans act as giving the va discretion to decide whether to conduct a rule of two analysis.for this and other reasons set forth below,i respectfully dissent.
the plain language of the veterans act unambiguously requires va contracting officers to conduct a rule of two analysis in every acquisition and does not exempt task or delivery orders under the federal supply schedule fss from this imperative.despite the statute clarity,the majority guts the rule of two imperative of its full force and effect by holding that a rule of two analysis is not required for every contract as long as the goals set under subsection a are met.op.at.participatory goals,however,are aspirational,and an agency can not refuse to set aside an acquisition solely because small businesses already receive a fair proportion of the agency contracts in relying entirely on prefatory language to congress,the majority becomes policy maker and departs from our duty to enforce the proper interpretation of the statute regardless of our policy views 
the statutory provision at issue could not be clearer.it provides that contracting officers shall award contracts on the basis of restricted competition whenever the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that the rule of two will be satisfied 
d use of restricted competition.except as provided in subsections b and c,for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection a,and in accordance with this section,a contracting officer of the department shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the united states.
d emphasis added.this provision is part of a broader small business contracting program congressionally tailored to the va,which requires the secretary of the va to increase small business contracting opportunities by establishing annual participation goals for small businesses vosb and small businesses sdvosb in va acquisitions.id.a.this statutory program confirms the imperative character of subsection d.specifically,for contracts below the simplified acquisition threshold,va contracting officers may use procedures other than competitive procedures in awarding contracts to small businesses.id.b emphasis added.similarly,for acquisitions valued above the simplified acquisition threshold but below million,va contracting officers may award a contract to a small business using noncompetitive procedures as long as certain requirements are met.id.c emphasis added.
in contrast,subsection d of the veterans act applies to all va acquisitions and requires va contracting officers to conduct a rule of two analysis in every acquisition,without limitation.unlike subsections b and c,which use discr
