the false claims act fca permits,in certain circumstances,suits by private parties on behalf of the united states against anyone submitting a false claim to the government.in,congress amended the fca to include b,which provides that w hen a person brings a qui tam action,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.this appeal requires us to interpret b for the first time.we hold that b establishes an,bar.we further hold that subsequently dismissed cases constitute pending actions under b.finally,we hold that a material facts,not identical facts,test should be used to determine if a related action is based on the facts underlying the pending action.b.we affirm the district court dismissal of lujan qui tam action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under b.
background and proceedings 
linda lujan and william schumer,former hughes aircraft company employees,brought separate qui tam claims alleging that hughes fraudulently used commonality agreements determining whether b bars lujan action necessarily involves reviewing schumer action.
united states ex rel.schumer hughes aircraft company 
in,former hughes manager william schumer filed a qui tam action against hughes asserting that hughes defrauded the united states government by entering into unauthorized and illegal commonality agreements allocating project costs over more than one subcontract.the government declined to intervene in may,the district court found the commonality agreements proper,and granted summary judgment in favor of hughes.
schumer appealed and hughes,arguing that because government auditors had alleged the same mischarging prior to schumer filing,the action was barred under the government knowledge defense,b.while acknowledging that the amendments eliminated the government knowledge defense hughes argued that the amendments could not be applied retroactively to hughes conduct.we held that the amendments applied retroactively to hughes conduct,affirmed the majority of the district court findings,and remanded two factual issues regarding conduct.see united states ex rel.schumer hughes aircraft,cir.
the supreme court granted certiorari and reversed,holding that the amendments could not be applied retroactively to conduct.the court declined to review the remaining issues and held that the claims should have been dismissed,because the district court did not have jurisdiction over the conduct due to the government knowledge exception see hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d.
united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft company 
this is the third appeal in this case.
in february,lujan filed qui tam claims against hughes for alleged fraud and retaliation claims for her employment termination lujan alleged that hughes was engaging in fraudulent contracting practices by shifting costs from programs to programs.pursuant to b,lujan filed her claim in camera and served it on the government.while the qui tam claim was still under seal and before hughes had been served with the complaint,the los angeles times ran two articles reporting lujan qui tam claim filing.the district court held that lujan public disclosure of the existence and substance of her qui tam complaint violated the fca statutory seal provision,b,and dismissed the action.
we reversed the district court.see lujan hughes aircraft lujan i,cir.we held that the use of dismissal as a sanction was not necessarily the appropriate remedy for lujan violation.see id.at.in addition,we held sua sponte that before the district court could reach the merits of lujan claim,it would have to determine if it had jurisdiction under e a,which bars suits brought after the allegations in the complaint have been publicly disclosed,unless the relator is the original source of the information.id.at.we noted the similarities between lujan complaint and the earlier filed schumer complaint.
in march,the district court found that lujan allegations were substantially similar and therefore based upon those publicly disclosed in schumer 
lujan qui tam allegations are substantially similar to schumer previous claims.lujan attempts to distinguish her allegations by stating that they involve mischarging within the program,while schumer addressed cost shifting among the program and other aircrafts,msip,and.however,upon reviewing the allegations previously brought by schumer,the court finds that lujan allegations are simply a variation on schumer.
schumer claims,like lujan involve the bomber system,which was a massive,billion dollar contract.with such large stakes at hand,the government necessarily performed a thorough review of schumer claims as evidenced by the schumer record and proceedings.lujan now seeks to create a meaningless distinction between her claims and schumer in order to further the government,and her,interests.
to give credence to lujan microscopically fine distinctions between her allegations and those of schumer would do injustice to the purposes underlying the false claims act.it is the harbinger,not the mimic,who is entitled to champion the government interests.
therefore,the district court dismissed lujan qui tam claims,holding that the district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case under e.
on appeal,we split lujan qui tam claims into two groups pre and conduct.see united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft lujan ii,cir.following schumer,we affirmed the district court dismissal of lujan qui tam conduct claims,because the government already had knowledge of her claims see id.we reviewed the conduct claims to determine if there was subject matter jurisdiction under e.we affirmed the district court finding that lujan and schumer allegations were substantially similar and therefore constituted public disclosure of lujan qui tam claims,stating 
the subject matter of schumer action was four defense contracts between hughes and the united program contract contract,the radar multistage improvement program contract contract,the radar upgrade program contract contract,and the special programs contract contract.the contract involved the design of an advanced radar system for that airplane.hughes managed each of these contracts under commonality agreements,which permit each program using a common component to share in some portion of its development and production costs.
schumer alleged that hughes used these commonality agreements to misbid,misallocate,and mischarge costs among the four contracts.for example,schumer alleged that hughes charged the development of a radar signal processor to the contract but then also charged these developments costs to the,and contracts.
lujan allegations also concern the contract to develop the radar system.lujan alleges that,between and at least,hughes routinely mischarged costs associated with the design and development of various radar system contracts.she also alleges that hughes mischarged costs on contracts involving the,and by means of the commonality agreements governing cost allocations among the various radar system programs.
the schumer and lujan allegations both involve transactions among and within the radar system programs on four aircraft.the two claims involve the same commonality agreements and the same radar program contracts.
lujan ii,at.we then found that lujan was an original source because she brought her allegations to the government before schumer allegations were publicly disclosed.therefore,we reversed the district court dismissal of lujan claims,holding that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under e a original source exception.
on remand,hughes moved to dismiss lujan qui tam action under the b jurisdictional bar.the district court determined that lujan ii had not decided the b issue,and then found that b applied because schumer was pending when lujan filed her action.the district court reviewed the prior district court findings that the allegations were substantially similar and based upon those publicly disclosed in schumer lawsuit and our lujan ii upholding of that finding.the district court found that lujan claims were based on the same essential facts and raised
