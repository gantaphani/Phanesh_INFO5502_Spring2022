appellant,oscar renda contracting,renda appeals the district court order dismissing its suit for failure to state a claim.the principal issue in this case is whether the first amendment protects a contractor whose bid has been rejected by a city in retaliation for the contractor exercise of freedom of speech where the contractor had no relationship with that city.although the supreme court expressly reserved this question in board of county commissioners umbehr,d,the court analysis in that case when read along with rutan republican party of illinois,d,persuades us that the absence of a prior relationship would not preclude the contractor claim.we vacate the order dismissing this case and remand it to the district court for further proceedings.
appellant,renda,is a construction company based in roanoke,texas,and specializes in public works projects.the appellee,city of lubbock the city,is an incorporated municipality in texas.the city requested bids for construction of improvements to its storm drainage south lubbock drainage improvements project.renda submitted the lowest bid by more than million.the next lowest bidder was utility contractors of america uca.under texas law,the city is required to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder.
after becoming aware that city officials had recommended that the city award the contract to uca,renda requested a meeting with the city staff officials.during the meeting,the city officials apparently stated that they knew renda had previously filed a lawsuit against the el paso water district water district suit and was awarded damages,and they expressed concern that renda was lawsuit happy.renda explained to the city staff officials its reasons for filing the lawsuit,and renda left the meeting believing it had dispelled any concerns the city officials had regarding the lawsuit.the city officials recommended the acceptance of renda bid proposal,but only on the condition that renda execute an affidavit reaffirming its familiarity with the conditions and requirements of the construction project and the applicable contractual provisions.renda complied with the demand and signed the affidavit on the same day the city council voted on the contract.
despite the signed affidavit,the council awarded the contract to uca,by a vote,claiming that they had reservations concerning renda business practices.renda,on the other hand,alleged that the city real reason for denying its bid stemmed from renda lawsuit against the water district.renda alleged in paragraph of its petition that it was explained to city representatives,including the attorneys from the city attorneys office,that renda asserted a first amendment retaliation claim and a breach of contract claim in the water district case.renda also alleged that it prevailed in this suit.
renda filed suit in the district court seeking damages and other relief because the city retaliated against it for exercising its first amendment rights the district court granted the city motion to dismiss the first amendment retaliation claim because renda did not allege that the speech involved a matter of public concern to the relevant city of lubbock,texas and renda did not have a commercial relationship with the city.on appeal,renda argues that the district court erred in resolving both issues against it and in dismissing its suit.
we review dismissals under rule b de novo.causey sewell,cir citing hamilton united healthcare of louisiana,cir.in doing so,we accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint.id.citing herrmann holdings limited.lucent technologies,cir.the dismissal should be upheld only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of their claim which entitles them to relief.id.quotations and citations omitted.subsumed within this standard,is the requirement that the plaintiff complaint be stated with enough clarity to enable a court or an opposing party to determine whether a claim is sufficiently alleged.elliott foufas,cir.
renda argues first that the district court erred in concluding that it failed to adequately allege that renda water district a matter of public concern.to state a first amendment retaliation claim,an employee suing his employer must establish four elements the employee must suffer an adverse employment decision the employee speech must involve a matter of public concern the employee interest in commenting on matters of public concern must outweigh the defendant interest in promoting efficiency and the employee speech must have motivated the employer adverse action.kinney weaver,cir en banc emphasis added.the supreme court explained in connick myers,d,that w hether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.
as stated earlier,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to plead that the prior lawsuit against el paso water district involved a matter of public concern because the suit had nothing to do with a public issue in lubbock and thus did not address a matter of public concern to lubbock the relevant community.
the city relies on the language in a number of supreme court cases and cases from this court requiring proof that the speech is a matter of concern in the community.see,connick,at.stating that the speech should fairly relate to a matter of political,social,or other concern to the community alexander eeds,cir quoting markos city of atlanta,cir concluding that the speech at issue was not public speech because no one could reasonably argue that the complaints were made against a backdrop of widespread debate in the community but were merely matters of private concern emphasis added tompkins vickers,cir stating that the plaintiff speech was made against a backdrop of widespread debate in the greenville community regarding the art program and other aspects emphasis added.
the city tracks the position taken by the district court and argues that while allegations in the water district suit of wrongdoing by el paso officials might be a matter of public concern in el paso,it would be of little interest to the residents of the lubbock community.
we have found no cases expressly discussing whether the speech at issue must be a matter of public concern in the community where the retaliation and plaintiff damages occur.however,the district court affirmative answer to this question is inconsistent with the result in this circuit en banc decision in kinney.
in that case we permitted plaintiffs to assert claims for first amendment retaliation even though the location of the protected activity and the place where the retaliatory activity occurred were hundreds of miles apart.kinney.at argument,the city agreed that kinney was dispositive of this issue.
this conclusion is also more consistent with our reading of the supreme court cases that public concern has a broader meaning than that given by the city.as the supreme court in city of san diego roe,d,stated t hese cases make clear that public concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest.we conclude,therefore,that the district court erred in concluding that renda complaint failed to allege that the water district lawsuit was a matter of public concern in the community because the protected activity the lawsuit occurred in el paso rather than lubbock,where the retaliation occurred.
the city also argues that renda allegation that its bid was rejected because it filed a lawsuit against the el paso water district is insufficient to raise an inference that the lawsuit is a matter of public concern.if the petition alleged only that renda filed a lawsuit we would agree with the city.in this circuit an employee suit against her employer is not considered per se a matter of public concern.if the lawsuit is only a matter of personal interest to the employee,it is not considered a matter of public concern.see rathjen litchfield,cir citing day south park indep.sch,cir.
but renda alleged in paragraph that its suit involved renda asserting a first amendment retaliation claim and a breach of contract claim.renda
