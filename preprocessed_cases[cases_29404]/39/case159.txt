plaintiffs are air traffic controllers who allege personal injuries based on their exposure to toxic mold at the detroit metropolitan wayne county airport dtw.they claim that several mold remediation firms hired by the federal aviation administration faa negligently performed their contracts and exacerbated the building existing mold contamination.plaintiffs appeal the district court order dismissing their complaint for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.because we conclude that all defendants but one were properly dismissed,we affirm the district court judgment in part and reverse in part.
plaintiffs are faa employees who work as air traffic controllers in dtw air traffic control tower tower in september,the faa discovered mold in the tower storage areas and hired moldquest international,moldquest to investigate.moldquest testing revealed significant levels of mold contamination,including the presence of stachybotrys,commonly referred to as toxic mold.moldquest report stated that the presence of stachybotrys indicated the affected wall materials had been saturated for an extended period of time.
the faa hired a private mold remediation firm,defendant mis corporation,mis,to treat and remove the mold in the tower fourth and ninth floors plaintiffs allege that mis remediation,which took place in january,was disastrous,causing toxic mold to spread throughout the tower 
the faa hired defendant,an environmental consulting firm,to evaluate the scope of the and to recommend mitigation strategies.recommended that the faa retain another mold remediation firm to spray the tower fourth and ninth floors and its elevator shaft with approved microbiologic biocide.the faa thereafter hired coach catastrophic cleaning restoration services,coach to perform a second remediation.
on january,defendant coach sprayed the tower fourth and ninth floors and elevator shaft using an unmarked container.within hours of the spraying,eight air traffic controllers became ill and sought immediate medical treatment,resulting in a employee evacuation.according to plaintiffs,coach spray contained octanol,undecone,dodecane,and tridecane,which can cause numerous health hazards,including lung damage,drowsiness,dizziness,pulmonary edema,asphyxiation,vomiting,and death.
despite two professional mold remediations,the contamination persisted.the national air traffic controllers association plaintiffs union hired wonder makers environmental,wonder makers to evaluate the tower contamination.wonder makers detected various strains of mold on the fourth,ninth,and tenth floors,and toxic mold in air and dust samples collected throughout the building.
the faa again contracted with mis to perform a third remediation.they also hired safe technology,safe to recommend an effective mold remediation plan and to provide testing.in addition,the faa retained a certified industrial hygienist cih from clayton environmental consultants clayton to assist mis with its remediation efforts.
mis performed the third mold remediation in may,executing the faa specifications according to the consulting reports the faa received from clayton and safe.plaintiffs assert that safe report was flawed because it failed to address several issues.after the third remediation,plaintiffs reported an increase in the severity of their symptoms.
in june,the faa hired defendant jacobs facilities,jacobs to conduct a site survey and to prepare an assessment report.jacobs investigation revealed that the tower elevator shaft act ed as a piston that forc ed contaminated air into each level of the building.the report characterized the tower overall contamination as minor,but nonetheless recommended a thorough cleaning of the tower elevator shaft with a solution.
in may,the faa hired mis to perform a fourth remediation,focusing on the tower elevator shaft.at the direction of the faa,mis executed many of jacobs recommendations regarding the treatment of mold and other contaminated materials located in the shaft.
wonder makers returned in december to conduct additional testing.its sampling indicated that the may remediation failed to remov e all fungal materials.wonder makers recommended to the faa an invasive sampling of the elevator interior liner to determine if mold spores were present beneath the liner.the faa ultimately rejected wonder makers recommendation.
in light of plaintiffs contin uing complaints of health problems,the faa hired applied environmental,and safe to investigate whether their multiple remediations had eradicated the mold.in june,safe recommended that no further mold testing or remediation was required.the faa adopted safe assessment and did not hire mis to perform a fifth remediation.according to plaintiffs,however,safe was hired to simply rubber stamp the faa decision to cease its mold remediation efforts.
on september,plaintiffs filed a complaint in the circuit court of wayne county,michigan,claiming that,safe,jacobs,and bureau veritas north american,clayton successor by merger,were negligent in their consultation and evaluation of the tower mold contamination and that mis and coach negligently executed their mold remediation contracts with the faa plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages in excess of resulting from their exposure to indoor air contamination and ineffective mold remediation.
mis removed plaintiffs complaint to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan pursuant to a,the federal officer removal statute,asserting that it was acting under the color of federal office by virtue of its multiple contracts with the faa mis argued that it was immune from liability under the government contractor defense because the faa had closely regulated,monitored,and supervised each mold remediation.plaintiffs moved to remand the case,which the district court denied after conducting a jurisdictional hearing.
relying upon fultz associates,and its progeny,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that michigan law does not recognize tort actions for alleged negligent breaches of contract.plaintiffs contested the dismissal and moved the district court for leave to file an amended complaint.
after extensive briefing,the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss and denied plaintiffs motion to amend their complaint on futility grounds.specifically,the district court ruled that the operative complaint and proposed amended complaint failed to allege that defendants owed plaintiffs a duty that was separate and distinct from defendants contractual obligations to the faa.see fultz,at.
plaintiffs timely appeal.
plaintiffs first claim that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based upon the purported inapplicability of the government contractor defense.we disagree.the district court subject matter jurisdiction was not dependant upon the success of the government contractor defense rather,mis needed only to assert a colorable federal defense at the time of removal.mesa california,
the federal officer removal statute permits a defendant to remove to federal court a action brought against the 
united states or any agency thereof or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the united states or of any agency thereof,sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office or on account of any right,title or authority claimed under any act of congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue.
in willingham morgan,the united states supreme court explained the broad scope of the federal officer removal statute 
the federal officer removal statute is not narrow or limited.at the very least,it is broad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of their duty to enforce federal law.one of the primary purposes of the removal its history clearly to have such defenses litigated in the federal courts.the position of the court below would have the anomalous result of allowing removal only when the officers had a clearly sustainable defense.the suit would be removed only to be dismissed.congress certainly meant more than this when it chose the words under color of office.in fact,one of the most important reasons for removal is to have the validity of the defense of official immunity tried in a federal court.the officer need not win his case before he can have it removed.in cases like this one,congress has decided that federal officers,and indeed the federal government itself,require the protection of a federal forum.this policy should not be frustrated by a narrow,grudging interpretation of a.
id.at emphasis added citation omitted.
because mis is not itself a federal officer,it must satisfy a test to entitle it to removal under a.first,mis must establish that it is a person within the meaning of the statute who act ed under a federal officer.a.second,mis must demonstrate that it performed the actions for which it is being sued under color of federal office.id.third,mis must show that it raised a colorable federal defense.see jefferson county acker,u,lay burley stabilization,app x,cir unpublished moore,concurring isaacson dow chem,cir.we address each of these requirements in turn.
the parties do not dispute that mis is a person under the statute.nevertheless,we conclude that the term person includes mis because the context of a does not indicate otherwise.the plain language of does not exclude corporations.in addition,text covers entities,such as the united states and its agencies,which suggests that interpreting person to include corporations is consistent with the statutory scheme.isaacson,at see also winters diamond shamrock chem,cir same good armstrong world,same pack ac s,same fung abex,same 
the statute permits removal only if mis was acting under an faa officer.a see lay,app x at.in watson phillip morris companies,the supreme court held that the federal trade commission heavy regulation and supervision of a firm did not,standing alone,satisfy the statute acting under requirement 
the relevant relationship is that of a private person acting under a federal officer or agency.a emphasis added.in this context,the word under must refer to what has been described as a relationship that involves acting in a certain capacity,considered in relation to one holding a superior position or office.oxford english dictionary ed.that relationship typically involves subjection,guidance,or control.webster new international dictionary ed.see also funk wagnalls new standard dictionary of the english language defining under as meaning s ubordinate or subservient to,s ubject to guidance,tutorship,or direction of oxford english dictionary,supra,at s ubject to the instruction,direction,or guidance of.in addition,precedent and statutory purpose make clear that the private person acting under must involve an effort to assist,or to help carry out,the duties or tasks of the federal superior.see,davis south carolina,supra,at.see also supra,at.
in our view,the help or assistance necessary to bring a private person within the scope of the statute does not include simply complying with the law.we recognize that sometimes an english speaker might say that one who complies with the law helps or assists governmental law enforcement.taxpayers who fill out complex federal tax forms,airline passengers who obey federal regulations prohibiting smoking,for that matter federal prisoners,all help or assist federal law enforcement authorities in some sense of those words.but that is not the sense of help or assist that can bring a private action within the scope of this statute.that is in part a matter of language.one would usually describe the behavior of the taxpayers,airline passengers,and prisoners we have described as compliance with the law or acquiescence to an order,not as acting under a federal official who is giving an order or enforcing the law.
id.at emphasis in original.
in rejecting phillip morris argument,the court distinguished the facts of its case from those of other lower federal court cases that have held that government contractors fall within the terms of the federal officer removal statute,at least when the relationship between the contractor and the government is an unusually close one involving detailed regulation,monitoring,or supervision.id.at citing winters,at.the court explained that when analyzing whether a private firm is help ing or assist ing a federal officer,such that its assistance satisfies the acting under requirement 
the answer lies in the fact that the private contractor in such cases is helping the government to produce an item that it needs.the assistance that private contractors provide federal officers goes beyond simple compliance with the law and helps officers fulfill other basic governmental tasks.in the context of winters for example,dow chemical fulfilled the terms of a contractual agreement by providing the government with a product that it used to help conduct a war.moreover,at least arguably,dow performed a job that,in the absence of a contract with a private firm,the government itself would have had to perform.
in its removal motion,mis claimed that its work was performed at the direction of,and in accordance with,detailed mold abatement specifications established by the faa and that t he faa provided detailed instructions pertaining to the materials that mis was required to use and the manner in which mis was to perform the mold remedial activities.in support of its removal,mis attached its faa contracts 
the faa contracts included precise specifications.for example,during the january remediation,the faa mandated that mis follow explicit parameters for site containment and waste disposal 
the contractor must establish a work area perimeter around the area containing the visible mold on the fourth and ninth floors.the area where mold is present is to be isolated utilizing a minimum of plastic sheeting.negative pressure is to be supplied to the enclosure with the use of negative air scrubber machines equipped with hepa particulate air filtration.
the mold contaminated drywall and mold waste is to be double bagged in labeled polyethylene bags.each bag shall be adequately sealed.the exterior bag is to be hepa vacuumed in the equipment room of the decon chamber prior to exiting to work area.finally,the bags are transported to and then disposed of in a landfill approved for the disposal of mold and containing waste by the state of michigan.
federal officers closely monitored mis work.specifically,each contract designated a federal officer who direct ly supervised each remediation these federal officers hereinafter faa contracting officers were prohibited from modifying or deviating from the faa specifications without first obtaining the signature of the lead contractor officer,judy ryckman,also an faa officer.furthermore,faa contracting officers had the authority to require mis to dismiss from work those mis employees which they deem ed incompetent,insubordinate,unsuitable,or otherwise objectionable.the faa also controlled the working hours of mis employees,who were escorted by faa personnel at all times,and were prohibited from entering the work site without prior faa approval.
unlike the cigarette manufacturer in watson,mis assistance went beyond simple compliance with the law.id.at.mis helped faa officers carry out their task of ridding a federal employee occupied building of an allegedly hazardous contaminant a job that,in the absence of a contract with mis or another private mold remediation firm the faa itself would have had to perform.id.at.under these facts,we conclude that the contractual relationship between mis and the faa was an unusually close one,involving detailed regulation,monitoring,and supervision.id.at citing winters,at.for these reasons,we conclude that mis has satisfied a acting under requirement.see watson,at.
next,mis must show that it performed the actions for which it is being sued under color of federal office.acker,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.to satisfy th is requirement,mis must show a nexus,a causal connection between the charged conduct and the asserted official authority.id.quoting willingham,at.in other words,the removing party must show that it is being sued because of the acts it performed at the direction of the federal officer.see watson,at city of cookeville upper cumberland membership,cir lay,app x at.the supreme court has indicated that t he hurdle erected by this requirement is quite low.isaacson,at citing maryland soper,i t is enough that the federal officer acts or presence at the place in performance of his official duty constitute s the basis for the lawsuit.
here,mis mold remediation work,which was performed at the direction of faa officers under contract,was also the alleged cause of plaintiffs personal injuries.this establishes the nexus required by a.see willingham,at.furthermore,even if plaintiffs were able to demonstrate that the alleged occurred because of an act not contemplated by mis contracts with the faa,it is sufficient for our purposes that mis execution of the faa contracts gave rise to the alleged.see isaacson,at.indeed,whether the challenged act was outside the scope of mis official duties,or whether it was specifically directed by the faa,is one for the to answer.id.citing willingham,at see also arthur miller,edward cooper,vikram david amar,federal practice procedure ed.
finally,mis must show that it raised a colorable federal defense.acker,at mesa,at.in its removal motion,mis asserted that it was immune from liability under the government contractor defense as articulated in boyle united technologies.in boyle,the supreme court held that the uniquely federal interest of getting the government work done requires that,under certain circumstances,a private contractor must be protected from tort liability associated with its performance of a government procurement contract.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the boyle court thereafter articulated a test announcing that 
l iability for design defects in military equipment can not be imposed,pursuant to state law,when the united states approved reasonably precise specifications the equipment conformed to those specifications and the supplier warned the united states about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the united states.
id.at,this affirmative product of federal common known as the government contractor defense.id.at.
plaintiffs assert that the government contractor defense was not a colorable defense because mis contracts with the faa were performance contracts.the availability of the government contractor defense based upon the performance of a service contract presents an issue of first impression in our circuit.however,we have stated that a colorable federal defense need only be plausible,upper cumberland membership,at lay,app x at,and that a district court is not required to determine its validity at the time of removal.upper cumberland membership,at citing with approval magnin teledyne cont l motors,cir a colorable federal defense need only be plausible its ultimate validity is not to be determined at the time of removal.for example,in acker,the supreme court concluded that the defendant had presented a colorable federal defense of tax immunity even though the court ultimately rejected that defense.at.
thus,we must determine whether our lack of precedent regarding the availability of the boyle defense to service contractors defeats the plausibility of the defense.in this regard,we routinely look to our sister circuits for guidance when we encounter a legal question that we have not previously passed upon.united states washington,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as mis argued in its removal brief,the application of the government contractor defense has found support in the context,as well as in the performance contract context.see hudgens bell,cir defense applicable where private service contractor defending a negligent lawsuit carley wheeled coach,cir defense available to contractors.but see in re hawaii federal asbestos cases,cir limiting applicability of government contractor defense to military procurement contracts.in hudgens,the eleventh circuit stated that a lthough boyle referred specifically to procurement contracts,the analysis it requires is not designed to promote rules regarding different classes of contract.rather,the question is whether subjecting a contractor to liability under state tort law would create a significant conflict with a unique federal interest.at citing glassco miller equip.co,cir.
the plausibility of the government contractor defense involving performance contracts has also been accepted by many federal district courts.see guillory ree contract,holding that federal contractor defense is a colorable federal defense in the performance contract context under a see also airport dist.atlas,t here is simply no reason why a nonmilitary contractor should be barred from enjoying this extension of immunity simply because he does not contract with the armed forces.lamb martin marietta energy,t he supreme court rationale for applying the government contractor defense in boyle is equally applicable in as well as military settings.footnote omitted.
indeed,when the boyle court articulated its basis for the government contractor defense,it explained that 
in yearsley ross construction,we rejected an attempt by a landowner to hold a construction contractor liable under state law for the erosion of acres of land caused by the contractor work in constructing dikes for the government.we said that if the authority to carry out the project was validly conferred,that is,if what was done was within the constitutional power of congress,there is no liability on the part of the contractor for executing its will,at.the federal interest justifying this holding surely exists as much in procurement contracts as in performance contracts we see no basis for a distinction.
boyle,at emphasis added second alteration in original.thus,it is at least plausible that the government contractor defense could apply outside the military procurement contract context because the supreme court noted that the origins of the defense,at least in part,were based upon a case that immunized a private contractor from liability arising out of its performance of a public works project.see yearsley,at carley,at.t he boyle court concluded that the rationale of the defense is the extension of sovereign immunity,and that in circumstances where the government would not be liable,private actors acting pursuant to government directives should not be liable either.carley,at.
under a,mis was not required to prove the success of the defense.see mesa,at magnin,at holding that defense need only be plausible its ultimate validity is not to be determined at the time of removal jamison wiley,cir concluding that defendant need not prove that he will actually prevail on his federal immunity defense in order to obtain removal winters,at same.
the reason for a threshold,colorability requirement is simple 
t he supreme court has noted that one of the most important functions of this right of removal is to allow a federal court to determine the validity of an asserted official immunity defense.removal pursuant to a is thus meant to ensure a federal forum in any case where a federal official is entitled to raise a defense arising out of his official duties.furthermore,this right is not to be frustrated by a grudgingly narrow interpretation of the removal statute.
winters,at emphasis added citation and internal quotation marks omitted see mesa,at in fact,one of the most important reasons for removal is to have the validity of the defense of official immunity tried in a federal court.quoting willingham,at internal quotation marks omitted see also int l primate prot.league adm rs of tulane educ.fund,expressly acknowledging the difficulty in applying a federal immunity defense t he question of immunity of federal officers is complicated,to wit,d etermining whether a federal officer ha s acted ultra vires is fraught with difficulty and subject to considerable manipulation.
consequently,because this aspect of plaintiffs appeal challenges only the basis for mis removal under a,our focus is not on whether mis would have succeeded at trial on the boyle defense,but only on whether,for removal purposes,mis raised a colorable claim to it.in this regard,we have stated previously that where a federal defense raises an issue of first impression in this court and it ha s previously found success in other circuits,one would be hard pressed to say that the defense was not colorable.upper cumberland membership,at.
for these reasons,we hold that mis a removal was proper and that the district court therefore possessed subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims 
plaintiffs also assert that the district court erred in dismissing their complaint for failure to state a claim under.b and improperly denied their motion for leave to amend their complaint on grounds of futility.we review these rulings de novo.first am.title devaugh,cir yuhasz brush wellman,cir.it is that defendants bear the burden of proving that plaintiffs claims fail as a matter of law.devaugh,at.we must also accept all factual allegations as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.id.we need not,however,accept unwarranted factual inferences.see bell atlantic twombly.in addition,to survive a motion to dismiss,plaintiffs must aver enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.
because the district court rulings are based upon a legal rule that appears unique to michigan tort law,we discuss the fultz case in detail.there,the michigan supreme court held that a third party could not sue a party to a contract for its negligent performance of that contract unless the plaintiff alleges that the defendant owed a duty to him that was separate and distinct from the defendant contractual obligations.at.
the plaintiff in fultz slipped and fell while walking though a snow and parking lot.at.the defendant,creative maintenance limited cml,had previously contracted with the parking lot owner to provide snow removal services.id.at the time of plaintiff fall,cml had neither salted nor plowed the parking lot in approximately fourteen hours.id.the plaintiff sued the parking lot owner and cml.a jury awarded the plaintiff compensatory damages after finding that cml was negligent in its performance of the contract and that its negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff injuries.id.the michigan court of appeals affirmed.
the michigan supreme court reversed,holding that,as a matter of law,cml owed no contractual or duty to plaintiff to plow or salt the parking lot.id.at.the fultz court provided the following explanation 
we believe the slippery distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance of a duty undertaken obscures the proper initial inquiry whether a particular defendant owes any duty at all to a particular plaintiff.
this court and the court of appeals have defined a tort action stemming from misfeasance of a contractual obligation as the violation of a legal duty separate and distinct from the contractual obligation.
we believe that the separate and distinct definition of misfeasance offers better guidance in determining whether a negligence action based on a contract and brought by a third party to that contract may lie because it focuses on the threshold question of duty in a negligence claim.as there can be no breach of a nonexistent duty,the former inquiry in a negligence case is defective because it improperly focuses on whether a duty was breached instead of whether a duty exists at all.
accordingly,the lower courts should analyze tort actions based on a contract and brought by a plaintiff who is not a party to that contract by using a separate and distinct mode of analysis.specifically,the threshold question is whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff that is separate and distinct from the defendant contractual obligations.if no independent duty exists,no tort action based on a contract will lie.
fultz,at citations and footnote omitted.the michigan supreme court decided the fultz case in.since then,the fultz holding often functions to bar a plaintiff from suing a contractor for its negligent performance.
the best illustration of the rule scope is set forth in banaszak northwest airlines,wl,at,unpublished there,the michigan court of appeals reversed a trial court grant of summary disposition in favor of an elevator contractor that was sued for negligence arising out of its installation of a moving walkway at the dtw.id.the plaintiff in banaszak fell into a deep wellway that defendant otis elevator company had inadequately covered with plywood id.at.according to otis contract with northwest airlines,otis was required to secure open wellways with aluminum covers.id.at.on appeal,the plaintiff argued that fultz did not bar her recovery against otis because it had created a new hazard,the use of plywood instead of aluminum to cover the wellway,which created a duty that was separate and distinct from otis contractual obligations to northwest.id.at.the michigan court of appeals agreed 
whether others removed structural plywood covers,or whether others placed the deficient plywood are factual matters to be determined at trial.whether the action presents one of failure of policing by others,the general contractor,or the owner as a theory of defense is also subject to proof at trial.otis elevator performance,and choices of performance,are negligence issues and not duty issues.and these,like the theories concerning proximate causation are questions of fact for the jury.
because otis elevator owed a separate and distinct duty from that required under its contract with northwest airlines,the trial court erred in granting summary disposition in favor of otis elevator and dismissing plaintiff claim.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
banaszak,wl,at citation omitted.
in a order,the michigan supreme court reversed the appellate court decision and reinstated the trial court order granting otis motion for summary judgment 
on order of the court,the application for leave to appeal the february,judgment of the court of appeals is considered and,pursuant to mcr g,in lieu of granting leave to appeal,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the order of the wayne circuit court granting summary disposition to defendant otis elevator company.otis entered into a contract to install moving walkways in a new airport terminal.as part of that contract,otis was required to provide a cover over the wellway,an opening at the end of the moving walkway that contains the mechanical elements.the purpose of the cover was to protect persons using that area.the plaintiff was injured when she stepped on an inadequate piece of plywood covering the wellway.this hazard was the subject of the otis contract.as a result,otis owed no duty to plaintiff that was separate and distinct from its duties under the contract.fultz associates.
banaszak northwest airlines,emphasis added.
plaintiffs argue that the michigan supreme court order in banaszak is not controlling due to its brevity and because orders of the michigan supreme court are not precedentially binding.we disagree.because the supreme court order can be understood,it is binding precedent.evans luptak,plc lizza,see brooks engine power components,overruled on other grounds,kurtz faygo beverages,people phillips,citing people crall,n,carrington cadillac asphalt,llc,wl,at,unpublished per curium opinion michigan courts are bound by banaszak order.
under the michigan supreme court holding in banaszak,michigan and federal district courts sitting in diversity have concluded that there is no independent duty under fultz when a plaintiff alleges a hazard that is the subject of the defendant contractual obligations.see mierzejewski torre bruglio,inc,no new hazard despite hazardously displaced snow because snow removal subject of parties contract thacker encompass,wl,at.may,unpublished per curium opinion no new hazard despite caused by negligent mold remediation because mold removal subject of parties contract crespo henkel,wl,at,no new hazard because alleged toxins released by metal working fluids was subject of parties contract,aff,app x cir per curium irrer milacron,wl,at,no new hazard where metal working fluid toxins permeated plant injuring employees because metal working fluid maintenance subject of parties contract.
in short,under michigan law,when an obligor contracts with an obligee to perform services,the obligor does not necessarily assume the obligee legal duties.using the fultz case as an example,when cml contracted to remove snow and ice by salting and sanding the owner lot,it did not assume the owner duty to provide a reasonably safe premises.thus,by implication,the injured plaintiff negligence action would lie against the premises owner and not the contractor.in turn,the premises owner may seek indemnification or contribution from the contractor.
in this regard,most jurisdictions deem a negligent action by a contractor to be a voluntary assumption of a duty to foreseeable plaintiffs.see briere lathrop,ohio holding general contractor liable for painter injury where employee of general contractor assisted subcontractor employee in moving scaffold,thereby proximately causing painter fall from scaffold saint joseph healthcare,wl,at expressly recognizing viable cause of action for negligence against hospital cleaning contractor who placed rumpled mat in hospital vestibule,although noting that plaintiff injury,a severed thumb,was not the foreseeable consequence of any negligence by cleaner because injury was caused when plaintiff placed thumb in hinge of automatic door while attempting to straighten rumpled mat with foot burks kroger,no,wl,reversing trial court grant of summary judgment to roofing contractors because there existed a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether roofing contractors negligent repair of grocery store leaking roof proximately caused plaintiff injuries.
thus,except in michigan,the dichotomy is recognized because a contractor who fails to act assumes no duty to third persons by his inaction,while a contractor who negligently acts,assumes,under the law,a duty to foreseeable persons who may be injured by the contractor conduct.see morgan scott,biscan brown,d,wissel ohio high school athletic ass n,ohio see also dan dobbs,et,prosser and keeton on torts,acts and omissions,reprint.as then chief judge benjamin cardozo of new york court of appeals explained,t he query always is whether the putative wrongdoer has advanced to such a point as to have launched a force or instrument of harm,or has stopped where inaction is at most a refusal to become an instrument for good.moch rensselaer water.
however,this principle of tort law is no longer the law in michigan.see fultz,at.but see davis venture one,cir discussing the fultz case and holding that under michigan law c ontractual duties do not limit separately existing common law tort duties.since we decided davis,however,the michigan court of appeals has held that,while eloquent,the davis decision is not consistent with fultz,mierzejewski,banaszak,or its progeny.carrington,wl,at o ur supreme court has made clear that the distinction recognized in davis is not allowed under the majority interpretation of fultz when determining what constitutes a separate and distinct duty.
it is a rule in this circuit that a panel of this court may not overrule a prior published opinion of our court absent en banc review or an intervening and binding change in the state of the law.see salmi sec y of health human,cir rutherford columbia gas,cir.a caveat to this rule was first explored in blaine construction insurance company of north america,cir,a diversity case applying tennessee law.in blaine,the panel declined to reconsider a dispositive sixth circuit case interpreting state law on the theory that it was bound by a prior panel decision.the panel further indicated,however,that it would have been empowered to revisit the prior case had there been an indication by the tennessee courts that they would have decided the previous sixth circuit case differently.id.at see also rutherford,at.in hampton united states,cir,a panel of this court interpreted blaine as standing for the proposition that a panel may reconsider a previous panel decision interpreting state law when the state courts have expressly indicated that they disagree with the previous panel decision and would have decided it differently.
here,the michigan court of appeals in its carrington decision expressly indicate s,hampton,at,that davis is incorrect in light of mierzejewski and banaszak.see carrington,wl,at.the fact that carrington is a michigan court of appeals opinion,as opposed to a michigan supreme court decision,is not dispositive because w e will accept the holding of a state intermediate appellate court with respect to state law unless we determine the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.united states philp,cir see also hampton,at indicating that the circuit should presume the michigan supreme court would agree with the michigan court of appeals unless it s clear the michigan supreme court would likely disagree.
we acknowledge that carrington is an unpublished decision.pursuant to michigan court rule c,a n unpublished opinion is not precedentially binding under the rule of stare decisis,and,as a result,we are not necessarily bound by carrington holding.see am.fidelity cas.indem.ins.of,cir i t would be incongruous indeed to hold the federal court bound by a decision which would not be binding on any state court.however,despite the fact that carrington is not precedentially binding,it remains our overarching duty to ensure that we correctly apply michigan law.after doing so,we conclude that it would be improper for us to disregard carrington analysis of davis and adhere to davis merely because carrington is unpublished.carrington provides persuasive evidence that the michigan courts would have decided davis differently,and we should accord carrington deference notwithstanding the fact that it is not technically binding.bailey o press,cir noting that in determining state law the panel is entitled to look to the relevant dicta in related state cases emphasis added.
in light of the michigan supreme court decisions in mierzejewski and banaszak,we conclude that it is very unlikely that the michigan supreme court would disagree with carrington pronouncement that the davis panel reasoning runs contrary to michigan law.because carrington provides us with a clear indication that davis would have been decided differently in the michigan courts,there is sufficient evidence to allow this panel to disregard our decision in davis.see hampton,at rutherford,at.
in the present case,defendants fall into two performance categories consultation or removal.according to plaintiffs complaint,defendants,safe,jacobs,and bureau veritas provided professional consultation services to the faa by producing reports that recommended mold remediation strategies.defendants mis and coach,on the other hand,performed the actual mold remediation work at the direction of the faa.the fultz case applies to plaintiffs negligence claims because they were not parties to defendants contracts and they do not assert that they were beneficiaries.thus,the salient inquiry is whether plaintiffs complaint avers that any defendant created a new hazard that gave rise to a duty that was separate and distinct from its contractual obligations to the faa.see fultz,at.
plaintiffs rely heavily on conant state farm cas,wl,at.may,unpublished per curium opinion,for the proposition that a mold remediation contractor can be held liable to a third party if its negligent containment procedures cause the spread of dangerous mold.id.in conant,plaintiffs homeowner insurer instructed a mold removal contractor to cut holes in plaintiffs bedroom wall to discover the source of their claimed water damage.id.despite evidence of mold in the wall interior,the contractor did not seal off his work area.id.the plaintiffs claimed that by cutting the holes,the contractor dislodged dormant mold spores that,until then,had been contained,and upon disruption,had become hazardously airborne.id.the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs,finding the insurer and mold contractor negligent.the michigan court of appeals affirmed.id.however,contrary to plaintiffs position,conant is inapposite because the mold removal contractor was not a party to the plaintiffs,the michigan court of appeals was not resolving a fultz rule question.in addition,the plaintiffs in conant were not a third party with regard to their homeowner insurer.
instead,as defendants argue,thacker encompass ins,wl.may,unpublished per curium opinion is more persuasive.there,a plaintiff claimed,inter alia,that soil materials engineers,sme,a mold remediation company hired by her homeowner insurer to remove existing mold contamination failed to remedy worsened the dangerous mold conditions,which caused her personal injuries.id.at quotation marks omitted.it was uncontested on appeal that the plaintiff was a third party to the mold remediation contract 
finally,plaintiff argues that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether sme and colby breached their duties,as described in restatement torts,to perform their contractual undertakings with ordinary care.we disagree.plaintiff claims against sme were dismissed by the trial court on the ground that,contrary to the fultz holding,plaintiff failed to establish that sme owed a duty to her that was separate and distinct from its contractual obligations.on appeal,plaintiff has failed to distinguish the fultz holding or establish sme independent duty.accordingly,we conclude that her claims against sme were properly dismissed.
id.at.we find the thacker case instructive regarding what constitutes a new hazard under michigan law with respect to a mold remediation contract.
we hold that pursuant to thacker,banaszak,and mierzejewski,the fultz rule of law forecloses plaintiffs claims against the consulting defendants,safe,jacobs,and bureau veritas.specifically,the faa hired to conduct air quality testing,to provide a mold remediation strategy,and to assess the extent of the tower existing contamination.the faa hired safe to produce indoor air quality reports,recommendations,and mold removal strategies.the faa contract with jacobs involved its consultation regarding the mold contamination in the tower elevator shaft and its preparation of a moisture assessment report.the faa hired veritas to address the contamination in the tower elevator shaft and to retain a cih.
plaintiffs claims against each of these defendants simply allege that they negligently performed their faa contracts.in essence,their failure to perform did not create a new hazard they merely left alone an existing mold hazard,or allowed contemplated mold hazards to manifest themselves.see banaszak,at no duty to plaintiff when she stepped on an inadequate piece of plywood covering a wellway because proper wellway covering subject of contract mierzejewski,at no new hazard despite hazardously displaced snow because snow removal subject of contract thacker,wl,at no new hazard because mold remediation was subject of contract crespo,wl,at no new hazard because metal working fluid maintenance subject of contract and irrer,wl,at no new hazard where metal working fluid toxins permeated plant because metal working fluid maintenance was subject of contract.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not err in ruling that plaintiffs complaint failed to assert a duty that was separate and distinct from,safe,jacobs,and bureau veritas contractual obligations under their faa contracts.put another way,under fultz,these defendants did not assume the faa duty to provide a reasonably safe working environment when the faa hired them to provide consulting services.
next,we must analyze whether plaintiffs complaint avers that mis or coach created a new hazard that gave rise to a duty that was separate and distinct from their duties.plaintiffs argue that mis negligent containment and mold disposal procedures created a new hazard,namely,severe however,pursuant to fultz,banaszak,mierzejewski,and thacker,mis failure to properly contain its work area and dispose of contaminated mold debris did not give rise to a concomitant duty to plaintiffs because mold containment and disposal procedures were the subject of its faa contracts.see also crespo,wl,at irrer,wl,at.moreover,was a contemplated hazard in its faa contracts.thus,any that resulted from mis negligent performance did not constitute a new hazard as that concept is understood and applied under michigan law.
the faa contract with coach presents a more difficult question.according to the operative complaint,the faa directed coach to spray the fourth and ninth floors and elevator shaft with an approved microbiologic biocide.emphasis added.coach argues that it did not create a new hazard under fultz because the faa had full knowledge of what biocide it would use and where it was going to be applied.
however,plaintiffs complaint avers that coach used an unmarked container to spray octanol,undecone,dodecane,and tridecane,allegedly dangerous chemicals,which can cause numerous health hazards,including lung damage,drowsiness,dizziness,pulmonary edema,asphyxiation,vomiting,and death.when coach sprayed the unmarked substance,it caused a employee evacuation and sent several plaintiffs to the hospital.the hazard of exposure to toxic biocide was not the subject of the faa contract with coach.thus,plaintiffs claim against coach is distinguishable from crespo because the alleged hazard is not an exposure to toxic mold,but an exposure to toxic biocide.see generally,katzman orion constr,wl,at,unpublished per curium opinion ruling that contractor owed plaintiff a duty that was separate and distinct from its snow removal duties because it left behind an unusually large piece of rock salt that was concealed under two inches of snow,causing plaintiff to trip and injure herself.court ruled that rock salt hazard was a new hazard because alleged hazard did not involve a snow hazard,but the introduction of a latent and unusual piece of rock salt.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor,the toxic biocide sprayed by coach was not an approved microbiologic biocide and,thus,was not the subject of its contract with the faa.emphasis added see banaszak,at devaugh,at.moreover,exposure to toxic biocide was not a contemplated hazard in coach contract with the faa.
for these reasons,we hold that coach use of this allegedly unapproved biocide gave rise to a duty under michigan law to foreseeable persons,such as these plaintiffs,that was separate and distinct from its contract with the faa.therefore,we conclude that under the fultz rule of law,the district court erred by dismissing coach from this action.see reed shurlow,wl,at,acknowledging that,the law continues to provide,in certain circumstances,for third party liability arising from negligent performance of contractual duties.
plaintiffs also argue that a special relationship existed between plaintiffs and defendants under michigan law that created a duty that was separate and distinct from defendants contractual duties.specifically,plaintiffs argue that defendants expertise in the area of mold remediation created a duty owed to plaintiffs as occupants of the dtw building.
negligence law typically does not impose an affirmative duty to act for the protection of another however,michigan law recognizes a number of special relationships that impose such affirmative duties.stiver parker,cir.some special relationships recognized in michigan are innkeeper to guest,employer to employees,psychiatrist to patient,doctor to patient outside medical malpractice liability.id.citation omitted see also dawe reuven,noting that michigan has determined that a special relationship exists in a variety of situations,and has classified the common,and relationships as special relationships.
the duty owed in a special relationship is often based on a two party relationship under which one delivers a service and the other pays for the service.id.at.in analyzing special relationships and deciding whether one person has a duty to aid or protect another,courts also look to whether the defendant created any hazard which did not already exist,or increased existing hazards by either taking or not taking certain steps.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as the michigan supreme court recently reit
