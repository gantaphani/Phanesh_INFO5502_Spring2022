this appeal presents the following question does a plaintiff who alleges he was treated differently because he is latino state a claim for relief under the action provision originally enacted as proposition and now codified in article i,section of the california constitution we conclude he does not,and agree with the trial court on this point.we nevertheless reverse the trial court order dismissing this and other claims on demurrer because the plaintiff in this case has demonstrated a reasonable possibility of amending his complaint and,as we discuss in the unpublished portion of this opinion,because dismissal of plaintiff remaining claims was improper.
facts and procedural history 
plaintiff cesar baez plaintiff and two others signed two agreements forming and dividing the profits earned by two different companies centinela investment partners,llc and centinela group,llc.of the three partners,two including plaintiff are latino the third is black.defendant california public employees retirement system calpers is charged with managing the investments that fund the pensions of california state employees.calpers hired plaintiff and his partners to manage two million investment funds.to effectuate this arrangement,plaintiff and his partners created two new entities that they through the two centinela entities named above with calpers centinela holdings llc,to serve as the two funds manager and centinela capital partners llc,to serve as the two funds investment advisor.
at some point thereafter,the california attorney general began investigating whether calpers was unlawfully awarding contracts at the behest of influence peddlers called placement agents.believing plaintiff to be associate d with several businessmen and individuals under investigation,defendant joseph dear,calpers chief investment officer at the time,informed plaintiff two partners that calpers would not award the centinela entities a third fund to manage as long as plaintiff was still an active participant in those entities.plaintiff subsequently signed a separation agreement withdrawing from the centinela entities,but allowing him to receive his share of the centinela entities earnings from managing the two existing calpers funds.
although calpers had no problem continuing to work with plaintiff latino partner who had no association with the influence peddlers under investigation,plaintiff alleges that calpers and dear collectively,defendants actions were due solely to racial animus namely,an avowed desire not to do business with anyone whose name ends with an ez.plaintiff therefore sued calpers and dear for million.he alleged that the defendants discriminat ed against,or grant ed preferential treatment to,any individual on the basis of race,in violation of article i,section of the california constitution intentionally interfered with the two contracts that created and divided the profits from the centinela investment partners llc and centinela group llc intentionally interfered with a prospective economic advantage by preventing plaintiff from sharing in any profits from a third calpers fund and from other fund management opportunities in texas,michigan and rhode island and negligently interfered with the same prospective economic advantages.
defendants demurred and moved to strike the initial complaint.the trial court sustained the demurrer in its entirety,denying leave to amend on the constitutional claim and granting leave to amend on the remaining tort claims plaintiff filed a more detailed first amended complaint fac his three tort claims.the trial court again sustained the defendants demurrers to the entire fac,denying leave to amend on the claims alleging interference with a prospective economic advantage and granting leave to amend on the interference with a contractual relation claim.
plaintiff stipulated to the entry of judgment as to the contractual interference claim,and filed this timely appeal.

article i,section proposition claim 
the trial court order sustaining the demurrer to plaintiff claim for discrimination under article i,section of the california constitution section did not contain any reasoning,and the parties did not transcribe the hearing on that demurrer.on appeal,defendants defend the order on the ground that section prohibits preferential treatment of minorities,women and other protected groups,not discrimination against them.plaintiff contends that section plain language encompasses both,and thus reaches his discrimination claim.
section provides,in pertinent part,that t he state shall not discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education or public contracting.cal,art i,subd.a.the voters added this provision to the california constitution in when they passed proposition,history.
at the time proposition passed,the california constitution already guaranteed the equal protection of the laws.cal,art.i,subd.a.that guarantee broadly prohibited the state from discriminating on the basis of race,but tolerated programs that granted preferences to minorities,women and other protected groups as long as those programs were narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest of remedying past discrimination.c c construction,sacramento municipal utility dist.th,c c construction connerly state personnel bd.th,connerly.proposition altered our state equal protection jurisprudence by flatly prohibiting the race and preferences that our equal protection clause used to permit.coral construction,city county of san francisco cal th,coral construction see also connerly,at.however,proposition ban on preferential treatment programs is not absolute such programs are still allowed if they favor one sex over another,if tied to a bona fide occupational qualification cal,art.i,subd.c,were contained in a court order or consent decree in place at the time proposition became effective,subd.d,or are necessary to ensure eligibility for federal funding,subd.e.
plaintiff offers two reasons why his claim alleging that defendants discriminated against him because he is latino is actionable under section.he first asserts that section text broadly prohibits the state,while engaged in public contracting,from discriminat ing against,or grant ing preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race cal,art.i,subd.a,italics added.plaintiff observes that our supreme court has defined the term discriminate in section to mean mak ing distinctions in treatment or show ing partiality in favor of or prejudice against.hi voltage wire works,city of san jose cal th,hi voltage,italics omitted coral construction,supra,cal th at fn.plaintiff concludes that section language,on its face and as interpreted by the courts,plainly prohibits defendants efforts to force him out of the centinela entities.
we disagree that section plain language is unambiguous and subject only to plaintiff interpretation.to be sure,section can be read as plaintiff suggests that is,as a reaffirmation of the already existing prohibition against discrimination found elsewhere in our constitution.but section can also be read more narrowly to prohibit the discrimination against unprotected groups that flows inexorably from the preferential treatment of protected groups in other words,section can be read to prohibit only the discrimination that is the flip side of the preferential treatment coin.our supreme court has acknowledged this reading of section.hi voltage,supra,cal th at striking down program because it affords preferential treatment to minority and subcontractors on the basis of race or sex,and discriminates on the same bases against non minority and women subcontractors.
because section language is susceptible to two reasonable interpretations,it is ambiguous.see,ceja rudolph sletten,cal th.when a provision is ambiguous,we may look to other indicia of the electorate intent,including the analysis and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlets.american civil rights foundation berkeley unified school dist.th.it is undisputed that the sole intent behind proposition and thus section was to eliminate affirmative action and other preferential treatment programs,not to reenact the equal bar against discriminating against protected groups that already existed elsewhere in our constitution.hi voltage,supra,cal th at it is clear the voters intended to prohibit preferential treatment coral construction,supra,cal th at official ballot statement indicated that purpose was to eliminate preferential treatment programs coalition for economic equity wilson cir,same,overruled on other grounds by winter natural resources defense council coalition for economic equity.in light of this purpose,we construe section to prohibit affirmative action programs not excepted from its reach and the discrimination that is their necessary,and not to reach the more conventional form of discrimination against protected groups.
plaintiff second argument is that we must adopt his broad reading of section,or else it is unconstitutional.plaintiff relies upon the political structure doctrine,which is an aspect of equal protection that prohibits a state from reallocating legislative power in a way that burdens the equal protection rights of protected groups.coral construction,supra,cal th at hunter erickson,amendment to city charter to require majority voter approval of any housing law,instead of allowing city councils to pass such laws violation of political structure doctrine washington seattle school dist,referendum requiring constitutional amendment to authorize school busing programs,instead of allowing local school boards to adopt such programs violation of political structure doctrine.more specifically,plaintiff contends that section reallocates legislative power by barring preferential treatment programs absent a further constitutional amendment that state and local governments used to be able to adopt on their own.plaintiff reasons that the only way section reallocation of legislative authority can be valid under the political structure doctrine is if section bars all discrimination preferential or not.he argues that our supreme court held as much in coral construction.
we are unpersuaded.coral construction rejected a political structure based challenge to section,but not on the grounds plaintiff recounts.instead,coral construction determined that section did not offend the political structure doctrine because its abolition of preferences which are themselves presumptively unconstitutional did not burden the right to equal treatment.coral construction,supra,cal th at.this is the same reasoning cited by every other court to consider and reject a political structure based challenge to section,coalition for economic equity,supra,at coalition to defend affirmative action brown cir.none of these decisions have turned on or,for that matter,looked to whether section protected conventional discrimination as well as preferential treatment.
for these reasons,we agree with the trial court that plaintiff has not stated a claim under section because he is not challenging a preferential treatment program.
however,the substance of plaintiff claim is that he was the victim of racial discrimination.we accordingly invited the parties under government code section to file supplement briefing as to whether plaintiff could amend his complaint to plead a cause of action under our state constitution general equal protection clause.art.i,subd.a.although a violation of this provision does not support a prayer for damages gates superior court th,our review of the supplemental letters leads us to conclude that plaintiff can state a prayer for appropriately tailored injunctive relief because a reasonable possibility that the defect in plaintiff pleading can be cured by amendment,he must be afforded an opportunity to amend his complaint on remand.
ii.interference with contractual relations claim 
the trial court cited two reasons when it sustained the demurrer to plaintiff claim against defendants for intentional interference with the two contracts calpers was a part of the agreements and could not be sued under the rule that a defendant is not liable in tort for interfering with contracts to which it is a party and plaintiff voluntary decision to sign the separation agreement barred his claim.plaintiff asserts the trial court was wrong on both counts,and we agree.
with respect to the first ground,a party to a contract may sue a third party for the tort of intentionally interfering with the performance of that contract.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,applied equipment,quoting pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d.this tort remedy is not available against other parties to the disrupted contract or against the agents of those parties.kasparian county of los angeles th,kasparian pm group,stewart th,pm group.there is good reason for this limitation the putative tort plaintiff already has a remedy against other parties to the contract kasparian,at applied equipment,at,and the potential liability for breach of contract provides adequate incentive for parties not to disrupt their own contracts della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,tort exists to discourage from meddling with formally cemented economic relationship s.
applied equipment narrowly held that a plaintiff could not plead around the longstanding limitation against suing another party to a contract by alleging a civil conspiracy to disrupt a contract involving that party and a.applied equipment,supra,cal th at.however,the language the court used in describing the limitation was imprecise.applied equipment stated that a claim for intentional interference with contractual relations could not be brought against other parties to the allegedly disrupted contract id.at,but went on to observe that the tort could be alleged against strangers to the contract and outsiders who have no legitimate social or economic interest in the contractual relationship.id.at.this language raised the question can the tort be alleged against a to a contract if that is not a stranger to the contract 
the california courts of appeal have by and large consistently read applied equipment references to strangers and outsiders as being synonymous with,and have entertained tortious interference claims against persons or entities who are not parties to the allegedly disrupted contracts or those parties agents,irrespective of what relationship those might have to the contractual relationship or to the parties to the contract.woods fox broadcasting,th,woods powerhouse motorsports group,yamaha motor th,asahi kasei pharma actelion th,asahi kasei pharma but see marin tug barge,westport petroleum,cir,barring tortious interference claims against parties as well as with a direct interest or involvement in the contractual relationship.
under this rule,plaintiff may sue calpers and dear for tortious interference with a contract.calpers is a party to several contracts with many of the centinela entities owned by centinela holdings llc and centinela capital partners llc.critically,however,calpers is not a party to the agreements that created centinela holdings llc and centinela capital partners llc in the first place and tho
