the board of county commissioners of escambia county,florida the county appeals from a summary judgment in favor of frankenmuth mutual insurance company frankenmuth.the summary judgment order declared enforceable a computer agreement the lease between the county and unisys leasing corporation,frankenmuth predecessor in interest.frankenmuth the district court denial of its motion for costs and attorneys fees.we affirm the summary judgment declaring the lease enforceable and vacate the denial of frankenmuth motion for attorneys fees and costs.
in,the escambia county comptroller,joe flowers,signed a agreement with unisys leasing corporation to lease a mainframe computer.in subsequent years,he added additional computer equipment and an imaging system to the lease under a series of lease schedules.paragraph of the agreement contained a clause,which provided that the agreement would terminate in any given year if the legislative body or funding authority should fail to appropriate funds to make the lease payments additionally,paragraph contained a clause,which provided that in the event the county refused to appropriate the requisite funds,the county agreed not to purchase or rent any substitute computer equipment for the balance of the appropriation period and for one full period following the termination of the agreement.in a separate addendum,the agreement provided that nothing in the lease would be construed to constitute a pledge of ad valorem taxes and that,in the event of default,the lessor had no right to compel the county to appropriate funds to make the lease payments.
flowers made scheduled payments under the agreement for several years without incident,during which the computer equipment was used for a variety of municipal functions,including county payroll and central data processing services,and to service the road,mass transit and solid waste departments.for the years,and,flowers submitted his budget requests to the county and included in the comptroller budget a line item for debt service on computer equipment.each year the county approved in excess of to cover this expenditure without any specific inquiry into the details of the lease agreement.during this period,unisys conveyed its interest in the lease to chicorp corporation,and chicorp subsequently conveyed its interest in the lease to frankenmuth.
in early,the county began studying the advisability of a computer network.flowers suggested integrating the county computer network with the comptroller system,and provided the county with information about the unisys equipment,although he did not send to the county specific information regarding the terms of the lease with unisys.the county affirmed the decision to integrate the systems at a public meeting held on june.
later in,the county lost millions of dollars in bad derivative investments made by flowers office.flowers was criminally indicted for various acts of malfeasance,one of which was his decision to enter into the lease with unisys without county approval.flowers pled no contest and resigned from office.in,the florida legislature abolished the escambia county office of the comptroller,and the escambia county clerk of the circuit court,ernie lee magaha,became responsible for the constitutional duties formerly held by the office of comptroller.magaha and the county reviewed the lease and determined that the county should reject the lease because the unisys equipment was too old,expensive,and ineffective to serve the county needs.consequently,in,the county notified frankenmuth that it would not make its remaining lease payments for that year and that the lease was void and unenforceable because flowers had not been authorized to enter into the agreement without county approval,and he had failed to secure such approval.
in september,frankenmuth brought this lawsuit seeking both a declaration that the lease was valid and enforceable and an injunction prohibiting the county from breaching the agreement.during the discovery period,the county purchased a replacement computer system,and frankenmuth amended its claim to seek only declaratory relief.all parties moved for summary judgment.the district court ruled in part for frankenmuth,finding that although the clause in the lease was void and unenforceable under article vii,of the florida constitution the clause was severable,and,because the county had ratified the lease,the contract was enforceable without the clause.
the county appealed the district court decision and this court certified two questions to the florida supreme court,namely whether a county board of commissioners may approve a agreement under.stat.ch.absent formal resolution and,if so,what standards guide consideration of whether such an approval has occurred and whether the clause contained in the lease violates article vii,of the florida constitution.frankenmuth magaha,so d.the florida supreme court ruled that a county board may approve an agreement absent an express resolution,and outlined a test for determining whether,under.stat.ch,a board has ratified an agreement after the fact the frankenmuth test.the florida supreme court also ruled that the clause violated the florida constitution and was therefore unenforceable 
in accordance with the florida supreme court decision,this court vacated the district court original summary judgment in favor of frankenmuth,and remanded the case for a determination of whether the county had ratified the agreement under the frankenmuth test,and was therefore liable under the contract.on remand,the district court again held that the unconstitutional clause was severable,and therefore did not invalidate the entire lease.the court concluded that the county had ratified the agreement under the frankenmuth test and that,accordingly,the contract was enforceable against the county.the district court further held that neither escambia nor frankenmuth was entitled to attorneys fees.the county now appeals,arguing that the district court erred in concluding both that the clause was severable and that the county had ratified the lease agreement.frankenmuth from the denial of its motion for attorneys fees and costs.

discussion 
i.the county appeal 
the florida supreme court held that the clause in the lease violates the florida constitution.frankenmuth,so d at.accordingly,unless the clause is severable,the lease is not enforceable.the county first argues that the district court erred in concluding that the lease clause is severable.the county further argues that,even if the clause is severable,the district court erred in finding that the county ratified the lease.we first address the severability question.
whether the lease clause is severable 
in determining whether a contract provision is severable,florida courts look to the entirety of the agreement.wilderness country club groves,so d,a contract is indivisible where the entire fulfillment of the contract is contemplated by the parties as the basis of the arrangement.quoting local henley beckwith,so d.on review of a bilateral contract such as the one at issue here,the governing rule is that 
a bilateral contract is severable where the illegal portion of the contract does not go to its essence,and where,with the illegal portion eliminated,there still remains of the contract valid legal promises on one side which are wholly supported by valid legal promises on the other.
williston on contracts,vol,see also vineberg brunswick,cir a n illegal contract provision,or one contrary to public policy,when invalidated,will be severed from the remainder of the contract if it is possible to do so without leaving the remainder of the contract meaningless.wilderness,so d at a bilateral contract is severable where the illegal provision does not go to its essence.whether a contract is entire or divisible depends upon the intention of the parties.ireland craggs,cir.the parties intention is a matter that may be determined by a fair construction of the terms and provisions of the contract itself,and by the subject matter to which it has reference.d,contracts.
here,the fact that the contract itself contains a severability provision demonstrates that the parties intended for the contract to be severable furthermore,the clause does not go to the essence of the contract.the primary promises between the parties remain unchanged in the absence of this clause the county agreed to pay in excess of each year to lease the computer equipment,and frankenmuth and unysis continued to supply the city with official title to the property and use of the equipment for the lease term.in this case,the clause did not go to the essence of the contract between the parties.the essential terms remain intact without the clause and the remainder of the contract remains meaningful and viable.thus,the district court did not err in determining that the clause in this lease was severable.
having found that the district court correctly determined that the clause was severable,we turn to the question of whether the county ratified the agreement.
whether the county ratified the lease purchase agreement 
in frankenmuth magaha,the florida supreme court established a test to determine whether a county has ratified an agreement within the definition of.stat.ch.
first,a board of county commissioners must have the power to approve the agreement.second,a board of county commissioners must ratify the agreement in the same manner in which the agreement would have been initially approved.for example,as we stated above,the approval must be made in accordance with the sunshine law.additionally,where a charter or ordinance requires a board of county commissioners to take action in a specified manner,such as by passing a formal resolution unlike the circumstances here,then an approval must satisfy the specified manner to be valid.finally,in ratifying the agreement in the same manner in which it initially could have been approved,a board of county commissioners must have full knowledge of the material facts relative to the agreement.
frankenmuth,so d at.the county argues that none of the three prongs of the frankenmuth test can be satisfied,and thus,that the district court erroneously concluded that the county ratified the agreement.we discuss each part of the test in turn.
whether the county had authority to enter into the lease 
the county only argument regarding the first prong of the frankenmuth test is that the county did not have the authority to enter into the lease because the clause in the agreement violated article vii,of the florida constitution.in other words,the county argues that it could not have ratified the contract because it could not have ratified the clause absent a voter referendum as required by article vii,of the florida constitution.as discussed in part a,supra,we agree with frankenmuth that the illegal lease term was a severable or part of the agreement,and therefore the county could have approved the agreement pursuant to its authority under.stat.ch.we recognize that in frankenmuth,the florida supreme court indicated that a government entity commits an ultra vires act when it enters into a contract that violates its constitutional obligations,and in this case the florida supreme court concluded that the clause conflicted with the constitutional requirement that the county conduct a voter referendum before entering into a contract that would require a levy of taxes to satisfy its obligations.see frankenmuth,so d at explaining that a city government may not enter into an agreement that purports to contract away the city police powers partnership city of largo,so d,same.however,unlike,where the purpose of the contract was itself unconstitutional,the unconstitutional clause here was not a central part of the lease.here,the lease payment terms and schedule were the central parts of the agreement.the clause merely served as a supplementary penalty provision that was designed to discourage the county from deciding to cancel the lease before its full term.therefore,the district court properly ruled that the county ratification of the agreement was within the county authority under.stat.ch,and that frankenmuth had satisfied its burden under the first prong of the ratification test.
whether the county ratified the agreement in the same manner in which the agreement would have been initially approved 
the district court concluded that the only statutory requirement necessary for the county to lawfully approve the lease in the first instance was compliance with the florida sunshine law.because the county reviewed the lease arrangement and agreed to continue using the leased computer systems at public meetings in may and june,the district court concluded that the county had complied with the sunshine law.we find no error in this conclusion.
florida law does not require that the county issue a formal resolution to enter into a lease agreement.conceding that no rule requires that a contract be approved by formal vote or resolution,the county nonetheless argues that common law requires some functional equivalent to establish that the county intended to adopt the agreement.however,the florida supreme court has not articulated any specific requirement for such a functional equivalent.indeed,in explaining the second prong of the frankenmuth test,the florida supreme court stated 
in its opinion,the federal district court defined approve as to have or express a favorable opinion of or to accept as satisfactory.in addition to the definition adopted by the federal district court,the dictionary definition of approve also includes to give formal or official sanction to.thus,the dictionary shows that the term approve may consist of either an informal or formal expression of assent.
frankenmuth,so d at internal citations omitted.the county voted in june to adopt a computer networking plan that used the leased equipment.whether deemed to be a formal or informal expression,there is no question that this action signified the county assent to the use of the leased equipment.
the county,however,argues that before it can assent to any contract,either formally or informally,florida law requires that the specific terms and conditions of the contract be presented to the county commission at its public meeting.we are unable to find support in the cases cited by the county,or in florida law generally,for such a proposition.for example,the county reliance on hoskins city of orlando,cir is misplaced.in hoskins,the mayor of the city of orlando had signed a lease for an apartment building.id.at.that lease was later repudiated by the city.id.the court invalidated the lease because it had not been made for a legitimate municipal purpose and was thus beyond the city power.id.at.furthermore,unlike the case at bar,the lease at issue in hoskins involved real property and thus implicated specific statutory requirements,including the unanimous vote of the city council.id.while the city council had initially approved the lease unanimously,the lease ultimately signed by the mayor was so different from the original lease as to amount to another transaction.id.at.
ramsey city of kissimmee,so,is likewise inapplicable.there,the court held that the city had not ratified an engineering contract because the city charter expressly required that all such contracts be evidenced by resolution or ordinance.id.at,so.thus,ratification under that city charter was not possible absent formal resolution.there is no evidence in this case that escambia county code requires a similar formal resolution to approve or ratify a contract.frankenmuth,so d at 
we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that the county ratification of the lease complied with the florida sunshine law and that such compliance was the only statutory requirement necessary for the county to lawfully approve a contract.since the board in initially considered whether to integrate the unisys system into its new computer network at a public meeting,and ultimately agreed to adopt a technology plan that i
