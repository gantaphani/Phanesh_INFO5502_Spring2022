in this matter we reviewed the petition,determined it may have merit,stayed the action in the trial court,and requested an informal response.having considered the informal response and a reply,we determined that petitioner sandra hudson may have established a right to relief and set an order to show cause on two of the three issues petitioner raises.we subsequently reviewed the return and traverse.for the reasons we set forth post,we conclude the petition succeeds as to issues concerning the rule set forth in in re williamson cal d williamson,but it fails with respect to petitioner complaints about the people allegations regarding tolling of the statute of limitations.we therefore grant relief only in part.
factual and procedural background 
on december,petitioner,acting as secretary of the board of directors for the palo verde healthcare district pvhd,voted to approve two contracts between pvhd and one hussain sahlolbei.one pertained to surgical services directorship with sahlolbei,and the other was called the surgery agreement with salolbei.the parties agree that,at the time of petitioner vote on the contracts,sahlolbei was renting a residence on first street in blythe,california,that was owned at least in part by petitioner husband.the parties further agree that petitioner received sahlolbei rent checks at times,and that at least some of those checks were deposited into an account petitioner and her husband shared.
as one of pvhd board members,petitioner was required to file,each year,a statement of economic interest form form disclosing h er investments,h er interests in real property and h er income during the period since the previous statement.code.in,petitioner disclosed the first street property on her form and explained that it was her husband separate property.however,her form filings in through failed to disclose any interest in the first street property.
on january,real party in interest,the people,filed a complaint charging petitioner with a single count of violating of government code section,which prohibits m embers of the legislature,state,county,district,judicial district,and city officers or employees from entering into contracts,in an official capacity,in which they are financially interested.code,subd.a.the complaint alleged petitioner had willfully and unlawfully ma d e a contract in her official capacity in which she had a financial interest,and then specified that the contracts were surgical services and surgical services on call agreements with sahlolbei.the complaint also made the following allegation regarding the statute of limitations the crime charged in count was not discovered nor could it have reasonable sic been discovered until october,when the riverside county district attorney office received a letter from marty bachman which alleged potential violations of california conflict of interest laws committed by petitioner.
petitioner was arraigned on the complaint on february.on june,the grand jury of the county of riverside returned an indictment against petitioner.arraignment on the indictment occurred on july.
the indictment contained the original count for violation of government code section and added a second count under the same statute.the first alleged petitioner committed a felony by voting on pvhd surgical services agreement with sahlolbei,and the second makes the same allegation with respect to petitioner voting in favor of the surgical services.in addition,the indictment charged petitioner with five counts numbered through of offering a false instrument pen.code,because she failed to list the first street property on the form she filed in through.each of the counts for offering a false instrument was charged as a felony.
on september,petitioner filed a motion to set aside the indictment under penal code section.as she does in this proceeding,petitioner argued she was not financially interested in code,subd.a pvhd contracts with sahlolbei,invoked the williamson rule,and attacked the timeliness of all but the last two penal code section counts.the trial court solicited supplemental briefing on the statute of limitations issue and made its final ruling on march.although the trial court dismissed one of the penal code section counts count three as,it otherwise denied petitioner motion under penal code section.the trial court agreed with petitioner that the tolling allegations in the complaint and the indictment were deficient but allowed the people leave to amend so they could add more detail to their tolling allegations.this petition followed.
discussion 
a writ of prohibition is an appropriate way of challenging the validity of an indictment after the denial of a motion to set aside the information.pen.code,jones superior court d.on writ review,we ordinarily ignore the superior court ruling on the penal code section motion and defer to the magistrate findings of fact as long as they are supported by substantial evidence.people slaughter cal d.however,review is independent if the magistrate made no factual findings because the reviewing court is essentially deciding whether the magistrate properly interpreted the law.ibid.
all a magistrate needs to find to hold a defendant to answer is probable cause,or such a state of facts as would lead a man of ordinary caution or prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused.people slaughter,supra,cal d at.moreover,evidence that will justify a prosecution need not be sufficient to support a conviction an information will not be set aside or a prosecution thereon prohibited if there is some rational ground for assuming the possibility that an offense has been committed and the accused is guilty of it.citations.taylor superior court cal d,overruled on other grounds by people antick cal d,italics added.
the williamson rule bars the people from prosecuting petitioner for a felony violation of penal code section 
in support of her williamson rule argument,petitioner argues the people can not prosecute her for a felony under a general statute pen.code,because a special statute code,makes it only a misdemeanor to fail to file a form see code,making it a misdemeanor to knowingly or willfully violate statutes,including code.the people respond that petitioner may not invoke the williamson rule because government code section expresses a contrary intent,and they contend any such claim fails on the merits because the elements of filing a false document pen.code,are different from the elements of a violation of the statute requiring public employees to file a form.petitioner contentions regarding this apparent question of first impression are more persuasive.
under the williamson rule,if a general statute includes the same conduct as a special statute,the court infers that the legislature intended that conduct to be prosecuted exclusively under the special statute.in effect,the special statute is interpreted as creating an exception to the general statute for conduct that otherwise could be prosecuted under either statute.citation.indeed,in most instances,an overlap of provisions is determinative of the issue of legislative intent and requires us to give effect to the special provision alone in the face of the dual applicability of the general provision and the special provision people murphy cal th,murphy.
the williamson rule applies either when the general statute and the specific statute share the same elements,or when it appears from the statutory context that a violation of the special statute will necessarily or commonly result in a violation of the general statute.murphy,supra,cal th at.in its clearest application,the rule is triggered when a violation of a provision of the special statute would inevitably constitute a violation of the general statute.ibid.when the general statute includes an element not present in and imposes a punishment harsher than the special statute,it is reasonable to infer that the legislature intended to punish such conduct more severely.id.at.as a result,the williamson rule will not apply when,for example,a felony statute requires a more culpable mental state than a misdemeanor statute proscribing the same behavior.see,people watson cal d.
the williamson rule was designed to ascertain and carry out legislative intent.people jenkins cal d,jenkins.consequently,a defendant may not rely on williamson if there is sufficient evidence the legislature intended to authorize prosecution under both the special and the general statute.id.at see people butler th butler.
in jenkins,the court held the people could prosecute a defendant for both perjury pen.code,and fraudulently obtaining aid for dependent children and families welf.inst.code,because provisions of the welfare and institutions code,when interpreted in light of their legislative history,explicitly authorized prosecution under either statute.jenkins,supra,cal d at noting,among other things,that t he third sentence of welfare and institutions code section contains the statement that any person signing a statement that is declared under penalty of perjury is subject to the penalty prescribed for perjury in the penal code if he or she willfully and knowingly and with intent to deceive makes a false statement.similarly,the butler court,asked to decide whether the williamson rule barred prosecution for both obtaining telephone services by fraud pen.code,subd.b and theft of access cards pen.code,subd.c,found exactly the type of contrary legislative intent as was present in jenkins because an uncodified section of the act that created penal code section stated this act shall not be construed to preclude the applicability of any other provision of the criminal law of this state which presently applies or may in the future apply to any transaction which violates this act.butler,supra,th at.
in this case,the people have charged petitioner with a felony,offering a false document,under penal code section,subdivision a,which reads every person who knowingly procures or offers any false or forged instrument to be filed,registered,or recorded in any public office within this state,which instrument,if genuine,might be filed,registered,or recorded under any law of this state or of the united states,is guilty of a felony.petitioner argues government code section describes her alleged failure to disclose all of her assets and investments in her form with better particularity.that statute states every person who holds an office specified in section shall,each year at a time specified by commission regulations,file a statement disclosing his investments,his interests in real property and his income during the period since the previous statement filed under this section or section.the statement shall include any investments and interest in real property held at any time during the period covered by the statement,whether or not they are still held at the time of filing.government code section is part of the political reform act,and government code section states any person who knowingly or willfully violates any provision of the political reform act is guilty of a misdemeanor.
citing the exception to the williamson rule on which jenkins and butler rely,the people cite government code section as proof that the legislature intended to allow prosecution of the acts petitioner allegedly committed as either a misdemeanor violation of the political reform act code,subd.a or a felony violation of the rule against offering a false document pen.code.government code section nothing in this chapter shall exempt any person from applicable provisions of any other laws of this state.this rather indefinite language is a far cry from the overwhelming indications of a contrary legislative intent that were present in jenkins and butler.jenkins,supra,cal d at see butler,supra,th at.the special statutory scheme in jenkins explicitly referenced the general statute jenkins,supra,cal d at in contrast,government code section does not mention penal code section,specifically.the statutory scheme at issue in butler at least stated that prosecution was possible under any other provision of the criminal law of this state which presently applies or may in the future apply butler,supra,th at,but government code section fails to provide any specifics at all about the other laws of this state that might also apply.we can not find that a statute providing so little guidance as to its meaning is an expression of legislative intent to prevent application of the williamson rule,especially when jenkins and butler show how careful the legislature can be when it desires such a result.
if government code section does not prevent petitioner from invoking williamson,the people argue her invocation fails because penal code section and government code section require different elements.more specifically,they contend penal code section requires actual falsification of an instrument,while government code section only allows prosecution if a defendant fails to file a form.we disagree with the people base assumption for the reasons set forth post.
it is true that government code section affirmatively requires the filing of a form,such that the failure to file such a form at all would violate the statute.however,this is not all the statute requires.government code section also demands that the form disclos e his investments,his interests in real property and his income during the period since the previous statement,and that it include any investments and interest in real property held at any time during the period covered by the statement,whether or not they are still held at the time of filing.consequently,a person may violate government code section not only by failing to file a form,but also by filing a form that fails to make the necessary disclosures.
we find the williamson rule prevents the people from prosecuting petitioner for a felony under penal code section because a violation of the special statute will necessarily or commonly result in a violation of the general statute.murphy,supra,cal th at.penal code section applies to any person who knowingly procures or offers any false or forged instrument to be filed,registered,or recorded in any public office within this state,which instrument,if genuine,might be filed,registered,or recorded under any law of this state or of the united states.pen.code,subd.a.as indicated above,government code section requires a form to make certain disclosures regarding the filer assets and investments.the people present,and we see no reason why,the filing of a form that purported to disclose all of the filing party assets and investments but did not actually do so because of omissions is not equivalent to the offering of a false or forged instrument.after all,the core purpose of section is to protect the integrity and reliability of public records.citations.this purpose is served by an interpretation that prohibits any knowing falsification of public records.people denman th.a form is an instrument that not only may,but must,be filed,registered,or recorded under any law of this state or of the united states pen.code,subd.a,and we agree with the traverse that a form is filed in any public office ibid.because such documents must be both filed code,and kept open for public inspection and reproduction during regular business hours code.finally,a misdemeanor prosecution for violation of government code section and a felony prosecution for violation of penal code section both require the same basic mental state,namely,that the defendant knowingly committed the crime charged.pen.code,subd.a knowingly code,subd.a knowingly or willingly.
for these reasons,the people may not prosecute petitioner under penal code section when the basis of their allegation is that petitioner failed to list all assets and investments on several form.on remand,the trial court is to dismiss the remaining counts under penal code section.
the statute of limitations did not require dismissal of any of the counts against petitioner 
petitioner asks us to dismiss the first five counts against her because the complaint and the indictment both inadequately alleged tolling of the statute of limitations.the people respond that the statute of limitations is not jurisdictional,at least not in the way petitioner suggests.while we agree with petitioner that the statute of limitations is jurisdictional in some senses see,people williams cal th,we disagree with her implicit assumption that she was entitled to dismissal under penal code section simply because the trial court agreed that the people failed to properly allege tolling of the limitations period.
the purpose of a motion to set aside the accusatory pleading under penal code section is to review the sufficiency of the indictment or information on the basis of the record made before the grand jury in the one case or the magistrate at the preliminary hearing in the other.stanton superior court d,stanton.by statute,penal code section allows an attack on an indictment only,where it is not found,endorsed,and presented as prescribed in th e penal c ode,or on the theory,t hat the defendant has been indicted without reasonable or probable cause.pen.code,subd.a a,b.therefore,a motion under penal code section can not resolve problems not apparent from the transcript of the preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding.merrill superior court th.
in order to attack the pleading itself the demurrer is the appropriate vehicle.people brooks d,fn,disapproved of on other grounds by people whitmer cal th.in fact,a demurrer is only authorized if the defect about which the demurring party complains appears upon the face of the pleading.pen.code.moreover,if a court sustains a demurrer to a criminal pleading,the court must,if the defect can be remedied,permit the filing of an amended complaint.pen.code.
the law respects form less than substance.civ.code.consequently,a trial court may disregard the caption of a motion and instead treat it in accordance with the relief it requests.see,barrows american motors d,treating demurrer like motion for summary judgment due to nature of relief requested county of los angeles th,the substance of the motion to quash is what mattered,not its label.
in this case,petitioner made her arguments regarding the statute of limitations in a document captioned,notice of motion and motion to dismiss indictment pursuant to penal code section.the portion of the motion at issue in this section of the petition made no contentions about the state of the evidence vis the limitations period and instead argued,as petitioner does here,that multiple counts in the indictment were,as a matter of law,outside the statute of limitations because the people had failed to plead tolling of the limitations period in accordance with people zamora cal d,fn.zamora,which we discuss in more detail post.in other words,petitioner called the trial court attention to a defect that allegedly appear ed upon the face of the indictment pen.code,but not one that asked the trial court to review the sufficiency of the indictment or information on the basis of the record made before the grand jury.stanton superior court d,stanton italics added.for the reasons we have just stated,such an argument is much more like a demurrer than a motion under penal code section.
for its part,the trial court essentially treated petitioner contentions regarding the limitations period much like they had come in the form of a demurrer.after finding the indictment tolling allegations were insufficient because the people failed to explain why the alleged crimes could not have been discovered sooner,the trial court immediately stated,i am going to permit the people to amend the indictment to add as part of the zamora allegation the reason why the offense was not discovered earlier.the people have already pointed out and i agree with them that amending an indictment by merely adding or extending allegations tolling the statute of limitations does not change the offense charged,and such amendment is clearly allowable under penal code section.
we find no error in this approach.again,petitioner request for relief with respect to the statute of limitations sounded more in the nature of a demurrer than a motion to dismiss under penal code section.had petitioner expressly presented the trial court with a demurrer on statute of limitations grounds,and had the trial court sustained said demurrer after agreeing with petitioner about the adequacy of the indictment zamora allegations,the trial court would have been obligated to allow amendment unless it found that the defect could not be remedied.pen.code.here,the trial court found the indictment tolling allegations lacked sufficient detail,explicitly stated that amendment could cure the defect,and allowed amendment.in other words,it treated petitioner argument regarding the statute of limitations like what it was a demurrer and sought to give petitioner all she was entitled to expect better tolling allegations.the trial court impulse to look to amendment as a cure for the pleading issues petitioner brought to the court attention was appropriate given the gravamen of petitioner request for relief.
nor do we find fault with the way in which the trial court actually allowed amendment.the statute of limitations for the two counts under government code section is four years.pen.code,subd.c.however,this period runs from discovery,not commission,of the allege crime.pen.code,subd.c.the complaint and the indictment both allege discovery occurred on october.to be timely,the indictment needed to have been filed by october,unless some other tolling rule applies.
we agree with the people that penal code section,subdivision b,provides exactly such a rule when it states no time during which prosecution of the same person for the same conduct is pending in a court of this state is a part of a limitation of time prescribed in this chapter.here,the people filed the complaint against petitioner on january.that complaint charged petitioner with one count of violating government code section by voting on two contracts in a single day,and the indictment alleges each of those same votes as a separate count.therefore,the indictment alleges the same conduct as the complaint,and the days the complaint had been pending when the indictment was filed must be subtracted from the days between the october,date of discovery and the june,filing of the indictment.subtracting the time in which the complaint was pending,the indictment was filed days,or just over years,after the date of discovery and was therefore timely.
in addition,we are aware that,if an amendment changes a defect in the way in which the original complaint was alleged but does not charge an offense not attempted to be charged by the original complaint,it relates back to the date of the original filing of the information and has the effect of tolling the running of the statute of limitations from the date of the filing of the original information.patterson municipal court d.here,the complaint alleged petitioner violated government code section by voting on two contracts in which she had a prohibited financial interest.the indictment alleges each of those votes as a separate count under the same statute.petitioner does not and,we think,can not argue that the indictment added any charge that was not alleged in the original complaint.
instead,petitioner asserts that amendment was a legal impossibility because the allegedly defective tolling allegations in the complaint and the indictment mean that t he superior court never obtained jurisdiction.as petitioner sees it,the amended indictment can not be timely by relation back to the original indictment,because the original indictment was filed more than four years after the alleged date of discovery of petitioner committing the government code section counts,and it can not be timely by relation back to the original complaint,which was filed within four years of discovery but can not confer jurisdiction because it fails to properly allege tolling of the limitations period.this argument exalts form over function and rests on a misunderstanding of the jurisdictional nature of the statute of limitations and pleading compliance therewith.
we agree with petitioner that the statute of limitations in criminal cases is jurisdictional in some respects.see,people mcgee cal d mcgee,overruled on other grounds by cowan superior court cal th cowan.for example,in a criminal case th
