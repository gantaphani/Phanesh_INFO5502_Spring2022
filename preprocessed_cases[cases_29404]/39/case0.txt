the united states navy contracted with petitioner company campbell to develop a multimedia recruiting campaign that included the sending of text messages to young adults,but only if those individuals had opted in to receipt of marketing solicitations on topics that included navy service.campbell subcontractor mindmatics llc generated a list of cellular phone numbers for consenting to users and then transmitted the navy message to over recipients,including respondent jose gomez,who alleges that he did not consent to receive text messages and,at age,was not in the navy targeted age group.gomez filed a nationwide class action,alleging that campbell violated the telephone consumer protection act tcpa,b a iii,which prohibits using any automatic dialing system to send a text message to a cellular telephone,absent the recipient prior express consent.he sought treble statutory damages for a willful and knowing tcpa violation and an injunction against campbell involvement in unsolicited messaging.
before the deadline for gomez to file a motion for class certification,campbell proposed to settle gomez individual claim and filed an offer of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.gomez did not accept the offer and allowed the rule submission to lapse on expiration of the time days specified in the rule.campbell then moved to dismiss the case pursuant to rule b for lack of jurisdiction.campbell argued first that its offer mooted gomez individual claim by providing him with complete relief.next,campbell urged that gomez failure to move for class certification before his individual claim became moot caused the putative class claims to become moot as well.the district court denied the motion.after limited discovery,the district court granted campbell motion for summary judgment.relying on yearsley ross constr,the court held that campbell,as a contractor acting on the navy behalf,acquired the navy sovereign immunity from suit under the tcpa.the ninth circuit reversed.it agreed that gomez case remained live but concluded that campbell was not entitled to derivative sovereign immunity under yearsley or on any other basis.
an unaccepted settlement offer or offer of judgment does not moot a plaintiff case,so the district court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate gomez complaint.

gomez complaint was not effaced by campbell unaccepted offer to satisfy his individual claim.under basic principles of contract law,campbell settlement bid and rule offer of judgment,once rejected,had no continuing efficacy.with no settlement offer operative,the parties remained adverse both retained the same stake in the litigation they had at the outset.neither rule nor the railroad tax cases california san pablo tulare,little bowers,and san mateo county southern pacific,support the argument that an unaccepted settlement offer can moot a complaint.
campbell status as a federal contractor does not entitle it to immunity from suit for its violation of the tcpa.unlike the united states and its agencies,federal contractors do not enjoy absolute immunity.a federal contractor who simply performs as directed by the government may be shielded from liability for injuries caused by its conduct.see yearsley,at.but no derivative immunity exists when the contractor has exceeded its authority or its authority was not validly conferred.at.the summary judgment record includes evidence that the navy authorized campbell to send text messages only to individuals who had opted in to receive solicitations,as required by the tcpa.when a contractor violates both federal law and the government explicit instructions,as alleged here,no immunity shields the contractor from suit.

justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
is an unaccepted offer to satisfy the named plaintiff individual claim sufficient to render a case moot when the complaint seeks relief on behalf of the plaintiff and a class of persons similarly situated this question,on which courts of appeals have divided,was reserved in genesis healthcare symczyk,slip,at.we hold today,in accord with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,that an unaccepted settlement offer has no force.like other unaccepted contract offers,it creates no lasting right or obligation.with the offer off the table,and the defendant continuing denial of liability,adversity between the parties persists.
this case presents a second question.the claim in suit concerns performance of the petitioner contract with the federal government.does the sovereign immunity from suit shield the petitioner,a private enterprise,as well we hold that the petitioner status as a government contractor does not entitle it to derivative sovereign immunity,the blanket immunity enjoyed by the sovereign.
the telephone consumer protection act tcpa or act stat,b a iii,prohibits any person,absent the prior express consent of a recipient,from mak ing any call using any automatic telephone dialing system to any telephone number assigned to a paging service or cellular telephone service.a text message to a cellular telephone,it is undisputed,qualifies as a call within the compass of b a iii.for damages occasioned by conduct violating the tcpa,b authorizes a private right of action.a plaintiff successful in such an action may recover her actual monetary loss or for each violation,whichever is greater.damages may be trebled if the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the act.
petitioner company campbell is a nationwide advertising and marketing communications agency.beginning in,the united states navy engaged campbell to develop and execute a multimedia recruiting campaign.in and,campbell proposed to the navy a campaign involving text messages sent to young adults,the navy target audience,encouraging them to learn more about the navy.the navy approved campbell proposal,conditioned on sending the messages only to individuals who had opted in to receipt of marketing solicitations on topics that included service in the navy.app.in final form,the message read 
destined for something big do it in the navy.get a career.an education.and a chance to serve a greater cause.for a free navy video call phone number.at.
campbell then contracted with mindmatics llc,which generated a list of cellular phone numbers geared to the navy target audience namely,cellular phone users between the ages of and who had consented to receiving solicitations by text message.in may,mindmatics transmitted the navy message to over recipients.
respondent jose gomez was a recipient of the navy recruiting message.alleging that he had never consented to receiving the message,that his age was nearly,and that campbell had violated the tcpa by sending the message and perhaps others like it,gomez filed a complaint in the district court for the central district of california in.on behalf of a nationwide class of individuals who had received,but had not consented to receipt of,the text message,gomez sought treble statutory damages,costs,and attorney fees,also an injunction against campbell involvement in unsolicited messaging.app.
prior to the deadline for gomez to file a motion for class certification,campbell proposed to settle gomez individual claim and filed an offer of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.app.to pet.for cert.campbell offered to pay gomez his costs,excluding attorney fees,and per message for the may text message and any other text message gomez could show he had received,thereby satisfying his personal claim,at.campbell also proposed a stipulated injunction in which it agreed to be barred from sending text messages in violation of the tcpa.the proposed injunction,however,denied liability and the allegations made in the complaint,and disclaimed the existence of grounds for the imposition of an injunction,at.the settlement offer did not include attorney fees,campbell observed,because the tcpa does not provide for an attorney fee award,at.gomez did not accept the settlement offer and allowed campbell rule submission to lapse after the time,days,specified in the rule.
campbell thereafter moved to dismiss the case pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of jurisdiction.no article iii case or controversy remained,campbell urged,because its offer mooted gomez individual claim by providing him with complete relief.gomez had not moved for class certification before his claim became moot,campbell added,so the putative class claims also became moot.the district court denied campbell motion.supp.cd cal.gomez was not dilatory in filing his certification request,the district court determined consequently,the court noted,the class claims would relat e back to the date gomez filed the complaint,at.
after limited discovery,campbell moved for summary judgment on a discrete ground.the navy enjoys the sovereign immunity from suit under the tcpa,campbell argued.the district court granted the motion.relying on our decision in yearsley ross constr,the court held that,as a contractor acting on the navy behalf,campbell acquired the navy immunity.no.cv cd,app.to pet.for cert,wl.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the summary judgment entered for campbell.the appeals court disagreed with the district court ruling on the immunity issue,but agreed that gomez case remained live.concerning gomez individual claim,the court of appeals relied on its decision in diaz first american home buyers protection.diaz held that an unaccepted rule offer that would fully satisfy a plaintiff individual claim is insufficient to render th at claim moot.at.as to the class relief gomez sought,the ninth circuit held that an unaccepted rule offer of judgment for the full amount of the named plaintiff individual claim and made before the named plaintiff files a motion for class certification does not moot a class action.at quoting pitts terrible herbst.
next,the court of appeals held that campbell was not entitled to derivative sovereign immunity under this court decision in yearsley or on any other basis,at.vacating the district court judgment,the ninth circuit remanded the case for further proceedings 
we granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the courts of appeals over whether an unaccepted offer can moot a plaintiff claim,thereby depriving federal courts of article iii jurisdiction.compare bais yaakov act,hooks landmark industries,chapman first index,tanasi new alliance bank,stein buccaneers limited partnership,diaz,at holding that an unaccepted offer does not render a plaintiff claim moot,with warren sessoms rogers,ed donnelly enterprises,weiss regal collections,holding that an unaccepted offer can moot a plaintiff claim.we granted review as well to resolve the federal contractor immunity question campbell petition raised.

in genesis healthcare,the court considered a collective action brought by laura symczyk,a former employee of genesis healthcare.symczyk sued on behalf of herself and similarly situated employees for alleged violations of the fair labor standards act of,et.in that case,as here,the defendant served the plaintiff with an offer of judgment pursuant to rule that would have satisfied the plaintiff individual claim,at slip,at.also as here,the plaintiff allowed the offer to lapse by failing to respond within the time specified in the rule.ibid.but unlike the case gomez mounted,symczyk did not dispute in the lower courts that genesis healthcare offer mooted her individual claim,at slip,at.because of that failure,the genesis healthcare majority refused to rule on the issue.instead,the majority simply assumed,without deciding,that an offer of complete relief pursuant to rule,even if unaccepted,moots a plaintiff claim.ibid.having made that assumption,the court proceeded to consider whether the action remained justiciable on the basis of the allegations alone.absent a plaintiff with a live individual case,the court concluded,the suit could not be maintained,at slip,at.
justice kagan,writing in dissent,explained that she would have reached the threshold question and would have held that an unaccepted offer of judgment can not moot a case.at slip,at.she reasoned 
when a plaintiff rejects such an offer however good the terms her interest in the lawsuit remains just what it was before.and so too does the court ability to grant her relief.an unaccepted settlement offer like any unaccepted contract offer is a legal nullity,with no operative effect.as every law student learns,the recipient rejection of an offer leaves the matter as if no offer had ever been made.minneapolis louis columbus rolling mill.nothing in rule alters that basic principle to the contrary,that rule specifies that a n unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn.fed.rule civ.proc.b.so assuming the case was live before because the plaintiff had a stake and the court could grant relief the litigation carries on,unmooted.ibid.
we now adopt justice kagan analysis,as has every court of appeals ruling on the issue post genesis healthcare accordingly,we hold that gomez complaint was not effaced by campbell unaccepted offer to satisfy his individual claim.
as earlier recounted,see supra,at,gomez commenced an action against campbell for violation of the tcpa,suing on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.gomez sought treble statutory damages and an injunction on behalf of a nationwide class,but campbell settlement offer proposed relief for gomez alone,and it did not admit liability.app.to pet.for cert.gomez rejected campbell settlement terms and the offer of judgment.
under basic principles of contract law,campbell settlement bid and rule offer of judgment,once rejected,had no continuing efficacy.see genesis healthcare,at kagan,dissenting slip,at.absent gomez acceptance,campbell settlement offer remained only a proposal,binding neither campbell nor gomez.see app.to pet.for cert.please advise whether gomez will accept campbell offer having rejected campbell settlement bid,and given campbell continuing denial of liability,gomez gained no entitlement to the relief campbell previously offered.see eliason henshaw,wheat,it is an undeniable principle of the law of contracts,that an offer of a bargain by one person to another,imposes no obligation upon the former,until it is accepted by the latter in short,with no settlement offer still operative,the parties remained adverse both retained the same stake in the litigation they had at the outset.
the federal rule in point,rule,hardly supports the argument that an unaccepted settlement offer can moot a complaint.an offer of judgment,the rule provides,is considered withdrawn if not accepted within days of its service.fed.rule civ.proc.a,b.the sole sanction if the ultimate judgment is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.rule d.
in urging that an offer of judgment can render a controversy moot,campbell features a trio of railroad tax cases california san pablo tulare,little bowers,and san mateo county southern pacific.none of those decisions suggests that an unaccepted settlement offer can put a plaintiff out of court.in san pablo,california had sued to recover state and county taxes due from a railroad.in response,the railroad had not merely offered to pay the taxes in question.it had actually deposited the full amount demanded in a california bank in the state name,in accord with a california statute that extinguished the railroad tax obligations upon such payment,at.san pablo thus rested on california substantive law,which required the state to accept a taxpayer full payment of the amount in controversy.san mateo and little similarly involved actual payment of the taxes for which suit was brought.in all three cases,the railroad payments had fully satisfied the asserted tax claims,and so extinguished them.san mateo,at little,at 
in contrast to the cases campbell highlights,when the settlement offer campbell extended to gomez expired,gomez remained emptyhanded his tcpa complaint,which campbell opposed on the merits,stood wholly unsatisfied.because gomez individual claim was not made moot by the expired settlement offer,that claim would retain vitality during the time involved in determining whether the case could proceed on behalf of a class.while a class lacks independent status until certified,see sosna iowa,a class representative with a live claim of her own must be accorded a fair opportunity to show that certification is warranted.
the chief justice dissent asserts that our decision transfers authority from the federal courts and hands it to the plaintiff.post,at.quite the contrary.the dissent approach would place the defendant in the driver seat.we encountered a kindred strategy in bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership.the parties in bancorp had reached a voluntary settlement while the case was pending before this court,at.the petitioner then sought vacatur of the court of appeals judgment,contending that it should be relieved from the adverse decision on the ground that the settlement made the dispute moot.the court rejected this gambit,at.similarly here,campbell sought to avoid a potential adverse decision,one that could expose it to damages a larger than the bid gomez declined to accept.
in sum,an unaccepted settlement offer or offer of judgment does not moot a plaintiff case,so the district court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate gomez complaint.that ruling suffices to decide this case.we need not,and do not,now decide whether the result would be different if a defendant deposits the full amount of the plaintiff individual claim in an account payable to the plaintiff,and the court then enters judgment for the plaintiff in that amount.that question is appropriately reserved for a case in which it is not hypothetical.
the second question before us is whether campbell status as a federal contractor renders it immune from suit for violating the tcpa by sending text messages to unconsenting recipients.the united states and its agencies,it is undisputed,are not subject to the tcpa prohibitions because no statute lifts their immunity.brief for brief for respondent.do federal contractors share the government unqualified immunity from liability and litigation we hold they do not.
g overnment contractors obtain certain immunity in connection with work which they do pursuant to their contractual undertakings with the united states.brady roosevelt.that immunity,however,unlike the sovereign,is not absolute.see,at.campbell asserts derivative sovereign immunity,brief for petitioner,but can offer no authority for the notion that private persons performing government work acquire the government embracive immunity.when a contractor violates both federal law and the government explicit instructions,as here alleged,no derivative immunity shields the contractor from suit by persons adversely affected by the violation.
campbell urges that two of our decisions support its derivative immunity defense yearsley,and filarsky delia.in yearsley,a landowner asserted a claim for damages against a private company whose work building dikes on the missouri river pursuant to its contract with the federal government had washed away part of the plaintiff land.we held that the contractor was not answerable to the landowner.t he work which the contractor had done in the river bed,we observed,was all authorized and directed by the government of the united states and performed pursuant to the act of congress.at internal quotation marks omitted.where the government authority to carry out the project was validly conferred,that is,if what was done was within the constitutional power of congress,we explained,there is no liability on the part of the contractor who simply performed as the government directed,at the court contrasted with yearsley cases in which a government agent had exceeded his authority or the authority was not validly conferred in those circumstances,the court said,the agent could be held liable for conduct causing injury to another,at 
in filarsky,we considered whether a private attorney temporarily retained by a municipal government as an investigator could claim qualified immunity in an action brought under.finding no distinction in the common law between public servants and private individuals engaged in public service,we held that the investigator could assert qualified immunity in the lawsuit,at,slip,at.qualified immunity reduces the risk that contractors will shy away from government work.but the doctrine is bounded in a way that campbell derivative immunity plea is not.qualified immunity may be overcome if the defendant knew or should have known that his conduct violated a right clearly established at the time of the episode in suit.at ginsburg,concurring slip,at citing harlow fitzgerald.campbell does not here contend that the tcpa requirements or the navy instructions failed to qualify as clearly established.
at the pretrial stage of litigation,we construe the record in a light favorable to the party seeking to avoid summary disposition,here,gomez.matsushita industrial zenith radio.in opposition to summary judgment,gomez presented evidence that the navy authorized campbell to send text messages only to individuals who had opted in to receive solicitations.app,at.a navy representative noted the importance of ensuring that the message recipient list be kosher that all recipients had consented to receiving messages like the recruiting text,and made clear that the navy relied on campbell representation that the list was in compliance.app.see also ibid.noting that campbell itself encouraged the navy to use only an list in order to meet national and local law requirements.in short,the current record reveals no basis for arguing that gomez right to remain was in doubt or that campbell complied with the navy instructions.
we do not overlook that subcontractor mindmatics,not campbell,dispatched the navy recruiting message to unconsenting recipients.but the federal communications commission has ruled that,under federal principles of agency,there is vicarious liability for tcpa violations.in re joint petition filed by dish network,llc,fcc rcd.the ninth circuit deferred to that ruling,at,and we have no cause to question it.campbell vicarious liability for mindmatics conduct,however,in no way advances campbell contention that it acquired the sovereign immunity from suit based on its contract with the navy.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit is affirmed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
thomas,concurring in judgment 
company,petitioner jose gomez 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice thomas,concurring in the judgment.
the court correctly concludes that an offer of complete relief on a claim does not render that claim moot.but,in my view,the court does not advance a sound basis for this conclusion.the court rests its conclusion on modern contract law principles and a recent dissent concerning federal rule of civil procedure.see ante,at.i would rest instead on the history of tenders.that history which led to rule demonstrates that a mere offer of the sum owed is insufficient to eliminate a court jurisdiction to decide the case to which the offer related.i therefore concur only in the judgment.
the text of article iii requirement,that requirement drafting history,and our precedents do not appear to provide sufficiently specific principles to resolve this case.when faced with such uncertainty,it seems particularly important for us to look to how courts traditionally have viewed a defendant offer to pay the plaintiff alleged damages.that history which stretches from the common law directly to rule and modern settlement offers reveals one unbroken practice that should resolve this case a defendant offer to pay the plaintiff without more would not have deprived a court of jurisdiction.offers thus do not bar federal courts from continuing to hear this case.
modern settlement procedure has its origins in the law of tenders,as refined in the and centuries.as with much of the early common law,the law of tenders had many rigid formalities.these formalities make clear that,around the time of the framing,a mere offer of relief was insufficient to deprive a court of jurisdiction.
at common law,a prospective defendant could prevent a case from proceeding,but he needed to provide substantially more than a bare offer.a mere proposal or proposition to pay a claim was inadequate to end a case.hunt,a treatise on the law of tender,and bringing money into court,hunt citing cases from the.nor would a defendant readiness and an ability to pay the money suffice to end a case.holmes holmes,barb.rather,a prospective defendant needed to provide a tender an offer to pay the entire claim before a suit was filed,accompanied by actually produc ing the sum at the time of tender in an unconditional manner.bacon,a new abridgment of the law,citing cases from the early.
furthermore,in state and federal courts,a tender of the amount due was deemed an admission of a liability on the cause of action to which the tender related,so any defendant who tried to deny liability could not effectuate a tender.hunt,at see cottier stimpson,explaining that a tender constitutes an admission of the cause of action the rossend castle dillenback v.the rossend castle,sdny same.as one treatise explained,a tender must be of a specific sum which the tenderor admits to be due t here must be no denial of the debt.hunt,at emphasis added.the tender had to offer and actually deliver complete relief.see,at sheredine gaul,dall,defendant must brin g the money into court and an offer to pay less than what was demanded was not a valid tender.see,elderkin fellows.
even when a potential defendant properly effectuated a tender,the case would not necessarily end.at common law,a plaintiff was entitled to deny that the tender was sufficient to satisfy his demand and accordingly go on to trial.raiford governor,see also hunt,at.
this history demonstrates that,at common law,a defendant or prospective defendant had to furnish far more than a mere offer of settlement to end a case.this history also demonstrates that courts at common law would not have understood a mere offer to strip them of jurisdiction.
although state statutes expanded the regime,the law retained its essential features.see bone,to encourage settlement rule,offers of judgment,and the history of the federal rules of civil procedure,nw,bone.these changes,for example,allowed defendants to offer a tender during the pendency of an action,as well as before it commenced.taylor brooklyn elevated,colby reed,at common law,generally no right of tender after action brought statutes also expanded the right of tender to cover types of actions in which damages were not certain.compare dedekam vose,cas,sdny t ender could not be maintained,according to the strict principles of the common law in cases where damages were not easily ascertainable,with patrick illawaco oyster,state statute extend ed the rule to tort actions.
nevertheless,state statutes generally retained the core of the tender rules.most critically for this case,a mere offer remained insufficient to end a lawsuit.see,kilts seeber,how.pr,under new york law,a mere offer was insufficient to preclude litigation.like the tender rules,state statutes recognized that plaintiffs could continue to pursue litigation by rejecting an offer.see bone.
the procedure in rule was modeled after a provision in the new york field code that was enacted in the century.see,at.that code abrogated many of the formalities governing civil procedure.among its innovations,the code allowed defendants in any cause of action to make an offer in writing to the plaintiff proposing to accept judgment against the defendant for a specified sum.see the code of procedure of the state of new york from to comprising the act as originally enacted and the various amendments made thereto,to the close of the session of.the plaintiff could accept the offer,which would end the litigation,or reject the offer,in which case the offer was considered with drawn without any admission of liability by the defendant.ibid.
in,rule was adopted as part of the federal rules of civil procedure,and has subsisted throughout the years without material changes.see bone.as it did in,rule now authorizes a party defending against a claim to serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms.rule a.rule also provides a plaintiff the option to accept or reject an offer.if the plaintiff accepts the offer,the clerk must then enter judgment,but a n unaccepted offer is considered withdrawn.rules a b.withdrawn offers unlike tenders can not be used in court as an admission against defendants.rule b.
in light of the history discussed above,a rejected offer does not end the case.and this consistent historical practice demonstrates why offers do not divest a federal court of jurisdiction to entertain gomez suit.made two settlement offers after gomez sued one filed with the district court under rule and one freestanding settlement offer.but with neither of these offers did the company make payment it only declared its intent to pay.because only offered to pay gomez claim but took no further steps,the court was not deprived of jurisdiction.
although the court reaches the right result,i can not adopt its reasoning.building on the dissent in genesis healthcare symczyk,the court relies on principles of contract law that an unaccepted offer is a legal nullity.but the question here is not whether offer formed an enforceable contract.the question is whether its continuing offer of complete relief eliminated the case or controversy required by article iii.by looking only to contract law and one recent rule opinion,the court fails to confront this broader issue.instead,i believe that we must resolve the meaning of case and controversy in article iii by looking to the traditional,fundamental limitations upon the powers of courts because cases and controversies have virtually no meaning except by reference to that tradition.honig doe,scalia,dissenting.
the chief justice dissent argues that examining whether the requirements of tenders have been met does not answer whether there is a case or controversy for purposes of article iii.post,at.as explained above,however,courts have historically refused to dismiss cases when an offer did not conform to the strict tender rules.the logical implications of the chief justice reasoning are that the rules conflict with article iii and that the constitution bars article iii courts from following those principles.but see colby,supra,at stating that,to stop litigation,a party must adopt the measure prescribed by the common law,except in jurisdictions where a different mode of proceeding is prescribed by statute that reasoning,therefore,calls into question the history and tradition that the requirement embodies.
the chief justice also contends that our precedents plainly establish that an admission of liability is not required for a case to be moot under article iii.post,at.but we need not decide today whether compliance with every formality would be necessary to end a case.the dispositive point is that state and federal courts have not considered a mere offer,without more,sufficient to moot the case.none of the cases cited by the chief justice hold that a retrospective claim for money damages can become moot based on a mere offer.california san pablo tulare,is inapposite because that decision involved a fully tendered offer that extinguished the tax debt under california law,at.alvarez smith,and already,llc nike,are also not on point.both involved claims for injunctive or declaratory relief that became moot when the defendants ceased causing actual or threatened injury.but whether a claim for prospective relief is moot is different from the issue in this case,which involves claims for damages to remedy past harms.see,parents involved in community schools seattle school dist,plaintiff sought damages in her complaint,which is sufficient to preserve our ability to consider the question alvarez,supra,at suggesting that a continuing controversy over damages would mean that the case was not moot.
as explained above,i would follow history and tradition in construing article iii,and so i find that mere offers did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction.accordingly,i concur in the judgment only.
roberts,dissenting 
company,petitioner jose gomez 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
chief justice roberts,with whom justice scalia and justice alito join,dissenting.
this case is straightforward.jose gomez alleges that the marketing firm campbell sent him text messages without his permission,and he requests relief under the telephone consumer protection act.that act permits consumers to recover statutory damages for unauthorized text messages.based on gomez allegations,the maximum that he could recover under the act is per text message,plus the costs of filing suit.campbell has offered to pay gomez that amount,but it turns out he wants more.he wants a federal court to say he is right.
the problem for gomez is that the federal courts exist to resolve real disputes,not to rule on a plaintiff entitlement to relief already there for the taking.as this court has said,n o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.raines byrd,quoting simon eastern.welfare rights organization.if there is no actual case or controversy,the lawsuit is moot,and the power of the federal courts to declare the law has come to an end.here,the district court found that campbell agreed to fully satisfy gomez claims.that makes the case moot,and gomez is not entitled to a ruling on the merits of a moot case.
i respectfully dissent.
in,president george washington sent a letter to chief justice john jay and the associate justices of the supreme court,asking for the opinion of the court on the rights and obligations of the united states with respect to the war between great britain and france.the supreme court politely but firmly refused the request,concluding that the lines of separation drawn by the constitution between the three departments of the government prohibit the federal courts from issuing such advisory opinions.correspondence and public papers of john jay johnston ed.
that prohibition has remained the oldest and most consistent thread in the federal law of justiciability.flast cohen,internal quotation marks omitted.and for good reason.it is derived from article iii of the constitution,which limits the authority of the federal courts to the adjudication of cases or controversies.art.iii.the case or controversy requirement is at once an important check on the powers of the federal judiciary and the source of those powers.in marbury madison,cranch,chief justice marshall established that it is the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.not because there is a provision in the constitution that says so there is.instead,the federal courts wield that power because they have to decide cases and controversies,and t hose who apply a rule to particular cases,must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.ibid.federal courts may exercise their authority only in the last resort,and as a necessity in the determination of real,earnest and vital controversy between individuals.chicago grand trunk wellman,see also allen wright.if a dispute is not a proper case or controversy,the courts have no business deciding it,or expounding the law in the course of doing so.daimlerchrysler cuno.
a case or controversy exists when both the plaintiff and the defendant have a personal stake in the lawsuit.camreta greene.a plaintiff demonstrates a personal stake by establishing standing to sue,which requires a personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.allen,at.a defendant demonstrates a personal stake through an ongoing interest in the dispute.camreta,at.
the personal stake requirement persists through every stage of the lawsuit.it is not enough that a dispute was very much alive when suit was filed the parties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit to prevent the case from becoming moot.lewis continental bank,internal quotation marks omitted.if either the plaintiff or the defendant ceases to have a concrete interest in the outcome of the litigation,there is no longer a live case or controversy.a federal court that decides the merits of such a case runs afoul of the prohibition on advisory opinions.
applying those basic principles to this case,it is clear that the lawsuit is moot.all agree that at the time gomez filed suit,he had a personal stake in the litigation.in his complaint,gomez alleged that he suffered an injury in fact when he received unauthorized text messages from campbell.to remedy that injury,he requested in statutory damages for each unauthorized text message.it was later determined that he received only one text message.
what happened next,however,is critical after gomez initial legal volley,campbell did not return fire.instead,campbell responded to the complaint with a freestanding offer to pay gomez the maximum amount that he could recover under the statute per unauthorized text message,plus court costs.campbell also made an offer of judgment on the same terms under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which permits a defendant to recover certain attorney fees if the rule offer is unaccepted and the plaintiff later recovers no more than the amount of the offer.crucially,the district court found that the parties do not dispute that campbell rule offer reflecting the same terms as the freestanding offer would have fully satisfied the individual claims asserted,or that could have been asserted,by gomez.supp,cd cal.
when a plaintiff files suit seeking redress for an alleged injury,and the defendant agrees to fully redress that injury,there is no longer a case or controversy for purposes of article iii.after all,if the defendant is willing to remedy the plaintiff injury without forcing him to litigate,the plaintiff can not demonstrate an injury in need of redress by the court,and the defendant interests are not adverse to the plaintiff.at that point,there is no longer any necessity to expound and interpret the law,marbury,cranch,at,and the federal courts lack authority to hear the case.that is exactly what happened here once campbell offered to fully remedy gomez injury,there was no longer any necessity for the district court to hear the merits of his case,rendering the lawsuit moot 
it is true that although campbell has offered gomez full relief,campbell has not yet paid up.that does not affect the mootness inquiry under the facts of this case.campbell is a multimillion dollar company,and the settlement offer here is for a few thousand dollars.the settlement offer promises prompt payment,app.to pet.for cert,and it would be mere pettifoggery to argue that campbell might not make good on that promise.in any event,to the extent there is a question whether campbell is willing and able to pay,there is an easy answer have the firm deposit a certified check with the trial court.
the court today holds that gomez lawsuit is not moot.according to the court,an unaccepted settlement offer like any unaccepted contract offer is a legal nullity,with no operative effect.ante,at quoting genesis healthcare symczyk,kagan,dissenting slip,at.and so,the court concludes,if a plaintiff does not feel like accepting the defendant complete offer of relief,the lawsuit can not be moot because it is as if no offer had ever been made.
but a plaintiff is not the judge of whether federal litigation is necessary,and a mere desire that there be federal litigation for whatever reason does not make it necessary.when a lawsuit is filed,it is up to the federal court to determine whether a concrete case or controversy exists between the parties.that remains true throughout the litigation.article iii does not require the parties to affirmatively agree on a settlement before a case becomes moot.this court has long held that when a defendant unilaterally remedies the injuries of the plaintiff,the case is moot even if the plaintiff disagrees and refuses to settle the dispute,and even if the defendant continues to deny liability.
in california san pablo tulare,the state of california brought suit against a railroad company for back taxes.before oral argument in this court,the railroad offered to pay california the entire sum at issue,together with interest,penalties and costs.at.although california continued to litigate the case despite the railroad offer of complete relief,the court concluded that the offer to pay the full sum,in addition to the deposit of the money in a bank,which by a statute of the state ha s the same effect as actual payment and receipt of the money,mooted the case,at.
the court grounded its decision in san pablo on the prohibition against advisory opinions,explaining that the court is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare,for the government of future cases,principles or rules of law which can not affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case.ibid.although the majority here places great weight on gomez rejection of campbell offer of complete relief,san pablo did not consider the agreement of the parties to be relevant to the question of mootness.as the court said then,n o stipulation of parties or counsel,whether in the case before the court or in any other case,can enlarge the power,or affect the duty,of the court.ibid.
more recently,in alvarez smith,the court found that a plaintiff refusal to settle a case did not prevent it from becoming moot.in alvarez,chicago police officers had seized vehicles and cash from six individuals.the individuals filed suit against the city and two officials,claiming that they were entitled to a timely hearing to seek the return of their property.the court of appeals ruled for the plaintiffs,and this court granted certiorari.
at oral argument,the parties informed the court that the cars and some of the cash had been returned,and that the plaintiffs no longer sought the return of the remainder of the cash,at.nevertheless,the plaintiffs much like gomez continue d to dispute the lawfulness of the state hearing procedures.at.although the plaintiffs refused to settle the case,and the defendants would not concede that the hearing procedures were unlawful,the court held that the case was moot.as the court explained,the dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the plaintiffs particular legal rights,and a dispute solely about the meaning of a law,abstracted from any concrete actual or threatened harm,falls outside the scope of the constitutional words cases and controversies.ibid.
the court reached a similar conclusion in already,llc nike.in that case,nike filed suit alleging that two of already athletic shoes violated nike air force trademark.in response,already filed a counterclaim alleging that nike trademark was invalid.instead of litigating the counterclaim,nike issued a unilateral covenant not to sue already.in that covenant,nike unconditionally and irrevocably promised not to raise any trademark or unfair competition claims against already based on its current shoe designs or any future colorable imitations of those designs,at slip,at.nike did not,however,admit that its trademark was invalid.after issuing the covenant,nike asked the district court to dismiss the counterclaim as moot,at slip,at.
already did not agree to nike covenant,and it did not view the covenant as sufficient to protect it from future trademark litigation.already argued that without judicial resolution of the dispute,nike trademarks would hang over already operations like a damoclean sword.at slip,at.this court disagreed and dismissed the suit.it found that because nike had demonstrated that the covenant encompasses all of nike allegedly unlawful conduct,and that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to recur,the counterclaim was moot,at slip,at.
these precedents reflect an important constitutional principle the agreement of the plaintiff is not required to moot a case.in san pablo,california did not accept the railroad money in exchange for settling the state legal claims in alvarez,the plaintiffs did not receive their cars and cash in return for an agreement to stop litigating the case and in already,the eponymous shoe company never agreed to nike covenant not to sue.in each of those cases,despite the plaintiff desire not to settle,the court held that the lawsuit was moot.
the majority attempts to distinguish these precedents by emphasizing that the plaintiffs in all three cases received complete relief,but that is not the point.i had thought that the theory of the court opinion was that acceptance is required before complete relief will moot a case.but consider the majority discussion of already what did nike covenant do it afforded already blanket protection from future trademark litigation.ante,at.what happened as a result of this complete relief the risk that underpinned already standing thus ceased to exist.ibid.even though what even though nike covenant was unilateral,and not accepted by already.ibid.
the majority is correct that because gomez did not accept campbell settlement,it is a legal nullity as a matter of contract law.the question,however,is not whether there is a contract it is whether there is a case or controversy under article iii if the defendant is willing to give the plaintiff everything he asks for,there is no case or controversy to adjudicate,and the lawsuit is moot 
the case or controversy requirement serves an essential purpose it ensures that the federal courts expound the law only in the last resort,and as a necessity.allen,at internal quotation marks omitted.it is the necessity of resolving a live dispute that reconciles the exercise of profound power by unelected judges with the principles of,ensuring adherence to the proper and properly limited role of the courts in a democratic society.at internal quotation marks omitted.
there is no such necessity here.as the district court found,campbell offered gomez full relief.although gomez nonetheless wants to continue litigating,the issue is not what the plaintiff wants,but what the federal courts may do.it is up to those courts to decide whether each party continues to have the requisite personal stake in the lawsuit,and if not,to dismiss the case as moot.the court today takes that important responsibility away from the federal courts and hands it to the plaintiff.
