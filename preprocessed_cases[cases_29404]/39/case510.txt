on march,the united states court of federal claims issued an order imposing sanctions on michael kiely for breach of the duty of candor under rule of the court rules.kiely represents the government in a contract dispute between industry associates,llc and the united states postal service.sued the government in the court of federal claims for unpaid electric charges under a real estate lease between and the postal service.the government counterclaimed against for unauthorized excess electric charges.moved to dismiss the counterclaim as untimely.during the course of a telephonic hearing on motion,the court became concerned that kiely had breached his duty of candor to the court by misleading it about the date on which the government learned the facts on which its counterclaim was based.the court expressed its concern in the form of an order directed to kiely to show cause why he has not violated rule b of the rules of the united states court of federal claims rcfc and should not be subject to sanctions.after kiely responded to the show cause order,the court issued its march order imposing the sanction of reprimand.
kiely appeals from that order.we have jurisdiction over the collateral sanctions order.see precision specialty metals united states.for the reasons set forth below,the order imposing sanctions is reversed,and the case is remanded.
justice stevens observed in cooter gell hartmarx,d,that the most precious asset of an attorney is his professional reputation.a formal order of sanction of any kind imposed by a court necessarily tarnishes an attorney professional reputation.just as it is the duty of the court imposing sanctions to do so only when truly warranted,it is our duty on appeal to review the facts of such a case with great care to determine whether a sanction has been properly imposed.we thus recite the facts of this case in some detail.
the underlying dispute in this case concerns a lease between and the united states postal service of a portion of a warehouse.electricity for the leased space was not provided directly to the lessee by the local utility,but instead was from account for the entire warehouse facility.the lease provides that the postal service will pay,rather than the utility,recurring costs for electricity,provided the charges for the leased space remain separately metered.
and the postal service disagreed about amounts due to for electric charges.when the dispute could not be resolved amicably,filed a claim under the contracts dispute act,seeking reimbursement for allegedly unpaid electric charges.not having received full satisfaction on its claim,filed a complaint on july,in the court of federal claims seeking in unpaid electric charges.
in late august of,management of the government defense to complaint was delegated to the commercial and appellate litigation law department of the postal service,and kiely an employee of that department was assigned to the case.in september and october of,he met with postal service personnel to develop information on which the government would answer complaint.the answer of general denial was filed on october.on november,kiely met with counsel for to discuss possible resolution of the case.during the course of that conversation,counsel for described the practice by which sent electric bills to its various tenants.counsel for informed kiely that practice was to add a fifteen percent surcharge to each electric bill.kiely thus learned that the government might have a counterclaim to recoup surcharges previously collected by.
kiely considered it necessary to determine independently,as a matter of fact,that had surcharged the postal service for electricity,because federal rule of evidence bars admission of evidence acquired in compromise negotiations.he also knew that before the government could file a counterclaim in the court of federal claims,it first must obtain a ruling from the contracting officer that it was entitled to recoup the surcharges.in this respect,kiely correctly understood the law,as morton united states,squarely holds that the government is subject to the contracts dispute act,and the court of federal claims lacks jurisdiction to entertain a government counterclaim unless and until the contracting officer determines that the government has a claim.id.at.
on february,the parties filed a joint preliminary status report with the court of federal claims,in which the government identified as a factual and legal issue the question of whether was entitled to augment the electricity charges.later in,kiely interviewed postal service employees familiar with the lease who denied knowledge of any surcharges.in november,kiely deposed two of officials,one of whom testified that did add a fifteen percent surcharge to electricity bills sent to the postal service.
in january of,kiely began the process of obtaining a determination from the contracting officer that surcharges had occurred and that they were impermissible under the contract.on february,kiely met with the contracting officer and asked him if he had been aware that applied a fifteen percent surcharge to the electric bills.the contracting officer denied any knowledge of such surcharges.after review of the file on the lease,on april,the contracting officer issued a demand letter to sustaining the government claim to recoup previous surcharges.with a decision by the contracting officer in hand,the government on may,filed a counterclaim in the court of federal claims demanding for surcharges on electricity bills since.
on june,moved to dismiss the government counterclaim,both as untimely and unwarranted on the merits.as to the timeliness issue,argued that the government had known of the surcharges for at least ten years,based on copies of authorized payments of electricity invoices from showing on their face attached to the motion.characterized the government counterclaim as a compulsory counterclaim,which under rcfc a must be filed at the time of the answer.according to,the government lack of attention to the surcharges for at least ten years did not excuse the failure to have timely filed the compulsory counterclaim.
on august,the government filed its opposition to motion to dismiss the counterclaim.the government response was signed by kiely.the government response did not deny allegation that the government had known of the surcharges for at least ten years,nor did the government response attempt to justify the late filing of a compulsory counterclaim based on oversight,inadvertence or excusable neglect under rcfc f.instead,the government argued that the propriety of its counterclaim should be measured under rcfc e,which provides that the court may permit a party to amend a pleading to file a supplemental pleading asserting a counterclaim that matured or was acquired by the party after serving an earlier pleading.
the government thus argued that for purposes of jurisdiction of the court of federal claims,its counterclaim did not mature for purposes of rcfc e until the contracting officer issued his decision on april.the government asserted that the lapse of time between the contracting officer decision and the filing of the counterclaim should not disqualify it under rcfc e.in the course of describing the decision of the contracting officer,which was the jurisdictional predicate for the government counterclaim,the government opposition to the motion to dismiss asserted that the contracting officer has stated that he was not aware of the claim until february of.the government opposition did not mention any of the case history recounted above from kiely first learning of possible grounds for a counterclaim in november of to the date kiely informed the contracting officer of the surcharges.
instead,consistent with its theory that the counterclaim would lie under rcfc e,the government argued that the counterclaim,for jurisdictional purposes,was not in existence at the time the government served its answer to the complaint.response to the government opposition to the motion to dismiss continued to treat the counterclaim as a compulsory one filed too late under rcfc a.thus emphasized that the government knew of the overcharges since at least.further,response informed the court that kiely learned of the surcharges during the depositions of employees on november.
on november,the court conducted a telephonic hearing on motion to dismiss the counterclaim.at the onset,the court explained that the hearing is going to boil down to a question of whether this is a compulsory counterclaim if so,whether it matured in advance of the filing date of the complaint here.and if it did,then questions involve whether or not the safety valve provisions of the rules rcfc f would kick in that would still allow the counterclaim to be filed.
the court focused immediately on the issue of when the government first learned of grounds for its counterclaim.the court stated that it was concerned with the government opposition because,as the court read it,the reference to the contracting officer only learning of the surcharges in february of left the impression that the government had no knowledge of the surcharges before that date.the court itself referred to the contents of the february joint preliminary status report,which indicated that someone in the government must have known of the surcharges.in further colloquy at the hearing between the court and kiely,kiely related most of the case history from his first learning from counsel of possible grounds for a counterclaim,through the events leading up to the government seeking the ruling from the contracting officer.the court expressed alarm that the details of that history had not been disclosed in the government answer to the motion to dismiss the counterclaim,which would have put in context the assertion that the contracting officer only learned of the surcharges in february of.the court asked kiely whether the statement about the contracting officer knowledge left the implication that the first you kiely knew about it,too,or at least shortly before that kiely responded your honor,i did mean to leave that implication.i do know if that is a necessary inference from that.the contracting officer obviously is the person whose knowledge of this is very important.i should assert the claim without him,so he the person who really has to be brought on board and assured that the facts are as we represent them to be.
after hearing from counsel for,the court referred to the invoices showing and announced it would dismiss the counterclaim as untimely.the court reasoned that the counterclaim arose prior to the filing of the complaint and therefore was compulsory,that the counterclaim at least should have been raised on a timely basis after knowledge of its potential source occurred to the government,which looks to have occurred at least as of november of,if not february,when i have a joint preliminary status report talking about this.i do buy the argument that suggests you have to have proof of the counterclaim the court thus rejected the government theory that it could not file its counterclaim without first having a decision from the contracting officer showing a meritorious claim of the government.
the court concluded that the statement that the contracting officer first knew of the surcharges in february of if reasonably read leave s the impression that the first time anybody knows about this was february of.the court admonished kiely y ou have a duty of candor to me,and i am not particularly pleased about you suggesting one thing here in the opposition to the motion to dismiss when you knew something else was true.
the court further specifically addressed kiely conduct,stating i am very dissatisfied with the brief you filed,kiely.i do think that it at least in my mind provides the kind of candor that i expect.now you might have had your reasons but i think that in the future,you need to be thinking twice about making representations to me that you think could be read as inconsistent with what you know to be the case and so i will decide whether sanctions are appropriate 
on november,the court of federal claims issued its order to show cause.the order directed kiely to show cause why he should not be sanctioned under rcfc c for making misrepresentations to the court.
the order identified the misrepresentation as arising from the government opposition to the motion to dismiss the counterclaim,which had referenced the contracting officer as learning of the counterclaim in february of.the opposition had not mentioned the bill which showed,or the november deposition testimony of employee who explained the regular practice of the fifteen percent surcharge.the opposition had also not mentioned kiely conversation with counsel in november of.the failure to have disclosed these details left the court with the impression that the government officials did not know about the counterclaim until sometime shortly before february of.
in particular,the show cause order directed kiely a to file a detailed affidavit describing how he obtained information regarding the subject of the counterclaim,b to provide an explanation of why the information provided in the affidavit was not included in the government brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss the counterclaim,and c to discuss why the court should not sanction kiely for such omissions.
on december,kiely replied to the show cause order.kiely provided the required affidavit,in which he recounted the history of his involvement in the case,substantially as had been revealed during the telephonic hearing on the motion to dismiss.
kiely response to the show cause order addressed each of the factual items identified in the show cause order as the basis for the charge that kiely misled the court by suggesting that the government had no knowledge of the basis for the counterclaim until shortly before asking the contracting officer for a determination.as for the may electric bill showing the,kiely pointed out that the bill had been disclosed by in paragraph of the motion to dismiss,thus providing the court with the information.because the government opposition did not contest the existence of the may bill,but instead argued at length why payment of the bills containing the surcharge could not estop the government from recouping the surcharges,kiely contended that he had not diverted the court attention from the document.
kiely explained that he had not referenced his november conference with counsel because he understood the information obtained at the meeting was privileged under federal rule of evidence.kiely stated that he had not referenced the november deposition testimony because he understood the key event for the maturing of the defendant counterclaim was the contracting officer determination.kiely explained that he understood that the government claim would not accrue until the date of the contracting officer decision,and consequently that date,as opposed to earlier dates,was material to his counterclaim.finally,kiely argued that the omission of the facts showing government knowledge earlier than february of could not have misled the court,as the court was informed by the government in the february joint preliminary status report that it would pursue the issue of augmented electric charges.
kiely response argued that rule sanctions were not warranted in this case for failure to have identified facts that he did not consider necessary or relevant to defendant argument,or that had already been presented in plaintiff motion.under kiely theory of the basis for the government counterclaim,the key event was the determination of the contracting officer establishing proof on which the government could mount a counterclaim that would withstand jurisdictional challenge in the court of federal claims.as the government had not tried to justify a compulsory counterclaim,but instead had sought permission to file a counterclaim under rule e,kiely argued that he should not be sanctioned for omission of facts not necessary or relevant to his theory of the case.and since the court was itself aware of government knowledge of the basis for a counterclaim before the supposedly misleading reference to february of,kiely argued that he should not be sanctioned for failure to mention facts that he considered irrelevant to his case,when such information was already known to the court.
on march,the court of federal claims issued its order imposing the sanction of reprimand on kiely.as a preliminary matter,the court first addressed the test it would apply to determine if sanctions should arise from the facts of this case.the court noted that a split in authority exists over whether an element of bad faith or intent is required to support sanctions when the inquiry is initiated by the court.the court found more persuasive the cases that permit court initiated sanctions under an objective standard of reasonableness the court concludes that it need not find that defendant counsel acted in bad faith or even intentionally intended to mislead the court,in order to impose sanctions,but instead must analyze his conduct under an objective standard of reasonableness,to wit,whether a reasonable,competent attorney,acting in like circumstances,would have believed a filing to be factually justified.
because kiely does not challenge the test applied by the court of federal claims,we are not called upon to decide whether the court applied the correct test.we express no view on that issue and instead review the facts of this case under the objective standard of reasonableness employed by the court.
the court based its sanctions ruling on the misrepresentation perceived by the court in the government opposition to the motion to dismiss its counterclaim.also the court based its ruling on another episode involving kiely appearance before the court in a previous case,even though information about that other episode had not been included in the order to show cause as a basis for possible sanctions in the case.
first,with regard to the misrepresentation concerning the counterclaim,the court cited the facts omitted from the opposition to the motion to in detail held that those facts were,they were determinative under the applicable rules,which govern the timing of compulsory counterclaims.the court opinion states that it strains credibility to suggest that defendant counsel did not understand that his statements on brief that the contracting officer became aware of the counterclaim in february of would mislead the court into concluding that the postal service had only learned of the surcharge a few months before the counterclaim was filed and that there thus had been no undue delay in bringing that claim.the opinion also states that the timing of when the postal service first became aware of the surcharge issue was highly relevant not only to when the claim matured or was acquired under rcfc e,but also to the more straightforward issue whether the defendant had failed to set up the counterclaim through oversight,inadvertence,or excusable neglect under rcfc f.the court then concluded that kiely had violated the duty of candor owed to the court.
the court noted that the advisory committee notes to rule indicate factors the court may consider in deciding whether to impose sanctions,or in deciding which sanction to impose.among those factors are whether the conduct in question is part of a pattern of activity and whether the person in question has engaged in similar conduct in other litigation.the court then stated given this guidance,it is unfortunately relevant that this is not the first,but the second time that defendant counsel has had difficulties with candor before the undersigned.
in wallace,united states,kiely then an attorney with the justice department represented the government before the court of federal claims.during the course of trial in that case,kiely sought to introduce a document that had not previously been identified.the issue of when kiely actually knew of the existence of the document was raised by the court.the court expressed concern that the document might have been subject to a discovery request and that its admission might violate pretrial procedures for the case.kiely was ordered to file an affidavit explaining the facts surrounding his discovery of the missing document.
in the order imposing sanctions on kiely in this case,the court explained that it was not satisfied with the affidavit filed by kiely in the previous case.the court noted that its show cause order had not cited the previous incident,stating that the court does not read rcfc c b as requiring it to describe in its order every factor that might impact its decision to impose sanctions.
we review an order imposing sanctions under the abuse of discretion standard.precision specialty metals,united states,citing cooter gell,at.a court abuses its discretion if the order imposing sanctions is based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.id.
rcfc b,which is identical to rule of the rules of civil procedure,concerns representations to court.subsection b specifies that by presenting a pleading the attorney is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,the allegations and other factual contentions in the pleading have evidentiary support and the denials of factual contentions in the pleading have evidentiary support.
in this case,the issue of compliance with rcfc was initiated by the court under rcfc c b,which provides that o n its own initiative,the court may enter an order describing the specific conduct that appears to violate subsection b and directing an attorney,law firm,or party to show cause why it has not violated subdivision b with respect thereto.
kiely contends,for two independent reasons,that the court of federal claims abused its discretion in entering the sanctions order in this case.first,kiely argues as a matter of law that he was entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard before he could be sanctioned at least in part because of previous conduct of concern to the court but not identified in the show cause order.
second,he argues that the court lacked grounds to sanction him for alleged omissions in the government response to the motion to dismiss its counterclaim.on this issue,kiely sees error in what he describes as a mixed question of fact and law.we address each issue in turn.
when sanctions are initiated by the court,rcfc c b requires the court to give notice of the specific conduct that appears to violate subdivision b,and thus to provide an opportunity for the party to show cause why no sanction for the stated conduct is warranted.when a person is charged with sanctionable conduct under rule,the person must have an opportunity in the rule proceeding to respond to the challenge.failure to identify conduct that underlies the sanctions order is reversible error,as a matter of law.in re deville,cir due process requires advance notice of exactly which conduct was alleged to be sanctionable anjelino new york times,cir the requisite notice must be particularized so that a party is aware of the particular factors that he must address if he is to avoid sanctions.nuwesra merrill lynch,fenner smith,cir per curiam reversing sanctions that were primarily based on conduct not identified in show cause order thornton general motors,cir per curiam reversing rule sanction where counsel was not provided with notice of specific conduct at issue.
kiely conduct in the wallace case is revealed from the complete transcripts of that proceeding,which this court has obtained and reviewed.on may,at trial in new orleans,kiely sought to introduce by way of rebuttal a daily report document exhibit while examining the plaintiff key officer.the court questioned when kiely had come into possession of the document.kiely responded i think about two weeks ago.trial transcript at.the court pressed kiely further as to the date on which he had discovered the existence of the daily report.kiely responded your honor,i could give you an exact date.it within the last month.id.at.neither party could recall whether the document in question had been subject to a discovery order,and out of caution,the court struck the document from evidence.id.at.later in the hearing on the same day,the court returned to the issue of exhibit.at that time,the court asked the plaintiff to determine if the docum
