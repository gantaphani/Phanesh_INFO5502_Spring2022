following the termination of a military supply contract,appellant raytheon company sought an increase in the total price of the contract to provide a basis for a later claim of termination damages.dissatisfied with the decision of the contracting officer,raytheon appealed to the armed services board of contract appeals.before the board,raytheon argued that the total price of the contract should have been increased substantially.the board granted raytheon claim in part and denied it in part.raytheon has appealed from the adverse portion of the board decision.
in,ford aerospace communications corporation was awarded a contract to develop the rosette scan seeker guidance section for use in the army chaparral missile.as part of its contract,ford aerospace developed a technical data package tdp,a package of design and manufacturing information that defines the required design configuration and procedures to ensure that an item will perform as intended when it is produced.
in,the army requested proposals for production of the guidance section by a second source.at that time,ford aerospace had not been awarded a contract for sustained production,and it had not demonstrated that the tdp was technically sufficient to allow mass production of the guidance sections.nonetheless,the request for proposals specified that the guidance sections were to be constructed based on the tdp that ford aerospace had developed.in addition,the request for proposals stated that the guidance section is a item.both the army and employees of hughes missile systems company raytheon predecessor in interest understood the term to mean that if an item were built properly and in compliance with the tdp,it would work as intended without the need for additional development work.
hughes submitted an initial proposal for the second source production contract in the amount of,which represented an estimated cost of plus percent for profit.while the initial proposals were being evaluated,the army was attempting to have the tdp validated as suitable for production by a source other than the developer.that attempt ended in failure when the validation contractor reported that it could not validate the tdp.the validation contractor noted that,along with other problems,engineering changes developed for the validation effort would require that portions of the guidance section be redesigned to meet specifications.
ford aerospace alerted the army to problems with the development effort.it explained that the tdp was still in an immature status,in part because requests for engineering changes had not yet been incorporated into the tdp,some of which represented significant design changes.although the request for proposals characterized the guidance section as a item,the army acknowledged a week before the request for proposals was issued that the tdp was not fully mature.
unaware of the problems with the tdp,hughes prepared its best and final offer for the second source production contract,estimating the total contract price for producing units to be,including profit.the price hughes actually submitted as its best and final offer was lower,however,because senior management at hughes directed that the offer be reduced by million.as a result,hughes bid the contract at.the board found that the bid reduction was not based on a revision of the cost estimate,but simply reflected a decision by hughes senior management to reduce the offered price.
despite the failed validation effort,and in contravention of a directive from the under secretary of the army that second source production contracts not be awarded until after validation of a tdp through sustained production by the product developer,the army awarded the second source production contract to hughes on september.the production contract for ford aerospace,which had been intended to prove that the guidance section could be manufactured from the tdp before the competitive procurement of the second source,was not awarded until six months later.
the delivery schedule required hughes to deliver first article test units by may,and all production units by april.between award and termination of the contract,however,engineering change proposals were incorporated into the contract to correct deficiencies in the tdp.although of those changes had no impact on contract price or schedule,the other resulted in a total contract price increase of and a total schedule extension that delayed final delivery until october.the board found that the contract modifications incorporating those changes addressed only the cost and schedule effects of implementing the changes,not the cost and schedule effects of the underlying deficiencies in the tdp that made the changes necessary.
the board also found that in addition to the large number of changes that were necessary to correct specific deficiencies in the tdp,hughes had very low production yields that were caused in part by those deficiencies.the expected yield on a missile guidance section is approximately percent.in april,however,hughes and loral the to ford aerospace reported yields on their production contracts of and percent,respectively.the board found that the low yields and increased costs experienced by hughes were caused in part by the tdp deficiencies,but that problems with quality control and manufacturing processes for which hughes and its subcontractors were responsible also contributed to the low yield and increased costs.
the army terminated the second source production contract for the convenience of the government on january,after accepting guidance sections from hughes.the remaining units were in various stages of assembly at the time the contract was terminated.hughes total cost of performance at termination was.the contract price at that time was.
hughes had previously entered into a separate contract with the government to produce additional guidance sections.the government referred to those sections as spares,and they were to be built in accordance with the tdp and all the changes to the tdp that had been approved at that time.the board found that the solicitation for the spares contract made no representation that it was for a item.to the contrary,the board found that when the final price negotiation for the spares contract was conducted in late april of,hughes was already months behind schedule in delivery of the first article test units under the main contract,and changes had been incorporated into the tdp for that contract.the board found that when hughes entered into the spares contract on may,hughes was fully aware that the was not a item and knew that production under the spares contract would encounter problems similar to those that affected production under the second source contract.
hughes submitted a certified claim requesting price adjustments on both of the guidance section contracts.the claim sought adjustment of the total contract price for the cost growth that hughes had already incurred and for costs that hughes would have incurred if the contract had not been terminated,which are known as etc costs.
hughes advanced several theories in support of its claim,including a discrete events approach and a modified total cost approach.by a final decision on august,the contracting officer allowed on the discrete events claim.the amount allowed was solely for incurred costs it did not include any etc costs.the contracting officer did not allow hughes a price adjustment on any of its other theories.
hughes appealed the contracting officer decision to the board.in proceedings before the board,the government disputed hughes entitlement to any additional contract price adjustments.hughes filed a restated claim,which was audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa.following a hearing,the board held that,based on incorrect statements and nondisclosures by the government,hughes was entitled to an additional contract price adjustment of.the board,however,rejected the remaining elements of hughes claim.
as part of its discrete events claim,raytheon argues that the board erred by refusing to allow in direct material costs for new and reworked refrigerated detection units rdus,parts used in the guidance sections.according to raytheon,the board improperly rejected its claim because the board failed to consider evidence that it would have been necessary to purchase new rdus in order to avoid production delays,failed to make any adjustment for future failures of the rdus during production,and used historical cost data for reworking rdus rather than setting the cost of the rdus based on the latest price quoted by the rdu vendor.
raytheon claims with regard to the rdus implicate a dispute about the records used to assess those claims.raytheon based its estimates on test failure information summary tfis reports,which are engineering reports prepared at the time of a test failure.the dcaa auditor relied instead on raytheon material cost accounting reports,which show actual material costs for repair or replacement of failed items.the auditor observed that whereas the tfis reports are subjective written accounts,the material cost accounting reports are based on accounting records and data and provide a more accurate basis for estimating future costs.
the board agreed with the auditor that the material accounting cost reports were more reliable than the tfis reports for ascertaining both the incurred and the estimated costs associated with the rdus.in the government view,that is a sufficient answer to raytheon various claims.we accept as supported by substantial evidence the board finding that the material accounting cost reports provided more reliable measures of the costs and reworking needs for the rdus.as we indicate below,however,that finding is not sufficient,standing alone,to justify rejection of raytheon claims.
raytheon first contends that because of the large number of failures among the rdus that were used in the guidance sections,hughes would have had to purchase new rdus to avoid a break in production.accordingly,raytheon argues,the board should have allowed an additional for the purchase of those rdus.the government appears to contend that the material cost accounting data yielded higher estimates of rdu production than did hughes data,and that under those higher estimates it would not have been necessary for hughes to purchase the new rdus.that is because the rdus that were already in existence either units that were in rework after failing testing or units that were completed but not yet tested could have been ready in time to prevent a break in production.
the problem with the government position is that the board does not appear to have addressed raytheon argument regarding the new rdus,at least not explicitly.perhaps the board meant its finding as to the respective reliability of the tfis records and the material cost accounting reports to suggest agreement with the government argument on this point,but we decline to make the leap the government suggests.raytheon made a discrete argument that it needed to purchase new rdus,and it is entitled to a decision on that issue.we therefore remand that issue to the board for a ruling.
raytheon second rdu claim is for in direct material costs for rdu rework that raytheon estimates hughes would have had to do if the contract had been completed.the dcaa auditor testified that he anticipated future rdu failures and that he expected future rdu rework costs due to failures to be approximately in line with the cost of such rework at the time of contract termination.following the recommendation in the auditor report,the board awarded raytheon as the cost of reworking rdus that had failed and required repair.raytheon claims that amount does not account for any future failures and that the board improperly relied on the dcaa auditor assumption of a percent future yield on reworked rdus.that assumption,raytheon contends,was entirely unrealistic in light of past experience with the units.the government argues that the auditor used hughes material cost accounting reports and the rework rates at the time of termination to predict the average cost of future rdu repairs.again,however,the board did not address this issue,and we therefore have no basis for determining whether the board agreed with the government argument in declining to grant raytheon a larger award on its rework claim.the absence of any finding on this issue makes it impossible for us to determine whether the board ruling is factually supportable and legally correct.we therefore remand for explicit findings on this issue as well.
raytheon next contends that the board improperly based the estimated cost of future rdu rework on historical costs rather than on a vendor quote.raytheon argued before the board that historical costs would not accurately reflect actual rework costs because the vendor had closed its production line.raytheon also contends that the government had accepted the vendor quote as the basis for pricing new rdu units.the auditor,however,explained that raytheon material cost accounting reports,on which he based his rdu rework cost estimates,relied on historical cost data.in addition,he explained that the vendor quote was merely a single quotation,and that typically a lower price could be negotiated with a vendor.again,however,the board did not expressly address the vendor quote argument.while rejection of that argument may be implicit in the board general finding regarding the repair of failed items,the board analysis focused on whether to rely on hughes tfis reports or on its material cost accounting reports there was no reference to the dispute about whether to rely on historical cost data or the vendor quote.in order to ensure that the board has addressed that issue and in order to facilitate judicial review,we direct that the board expressly address that issue as well on remand.
the government implies that the limited recovery that the board allowed raytheon on its claims indicates that the board rejected each of the arguments raytheon has raised here.while one can infer from the amount of the price adjustment that the board did not accept all of raytheon arguments,those arguments are very specific in nature and the government has sought to support the board ruling by contending that there was substantial evidence to support the specific findings that would be necessary to reject those claims.what is missing,however,is the findings themselves,against which to measure the sufficiency of the evidence.the board must make the appropriate findings before we can determine on review whether such findings are supported by substantial evidence.
raytheon asserts that the board erroneously rejected its claim for in engineering and administration e a costs that were assigned to three cost pools.according to raytheon,the board improperly imposed a heightened recordkeeping standard,requiring raytheon to trace claimed hours in three pooled accounts back to specific individuals.neither party disputes the propriety of pool accounting in general,and the auditor accepted various aspects of hughes accounting system.however,the auditor,and in turn the board,rejected the specific costs now claimed by raytheon.
raytheon attempts to turn the auditor acceptance of the general practice of pool accounting into an admission that the specific cost accounts at issue here were proper.specifically,raytheon asserts that the auditor admitted that hughes pooled the disputed charges in accordance with its disclosed and approved accounting practice,that dcaa was not challenging that allocation,and that the e a costs were chargeable to the contract.the testimony that raytheon cites,however,does not support those assertions.
raytheon challenges the board finding that the hours claimed were insufficiently tied to tdp defects.the auditor,however,testified that the cost accounts did not reveal who was charging the accounts and that he could not discern from the information provided by raytheon that the persons charging the accounts were actually working on issues related to tdp deficiencies.when challenged by counsel for raytheon,the auditor explained that he was uncomfortable with a million charge that i do have any references to who was working on what.later,the auditor testified that he could not determine from the information provided by raytheon whether the allocation of hours was proper or not.although the auditor explained his concerns about the particular cost accounts to raytheon and made a formal request for more information,raytheon never provided the additional information requested.
in response,raytheon argues that the army had already agreed that the additional costs were incurred due to tdp deficiencies.the evidence on which raytheon relies,however,establishes only that the government agreed that additional personnel would be necessary due to tdp deficiencies and that their hours should be charged to the account.that evidence does not support raytheon contention that the particular hours disputed by the auditor were actually related to tdp deficiencies and thus properly charged to that account.
raytheon next argues that there was no basis for the auditor concern about duplication of costs.the auditor testified that the lack of information about who was charging hours to the accounts in question and for what work they were charging those accounts raised a concern about possible duplication of hours.raytheon recitation of the various charge numbers that were pooled into the three cost accounts in question does not resolve that concern.
because there was substantial evidence supporting the board conclusion that raytheon did not sufficiently tie the hours claimed to tdp deficiencies,the board did not err in rejecting raytheon claim for engineering and administration costs.
raytheon argues that the board improperly rejected its time extension impact claim.it contends that the cost of performance must be increased to account for the increase in touch labor rates during the extended contract performance period attributable to program delays.the board found that raytheon time extension impact claim duplicated the costs for repair of failed units that had already been allowed.raytheon asserts that the board finding lacks substantial supporting evidence and that it rests on the auditor mistaken belief that the claim was for additional labor costs caused by defects or changed work,rather than for higher labor costs for an unchanged amount of work.
the board heard evidence from the auditor,who explained that he had identified the exact hours and costs associated with the extended period of performance.the audit report specifically notes that raytheon had already been credited for the increased costs associated with higher labor rates.raytheon argues that the auditor mistakenly believed the claim related to additional touch labor hours,but the auditor reference to additional touch labor was given merely as an example,and even then he stated that raytheon was given credit for labor at its future cost.
the board also found that the time extension impact claim was a total cost calculation that failed to take into account the million reduction in the bid price directed by hughes management.by reducing the bid price,hughes in effect underbid the number of labor hours necessary to complete the contract.as the contract performance period was stretched out due to program delays,those missing hours would be pushed farther into the future,and the labor costs for those hours would grow.the government contends that by claiming higher labor costs for those missing hours,raytheon is improperly seeking to recapture ground lost due to a business decision by its management.
raytheon responds that its calculations eliminated any effects of the reduction from its claim.raytheon notes that it used the number of labor hours from a march estimate at completion eac to calculate the cost of labor over both the original contract period and the extended contract period.furthermore,it points out that the march eac shows fewer labor hours than did the best and final offer of september,from which the million reduction had already been subtracted.
the points raytheon makes are correct,but they do not overcome the board objection.raytheon has not rebutted the evidence that,as a result of the million bid price reduction,the number of labor hours bid for assembly and testing was effectively reduced below the number in the march eac.at a labor rate of an hour,the cost of labor hours is.because the million bid reduction came off the total bid amount,rather than being allocated throughout the best and final offer,it is likely that at least of that reduction is allocable to the cost of labor,thus reducing the number of labor hours effectively bid as opposed to the number listed in the best and final offer to fewer than the number used in the march eac.in other words,raytheon has failed to rebut the government contention that it is seeking to recover for higher labor costs based on missing hours created by the bid reduction.
raytheon argues briefly that it should be compensated for the additional cost of the labor hours because contractors should be compensated for all cost increases on unchanged work caused by government delay.again,however,raytheon argument fails to address the consequences of the bid reduction ordered by its management.although the government may indeed be liable for the additional costs of an unchanged amount of labor when the cost of that labor has risen as a result of government delay,raytheon failed to prove that the amount of labor was unchanged.
raytheon next argues that the board improperly subtracted from its claim for compliance with the contract preproduction and production evaluation requirements ppe clause.the ppe clause required the contractor,at no change in contract price or schedule,to identify,report,and correct as directed by the government all deficiencies in the tdp that were necessary to permit quantity production.the clause defined types of tdp deficiencies that were subject to complete resolution under its terms,including typographical errors,conflicts of technical data,problems with tolerance stackup,vendor exceptions to parts procurements,and currently impossible manufacturing,test,or inspection requirements.in its initial proposal for the second source production contract,hughes included to cover the costs it expected to incur in reporting and correcting tdp deficiencies,as provided by the ppe clause.the board found that amount to be a reasonable estimate of the cost of performing the required ppe tasks for what was represented as a item.
raytheon argues that the deduction of that sum was inappropriate because dcaa did not identify a deduction for the ppe clause.raytheon also asserts that the application of the deduction to the discrete events claim was inappropriate because the board found that the government had misrepresented the contract as being for a item,thus giving rise to the unexpected additional costs.
we disagree.the audit report expressly noted that it was qualified by the impact and scope of the ppe clause.the board found that the ppe clause required hughes,at no charge to the government and no delay in schedule,to identify,report and correct all deficiencies associated with currently impossible manufacturing,test or inspection requirements,and deficiencies associated with increasing the percent yield or rate of production to meet quantity and schedule requirements.the government presented evidence that during performance the parties frequently invoked the ppe clause to make changes of the type at issue here.the government systems engineer who was responsible for determining whether the ppe clause applied to proposed engineering changes testified that hughes had submitted more than engineering change proposals under the ppe clause.according to the witness,many of the items included with the discrete events claim were for work covered by the ppe clause.thus,there was substantial evidence to support the board subtraction of from raytheon claim for compliance with the contract ppe clause.
the board did not award interest on the amounts the board allowed as prospective costs.raytheon contends that the board erred in that regard.according to raytheon,limiting the payment of interest to costs actually incurred contradicts the decisions in servidone construction united states,and caldera alberici construction.
