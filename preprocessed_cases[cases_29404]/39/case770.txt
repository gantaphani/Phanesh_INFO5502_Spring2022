in october,california prison system reached a milestone that its facilities were to handle.prison inmates numbered,an historic high greatly exceeding the capacity for which the prisons were designed.it is undisputed that severe overcrowding of state prisons posed a serious threat to the health and safety of inmates,correctional officers,and the general public because it heightened the risk of inmate violence against other inmates and prison staff,caused power failures that jeopardized prison security,resulted in sewage spills and environmental contamination that polluted groundwater and increased the risk of the transmission of infectious illnesses,and required the early release of offenders from county jails because of the inability of the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr to expeditiously move inmates from jails to state prisons.
after the legislature rejected his proposals to deal with the problem,governor schwarzenegger called a special session of the legislature to address this crisis.however,the legislature adjourned without taking any remedial action.
invoking the california emergency services act,et,the governor declared a prison overcrowding state of emergency and then authorized the cdcr to contract with private prisons to house some of california inmates 
the california correctional peace officer association ccpoa and other plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,seeking a declaration that the prison overcrowding emergency proclamation was not authorized by the emergency services act or any other law,and that the contracts signed pursuant to the proclamation violate the civil service mandate of the california constitution cal,art.vii,subd.a,and an injunction prohibiting the governor from issuing any further orders under the ostensible authority of his proclamation,enjoining defendants from performing any inmate transfer contract signed pursuant to the governor proclamation and from e ntering into any other similar contracts,and prohibiting the expenditure of any state funds pursuant to the existing inmate transfer contracts.
after a hearing,the trial court entered a judgment against the governor and other defendants declaring the governor state of emergency proclamation is unlawful,declaring the contracts entered into pursuant to the proclamation are unauthorized by the emergency services act or any other law,and violate article vii of the california constitution,issuing a writ of mandate ordering and commanding defendant arnold schwarzenegger to perform all acts necessary to revoke the proclamation of a prison overcrowding state of emergency dated october,and further command ing schwarzenegger to file a return within days,setting forth what he has done to comply with the writ,permanently enjoining the defendants from by payment of money,transfer of inmates out of the state custody,or in any other contracts signed pursuant to the governor proclamation,and awarding plaintiffs their costs of bringing the lawsuit.
we granted appellants petition for writ of supersedeas and stayed the judgment pending the decision in this appeal.we shall now reverse the judgment.as we will explain,the governor did not exceed his powers in declaring a state of emergency based on prison overcrowding,and cdcr contracts with private prisons do not violate article vii of california constitution.
factual background 
in october,the director of cdcr division of adult institutions advised the secretary of cdcr that a population crisis was occurring in the state prison system and immediate action was required because the historic population high of over inmates in state prison facilities posed an imminent and substantial threat to the public safety for the cdcr as well as the counties of our state.
in january and march,governor schwarzenegger proposed legislation to rectify the problem,but the legislature rejected the measures.because urgent action was needed to address this severe problem in california prisons,and he wanted to give the legislature a further opportunity to address this crisis,the governor called a special session of the legislature in june.however,the legislature adjourned without taking remedial action.
consequently,invoking the emergency services act on october,the governor issued a prison overcrowding state of emergency proclamation,finding that all cdcr prisons were at or above maximum operational capacity,and of the prisons were so overcrowded that the cdcr was required to house more than inmates in conditions that pose substantial safety risks,namely,prison areas never designed or intended for inmate housing,including,but not limited to,common areas such as prison gymnasiums,dayrooms,and program rooms,with approximately inmates sleeping in.
specifically,the governor proclamation found that the severe prison overcrowding caused substantial risk to the health and safety of the men and women who work inside these prisons and the inmates housed in them because,with so many inmates housed together in in large common areas,there existed an increased,substantial risk of violence an increased,substantial risk for transmission of infectious illnesses and an increased,substantial security risk due to problems for correctional officers created by and tight quarters.
the proclamation further found that there was an increased,substantial risk to the health and safety of cdcr staff,inmates,and the public because the severe overcrowding caused electrical and wastewater systems to operate at or above maximum capacity,resulting in power failures and blackouts within the prisons that increased security threats,and the discharge of waste beyond treatment capacity,resulting in thousands of gallons of sewage spills that caused environmental pollution and groundwater contamination which could affect the drinking water supply,putting the public health at an increased,substantial risk.
to address this extreme peril to the safety of persons and property,the governor proclamation directed cdcr to negotiate contracts for the transfer and housing of inmates in facilities outside of the state.
accordingly,cdcr contracted with the geo group,and corrections corporation of america to house california inmates.the contracts are for a term of three years,but the number of beds covered by the contract can be reduced or the contract terminated if other solutions materialize before the contracts expire.
ccpoa and other plaintiffs,whom we will refer to collectively as ccpoa,responded by filing a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.ccpoa did not dispute the facts stated in the governor proclamation rather,it argued that even under the facts as asserted in schwarzenegger proclamation,the governor had no statutory authority to declare a prison overcrowding emergency,and the contracts to house prisoners in institutions were unconstitutional.ccpoa claimed the proclamation was not authorized by the emergency services act because,in ccpoa view,the act is designed to address emergencies suffered by local governments,not emergencies suffered by state agencies or occurring solely on property.ccpoa also argued there was no showing that the emergency required the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions.in addition,ccpoa asserted the contracts violated the civil service mandate of article vii of california constitution.
the trial court held that although p rison overcrowding in california is a crisis creating conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state,which are or likely will be beyond the control of any single county or city in california,it is not covered by the california emergency services act because the emergency was due to circumstances which are ordinarily under the control of the state government as opposed to local government.in the trial court view,because control of the state prisons is exclusively within the purview of state government and not local government,it can not be inferred that the combined services of a mutual aid region or regions will be required to combat this emergency,regardless of the magnitude of the crisis.this holding was based upon the trial court conclusion that t he intent of the emergency services act is not to give the governor extraordinary powers to act without legislative approval in matters such as this that are ordinarily and entirely within the control of state government.the trial court further held that even if the governor emergency proclamation did not violate the emergency services act,the contracts to send some state prisoners to out of state private facilities are illegal because they violate the civil service principles founded sic in the california constitution,article vii,which preclude contracting out jobs that are typically performed by civil service employees.
accordingly,the trial court entered a judgment declaring the proclamation and resulting contracts to be unlawful,enjoining the performance of such contracts and the issuance of other orders pursuant to the proclamation,and awarding costs to ccpoa.
discussion 
to determine whether the state prison overcrowding emergency proclamation exceeded the governor authority under the emergency service act,we begin by examining the provisions of the act.
the emergency services act endows the governor with the power to declare a state of emergency in conditions of extreme peril to life,property,and the resources of the state so as to mitigate the effects of the emergency in order to protect the health and safety and preserve the lives and property of the people of the state.the act confers upon the governor broad powers to deal with such emergencies.after declaring a state of emergency,the governor may,for example,suspend any regulatory statute or the orders,rules,or regulations of any state agency if they would prevent,hinder,or delay the mitigation of the effects of the emergency.the governor also may commandeer or use any private property or personnel deemed necessary to carry out his responsibilities,and make expenditures from any fund legally available to deal with actual or threatened conditions of a state of emergency.
a primary purpose of the act is to ensure that all emergency services functions of the state and local governments,the federal government,and private agencies of every type,be coordinated to the end that the most effective use be made of all manpower,resources,and facilities for dealing with any emergency that may occur.to further that end,the governor is charged with the responsibility to coordinate the emergency plans and programs of all local agencies,such plans and programs to be integrated into and coordinated with the state emergency plan and the plans and programs of the federal government and of other states to the fullest possible extent.macias state of california cal th,d.
thus,the emergency services act makes clear that in situations of extreme peril to the public welfare the state may exercise its sovereign authority to the fullest extent possible consistent with individual rights and liberties the act recognizes and responds to a fundamental role of government to provide broad state services in the event of emergencies resulting from conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to life,property,and the resources of the state.its purpose is to protect and preserve health,safety,life,and property.the act makes equally evident the overriding necessity of a broadly coordinated effort to deal with emergencies,and places the primary responsibility,and the means for carrying out such efforts,with the state.macias state of california,supra,cal th at,d,orig.italics,quoting martin municipal court d.
the governor power to proclaim a state of emergency emanates from government code section,which provides the governor is hereby empowered to proclaim a state of emergency in an area affected or likely to be affected thereby when a he finds that circumstances described in subdivision b of section exist and either b he is requested to do so in the case of a city by the mayor or chief executive,in the case of a county by the chairman of the board of supervisors or the county administrative officer or c he finds that local authority is inadequate to cope with the emergency.further section references are to the government code unless otherwise specified.
subdivision b of section defines the circumstances that must exist in order for the governor to proclaim a state of emergency.state of emergency means the duly proclaimed existence of conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state caused by such conditions as air pollution,fire,flood,storm,epidemic,riot,drought,sudden and severe energy shortage,plant or animal infestation or disease,the governor warning of an earthquake or volcanic prediction,or an earthquake,or other conditions,other than conditions resulting from a labor controversy or conditions causing a state of war emergency,which,by reason of their magnitude,are or are likely to be beyond the control of the services,personnel,equipment,and facilities of any single county,city and county,or city and require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat,or with respect to regulated energy utilities,a sudden and severe energy shortage requires extraordinary measures beyond the authority vested in the california public utilities commission,subd b.
accordingly,as we will explain,the governor may proclaim a state of emergency when a condition of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property exists within the state,even in an area under the exclusive control of the state government,and because of its magnitude,the condition is likely to affect areas within the jurisdiction of local government is likely to be beyond the control of the services,personnel,equipment,and facilities of any single county or city and is likely to require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat,subd b.
the emergency services act does not define mutual aid,but its meaning is evident from the purpose of the statutory scheme and in the california disaster and civil defense master mutual aid agreement mmaa,which was executed in november by governor earl warren on behalf of the state of california and all its departments and agencies,by all counties,and by most cities.the mmaa created a formal structure whereby each jurisdiction can retain control of its personnel and facilities but can still give or receive help whenever needed.this mutual aid system ensures that all of the resources and facilities of the state,its various departments and agencies,and all its political subdivisions,municipal corporations,and other public agencies be made available to prevent and combat the effect of disasters and be available and furnished in all cases in which a state of extreme emergency has been proclaimed.
simply stated,mutual aid is the coordination and utilization of the multiple resources of state and local government to address a disaster or other state of emergency 
a mutual aid region is a subdivision of the state emergency services organization,established to facilitate the coordination of mutual aid and other emergency operations within an area of the state consisting of two or more county operational areas,subd.a.the state of california is divided into six mutual aid regions to enable the most effective application,administration,and coordination of mutual aid and other activities.governor office of emergency services,emergency management in california,supra,at.
contrary to the trial court ruling,the stated purpose of the emergency services act and the language of section,subdivision b do not exclude from the definition of a state of emergency a condition of peril to the safety of persons and property simply because it exists in an area that is,as the trial court put it,exclusively within the purview of state government.the act explicitly applies not just to a l ocal emergency,which is one within the territorial limits of a county,city and county,or city,subd.c,but also to an emergency that exists within the state,subd.b,which includes an area within the exclusive control of state government.
thus,for example,if a fire is raging out of control in a state park and threatens to spread in an manner that poses extreme peril to the safety of persons and property outside the park,the governor is not precluded from proclaiming a state of emergency simply because the condition exists on land within the purview of state government,not local government.
the issue then is not whether the condition is in an area under the exclusive control of the state,but whether it poses an extreme peril to the safety of people and property that,because of its magnitude,is or is likely to be beyond the control of the services,personnel,equipment,and facilities of any single county,city and county,or city and require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat,subd.b whether the condition of such peril in an area under the exclusive control of the state is likely to require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat will ordinarily turn on whether it is likely the condition will affect an area within the jurisdiction of local government and whether it is likely that local resources as well as state resourses will be needed to combat the condition.
ccpoa makes an unpersuasive argument that the language of section demonstrates that a state of emergency can not apply to a condition of extreme peril in an area under the exclusive control of state government.section says that when the governor finds that circumstances described in subdivision b of section exist,the governor is hereby empowered to proclaim a state of emergency in an area affected or likely to be affected thereby when b he is requested to do so in the case of a city by the mayor or chief executive,in the case of a county by the chairman of the board of supervisors or the county administrative officer or c he finds that local authority is inadequate to cope with the emergency.in ccpoa words,t hese alternative requirements confirm that the legislature had in mind emergencies that local governments would typically address,but that are too large for any one of them to handle effectively.however,the provisions of section do not support ccpoa conclusion because the statute logically applies when an area within a local government jurisdiction is likely to be affected by an emergency condition in an area under the exclusive control of the state.in that circumstance,the local government may request a state of emergency or,absent such a request,the governor may proclaim one if the local authority is inadequate to cope with the emergency.ibid.moreover,as we have already pointed out,ccpoa analysis ignores the plain and unambiguous language of section,subdivision b,which defines a state of emergency to include a qualifying condition that exists within the state,not just within the territorial limits of a county or city.
also without merit is ccpoa argument based on the language of section,which provides during a state of emergency the governor may direct all agencies of the state government to utilize and employ state personnel,equipment,and facilities for the performance of any and all activities designed to prevent or alleviate actual and threatened damage due to the emergency and he may direct such agencies to provide supplemental services and equipment to political subdivisions to restore any services which must be restored in order to provide for the health and safety of the citizens of the affected area.italics added.in ccpoa words,the language italicized above demonstrates that what the act means by state of emergency is a disaster affecting a particular area not a persistent crisis throughout the whole requires temporary supplemental assistance from state agencies to political subdivisions.not so.the purpose of section is to authorize,during a state of emergency,the use of services and equipment of the state to perform tasks ordinarily provided by local government but which local government can not perform because its resources have been depleted by the emergency.the statute can not reasonably be construed to limit a state of emergency to a condition of extreme peril within the jurisdiction of a local government.
referring to section,ccpoa argues that the act assignment of preparedness,mitigation,response and recovery tasks to the office of emergency services further supports ccpoa point.the act contemplates acute emergencies,those that arrive at some observable time be it an hour or a season and do particular harm that the state can mitigate,respond to and ultimately recover from.the argument fails because it makes no sense,and ccpoa offers no other analysis on this point.see atchley city of fresno d.
ccpoa also asserts the act listing of the kinds of conditions that can qualify as a state of emergency,while not exhaustive,indicates that the legislature meant to give state officials power over situations that would be the province of local government but for their magnitude in the particular instance.true,but this does not mean that a state of emergency can not apply to a condition of peril on state controlled property.to the contrary,the plain and unambiguous language of section applies to conditions of extreme peril that exist within the state,subd.b,not just within the territorial limits of a county,city and county,or city,subd.c.
ccpoa notes that every other proclamation issued by the governor since he took office has addressed a situation to which local governments would have responded if the harm had not been so,storms.and each has included a list of specific area s affected,usually by county.according to ccpoa,t his is strong evidence that even the governor recognizes the usual and proper circumstances for the executive exercise of powers granted by the act.again,ccpoa conclusion does not follow from the premise.the other emergency proclamations merely demonstrate that disasters or conditions of extreme peril have occurred on property within the control of political subdivisions of the state and that their magnitude justified declarations of a state of emergency.that those state of emergency proclamations addressed conditions of disaster or extreme peril occurring on property within the control of local authorities does not mean that a state of emergency proclamation must be limited to such circumstances.
thus,we reiterate.as pertinent to this case,sections and permit the governor to proclaim a state of emergency based on a condition in an area within the exclusive control of state government if the condition is of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property and,because of its magnitude,it is likely to affect an area within the jurisdiction of local government is likely to be beyond the control of the services,personnel,equipment,and facilities of any single county or city and is likely to require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat.whether the ability to combat the condition is likely to require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions will ordinarily turn on whether it is likely that local resources as well as state resources will be needed to combat the condition.
accordingly,the governor can proclaim a state of emergency based upon a condition occurring in a state prison.indeed,the emergency services act contains a provision specifically dealing with such an emergency.section states in any case in which an emergency endangering the lives of inmates of a state,county,or city penal or correctional institution has occurred or is imminent,the person in charge of the institution may remove the inmates from the institution.he shall,if possible,remove them to a safe and convenient place and there confine them as long as may be necessary to avoid the danger,or,if that is not possible,may release them.such person shall not be held liable,civilly or criminally,for acts performed pursuant to this section.this section and the plain and unambiguous language of sections,subdivision b and lead to the inescapable conclusion that the trial court erred in holding that the emergency services act does not apply to conditions arising in state prisons.
as we have noted,ccpoa did not dispute the facts asserted in the governor proclamation.at most,evidence submitted by ccpoa showed that overcrowding had long existed in california prisons and that it had caused no curtailment of prison programs,no additional training or any additional efforts to secure the safety of either inmates or cdcr staff in the weeks preceding the proclamation.
for example,correctional officer christopher trott declared inmate overcrowding is a major problem at calipatria state prison but said the problem is chronic and has not grown noticeably worse or better for many months prior to his declaration in october.indeed,the governor counsel introduced evidence that on august,mike jiminez,state president ccpoa,testified before a senate select committee on prison population management and capacity that we at ccpoa have been continually raising issues about prison overcrowding,the severe shortages in prison staffing,the deterioration of prison facilities,and the lack of effective risk assessment for inmate evaluation.in the face of these conditions ccpoa members work hard to manage the increased tensions and dangers that are exacerbated when prisoners are double and triple bunked,when exercise yards and rehabilitation facilities are used for emergency housing and when staff shortages make inadequate inmate oversight and implementation of inmate rehabilitation programs nearly impossible.our members already face an average of assaults per day and are on the front lines of an ongoing battle keeping prison tensions from boiling over and the widespread violence that would threaten the safety of staff and inmates alike.at the same time we are facing a crisis within the prison system.california as a whole is on the verge of a public safety disaster.italics added.
the trial court found that the severe inmate overcrowding in state prisons is a crisis creating conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state,which are or likely will be beyond the control of any single county or city in california.this satisfies two of the three criteria needed for a proclamation of emergency.
the question then is whether the conditions satisfy the third criterion,that they are likely to require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat,subd.b.
we conclude that the facts presented by the governor,and uncontested by ccpoa,were sufficient to establish that the prison inmate overcrowding occurring in october was a condition of the requisite magnitude that,if not addressed,would likely require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat,would likely require the coordination and utilization of the multiple resources of state and local government.
among other things,the governor showed that the state prison overcrowding crisis had already required cdcr to postpone the transfer of convicted felons from county jails to state prisons.consequently,the state had been relying on local government resources to temporarily house inmates who should be in state prison.this was local assistance akin to mutual aid that cdcr was likely to need to combat the prison overcrowding crisis.this fact and the governor showing that inmate overcrowding was occurring in prison facilities throughout the state were sufficient to establish that the problem was likely to require the assistance of the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to temporarily house in county jails the convicted felons whose transfers to state prison had to be delayed because of the prison overcrowding crisis.the governor also showed that delay in transferring convicted felons from jail to prison had required at least one jail to release county prisoners before they had completed their sentences,which,it can be inferred,was likely to require local law enforcement agencies to expend resources to investigate crimes that some prisoners commit upon their release.and it could be said that the dangers posed by the magnitude of the overcrowding made it likely that cdcr would have to resort to the power authorized by section to move some prison inmates to other places of confinement or release them which in turn would likely require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to house and care for the prisoners or to address recidivist crimes has committed by some convicted felons after their early release from custody.
the governor also stated,and ccpoa did not contest,that the state prison overcrowding crisis had substantially increased the risk of the transmission of infectious illnesses among inmates and prison staff.it logically follows that such infectious diseases would likely be transmitted to the general public either by prison staff or persons visiting prison inmates.it takes little imagination to recognize the likelihood that such a spread of infectious diseases would burden the resources of local government affected by the outbreaks,giving rise to a need for the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to assist persons who must resort to public health care services.
and the governor stated,and ccpoa did not contest,that inmate overcrowding had caused prison wastewater systems to operate at or above maximum capacity,resulting in thousands of gallons of sewage spills which polluted the environment and contaminated groundwater,putting the drinking water supply and the public health at risk.this circumstance and the fact that such severe overcrowding was occurring in prisons throughout the state were sufficient to show that it was likely the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions would be required to combat this serious environmental contamination and threat to public health in locations around the state.
because the three criteria necessary to proclaim a state of emergency are supported by the facts set forth in the governor proclamation,the governor did not exceed his authority in issuing the proclamation,and the trial court erred in ruling otherwise.
its substantive attacks against the governor proclamation having failed,ccpoa raises a procedural challenge by asserting that the proclamation is deficient because it does not contain an express finding that the emergency is likely to require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat the emergency.
before a state of emergency can be proclaimed,section makes it necessary for the governor to find that the circumstances described in subdivision b of section exist.but there is no language in the emergency services act that requires the governor to state each aspect of the necessary finding in the proclamation itself.issuance of the proclamation implies the governor has made the finding.therefore,it is sufficient if the proclamation sets forth circumstances that support the implied finding.see martin municipal court,supra,d at.
for reasons stated in part iii,ante,the prison overcrowding state of emergency proclamation supports the implied finding that,because of its magnitude,the condition was likely to require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat it.hence,ccpoa procedural challenge to the proclamation fails.
having rejected ccpoa attacks on governor schwarzenegger prison overcrowding state of emergency proclamation,we now turn to the trial court conclusion that when cdcr contracted with private,facilities to house some of california prison inmates,it violated article vii of our state constitution article vii,implemented by the state civil service act.et see california state employees williams d.
the governor correctly contends the trial court erred because the contracts fall within statutory exceptions to the prohibition against contracting out services ordinarily performed by state civil service employees.
article vii,section states a the civil service includes every officer and employee of the state except as otherwise provided in this constitution.b in the civil service permanent appointment and promotion shall be made under a general system based on merit ascertained by competitive examination.
the purposes of article vii are twofold to encourage efficiency and economy in state government,and to eliminate the spoils system of political patronage by ensuring that demonstrated than political all appointments to public service.pr
