executive air taxi corporation eatc appeals an adverse grant of summary judgment on its equal protection and substantive due process claims related to its activities at the bismarck municipal airport bma.it also appeals certain discovery rulings.the city of bismarck the city and cook leasing,cook adverse summary judgment rulings on a contract claim and a motion for sanctions under federal rule of civil procedure.we affirm the district court in all respects.
eatc is a north dakota corporation that has provided commercial aeronautical services at bma since the.from then until the filing of this suit,eatc was the only fixed base operator fbo at bma.a fbo is a business that provides a full range of aeronautical services,including aircraft fueling,aircraft maintenance,charter services,air ambulance services,and aircraft and hangar rental.
the city,which owns and operates bma,was a limited service provider during the same time period,providing aircraft fueling,hangar storage,and towing services.the private party defendants are,or at one time were,limited service providers at bma.robert simmers and michael aarestad own simson investment company simson,which owns buildings on land leased at bma simmers and aarestad also own aircraft management services,ams,which leases space from simson,and provides pilot services,flight instruction,and aircraft maintenance.steven scherr owns onstar management,which rents aircraft.cook leasing,cook also rents an aircraft.mark fetch and allen sauter provided flight instruction services based out of other airports,but occasionally picked students up at bma,and at various times worked for other defendants.
in,eatc negotiated a lease with the city for land at bma and renewed it for an additional ten years in.the lease required eatc to operate a flying school,charter service,and an aircraft repair station,and to build facilities at bma to provide these services.the agreement provided for low lease rates of two cents per square foot of unimproved property and six cents per square foot of improved property.by,this rate had increased only to three cents per square foot of unimproved property and remained unchanged at six cents per square foot of improved property.no limited service provider had a comparable lease with bma.
in,the city issued eatc a permit to sell aviation fuel.the city and eatc are the only fuel providers at bma.revenue from fuel sales is a significant portion of the city total revenue from the airport.
in may,eatc brought suit under,alleging that the city violated the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by treating other businesses operating at bma differently than eatc.according to eatc,the private party defendants conspired with the city in this discrimination,which caused eatc to lose revenue and to suffer a diminution in the value of its business.the district court rejected these claims,holding that the city had a rational basis for treating eatc differently,and that eatc was not deprived of any property interest protected by the due process clause.the district court also refused to modify two discovery orders entered by a magistrate judge.the first order denied eatc request to use a special software retrieval program to search for deleted materials on a city employee laptop.the second order denied eatc discovery request for financial information from private party defendants.the district court also rejected the city counterclaim against eatc for breach of its fuel permit,holding that the statute of limitations barred any breach occurring before june,and that the entire alleged breach was waived.finally,the district court denied cook rule motion against eatc,finding that eatc allegations were not so baseless as to warrant sanctions.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,considering the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.uhiren squibb,cir.
eatc claims that the city violated its constitutional right to equal protection of the laws by treating various limited service providers more favorably than eatc.it alleges that the city refused to provide it with towing services,references,and other means of attracting business that the city provided to other businesses.eatc also argues that the city selectively enforced bismarck code of ordinances,allowing the private defendants to conduct commercial aeronautical services at bma without leases,written standards,or payments,while simultaneously requiring eatc to have a written lease and strictly enforcing its terms.
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment commands that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.city of cleburne,cleburne living,d.when a state treats persons differently based on a suspect classification,such as race,the state action is subject to strict judicial scrutiny.where no suspect classification is involved,however,the state need only show that the differential treatment is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.vacco quill,d.states have wide latitude when acting in the economic sphere.city of cleburne,at.eatc therefore must show that the city treated it differently from other parties,and that there was no rational basis for the differential treatment.
we are doubtful,as a threshold matter,that fixed base similarly situated with the limited service providers at the airport.but eatc argues that it is similarly situated with a de facto fixed base operator,comprised of the city and the limited service providers acting in concert.from this premise,eatc proceeds to argue that the city discriminated against eatc to boost the city fuel sales.
assuming that the parties are similarly situated,we believe that the city has shown a rational basis for its actions.a city has a legitimate interest in generating revenue from operating an airport and from selling fuel at the airport.see jacobsen city of rapid city,cir alamo airport,cir.particularly given that the federal aviation administration faa requires airports to be as as possible,a,and authorizes public airport authorities to provide any or all of the aeronautical services needed by the public,including fuel services,see faa order a,airport compliance handbook.d,we are comfortable that actions taken by the city to generate revenue are rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
the city interest in preserving the revenue generated by its fuel sales provided a rational basis for most of the actions disputed by eatc.it was rational for the city to refuse to tow aircraft to eatc,because the opposite decision would encourage aircraft owners to use eatc fueling services instead of the city.similarly,the city may rationally refer its customers seeking hangar space or aircraft maintenance to simson rather than eatc,because simson does not compete with the city for fuel sales.
eatc argument regarding differential enforcement of also fails.at the time this lawsuit was commenced stated 
commercial activities.a person may not engage in any commercial aeronautical activity on the airport without the written approval of,and under the standards prescribed by,the airport manager.for the purpose of this part,a commercial aeronautical activity includes any activity which involves,makes possible,or is required for the operation of aircraft,or which contributes to or is required for the safety of such operations.all standards required for any commercial aeronautical activity will be on file in the airport manager office.
bismarck,code of ordinances subsequently amended on,reprinted at appellant app.emphases added.
eatc argues that the city enforced the written approval and standards provisions of this ordinance against eatc,but not against the limited service providers.eatc argues that its detailed lease constituted written approval and established the standards referenced in the ordinance,and that the limited service providers at the airport were not required to have written approval or abide by the terms contained in eatc lea
