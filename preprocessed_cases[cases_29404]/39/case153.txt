procedural history 
in december of,the office of inspector general oig for the department of health and human services hhs completed an investigative audit report of four grants awarded by hhs to the delta foundation delta in,and under the community services block grant program.on the basis of the audit report,the administration of children and families acf within the hhs issued an audit determination letter to delta setting forth the government findings that delta had violated various hhs regulations and other administrative requirements in its implementation of the four grants,resulting in a disallowance of in grant expenditures.acf ordered delta to repay this amount to hhs.
delta filed an appeal with the hhs departmental appeals board dab or the board disputing the findings of the acf decision and seeking reversal of the acf order.on november,the dab affirmed the initial agency determination.
on may,delta filed a complaint to reverse the order in the united states district court for the northern district of mississippi claiming that the dab violated the administrative procedure act and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the district judge referred the complaint to a magistrate.the magistrate issued a report and recommendation suggesting that the district court uphold the dab decision and finding that delta had waived other arguments by not presenting them to the dab.after hearing objections to the report,the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation and affirmed the dab order.the present appeal followed.
today we decide whether the dab proceedings are sufficiently adversarial so that failure to raise an issue before the dab constitutes waiver under sims apfel,d.we also review the dab decision to determine whether the decision was arbitrary and capricious.we find that the dab decision was not arbitrary and capricious,and we affirm the dab decision.
ii.background 
delta is a mississippi nonprofit corporation formed to stimulate economic opportunities for the economically disadvantaged mississippi delta region.delta has developed manufacturing companies in mississippi and arkansas,with concentrations in electronics,apparel,wood products,and industrial parts.delta economic development activities are managed by two subsidiaries delta enterprises,delta enterprises,which establishes and acquires manufacturing businesses,and delta capital corporation delta capital,a venture capital company that provides financial and management services to businesses.
through the office of community services ocs,hhs offers competitive grants under the community services block grant program,et,to private nonprofit community development corporations that have as their principal purpose the planning,developing,or managing of community development projects intended to promote the creation of,permanent jobs or business development opportunities for residents.between and,delta applied for and received four grants from hhs,totaling million.the hhs grant applications completed by delta required that applicants demonstrate that their proposed projects would create permanent jobs of which percent would be filled by residents.grant applicants were instructed that at the end of the prescribed grant periods,varying from twelve to seventeen months,all businesses must be in place and operational.it was required that any critical issues or potential problems that could negatively affect the projects be communicated by the applicant.the grant announcements specified that in selecting applicants,preference would be given to projects that had secured outside funding in an amount equal to some percentage,varying by the grant,of the proposed grant amount.
the administration of the grants is governed by various cost and accounting principles set forth in federal regulations and in office of management and building omb circulars.by accepting a grant award,the grantee agrees to comply with the federal regulations and omb circulars governing the administration of the grants.in general terms,these provisions require,inter alia,properly documenting expenditures for goods and services.they also require prior approval for any changes within the scope or objectives of the project.
in december of,the oig of hhs conducted an audit of the four grants awarded to delta.the oig faulted delta for failing to create permanent jobs,using federal funds for purposes unrelated to the objectives of the grants,failing to provide the private capital and services as contemplated in the grant applications to ensure the success of the grants,and submitting programmatic and financial reports to hhs that were often untimely and inaccurate.the audit concluded that delta did not administer the grants in accordance with the grant proposals and submitted inaccurate progress reports.the resulting recommendation was that delta be required to refund million to the federal government.the audit detailed the failings of the administration of each of the grants.
in,delta applied for and received a grant from hhs in the amount of to expand its existing railroad spike manufacturing project,great river spike,by activating a second production line and consequently creating an additional new jobs.pursuant to the grant terms,delta would transfer of the grant money to its subsidiary,delta enterprises,and retain to cover grant administration costs.delta enterprises would use the funds to make an equity investment in its subsidiary,rail products,which would then transfer the money to great river spike.great river spike was a joint venture with another railroad spike manufacturer,spike industries,but rail products,was the majority owner.
at the time of the grant application,delta represented that it would achieve access to of private capital.delta referred obliquely in its application to a loan from the arkansas industrial development commission aidc,but delta omitted information concerning the loan payment status and the loan property clause that would encumber by a primary lien,mortgage,or privilege any property purchased by great river spike with the grant funds.also at the time of the application,delta corporate subsidiary,delta enterprises,through which grant funds were to be transferred to rail products and then to great river spike,had been administratively dissolved by the state of mississippi on february.this fact was not disclosed by delta in its grant application.
contrary to the representations made in the grant proposal,great river spike did not use the funds to start a second production line.the funds were instead used to build a second spike machine to be used while the business other spike machine was repaired.in addition,delta failed to obtain the private capital that it claimed would be invested in the project.in connection with this project,delta hired only eight additional employees but did not document whether those hired during the project period were workers as required by the grant award.
as a result of substantial operating loss,great river spike terminated operations in january of,six months after the close of the extended grant period great river spike did not report its closing to hhs.in october,the aidc foreclosed on property pledged as collateral for its loan of to great river spike.included in the foreclosed property was the new machine purchased with the grant funds.aidc sold this property at public auction for.at auction,jim smith,general manager of great river spike and delta venture partner,purchased the equipment.hhs was not informed of the foreclosure or the sale.on february,delta filed a property inventory and disposition statement claiming that great river spike still retained the spike machine purchased with the grant funds.
in,hhs awarded delta a grant of to create new threads,an apparel manufacturing company in greenville,mississippi subsequently greenville apparel.the goal of greenville apparel was to take over the excess sewing work from fine vines,an existing apparel manufacturer owned by delta enterprises,and to pursue an opportunity to produce the arizona line of blue jeans for penney.delta predicted that greenville apparel would create new private sector vast majority of which would be filled by individuals.delta represented that in private capital would be contributed to the project.it was delta view that the imminent passage of nafta was a minimal risk for the project.
in the grant application,greenville apparel was proposed as a subsidiary of delta enterprises and not a division or expansion of fine vines,although delta did represent that it would initially contract with fine vines for production capabilities and management assistance.delta maintained in the grant application that it would retain for grant administration expenses and transfer in grant funds to delta enterprises in return for equity in delta enterprises.in turn,delta enterprises was to purchase stock in greenville apparel.
ultimately,no stock purchases were made,and delta instead transferred the money as paid in capital.greenville apparel was not created as an independent entity,but operated instead as a subcontractor of fine vines and was located in the fine vines facility.only a few jobs were created through greenville apparel.delta states that greenville apparel was unable to realize its customer base or receive the necessary financing to participate in the jeans program,and that the passage of nafta negatively affected greenville apparel potential for securing manufacturing jobs.
additionally,greenville apparel used grant funds to purchase pieces of sewing equipment.only four pieces of the equipment were used by greenville apparel.the rest remained unused or were used by fine vines.harold hall hall,an officer or project manager in several delta companies and chief operating officer of delta enterprises,informed the oig auditors that it was less expensive to purchase the used equipment in bulk than to purchase as new only those machines needed by greenville apparel.none of the machines was in use at the time of the audit.additionally,grant funds were used to provide loans to fine vines,which had been administratively dissolved by the state of mississippi on february fact not disclosed by delta in the grant application.
on june,delta was awarded a grant of.the purpose of the grant was to start metcalfe manufacturing,metcalfe,a metal products manufacturing company in partnership with reliance electric.metcalfe was to create new permanent jobs.delta represented that it would obtain private capital in the amount of.as with the and the grants,delta represented that grant funds would be transferred through an equity investment in delta enterprises,which would in turn make an equity investment in metcalfe.in total,delta would transfer through delta enterprises to metcalfe,while retaining to cover grant administration expenses.
ultimately,metcalfe did not develop as an independent subsidiary of delta enterprises but was designated as a division of electro national,a corporate subsidiary of delta enterprises.few jobs were created through metcalfe,and two months prior to the end of the grant period,no jobs remained at metcalfe because it had terminated operations.
only of the grant funds were transferred through delta enterprises to metcalfe,and the stock purchases were never made.moreover,delta loaned in grant funds to fine vines and electro national without informing hhs.metcalfe used of the grant funds to satisfy a credit line and paid to metcalfe employees.the private capital promised in the grant applications did not materialize.furthermore,hhs learned that electro national had been administratively dissolved by the state of mississippi on october and was not reinstated until six months after the grant period expired in.
in,delta was awarded a grant of to start delta eagle fuel cell,delta eagle,a joint venture to engage in the business of repairing neoprene rubber fuel cells for aircraft and helicopters.the project was to create thirty new,permanent jobs,and delta represented that it would secure private capital in the amount of committed to the project.delta contemplated that of the grant funds would be used for grant administration purposes.the remaining grant funds would be used to purchase stock in various delta subsidiaries,including delta capital,action communications,and moeller manufacturing,moeller.in return,these subsidiaries were to make an equity investment in delta eagle and provide delta eagle with a term loan to conduct the project.the project was stated to be a joint venture corporation between moeller and simmie brown,who was to contribute his expertise to the project and provide certifications from the federal aviation administration faa.
ultimately,delta and simmie brown relationship deteriorated,and the joint venture failed.delta requested a twelve month extension in the grant period to allow delta to continue the project solely through moeller.prior to considering an extension,hhs requested that delta provide hhs with documentation,including assurances that moeller would have the same faa certification to perform the aircraft repair services.delta responded by asking for a modification of the grant terms to allow it to abandon the aircraft fuel and flotation repair business and to operate solely as a generalized manufacturer.hhs did not allow this modification.hhs also requested that delta return to the federal government in grant funds that had been drawn down but not yet disbursed.delta did not return these funds.later,during the hhs audit in,hhs discovered that action communications had been administratively dissolved by the state of mississippi in for failure to file an annual report or pay taxes,and moeller was dissolved in for failure to pay taxes.these facts were not disclosed in the grant applications.
moreover,delta never obtained the private capital it had promised in the grant application.the record indicates that delta used of the grant funds to repay a loan predating the grant period,and transferred to moeller for activities unrelated to the grant project.a garnishment action unrelated to the grant project seized another.when pressed to prove that it had transferred funds in the form of stock,delta submitted a copy of a check presumably for the purchase of stock,and a stock certificate for one share of stock.the stock certificate was proved to be false when oig auditors discovered that at the time the stock certificate was issued,all authorized shares had previously been issued and therefore no stock was available to be issued.
subsequent proceedings 
on april,the acf issued an audit determination letter based on the audit.acf demanded the return of all grants except for a credit reflecting the jobs created by the and grants.acf divided the disallowance into six categories.first,acf disallowed for lack of documentation to support stated costs,including in administrative costs,in miscellaneous expenditures,and in management fees paid to fine vines under the grant.second,acf disallowed attributable to the cost of the seized equipment in the grant for delta failure to safeguard the assets as required.third,acf disallowed in costs attributable to expenditures incurred outside the grant periods.fourth,acf disallowed in expenditures because they were unrelated to the grant purposes.fifth,acf disallowed because delta subsidiz ed subsidiary organizations by transferring funds to them without obtaining additional stock in return,in violation of the regulations requiring grant recipients to maintain effective control over grant funds.sixth,acf disallowed in grant funds that were neither used by delta for purposes of the grant nor returned to the federal government as required by the federal regulations governing the grants.the total amount of the disallowed expenses was.
delta appealed the audit determination to the dab.first,delta suggested that its failure to effect stock purchases and the investment of grant monies in administratively dissolved entities had no material impact on delta control over the grant funds.second,delta argued that the disallowance for failure to safeguard the assets purchased with the grant funds was wrong given the limited property interests hhs maintained in that equipment purchased with the grant money.third,delta maintained that acf misapplied the reasonableness standard in disallowing the for sewing equipment.fourth,delta argued that it had submitted ample documentation to support salary and other costs among the administrative and management fees disallowed for lack of documentation.
on november,the board upheld the in disallowances,finding that delta had failed to implement projects as described in the grant applications.specifically,the dab disallowed the expenditures on equipment under the grant based on the finding that delta failed to show that the purchase was prudent and consistent with sound business practices.the dab raised the issue sua sponte as to whether the cost principles of omb circular circular were the proper principles to apply when measuring the expenditures of the subsidiaries of the delta.the dab considered the issue waived because delta had not raised the argument.
delta sought review of the dab decision by filing suit in the united states district court for the northern district of mississippi.delta alleged that the dab opinion violated the administrative procedure act and the due process clause of the fifth amendment and sought to vacate the dab decision on the grounds that it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with the law.delta also sought an injunction against the enforcement of the order.after briefing and oral argument,the magistrate issued a report and recommendation on january suggesting that the district court affirm the dab decision.the district court reviewed the objections to the magistrate report and then entered final judgment,adopting the magistrate report.the present appeal was timely filed.
iii.delta waived the issue of improper applications of cost regulations 
on appeal,delta argues that the dab applied the wrong federal cost regulation in evaluating the expenditures of delta subsidiaries.the dab reviewed delta expenses under the standards set forth in hhs administrative regulations at pt.and in circular.delta submits that the dab should have reviewed delta expenses under the standards located in pt.delta contends that the cost regulations relied on by the dab did not extend to commercial organizations until august of,and therefore,should not govern the disallowance of expenditures and costs incurred by delta subsidiaries.further,delta argues that the cost principles set forth in circular do not govern the cost allowances for commercial entitles receiving hhs funding and thus should not have been applied to delta subsidiaries.because we find that delta waived this argument by failing to pursue the issue at the administrative level,we do not address whether the dab applied the proper cost regulations when it disallowed delta expenses.
in sims apfel,d,the supreme court examined the question of whether an issue exhaustion requirement should be imposed on a social security claimant thus requiring the claimant to raise all issues in its request for review by the social security appeals council appeals council or risk waiving those arguments not raised.the court held that a requirement of issue exhaustion is not appropriate in the social security context.id.at.
in sims,the social security administration ssa denied the petitioner claims for benefits,and the petitioner requested that the appeals council review her claim.the appeals council denied review,and the petitioner filed suit in district court,which rejected all of petitioner claims.id.at.on appeal,this court declined to address arguments that petitioner had not raised in her request for review by the appeals council.cir.the supreme court reversed,holding that a social security proceeding is not an adversarial type of proceeding therefore,there is no issue exhaustion requirement in social security appeals.sims,at.in reaching this conclusion,the court began by noting that issue exhaustion requirements are usually created by statute.id.at.alternatively,an issue exhaustion requirement may be imposed by an agency regulations requiring a claimant to exhaust all issues in administrative appeals.id.at.absent either a statute or regulation requiring issue exhaustion,a court may impose it where it is appropriate to do so.the court recognized that a judicially imposed issue exhaustion requirement may be proper because it is an analogy to the rule that appellate courts will not consider arguments not raised before trial courts.id.at.the degree to which such an analogy applies is dependent on whether the particular administrative proceeding is similar to traditional is,whether the proceeding before the administrative agency is sufficiently adversarial.id.at.the rationale for requiring issue exhaustion is that parties should have an opportunity to offer evidence before the administrative agency charged with the fact finding responsibility.id.this rationale is strongest in cases in which the parties are expected to develop the issues in an adversarial administrative proceeding.id.at.the court warned,however,of the wide differences between administrative agencies and courts.id.quoting shepard nlrb,d.and the court counseled against reflexively assimilat ing the relation of administrative bodies and the courts to the relationship between lower and upper courts.id.quoting fcc pottsville broad.
in applying this reasoning to the facts of sims,the court first recognized that no statute or regulation required issue exhaustion in ssa proceedings.id.at.a plurality of the court then analyzed the ssa proceedings and determined that,social security proceedings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial.id.at.imposing an issue exhaustion requirement,therefore,would be improper in those cases.id.at.the court noted specifically that in social security proceedings,the administrative law judge alj is charged with investigating the facts and developing arguments both for and against granting benefits,and the appeals council review is similarly broad.id.at.citing richardson perales,d.no representative goes before the alj on behalf of the social security commissioner to oppose the claim for benefits,and there is no indication that the commissioner opposes claimants before the appeals council.id.the court pointed out that the appeals council conducts the review process in an informal and manner.id.citing b.the parties are permitted,but are not required,to file briefs with the appeals council.id.citing.the court also noted that the form on which claimants request review of their case provides only three lines for a claimant to state the details of his request for review.an accompanying notice states that the form should only take ten minutes for the claimant to complete.id.at.citing a.this fact led the court to conclude that the appeals council does not rely upon the parties to identify the pertinent legal and factual issues.id.the appeals council may review any new material evidence outside of the record promulgated by the parties.id.at.citing a.the court noted that the appeals council review is plenary and the council may even review cases against the wishes of the applicant.id.citing a.
the court then concluded that proceedings before the ssa lack an adversarial quality and are far more informal than traditional litigation therefore,the usual rationale for implying an issue exhaustion requirement is not present.accordingly,the court held that a judicially created requirement was inappropriate for social security appeals.id.at.
turning to the question of whether there is an issue exhaustion requirement for hhs proceedings,we first note that there is neither a statute nor a regulation that mandates issue exhaustion in that context.accordingly,this court must engage in an analysis consistent with sims to determine whether proceedings before the hhs are sufficiently adversarial in nature so as to require issue exhaustion at the administrative level.
the regulations governing hhs appeals describe a proceeding that is clearly more adversarial than an informal social security proceeding.both parties in a proceeding before the dab may be represented,and each party participates in developing an appeal file for the dab to review,including written arguments supportive of the party claims.in order to promote development of the record,the board may request additional documents or information from the parties,require briefing on the issues in the case,issue orders to show cause and hold preliminary conferences.after the dab has reviewed the file,the dab or one of the parties may request a conference in which each party representative may make oral presentations and submit briefs.additionally,the appellant may request a hearing,which,while remaining informal,provides each side with an opportunity to make opening and closing statements,and present and witnesses.d.following the hearing,parties are allowed to submit briefs or proposed findings and conclusions.e.thus,unlike the ssa proceedings in which the appeals council itself,and not the claimant,has the responsibility for identifying the claims and developing arguments,the parties appear before the dab as adversaries,charged with presenting their arguments and supporting witnesses and effectively discrediting opposing parties through.given these differences,we hold that there is a sufficiently adversarial nature to hhs proceedings so as to impose an issue exhaustion requirement to those proceedings.a claimant must therefore exhaust all issues in a request for review by the dab in order to preserve judicial review of those issues.see also salt lake comm.action program,shalala,predating sims but holding traditional exhaustion principles applicable to hhs administrative proceedings before the dab.
having determined that claimants in a hhs proceeding must conform with the requirements of issue exhaustion,we next decide whether delta complied with this requirement.delta contends that its argument regarding the applicability of circular to delta subsidiaries was preserved for review because the hhs agency was aware of the ambiguity as to the appropriate standard.delta likens its situation to that of the claimant in trinity indus.occupational safety health review comm oshrc,cir.
in trinity,the secretary of labor argued that because trinity failed to raise the issue of employer knowledge in its petition for review,and oshrc did not consider it,this court was precluded from deciding the knowledge issue on review.this court agreed with the secretary and held,where the commission was clearly aware of the knowledge issue and where the knowledge issue constituted a fundamental element of the secretary burden of proof,the knowledge issue was properly preserved for the court review.id.at.to hold otherwise would place form above purpose id.
delta presents this holding as support for its argument that the dab was aware of the ambiguity regarding the appropriate cost review regulation and,therefore,any finding that delta had failed to exhaust the issue before the dab would place form above purpose.the facts of this case,however,differ significantly from trinity.in trinity,this court noted that trinity did raise the issue of employer knowledge in its brief to the commission,even if it did not raise the issue of knowledge in its petition for review before the commission.id.the commission,therefore,was well aware of the knowledge issue and had a chance to make a ruling on that issue.conversely,delta never raised the issue of the proper cost regulation.the dab was the first to refer to the question of the proper cost regulations and did so in a footnote in which it observed the ambiguity surrounding the issue of the proper cost regulation,but then concluded by acknowledging that delta had not raised the issue.therefore,unlike in trinity,where the relevant issue was did not raise the issue at all.we find that delta failed to exhaust the issue of proper cost regulations at the administrative level.consequently,delta has waived this issue and we are without authority to review this question.we therefore disregard delta argument that certain expenditures were disallowed due to reliance on an improper set of cost accounting standards 
iv.specific disallowances by the board 
standard of review 
the court reviews the decision of the dab under a,administrative procedure act.apa.under the apa,the administrative record is reviewed to determine whether the challenged action was arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law harris united states,cir.the court scope of review in this matter is very narrow.louisiana verity,cir.the court role is not to weigh the evidence pro and con but to determine whether the agency decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there was a clear error of judgment.id.quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.thus,if the agency considers the factors and articulates a rational relationship between the facts found and the choice made,its decision is not arbitrary and capricious.harris,at quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.the agency decision need not be ideal,so long as it is not arbitrary or capricious,and so long as the agency gave at least minimal consideration to relevant facts contained in the record.id.quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.
disallowance for subsidizing subsidiary organizations 
the first disallowance challenged by delta concerns apparently used for subsidizing subsidiary organizations.hhs has the authority to disallow costs not materially in compliance with the grant award if appropriate under the circumstances.see a.in reaching the decision to disallow the the board discussed,inter alia,delta failure to make equity investments contemplated in its grant applications,and its failure to disclose that the subsidiary corporations involved in each of the four grants were administratively dissolved by the state of mississippi.based on these actions,the board determined that delta viewed grant funds as capital that could be used by any of its subsidiaries without any regard for compliance with directives from the grantor.we now consider delta efforts to demonstrate that the board decision was arbitrary and capricious.
delta failure to purchase stock as promised 
in each of the four grant applications,delta promised to transfer grant funds to delta enterprises and delta capital in return for stock.the promised equity investments,however,were never made by delta.in fact,these investments could not have been made as contemplated because all authorized shares in delta capital had been previously issued.nonetheless,as late as,delta continued to misrepresent that these purchases had been made,and even presented a false stock certificate to auditors in an effort to advance the charade.
delta now admits to channeling the funds to its subsidiaries as paid in capital.both delta enterprises and delta capital were wholly owned by delta thus,whether transferred as paid in capital,or through an equity investment,delta claims that the funds remained under its control at all times.on that basis,delta concludes that its departures from the grant proposals were inconsequential,rather than material as required by statute.see a providing for disallowance of costs if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
the board decision must be upheld on the agency grounds,or not at all.institute for tech.dev.brown,cir.it is delta burden,however,to show that the agency decision is erroneous.see mississippi hosp,heckler,cir noting that a presumption of validity attaches to agency action.the board primarily justified its decision by charging that delta failed to abide by the terms of the grant,and used grant funds as unrestricted support for its operation as a whole.thus,delta efforts to show that it maintained effective control over the funds are unpersuasive as this ground was not a primary basis for the board disallowance.
additionally,we are not persuaded by delta assertion that only an inconsequential accounting difference exists between transferring funds as,rather than an equity investment.first,we note that this rather flamboyant conclusion is made without any supporting authority.second,the record indicates that in delta scrambled to mislead auditors who questioned whether a required equity investment in delta capital was ever made.it is not unreasonable to presume that if delta truly regarded the difference between these two methods of transfer as inconsequential,then concealing the difference would not have been necessary.
thus,we need not determine today whether failure to receive stock in exchange for funds surrendered to a subsidiary is alone a sufficient basis to support to the disallowance.delta failure to make the contemplated equity investment,when combined with its presentation of a false stock certificate to auditors,and total failure to support its assertion that the treatment of funds as paid in capital was inconsequential,lead us to conclude that delta has not shown this disallowance to be arbitrary and capricious.see mississippi hosp,heckler,cir noting that a presumption of validity attaches to agency action.
administratively dissolved subsidiaries 
as set forth in delta grant applications,delta enterprises and delta capital were to act as conduits through which grant money would flow to other delta subsidiaries.delta failed to disclose,however,that rail products,fine vines,electro national,action communications,and moeller integral to each grant been administratively dissolved by the state of mississippi.it is undisputed that administratively dissolved entities may not engage in activity unrelated to winding up their affairs.thus,these corporate subsidiaries were unable to participate legally in the programs for which the grants had been given.
delta downplays the significance of administrative dissolution by noting that dissolved corporations may seek reinstatement within five years and reinstatement is retroactive.though delta correctly notes that reinstatement reaches back to the date of administrative dissolution,many of the corporations at issue were beyond the period for reinstatement at the time of the oig audit in.further,each of these corporations was administratively dissolved at the time delta submitted its grant applications.thus,even if these corporations could have been reinstated at the time delta filed its grant applications,it appears that the very its duty to disclose in the grant applications any problems that could negatively affect the projects.
in our view,delta failure to disclose the dissolution of its subsidiaries,on its own,constitutes a material breach of the terms and conditions of delta award.these subsidiaries were unable to participate legally in delta grant programs at the time the funds were given.the mere possibility that these entities could have been within a period does not make delta failure to disclose this information immaterial.when viewing this behavior against the backdrop of delta efforts to mislead auditors and its other skullduggery,delta has not persuaded this court that the board disallowance was arbitrary and capricious.
delta failure to safeguard assets 
delta channeled funds from the grant to great river spike.with of grant funds,great river spike bought a machine to expand existing business activity.unbeknownst to hhs,the machine became immediately encumbered through an property clause related to a loan from aidc.in relatively short order,the machine was seized pursuant to this clause and sold via public auction for to the manager of great river spike.the board found that delta failed to safeguard adequately grant assets and disallowed this expense.we review this conclusion to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious.
in reaching its decision,the board noted that delta did not clearly disclose the existence of great river spike loan from aidc,great river spike failure to make payments on the loan since,and the existence of aidc property clause.for the board,it was not unreasonable to presume that had these facts been disclosed in delta grant application,ocs would have rejected the application,or found some way to safeguard assets destined for great river spike.considering delta omissions regarding the loan,the board indicated its belief that delta had no authority to encumber the property.the board also expressed concerns that delta essentially squandered grant property on the risky proposition that the influx of grant capital might allow great river spike to pay down aidc loan.
delta argues that,at most,hhs is entitled to fair market value of the equipment because delta had legal title to the machine and disposed of it correctly pursuant to.predictably,delta asserts that represents the fair market value of the spike machine.
hhs argues,consistent with the board opinion and applicable law,that delta had an obligation to safeguard the property and to prevent it from being seized.see c repealed requiring recipients to maintain financial management systems that protect against loss,damage or theft of grant property c repealed creating duty to safeguard property and assure that property is used solely for authorized purposes.considering that the spike machine was subject to immediate seizure by aidc because great river spike was in default on the loan,it is clear that delta actions do not square with its duty to safeguard grant assets.further,given the inadequate disclosure of the defaulted loan,we believe that delta had no right to encumber the spike machine.
finally,it is worth addressing delta attempt to characterize the auction of the spike machine as an orderly disposition of an asset authorized by statute.it is true that dispositions of grant property may be proper pursuant to statute.disposition is only appropriate,however,when the property is no longer needed for grant purposes,and it is sold in a competitive process with agency permission.g.in this case,delta made no attempt to gain hhs permission for the sale,and even filed a false property and inventory disposition statement indicating that great river spike retained the spike machine.given delta opaque disclosure of the aidc loan,the unauthorized encumbrance and sale of grant property,and delta disregard for applicable regulations,we can not conclude that the board decision was arbitrary and capricious.
disallowed as unneeded equipment 
in connection with the grant project delta,through its subsidiary greenville apparel,used in grant funds to purchase pieces of sewing equipment.as required by circular,the board considered whether this purchase of the sewing equipment was reasonable for the performance of the award and allocable thereto.the board found that only four pieces of this sewing equipment were used for grant purposes.the other eighteen pieces of sewing equipment were either used by fine vines,or sat idle.the auditors allotted of the total purchase price to the unused equipment and the board disallowed that portion of the expense.
in reaching its determination,the board noted that a cost item is reasonable if in its nature or amount,it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent business person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur the costs.the board recognized that when evaluating the reasonableness of an action consideration must be given to various factors,including sound business practices and the terms and conditions of the awards.a cost is allocable to the grant,to the extent of the benefits received.resolution of this issue did not turn on whether the purchase price was reasonable because delta obtained a discount for purchasing the entire lot of equipment.instead,the board focused on whether the purchase was consistent with the terms of the award,the prudence of the purchase at the time made,and whether the purchase was intended to benefit the grant project or other cost objectives of delta related organizations.
delta argued to the board that the equipment purchase was in accordance with its business plan.the board noted,however,that none of the items of equipment listed in delta business plan correlated with the pieces of equipment at issue.further,the board found that delta offered no evidence or testimony,aside from baseless assertions,that this equipment would have been useful for the project.finally,aside from an oig finding that four pieces of equipment were used by greenville apparel,the board concluded that no evidence in the record demonstrated the equipment purchase was a prudent business expenditure int
