this dispute is another round in a battle by state employees to prevent the state of california from contracting out to private companies the performance of state services.armed with the civil service act,article vii of california constitution article vii,state employees have usually prevailed in the courts because article vii has been interpreted to forbid,in most circumstances,private companies from contracting with the state to perform services that can be accomplished by state employees.
the battlefield changed in november,when california voters approved proposition,adding article xxii to our constitution article xxii to allow the state to contract with private entities to obtain architectural and engineering services for public works of improvement.proposition specified that article vii shall not be construed to limit the state from contracting with private companies for such services.
the state and professional engineers in california government pecg,a union representing engineers employed by the state,then entered into a collective bargaining agreement,known as a memorandum of understanding mou.among other things,it provides that,except in extremely unusual or urgent circumstances,the state must make every effort to use state employees to perform architectural and engineering services for public works projects,before resorting to contracts with private companies.in order to ensure that state employees have preference over contract employees,the mou contains requirements that make it more difficult for a state entity to contract out for such services.these requirements are contained in what we will refer to as provision of the mou.
in this latest round of the ongoing battle,consulting engineers and land surveyors of california,john humber,and harris associates,collectively,celsoc filed a petition for writ of mandate,seeking to enjoin the implementation of provision of the mou.in a well articulated ruling,the trial court granted the requested relief.pecg appeals.
as we will explain,we agree with the trial court ruling that the terms of provision of the mou limit the ability of the state to contract freely for architectural and engineering services,and are on their face,directly in conflict with article xxii.we also conclude substantial evidence supports the court finding that the implementation of provision would disrupt ongoing public works projects and waste public funds by terminating existing contracts,produce great and irreparable injury to the public and to the parties to existing architectural and engineering services contracts,and result in the loss of benefits that would flow to the public from such future contracts.
hence,we shall affirm the judgment enjoining the implementation of provision of the mou.
background 
section of article vii states a the civil service includes every officer and employee of the state except as otherwise provided in this constitution.b in the civil service permanent appointment and promotion shall be made under a general system based on merit ascertained by competitive examination.article vii creates the state personnel board,to which enforcement and administration of the civil service laws are delegated.it embraces every officer and employee of the state,except for certain positions specifically exempted from the civil service.article vii is implemented by the state civil service act,et see california state employees williams d.
courts have interpreted article vii as a restriction on the contracting out of state tasks to the private sector.california state employees state of california d.hereafter csea,and cases cited in csea.the restriction does not arise from the express language of article vii.citation.rather,it emanates from an implicit necessity for protecting the policy of the organic civil service mandate against dissolution and destruction.citation.ibid.
thus,courts generally have concluded that article vii forbids the state from contracting for private companies to perform services of the kind that persons selected through civil service could perform adequately and competently.state compensation ins.fund riley cal d.
however,the restriction on contracting out is inapplicable if the state seeks to contract for the performance of new functions not previously undertaken by the state or covered by an existing department or agency.professional engineers department of transportation cal th,d,hereafter professional engineers.the restriction also may be inapplicable if the state releases a former function in favor of privatization on an experimental basis under circumstances involving considerations of economy and efficiency.id.at,d.
in addition,government code section,subdivision a permits the state to contract out for personal services in order to obtain cost savings if those savings can be achieved without ignoring other applicable civil service requirements,such as the use of publicized competitive bidding and the avoidance of the displacement of state workers,and if there is no overriding public interest in having the state perform the function.csea,supra,d at.csea concluded that this section does not violate article vii.the goal of maintaining the civil service must be balanced with the goal of a fiscally responsible state government.id.at.
with this background in mind,the california supreme court held that amendments to another government code section,expanding the authority of the state department of transportation caltrans to award contracts to the private sector for state work,violated article vii.professional engineers,supra,cal th at,d.this was so because the work had been historically or customarily performed by state employees,and the legislature had failed to make any findings demonstrating that the work could not be performed adequately and competently by state employees.professional engineers,supra,cal th at,d.
in professional engineers,caltrans urged the supreme court to disapprove certain decisions restricting the state ability to contract out to private companies the performance of state services.the court declined to do so noting,although caltrans reasons,if factually based,might support a constitutional amendment to clarify,or indeed abrogate,the private contracting restriction,they offer no solid ground for ignoring traditional principles of stare decisis.professional engineers,supra,cal th at,d.
the electorate responded in november with proposition,the fair competition and taxpayer savings act,adding article xxii to our constitution.section of article xxii provides in pertinent part the state of california and all other governmental entities,shall be allowed to contract with qualified private entities for architectural and engineering services for all public works of improvement.the choice and authority to contract shall extend to all phases of project development and shall exist without regard to funding sources whether federal,state,regional,local or private,whether or not the project is programmed by a state,regional or local governmental entity,and whether or not the completed project is a part of any state owned or state operated system or facility.section of article xxii goes on to say nothing contained in article vii of this constitution shall be construed to limit,restrict or prohibit the state or any other governmental entities,from contracting with private entities for the performance of architectural and engineering services.
the expressed purpose of article xxii is to remove existing restrictions on contracting for architectural and engineering services to encourage partnerships for the benefit of california taxpayers to promote fair competition so both public and private sector architects and engineers work more efficiently to speed the completion of backlogged transit projects to ensure that contracting for architectural and engineering services occurs through a fair and competitive selection process that is free of undue political influence and to make sure that private firms contracting for architectural and engineering services with governmental entities meet established design and construction standards.initiative measure.
thereafter,pecg and the state negotiated an mou for professional engineer unit unit.provision of the mou concerns contracting out of professional engineering services.it asserts that state entities are contracting out work appropriately done by unit employees,resulting in unnecessary additional costs to the state therefore,e xcept in extremely unusual or urgent,circumstances,or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law,federal mandate,or court,the state must make every effort to hire,utilize and retain unit employees before resorting to the use of private contractors.in order to accomplish this objective,the mou specifies that state entities are required to provide pecg with copies of invitations for bids for such contracts,so pecg will have the opportunity to present alternatives that would avoid the need for contracting out.
provision also mandates the establishment of a state joint committee,with half of its members being pecg representatives and the other half being representatives of the department of personnel administration,the department of finance,and affected departments.the committee is required to review all currently existing contracts and,upon request,each state entity is required to submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in unit class specifications,and to provide documents concerning the personnel costs involved.the committee has the duty to examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section,the terms of the contracts,all applicable laws,federal mandates and court.in this regard,the committee must consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately,which contracts will take additional time to terminate,which contracts may continue for how long and under what conditions and how if necessary and cost effective to transition contract employees or positions into civil service.all determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee.if savings were generated by the termination of personal services contracts,the state is required to implement the committee findings regarding utilization of the savings.
provision contains a subsection,entitled displacement avoidance,the stated objective of which is to ensure that unit employees have preference over contract employees if the duties at issue are consistent with the unit employee classification,the unit employee is qualified to perform the job,and there is no disruption in services.the subsection also says in pertinent part to avoid or mitigate unit employee displacement for lack of work,the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee classification is being performed by a contractor if the joint committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the state to assign the work to a unit employee who would otherwise be displaced,this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section.the state and pecg shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments.this shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a unit employee to avoid displacement,are utilized to offset that employee moving and relocation costs 
according to provision,t he state is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations,government code as it pertains to restriction on contracting out.thus,nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law public contract code.
celsoc filed a petition for writ of mandate,challenging the validity of provision and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.celsoc asserted that provision is an impermissible restriction on contracting out and an unlawful attempt to resurrect the civil service mandate of article vii,in violation of article xxii hereafter proposition.
pecg disagreed,claiming that provision merely creates a committee to analyze nonconfidential data to determine whether the state is incurring unnecessary costs on existing contracts,and that the preference for using state employees does not violate proposition.
the trial court agreed with celsoc and granted the petition for writ of mandate,enjoining the state and pecg from implementing provision.in the court view,its ruling would not prevent pecg from obtaining cost information about outside engineering contracts,which information is readily available through the public records act.
discussion 
pecg contends that the trial court erred because the terms of provision do not materially conflict with proposition.we disagree.
in interpreting a voter initiative,we apply the principles that govern the construction of a statute.robert superior court cal th,d,horwich superior court cal th,d.we begin by examining its language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning,viewed in the context of the initiative as a whole and the overall statutory scheme and purpose.people rizo cal th,d.where possible,the language of the initiative should be read so as to conform to the spirit of the enactment.shapiro san diego city council th,d.if the terms of the initiative are unambiguous,we presume the voters meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.day city of fontana cal th,d.when the language is ambiguous,we refer to other indicia of the voters intent,particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.citation.people rizo,supra,cal th at,d.
proposition provides that the state and all governmental entities shall be allowed to contract out architectural and engineering services,and that article vii shall not be construed as restricting the state from doing so.in other words,the judicially construed civil service restrictions of article vii against contracting out do not apply to such contracts.the voters emphasized the purpose of proposition is to remove existing restrictions on contracting for architectural and engineering services so that state government can use qualified private firms to help deliver transportation and infrastructure projects safely,to promote fair competition in order to obtain the best quality and value for california taxpayers,and to speed the completion of backlogged projects.initiative measure.
however,provision of the mou negotiated by pecg and the state mandates the preferential use of civil service engineers over outside engineers,except under specified circumstances permits termination of existing outside engineering contracts and transfer of the work to civil service engineers after the contracts are reviewed by a committee dominated by pecg members and requires that steps must be taken,such as termination of outside contracts where possible,to minimize the displacement of state engineers resulting from contracting out engineering services.although cost savings appear to be a consideration with respect to the termination of existing engineering contracts,there is no requirement that the preference given to civil service engineers for new projects must be based on cost effectiveness.
the effect of all of these requirements is to restrict the ability of state authorities to freely contract out engineering services.the mandatory preference for civil service engineers,without a concomitant requirement of cost savings,does not ensure the best value for california taxpayers,and it undermines the goal of promoting fair competition.moreover,common sense dictates that the review and termination of existing contracts is not conducive to speeding the completion of backlogged projects.in other words,provision contravenes the goals of proposition and thwarts the intent of the electorate.
pecg strained efforts to save provision of the mou are unconvincing.
first,pecg asserts that proposition was intended to remove only the contracting out restrictions that existed in november when the initiative was approved by the voters thus,it does not apply to the provisions of later enacted mou,like provision.
this is a nonsensical contention.proposition was a forward thinking initiative designed to free the state in the future from the statutory and constitutional provisions the courts had construed to restrict contracting out for engineering and architectural services on public works projects.the fact that provision did not exist when proposition was passed is immaterial.by seeking to reimpose restrictions of the kind eliminated and forbidden by proposition,provision is the very type of action that the voters intended to preclude by adopting the initiative measure.
next,pecg argues provision applies only to already awarded contracts and does not restrict the state ability to contract freely for architectural and engineering services on public works projects hence,it does not violate proposition.
in pecg view,provision merely provides a forum for open debate over whether particular a e architectural and engineering contracts are cost effective.it is in no way intended to slow down,interfere with or restrict the state ultimate decision with respect to whether or not to contract out.
this attempt to make over provision is unconvincing.the parts of provision entitled,purpose and policy regarding personal services contracts and cost savings,plainly show that the mou is intended to restrict the state ability to contract out for engineering and architectural services on public works projects.under the guise of fiscal responsibility,it does so by,among other things,compelling state entities to make every effort to hire,utilize and retain unit employees before resorting to the use of private contractors for such services requiring state entities to provide pecg with copies of requests for private contractor bids for such services,so that pecg can advocate against contracting out creating a joint committee with responsibility for reviewing all private contracts for services found in unit class specifications,and determining which of those contracts should be terminated immediately or transitioned into civil service imposing a requirement that a state entity must meet and confer with pecg when a unit state employee would be displaced by the contracting out of architectural and engineering services on public works projects,in order to ensure that unit employees have preference over contract employees.
by any measure,these are significant restrictions on the ability of a state entity to contract out for architectural and engineering services on public works projects now and in the future.
equally unconvincing is pecg claim that provision does not authorize the joint committee to terminate state contracts with private companies for architectural and engineering services on public works projects.
paradoxically,in its response to an amicus curiae brief,pecg argues the committee will terminate such a contract only upon the mutual agreement of the entire committee,which necessarily will include the agreement of the affected department that entered the contract in the first instance and,therefore,the termination will reflect an exercise of the department contracting choice.
pecg latter contention is an implicit concession that the committee will terminate contracts and that it has the authority to do so.the terms of provision support such an interpretation because they state the committee shall examine the contracts and will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately,which contracts will take additional time to terminate,which contracts may continue and how if necessary and cost effective to transition contract employees or positions into civil service.even the committee interprets provision as allowing it to requir e that a contact be terminated.
in any event,pecg contends,the committee ability to terminate a state contract with a private company for architectural and engineering services on public works projects does not restrict the state ability to contract out for such services.this is so,it argues,because the committee decision to terminate a contract is made by the express mutual agreement of the committee members,which,in pecg view,means that the decision represents the state choice on contracting.
however,the phrase mutual agreement does not necessarily mean unanimous agreement.in fact,the record shows that not even the committee has been able to agree on whether this phrase means unanimous agreement,agreement by a supermajority,or agreement by a simple majority.therefore,we can not say that provision precludes the committee from overriding an affected state entity desire not to terminate its contract with a private company for architectural and engineering services on public works projects 
in yet another effort to salvage provision,pecg claims proposition dictate that t he state of california and all other governmental entities shall be allowed to contract with qualified private entities for architectural and engineering services for all public works of improvement does not include caltrans or other state agencies.in pecg view,the state means only the legislature.based on this faulty premise,pecg argues that when the legislature passed assembly bill approving the mou,the state exercised its option by choosing to contractually bind itself to the restrictions in provision.
not so.the state includes the executive branch and its agencies.it is illogical to interpret proposition mandate allowing the state to contract out architectural and engineering work as excluding such agencies.after all,it is through those agencies that the state conducts its business.for example,caltrans builds and maintains freeways and it is caltrans,not the legislature,that would contract for architectural and engineering services to accomplish this objective.in other words,it is governmental agencies,like caltrans,that the voters allowed to contract out for such services.
this interpretation of proposition is borne out by the ballot pamphlet argument in favor of the initiative.see delaney superior court cal d,ballot arguments are accepted sources from which to ascertain the voters intent.the ballot argument refers to california traffic congestion and the backlog of transportation projects needed to reduce this congestion,pointing out that caltrans simply can not do all the work alone and that the legislative analyst recommended that caltrans contract out more work.ballot,general november,argument in favor of,at.the ballot argument goes on to say that california got into this mess as the result of several lawsuits that essentially banned the state from hiring private architects and engineers.ibid.
this latter statement is an indirect reference to professional engineers,supra,cal th,d,which involved a lawsuit to enjoin caltrans from contracting out services.upholding the injunction based on the civil service mandate against contracting out work traditionally performed by the state,the supreme court indicated a constitutional amendment is necessary to change this mandate.id.at,d.the voters responded by amending the constitution with proposition.
provision of the mou in effect reinstates the civil service mandate against contracting out described in professional engineers.but california voters made clear their intent to eliminate existing civil service restrictions against contracting out architectural and engineering services.they did so with a new constitutional mandate that the state shall be allowed to contract out such services.no matter what discretion the legislature has purported to give or withdraw from government agencies,it does not have a free hand to approve mou or enact statutes that flout this mandate.california state personnel bd.california state employees,local,seiu,cal th,d.
pecg argues that we must harmonize the mou and proposition if possible,rather than find provision to be unconstitutional.
if a statute is susceptible of two constructions,one of which will render it constitutional and the other unconstitutional in whole or in part,or raise serious and doubtful constitutional questions,the court will adopt the construction which,without doing violence to the reasonable meaning of the language used,will render it valid in its entirety,or free from doubt as to its constitutionality,even though the other construction is equally reasonable.citations.the basis of this rule is the presumption that the legislature intended,not to violate the constitution,but to enact a valid statute within the scope of its constitutional powers.citation shealor city of lodi cal d.
pecg believes that provision and proposition can be harmonized because the terms of provision make clear the intent that it not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services,and that all determinations made pursuant to provision shall be through express mutual agreement with the affected state entity.thus,in pecg view,the mou is not unconstitutional because all of the determinations made,and actions taken,via provision are choices made by the state.
we already have rejected pecg claim that limitations imposed by provision on the contracting out for architectural and engineering services on public works projects always will be done with the agreement of the affected state entity.
and regardless of the purported intention not to apply provision in a manner that would result in the disruption of services,the fact remains that,as described ante,there are irreconcilable conflicts between proposition and provision,such that the two can not have concurrent operation dew appleberry cal d,citations omitted.
the trial court ruled that a permanent injunction was warranted based on the facial invalidity of the mou,which alone supports issuance of the writ.the court also found that,beyond the facial invalidity,implementation of the mou would cause great and irreparable injury to the public as well as to the parties to existing engineering service contracts.
pecg challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the permanent injunction,but confines its argument to the latter reason proffered by the trial court.it contends the court erred in permanently enjoining implementation of the mou because nothing in its terms caused irreparable injury to celsoc.the contention fails for three separate reasons.
first,pecg argument is not sufficient to meet its burden of establishing reversible error.to establish entitlement to relief on appeal,pecg must demonstrate that neither ground cited by the trial court supports the ruling.this is so because if the court decision is correct on any ground,it will be affirmed.estate of beard th,d.
pecg provides no argument or legal authority establishing that where a permanent injunction,as opposed to a preliminary injunction,is sought to prevent the implementation of a contract,irreparable injury must be shown even if the challenged contract is unconstitutional on its face.it is pecg responsibility to support its claims of error with citation and authority we are not obligated to perform that function on pecg behalf.in re marriage of nichols th,fn,d estate of hoffman d.
second,under principles of appellate review,pecg has forfeited its claim that the trial court determination is not supported by substantial evidence.where the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged,the appellant must set forth all of the evidence,not just the evidence in the appellant favor,and show how the evidence is deficient.foreman clark fallon cal d.it is not enough to merely point out that substantial evidence would support a judgment in the appellant favor.pecg has done only the latter.it simply says substantial evidence establishes that implementation of the mou will not result in any injury to the public or private sector because the mou provides it shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner that results in a disruption of services.pecg does not discuss any of the evidence submitted by celsoc to support its contention that it and the public would be injured by the implementation of the mou.thus,the claim of error is forfeited.foreman clark fallon,supra,cal d at.
in any event,applying the venerable substantial evidence test shapiro san diego city council,supra,th at,d,we conclude that ample evidence supports the trial court finding that implementation of provision of the mou will result in great and irreparable harm to the public and the parties to existing contracts for engineering services.
celsoc submitted the expert opinion of dan masdeo,an engineer who discussed existing dollar private engineering services contracts with the state and the likely effects of their termination.he explained that terminating these contracts,which were in the inspection and materials testing phases,would hamper inspections for compliance with the plans and specifications for projects,delay completion of the projects,adversely affect the process for paying claims for services rendered,and put the state of california at serious risk of economic loss and because nothing in the mou provides that the mandatory preference for using unit employees for future projects is inapplicable if it would be more cost effective to use outside engineers,the public would be deprived of any cost savings that accrues from the award of future contracts to private engineering firms.
celsoc evidence,the terms of the mou,and the logical inferences arising therefrom support the trial court finding that injury to the public arises from the disruption of ongoing projects and waste of scarce funds that would be caused by termination of existing contracts,as well as the loss of the benefits that would flow to it from future contracts,none of which are readily susceptible to measurement in monetary terms.the injury to the parties to existing contracts arises from the threatened loss of investments that have been made in order to perform contracts that may not be recoverable if their contracts are terminated pursuant to provision of the mou before their full anticipated term.
in concluding that provision of the mou does not violate article xxii,our dissenting colleague seizes on an argument that is not properly before us see,fn,ante because it was not raised in the trial court and,without good cause,pecg waited until its reply brief to raise it on appeal.neighbours buzz oates enterprises d,fn.
saying that article xxii does nothing more than allow state entities to contract with private companies for architectural and engineering services for public works of improvement,the dissent reasons that provision of the mou does not violate article xxii because the mou constitutes the affected state entities choice to limit their ability to do so.
the dissent errs for three reasons.first,pecg forfeited this purported basis for relief by failing to raise it in the trial court and by waiting,without good cause,until its reply brief to raise it on appeal.second,the record does not show that all of the affected state entities agreed to the mou.and third,even if the entities did agree to the mou,it runs afoul of the public policy decision the voters made when they adopted article xxii.
the proponents of article xxii asserted,and the voters agreed,that the state and its taxpayers would benefit from the unrestricted contracting out for architectural and engineering services for public works projects because such partnerships would be less costly and more efficient would speed up completion of backlogged highway,bridge,transit,and other projects and would eliminate undue political influence in the contracting process.initiative measure.in this light,article xxii directives that state entities shall be allowed to contract out for such services and that nothing in the constitution shall be construed to limit,restrict or prohibit state entities from doing so,mean the voters decided,as a matter of public policy,that there must be no limits on a state entity ability to so contract out.surely,allowing state agencies to impose upon themselves general limitations on such contracting out runs afoul of this public policy decision of the voters.
the dissent is also wrong in saying our decision transforms language permitting the state to contract with private entities into language compelling it to do so.nothing in our decision suggests state entities must contract out for architectural and engineering servic
