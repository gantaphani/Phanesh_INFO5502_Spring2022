hamm associates,hamm appeals the decision of the armed services board of contract appeals board upholding the contracting officer co decision denying hamm claim for an equitable adjustment.in re hamm,asbca,wl.at the board,hamm claimed,among other things,it was entitled to for additional policing work because of a defect in the specification whereby the government understated the policing acreage.although the board found that the contract between the navy and hamm was defective as to the policing acreage,it denied hamm claim for an equitable adjustment based on its finding that hamm was not misled by the defect.we conclude that this finding was not supported by substantial evidence because hamm relied on the understated policing acreage and the defect was not patent.we therefore reverse and remand for a quantum hearing.
background 
on october,the department of the navy navy awarded hamm a combination and contract.the portion of the contract included management and maintenance of family housing units and other real property at seven housing areas in or near norfolk,virginia.the contract provided for a base year and four option years.the base year as awarded covered a period,but a general accounting office award protest caused the navy to suspend contract performance from november,to april.upon resolution of the protest,the navy adjusted the term to cover a period beginning on april.thereafter,the navy exercised two options,the first for twelve months and the second for nine months.consequently,the contract lasted a total of months.
particularly relevant to this appeal,the contract required seasonal grass mowing and daily policing of the housing area grounds.to that end,the contract contained three specific line items,as follows 
section required general and prestige mowing weeks per year,from april through october.it also required daily policing of grounds for which lawn maintenance was required,in addition to all streets,sidewalks,playground areas,parking lots,gutters,and alleys.on april,hamm subcontracted with trident services for general and prestige mowing.over the course of the contract,both hamm and trident services employees performed the required policing work.
the board found that hamm discovered a discrepancy between the mowing and policing acreages in early after receiving a draft contract modification from the navy.after analyzing the contract information in more detail,hamm claims to have found that the acreages for both policing and mowing were essentially the same.noting that the policing acreage included both the mowing acreage plus the acreage for streets,sidewalks,playground areas,parking lots,gutters,and alleys,hamm concluded that the acreage for policing must have been understated.
on april,hamm requested a price modification from the co because of the understated policing acreage.the co denied the request.hamm then submitted a certified claim for on july,for additional acres of policing.thereafter,hamm hired a professional engineer to review the public works center pwc drawings attached to the contract drawings through r to determine the actual mowing and policing acreages.hamm expert calculated a total mowing area of acres and a total policing area of acres.comparing those results to the acreages listed in the contract,hamm expert found that both the mowing and policing acreages were understated.hamm therefore submitted a revised claim to the navy for for additional policing and for additional mowing on june,concurrently requesting a final contracting officer decision fcod.hamm later incorporated this claim into its consolidated request for equitable adjustment,submitted april,to address several contract issues.subsequently,hamm certified this request and submitted it for a fcod on august.the co issued a final decision on october,denying hamm consolidated request,including the claim for additional policing and mowing.
hamm timely appealed to the board on january.the consolidated appeals were docketed as asbca,with asbca,wl as the central appeal file.an administrative judge conducted hearings on the consolidated appeals on january.on april,the board issued a separate opinion addressing the mowing and policing appeals,identifying the opinion by the original docket number,asbca.in its opinion,the board upheld hamm claim for an equitable adjustment for additional mowing because the mowing acreages provided in the solicitation were understated by acres weekly and hamm was misled by this defect.hamm,asbca,slip op.at.the board also found that the policing acreage in the contract specification was erroneous.id.but the board denied hamm claim for the value of additional policing work,finding that hamm failed to show that it was misled by the understated policing acreage.in particular,the board found that hamm used the single mowing acreage of acres to propose conducting policing days per year.id.thus,because hamm policing proposal included only the mowing acres id.at,the board found that hamm failed to include any additional acreage for the streets,sidewalks,playground areas,parking lots,gutters,and alleys,id.at.having relied on the single mowing acreage to calculate its policing bid,the board found that hamm was not actually misled by the defective policing acreage.id.

we review a board decision by applying the standards of review set out in the contract disputes act of cda.under the cda,the board conclusions of law are reviewed without deference.b.the board findings of fact,however,shall not be set aside unless fraudulent,or arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.id.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.wickham contracting,fischer.the issue here is one of fact whether hamm was misled by the navy defective solicitation,which understated the policing acreage.
ii.analysis 
we conclude that the board finding that hamm was not misled by the defective specification is not supported by substantial evidence.based on the evidence before the board,it is clear that hamm did not erroneously rely on the single mowing acreage in assembling its bid hamm instead relied on the understated policing figure.moreover,the navy understatement of the policing acreage was not a patent defect.consequently,hamm may recover an equitable adjustment.
whenever the government uses specifications in a contract,there is an accompanying implied warranty that these specifications are free from errors.robins,united states,citing united states spearin.in order to recover an equitable adjustment based upon an erroneous specification,a contractor must show that it was misled by the error in the specification.id.conversely,w here the contractor is not misled,it can not claim an equitable adjustment.see also comtrol,united states,there can be no recovery if there was no reliance.thus,a claimant is not entitled to recover when it was aware of a defect in the specification at the time of entering into a contract.see wickham contracting,united states,see also robins,at refusing to grant contractor an equitable adjustment because contractor submitted bid knowing that the acreage figures were understated.in addition,a claimant is eligible for an equitable adjustment only if it can show that its conduct in preparing its bid was reasonable.highway,united states.as such,when a contractor is faced with an obvious omission,inconsistency or discrepancy of significance,he is obligated to bring the situation to the government attention if he intends subsequently to resolve the issue in his own favor.space united states.
we summarize the above rules as follows where a seeks to recover an equitable adjustment for additional work performed on account of a defective specification,the must show that it was misled by the defect.to demonstrate that it was misled,the must show both that it relied on the defect and that the defect was not an obvious omission,inconsistency or discrepancy of significance in other words,a patent defect that would have made such reliance unreasonable.
both hamm and the navy agree that this case involves a defective specification.they disagree,however,as to whether hamm was misled thereby.accordingly,in determining whether hamm is eligible for an equitable adjustment,we must decide,first,whether the board had substantial evidence to conclude that hamm did not rely on the defective specification in submitting its policing bid,and second,whether hamm was or should have been aware of the defect.
whether hamm relied on the defective specification 
on appeal,hamm contests the board finding that it was not misled by the defective specification,arguing that it relied on the policing acreage in submitting its bid.specifically,hamm notes,in calculating its bid using the navy engineering performance standards eps,it used the given total acreages for the contract performance period and the eps per acre information.as such,hamm claims it clearly was misled by the defective specification.moreover,while hamm admits that,at one point in its proposal,it relied on the single mowing acreage to assume only acres of policing work,it contends that this assumption served only to arrive at an estimated daily staffing requirement.in particular,hamm explains,because the solicitation required acres of policing,it used the single mowing acreage to estimate that the solicitation called for days per year of policing acres per year acres per day days per year.according to hamm,it therefore proposed policing only five days a week weeks x days federal holidays days,a proposal that the navy incorporated when it accepted hamm bid.but hamm emphasizes that this estimate of staffing requirements using the single mowing acreage did not affect its policing bid,which was wholly based on eps calculations using the annual policing figure.
in response,the navy argues that the board correctly determined that hamm failed to show it relied on the erroneous acreage figure when it prepared its proposal.instead,the navy argues,hamm relied on two erroneous assumptions when it offered to police according to the board findings acres daily for days per year.first,the navy contends that hamm proposed policing acres daily by erroneously relying on the miscalculated single mowing acreage in assembling its bid.given the requirements of section of the solicitation,which clearly notes that the daily acreage to be policed includes the single mowing acreage as well as additional acreage,the navy insists that hamm acted unreasonably.second,in light of the solicitation clear requirement in section for a workweek,the navy posits that hamm made another unreasonable assumption when it estimated policing duties were only required days a year.according to the navy,because hamm itself made mistaken and unreasonable assumptions,it can not claim it was misled by the erroneous policing acreage in the specification.
we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the board finding that hamm relied on the single mowing acreage in assembling its bid for policing work.as the navy notes here,hamm divided the yearly policing acreage by the single mowing acreage to estimate that the grounds required days of policing.on the basis of this calculation,the board erroneously concluded hamm proposal offered to police acres daily for days per year.hamm,asbca,slip op.at.this is not supported by substantial evidence.based on its estimated calculations,wherein hamm admittedly used the single mowing acreage,hamm proposed to police the grounds daily monday through friday annual policing days.contrary to the navy arguments,this workweek was fully incorporated into the contract.it is clear that hamm only used the single mowing acreage to arrive at a rough estimate of the daily staffing requirement,by which it then determined the appropriate workweek.this analysis in no way involved the calculation of the bid for the policing work itself.
with respect to the relevant portion of its bid,hamm in fact relied on the erroneous policing acreage from the specification.as borne out by the evidence below,hamm used the navy eps system to prepare its bid.first,hamm testified before the board that his company employed the navy eps system to calculate its proposal,using the acreages provided by the government.in particular,as demonstrated in the portion of its proposal titled staffing grounds maintenance service work,hamm performed its eps calculations using the understated policing value.in the subsection detailing the stated requirements in direct labor hours,hamm calculated the total hours for policing of grounds by multiplying the understated yearly policing acreage by the number of time hours per acre to arrive at a total of hours per year of policing.further,in determining the proposed grounds maintenance staff expressed in productive hours,hamm used this yearly hours total to derive the required number of annual policing staff,which ultimately led to the bid for work including policing services.
based on our analysis,we agree with hamm that the board did not have substantial evidence to support its finding that hamm was not misled by the defective specification in calculating its bid with respect to policing.while hamm did use the mowing acreage to estimate the appropriate workweek,it otherwise relied on the understated yearly policing acreage when calculating its policing bid.
whether the specification was patently defective 
having concluded that hamm relied on the understated policing acreage figure,we must still determine whether hamm was aware of or should have been aware of the defect such that it is not entitled to recover an equitable adjustment 
the navy contends that the annual policing acreage was a patent ambiguity and hamm should not,therefore,be entitled to recover.in making this argument,the navy primarily relies on the fact that the daily policing acreage was less than or equal to the single mowing acreage,which was contrary to section of the solicitation.this ambiguity would have been apparent to a reasonable person in the contractor position,according to the navy,based on the information available at the time of contracting.in particular,the navy points out,hamm could have calculated that the minimum annual policing acreage was at least acres based on the correct single mowing acreage of acres acres x days.as the navy notes,this calculated minimum already exceeds the stated yearly policing acreage,in clear contravention of section.finally,the navy argues that it would have been obvious from the pwc drawings that hamm proposal to police acres per day underestimated the policing requirements.thus,the navy asks us to find a patent ambiguity and,because hamm failed to inquire,to preclude hamm from recovering an equitable adjustment.
hamm disagrees,arguing that the understated policing acreage was not a patent ambiguity.first,hamm notes,the specification was not patently defective because the line items seemed reasonable on their face.according to hamm,the acres of mowing for the period acres of general mowing acres of prestige mowing were significantly lower than the acres of policing for the same time period,such that no patent ambiguity could be facially discerned.second,hamm contends that the fact that the single mowing and daily policing acreages were the same was not patent arriving at this information required reverse engineering the total acreages for mowing and policing,which itself involved a series of complicated calculations using figures from various sections of the specification.thus,hamm concludes,t he fact that these acreages are,according to the board,deducible by performing obtuse calculations and integrating various sections of the contract did not obligate hamm to verify a clear and on its face reasonable contract specification.appellant reply br.in arriving at this conclusion,hamm relies on michner united states.cch,available at wl.trial div,aff,to argue that bidders may rightfully rely on estimates even if measurements of scaled pwc drawings would have revealed the acreage differences,as long as the bidder acted reasonably.
we begin by noting that both the navy
