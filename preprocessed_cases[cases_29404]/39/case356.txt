pacific gas and electric disputes the meaning of two agreements between it and western area power administration,a federal entity that operates hydroelectric projects in the west.the agreements a contract and an amendment to the contract provide load shaping for western,give it access to power to balance western hydro supplies and enable it to offer customers firm service and they give access to western excess hydro power at prices lower than average costs.
under the agreements,the rate that charges western for energy is based on costs for thermal generation,producing power from its fossil fuel and nuclear plants.these costs became less obviously suitable as markers when california restructured its energy market in.then divested itself of most of its generation facilities,retaining only a single nuclear power plant and a small number of facilities.although still produces three times as much energy as western requires,its remaining plants are to provide services for western,and it now relies on market purchases in whole or in part for the energy it supplies western.it would like to be able to charge western the same price it pays.
the california restructuring also established an independent system operator iso,to which turned over the operation of its transmission facilities.as a result is now billed for several new services.it would like to have western cover some of these costs.
accordingly it filed a new rate schedule with the federal energy regulatory commission under of the federal power act fpa,changing its energy rates to reflect the new sources which are currently much more expensive and its transmission rates to reflect the new iso costs.ferc accepted the proposal for filing but suspended the rate increases for five months,as permitted by the statute,and set the matter for an evidentiary hearing.ferc,wl.as the right of a utility to effect rate changes via may be overridden by a contract between the parties,see federal power commission sierra pacific power.united gas pipe line mobile gas service,the was whether the agreements between and western barred the filing.
the alj ruled in favor of western,finding such a bar.she held that the agreements unambiguously precluded from using to change energy rates except in three specific circumstances,none of which applied.pacific gas alj opinion,ferc,at,wl.as to transmission rates,she found that had not complied with the contractual condition precedent of participating in a joint review of relevant cost information with western.id.at.ferc affirmed in a very brief order,ferc,wl,and denied petition for rehearing,ferc,wl.
as to the energy rates,we affirm.as to the transmission rates,we remand the case for the commission to reexamine the joint review issue,on which the alj opinion muddled the governing standard and failed to address seemingly significant fact claims.
the controlling agreements are contract the contract,executed july,and the energy account and capacity account repurchase rate letter agreement the letter agreement,dated february.article of the contract provides for joint review of the rates every five years,and,if the review fails to yield agreement,allows either party to seek ferc approval for changes.invoked article in filing under of the fpa for changes to both its energy and transmission rates.as to energy rates,the issues revolve entirely around new restrictions that ferc believed were added by the letter agreement as to transmission rates,they revolve entirely around article joint review process.
in reviewing ferc interpretation of contracts we first determine de novo any unambiguous meaning of the contract deference comes into the picture only if we find an ambiguity,in which case we defer to any reasonable resolution by ferc.appalachian power ferc,chevron natural res.def.council,d.another rule,on which all parties here agree,is that absent a finding of ambiguity parol evidence is inadmissible even to determine ambiguity.see,appalachian power,at appalachian power fed.power comm n.ferc findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.b.
energy rates.the letter agreement totally revamped the way energy rates are calculated under the contract.although the contract article provides for amendment via,amendments of the contract alone would be meaningless as to energy rates unless they could also bring about changes in the letter agreement.thus the key question is whether the letter agreement itself limits authority to use article to change the letter agreement energy rate terms.
the key language is found in two paragraphs of of the letter agreement 
except as expressly provided herein,nothing in this letter agreement shall be construed as affecting in any way right to make unilateral application to the ferc under section of the federal power act and pursuant to the commission rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to make the changes in rates,terms and conditions as set forth in section a of appendix a,and paragraph of appendix c,or to make changes to the service charges set forth in paragraph as provided in article of the contract.otherwise,this letter agreement shall not be subject to change pursuant to section of the federal power act unless agreed by the parties.
except as otherwise provided herein,nothing in this letter agreement shall be construed as affecting in any way the rights of western or under the federal power act 
letter agreement emphasis and bracketed enumeration added.we refer to the above as the first and second paragraphs of,although in fact there is an irrelevant prior paragraph.
the alj found that this language unambiguously limits right to file under for changes in the letter agreement energy rates,leaving only the three listed instances.agrees that it authorizes filings in these instances,but argues that these rights are in addition to rather than instead of the rights granted under article of the contract.
rather than attempting to prove that its interpretation is correct,directs most of its fire to the alj finding that the letter agreement was unambiguous,a ruling that barred admission of parol evidence.it first argues that ferc acknowledged ambiguity by ordering a hearing on the matter.but while a remand for a hearing may often indicate that a contractual provision is ambiguous,it may simply mean that it is difficult and indeed it is.
the listing of preserved rights in the first quoted sentence of is clearly directed at preventing an implied limitation of those rights.but it does not bode well for other rights since they are not expressly preserved and might elsewhere be expressly or impliedly limited.the next sentence establishes that restriction otherwise,this letter agreement shall not be subject to change pursuant to section of the federal power act unless agreed by the parties.this says rather clearly that can use to change the letter agreement energy rate computation methods only in the three enumerated categories.
argues that the clarity of that sentence is undermined by the first sentence of the next paragraph except as otherwise provided herein,nothing in this letter agreement shall be construed as affecting in any way the rights of western or under the federal power act it says that these two otherwise sentences either cancel each other mirror images of one they are utterly ambiguous,thereby necessitating the consideration of parol evidence respecting them.petitioner opening brief at.argument would be on much stronger footing if the second otherwise sentence lacked the opening phrase,except as otherwise provided herein as it is,the sentence acknowledges that other provisions in the letter agreement affect the rights of the parties under the federal power act.that the second otherwise sentence begins a new paragraph further suggests that it leaves in place the prior paragraph explicit restriction of rights.
the two paragraphs invite a straightforward and internally harmonious construction giving effect to each part.mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d.the otherwise sentence of the first paragraph explicitly limits all rights to change the letter agreement,with three enumerated exceptions the otherwise sentence of the
