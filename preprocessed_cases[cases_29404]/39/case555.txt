gardiner,kamya associates,gka appeals from a decision of the board of contract appeals bca of the department of housing and urban development hud,denying gka claim for a retroactive pricing adjustment in its contract with hud.we affirm.
background 
on may,gka and hud entered into indefinite quantity contract no,under whose terms hud agreed to purchase between and of various accounting services for the purpose of ensur ing the integrity of hud single family mortgage insurance program and protect ing the insurance fund.under the program,hud guaranteed certain mortgages.in the event that the mortgagor defaulted,the mortgagee could file a claim with hud for payment of the outstanding balance of the mortgage.hud did not conduct reviews of claims as they were filed,and for this reason hud hired gka to further review selected claims,ensure that the mortgagees complied with all applicable regulations,with mortgagees concerning any irregularities,provide technical support to mortgagees and hud and suggest improvements to hud processes.
the indefinite quantity contract adopted federal acquisition regulations governing such contracts.see to.as contemplated by the regulations the contract did not provide for any specific work to be done.rather,the specific tasks to be performed,pricing and other arrangements were to be negotiated separately for each task order.the regulations further state that the contractor is bound to perform all work called for in the task orders.the contractor shall furnish to the government,when and if ordered,the supplies or services specified.
in march the parties executed task orders and.under task order,gka agreed to provide reviews to ensure that mortgagees did not overbill hud and otherwise complied with hud requirements.the task order provided for a fixed unit price arrangement and required gka to invoice claims as they were actually processed.claims were divided into categories and assigned unit prices per claim reviewed for each category.the task order stated that the contractor shall perform reviews of claims,which were individually listed and categorized at the end of the task order.the task order calculated the price for review of all listed claims to be and accordingly allocated a total task order amount not to exceed nte.gka was not entitled automatically to any of these funds rather,gka was to be paid as it invoiced specific claims after reviewing them.task order provided for a fifteen month period of performance for gka to perform the reviews,measured from the task order effective date of march.task order was similar to task order in its pricing structure and period of performance.it required gka to perform reviews of the reviews.reviews involved reviewing mortgagees responses to gka requests for more information or documentation,made during the reviews.like task order,task order categorized claims and provided a fixed price per review of each category.a task order amount not to exceed nte was allocated for task order,but as with task order,gka had to invoice claims as they were reviewed to be paid.
the fixed unit prices per claim listed in the task orders were calculated by estimating the number of hours of work required,multiplying them by an hourly rate for particular types of employees doing the work,and adding the results to obtain a fixed price for each claim.hud never independently estimated the number of hours required rather,the estimates of number of hours required to perform claims reviews were derived from estimates used in a prior contract between hud and another contractor,irvin burton associates.during the negotiations for task orders and,gka sought higher prices per review than those finally adopted in the task orders.gka contended that the estimates,which were also used in earlier task orders,underestimated the time required and that it had to spend many more hours to perform the claims reviews.hud refused to change the prices.eventually,gka agreed to hud proposed prices for task orders and.
in the spring of the end of the period of performance of task orders and was approaching,but gka had not finished reviewing the claims that those task orders originally required.the record does not disclose whether gka had a legitimate excuse for failing to perform the required work under task orders and within the allotted period.but whether it did or not,hud desired gka to continue the work beyond the time allotted for completion.hud decided to seek a six month extension to allow gka time to finish the claim reviews at the original contract prices.although hud did not wish to alter the unit prices of the task orders,gka again insisted that the fixed prices then in force did not properly reflect the number of hours that gka worked.hud explicitly stated its disagreement.
during these negotiations over the modification,gka submitted invoices for past work in amounts in excess of the authorized task order prices.hud immediately rejected the invoices and directed gka not to bill in excess of the fixed prices established by the task orders.
the bca found that during negotiations there was no understanding on the repricing issue.gka president chris gardiner gardiner and another gka official testified that they had a meeting in july with a hud official,who allegedly promised that adjustments would be retroactive and cover all work,including reviews already invoiced and paid for,completed under task orders and.the bca found that hud did not share this understanding,and it is undisputed that gardiner did not advise any of the hud contracting officers of the alleged conversation.on october,gardiner sent a letter to hud expressing his understanding that a djustments w ould be made to the old rates at the conclusion of this review,if necessary.gka w ould then be compensated for the difference between the new and old rates,if necessary.the bca found that this letter did not affirmatively convey gka alleged view that the repricing was to be retroactive.
in november the parties executed modification to task order and modification to task order collectively,modification.modification had an effective date of july.while the parties dispute whether that modification provided for retroactive pricing of the work already performed,they agree that it provided that gka would continue the unfinished work under task orders and and that the parties would consider adjustment of the pricing for the continuing work.the modification provided in relevant part 
the purpose of this modification is to definitize contracting officer verbal authorization of july,to continue the services under the existing statement of work and,extend the performance period of this agreement by additional six months.
the period of performance is hereby modified to read twenty one months from the effective date of award 
the contractor shall continue performance of the services required under this task order at the same unit price per review specified for the respective categories on page of the task order.such prices shall remain in effect pending results of the audit and subsequent negotiations of the unit prices.
as contemplated by modification,the defense contract audit agency dcaa performed an audit in late.the hours that the dcaa audit found gka actually worked were greater than the estimates used to calculate the prices of the original task orders and.accordingly,hud permitted adjustment of the prices during the extension period after july,on july,gka wrote to a hud contracting officer claiming an entitlement to have task orders and repriced retroactively to march.hud promptly refused,in writing,to adjust prices retroactively to the date.
gka appealed the contracting officer denial of repricing retroactive to to the bca on january.the bca conducted a hearing.in its first decision,the bca held that gka was not entitled to a retroactive pricing adjustment because modification was unenforceable insofar as it might be construed to give a retroactive price adjustment.the bca held that modification lacked adequate consideration to reprice task orders and retroactively because gka was already obligated to perform the work under the original task orders and.gka
