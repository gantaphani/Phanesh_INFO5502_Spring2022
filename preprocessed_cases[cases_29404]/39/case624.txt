background 
in september,forman signed a plea agreement with the fbi resulting from charges against him arising from an fbi investigation,entitled operation thimble.this investigation targeted clothing industry corruption involving defense contracts awarded by the defense personnel support center.operation thimble investigated allegations of corruption of many parties involved in government contracting,including those that offered bribes,private business consultants,and those that accepted them,federal procurement officials.one of the private consultants targeted was jules wertheimer wertheimer,a consultant in the industry.evidence obtained by the fbi against wertheimer,however,was insufficient for any criminal charges.in order to develop a stronger case against wertheimer,the fbi enlisted forman aid.forman,in an effort to reduce his own sentence resulting from operation thimble,signed a formal agreement the agreement to cooperate actively with the fbi in the investigation targeting wertheimer,entitled operation extra gold.
the agreement,the interpretation of which is ultimately the subject of this appeal,was relatively short less than five pages and signed by forman and an authorized agent of the fbi.the most critical paragraphs are reproduced below 
the fbi shall reimburse forman for expenses incurred by him which are deemed by the fbi to be reasonable and in furtherance of this investigation.forman agrees that prior to incurring such expenses,he will consult with the fbi designated representative as to the nature and justification for incurring expenses.the fbi has the right to direct forman not to incur expenses which the fbi deems not to be in furtherance of its investigative goals.

emphases added.
forman role in operation extra gold was to establish and operate a textile company known as.to the outside observer,was a legitimate,enterprise that manufactured and marketed a patented fireproof fabric referred to as sandel.forman licensed rights from the patent owner,daniel ferziger ferziger,to make and sell sandel.forman promoted through advertising,seminars,video sales presentations,literature,and sales trips.he hired and employed a salesman,one martin reiser reiser,to help develop the company business.he also contacted former procurement officials at various government agencies in attempts to market sandel.also attracted the attention of an outside investor,northeast investors corporation northeast.northeast,however,was an entirely fictitious front company,composed solely of undercover agents ucas of the fbi.forman,through,provided an entry point for the ucas into the clothing industry and the potential identification of corrupt practices and its perpetrators.
forman made the first introductions of the ucas to the ultimate target of operation extra gold,wertheimer.his cooperation,however,extended beyond simple introductions.forman often wore concealed wires and made recordings of conversations.he also testified at grand jury and trial proceedings for the fbi.in fact,during forman sentencing after the conclusion of operation extra gold,the district court judge characterized forman cooperation as exceptional.ultimately,operation extra gold led to the arrest and conviction of wertheimer and others.forman testified,in accordance with paragraph of the agreement,at wertheimer trial in september.
after testifying at wertheimer trial,forman requested reimbursement from the fbi for certain expenses incurred during the course of the undercover operation,including general travel expenses and related costs,sandel production and marketing costs,advertising and seminar expenses,loans to the sandel patentee,ferziger,an exclusive license for sandel,and salary and expenses related to forman hiring of reiser.
forman request for reimbursement of all these expenses was denied by the fbi on june.the fbi chief contracting officer later denied forman appeal with the exception of in travel expenses on april,because forman failed to obtain authorization from the fbi before incurring the expenses,in violation of the contract.in july,forman filed a complaint with the court of federal claims.the court denied the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.contrary to the government assertions that the statute of limitations began to run when the expenses were incurred,the court noted that the fbi denied forman claim for reimbursement in june,and by filing suit by july,he was well within the statute of limitations under the tucker act.nevertheless,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment for the government,stating that the agreement required explicit prior approval of expenses by the fbi,which forman never obtained.forman filed a timely appeal with this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
whether we have jurisdiction to adjudicate a particular issue on appeal is a question of law.palmer barram.interpretation of a government contract is a question of law,subject to de novo review on appeal.sanchez son united states.the grant of summary judgment on a question of law is subject to de novo review.seaboard lumber united states.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c anderson liberty lobby,d.
on appeal,the government first argues that the court of federal claims erred by hearing forman appeal.the government asserts that the court lacked jurisdiction for two reasons.first,it argues that operation extra gold last investigative activity was concluded in january,over eight years prior to the case being brought to the court of federal claims,well outside the statute of limitations under the tucker act.see.second,the government argues that pursuant to the contract disputes act cda,the statute of limitations had tolled when forman brought his appeal from the june,decision of the fbi chief contracting officer in july.see a.
the court of federal claims may not consider claims and grant relief against the government,absent statutory authority.united states testan,d.this authority must be strictly construed.hart united states.in the case of the court of federal claims,one example of statutory authority to consider claims is based on the tucker act.the statute of limitations is an express limitation on the tucker act waiver of sovereign immunity.soriano united states,d hart,at.indeed,e very claim of which the united states claims court has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.the claim first accrues when all events have occurred that fix government liability and entitle the claimant to institute an action.hart,at.therefore,when forman performance of the contract was complete,fbi liability was fixed,the claim first accrued,and the statute of limitations began to run.we must determine,then,the time at which forman performance was complete.this determination requires interpretation of the contract.
in interpreting a contract,w e begin with the plain language.mcabee,united states.we give the words of the agreement their ordinary meaning unless the parties mutually intended and agreed to an alternative meaning.harris dep t of veterans affairs.the court generally does not resort to parol evidence when the provisions in the contract are clear and unambiguous.mcabee,at,but,metric constructors,aeronautics space,addressing the use of extrinsic evidence of trade practice and custom in contract interpretation of unambiguous terms.in addition,w e must interpret the contract in a manner that gives meaning to all of its provisions and makes sense.id.
as neither party argues that a mutually intended and agreed to alternative meaning exists,we must construe the contract as written,without reliance on any parol evidence.paragraph indicates that the agreement shall continue as long as the fbi deemed that forman services are required.those services included running as a legitimate business for operation extra gold.contrary to the fbi assertion,however,forman participation pursuant to the agreement was not limited simply to investigative activities,operating and surreptitiously recording conversations.paragraph of the agreement specifically points out that forman would testify when directed by the fbi.thus,testifying was one of the services forman agreed to perform.indeed,assistant attorney hoffa hoffa indicated in a december,letter to the defense logistics agency that forman cooperation as a witness in operation extra gold was a necessary service.hoffa wrote that i n,forman executed his plea agreement and from that date until september of this year he worked with the fbi in supporting their operation.hoffa also noted that a s part of his cooperation,forman testified in the grand jury and at trial.
therefore,forman completed his duties under the agreement when he testified for the united states against wertheimer in september,as required by the agreement and as expected by the fbi.that testimony,the final step of forman cooperation with the fbi,fixed the time from which the potential liability of the government began to run.to read paragraph out of the contract,to assert,as the government does,that forman testimony was not a required aspect of the contract would indeed vitiate the requirement of that provision.accordingly,forman had six years from september,to file his claim with the court of federal claims.see.forman filed his complaint in july of.thus,the court of federal claims had jurisdiction to hear the case 
having determined that jurisdiction is proper,we turn to the merits of the case,primarily whether the contract provides for reimbursement of various expenses incurred by forman.a contract is read in accordance with its express terms and the plain meaning thereof.sanchez son,at.the court of federal claims read paragraph of the agreement to mean that plaintiff was required to obtain specific approval before incurring expenses for which he expected to be reimbursed.emphasis added.the government contends both in its brief and at oral argument that it is not required to reimburse forman for any expenses for which he did not obtain express approval before proceeding with the expenditure.forman,on the other hand,argues that all that was required under paragraph was that he consult with the fbi before incurring any expenses.forman contends only after consulting with the fbi could the fbi choose not to reimburse him for the amounts in question.in instances where the fbi did not prohibit forman from incurring the expenses,forman argues that those expenses were at least implicitly approved by the fbi.
we find the position adopted by the government is not supported by the plain language of the agreement.on its face,paragraph clearly does not require explicit or specific rather,that forman consult with the fbi designated representative as to the nature and justification for incurring expenses.additionally,paragraph of the agreement clearly states that the only expenses reimbursable by the fbi were those that are deemed by the fbi to be reasonable and in furtherance of this investigation.after consultation,if the fbi deemed the expenses not to be in furtherance of its investigative goals,it could instruct forman not to incur those expenses.thus,if forman consulted with the fbi regarding an expense,forman would be responsible for that expense if the fbi directed him not to incur it.
other paragraphs in the agreement,however,explicitly limit the expenses the fbi is required to reimburse.nothing in the agreement indicates forman was not entitled to any legitimate profits from operating.indeed,the agreement memorializes the parties intent that forman would operate a legitimate,business and keep legitimately generated profits.only paragraph limits the profits that forman would be entitled to forman will not economically benefit personally when entering into contractual agreements with the government when the following occurs the fbi has requested forman to formally solicit the government business and the subsequent contract has been tainted by deceit,bribery or fraud caused by the undercover investigation.paragraph of the agreement indicates that the fbi would not be responsible for any economic losses that forman would incur during his cooperation with the fbi.paragraph does note that the fbi would finance any and presumably,only investigative expenses of the investigation.
it follows then,from the plain language of the agreement,that economic gains and losses on the part of forman that arose while maintaining as a legitimate business would be borne by forman himself.economic gains resulting from any tainted government business would not accrue to forman,and any losses that resulted from the fbi investigation would be borne by the fbi.the fbi,not forman,was entitled to any gains that were tainted,in accordance with paragraph.under paragraph,the fbi,not forman,would direct and finance the investigative aspect of the agreement.thus,summary judgment was proper if,under the plain language of the agreement,there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding which party either forman or the fbi was responsible for any particular expense.
expenses that were in furtherance of the investigation were to be paid for by the fbi,provided forman consulted the fbi prior to incurring such expenses.conversely,any expenses related to the legitimate business operation of are beyond the scope of reimbursement.there are six types of specific expenses in this case general travel expenses and related costs sandel production and marketing costs advertising and seminar expenses loans to ferziger the sandel license and reiser salary.we will address each in turn.
