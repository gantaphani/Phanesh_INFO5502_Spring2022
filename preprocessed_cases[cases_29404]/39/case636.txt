as the directors and principal officers of wilmette,maher and gravee played a large role in negotiating the terms of the merger that formed horizon.maher and gravee allege that as part of these negotiations,the government required them to give up their existing pension plans from wilmette with the understanding that horizon could create comparable benefits for them when it became financially stable.in addition,the government allegedly required maher and gravee to become the directors and principal officers of horizon.after these negotiations,horizon was duly formed upon the execution of three merger agreements in march of,followed by a vote of approval by the board of directors on november.in,horizon reestablished pension benefits for maher and gravee by creating a deferred compensation trust.horizon established a second deferred compensation trust in.the establishment of these trusts was reflected in employment and compensation agreements between horizon and the appellants.

the ots declared horizon insolvent in early,placing horizon into a receivership directed by the rtc.maher and gravee continued as directors and officers until june,when the rtc terminated their employment.they then sought to obtain the proceeds of their deferred compensation trusts,but the rtc ordered the trustee,harris bank,not to disburse the trust proceeds.maher and gravee subsequently sued harris bank,horizon,and the rtc to recover the proceeds of the deferred compensation trusts.the rtc asserted in defense that the trusts violated certain regulations and counterclaimed for recovery of bonuses paid to maher and gravee.after a bench trial,the united states district court for the northern district of illinois ruled in the rtc favor,finding that the trusts violated and that the bonuses violated.maher harris trust sav.bank,c,dist.lexis.the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit affirmed,noting that while plaintiffs may have vested contractual rights to their deferred compensation,the property interests plaintiffs acquired as a result of the trusts are void and the trust assets will be shared by all persons with proper claims against horizon.maher harris trust sav.bank,cir.
while maher and gravee appeal was pending at the seventh circuit,the rtc sued all of the directors of horizon,including maher and gravee,for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,negligence,and gross negligence in the operation of horizon leading to losses in excess of million.the outside directors all of horizon former directors but for maher and gravee,who were inside directors because they were the only directors employed by horizon counterclaimed for breach of contract and brought a complaint against the ots in its capacity as successor to the fhlbb,and against the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in its capacity as successor to the fslic.maher and gravee filed a separate answer to the rtc complaint,along with counterclaims against the rtc,ots,and fdic.on june,pursuant to a settlement agreement,the district court dismissed the pleadings involving the outside directors and,at the same time,transferred the counterclaims of maher and gravee to the court of federal claims.maher and gravee then filed an amended complaint at the court of federal claims on february,naming the united states as a defendant,acting through the rtc,ots,and fdic.
the government moved to dismiss the amended complaint,arguing that the claims were time barred,the transfer was improper,the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,and maher and gravee failed to plead a claim for which relief could be granted.the court of federal claims granted the motion to dismiss,stating 
contracts are formed through an exchange of promises through commitments to act or refrain from acting in a specified way that are evidenced in a writing or are inferable from conduct.we have neither writing nor conduct here.plaintiffs were not parties to the government supervisory merger agreement with the bank,they cite no language in that agreement supportive of the promises they now allege,and they reference no course of dealing between the parties from which the existence of such promises might reasonably be inferred.rather,the whole of plaintiffs case rests on the naked proposition that,by entering into a contract with the bank,the government entered into a contract with them as well or,alternatively,that as part of its contract with the bank,the government also assumed special commitments for their benefit.the argument can not succeed.

according to maher and gravee,the 
gravamen of their complaint is that the government acting under and through its agencies,whether it be the ots,the rtc or fdic,breached its contractual obligations to horizon and thus to maher and gravee by changing the regulatory framework under which the government had initially induced horizon to merge with several failed thrift institutions in the early.
