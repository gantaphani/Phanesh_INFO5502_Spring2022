we are called upon to determine whether the united states constitution imposes any limit on the city of honolulu power to repudiate a contract to convey property to a private citizen in connection with its leasehold conversion program.
in,the city and county of honolulu the city enacted an ordinance,later codified at chapter of the revised ordinances of honolulu chapter,which created a mechanism allowing owners of leasehold interests in condominium units to convert their leasehold interests into fee interests by using the city power of eminent domain we upheld the constitutionality of chapter in richardson city and county of honolulu,cir.as we explained in that case,chapter was a response to hawaii long history of feudal land ownership,which survived well after american acquisition.id.at.at the time of chapter enactment,a small handful of landowners owned the vast majority of land in the state.despite the efforts of hawaii leaders to divide these large hawaiian land estates,the system persisted,driving the price of land in hawaii to exorbitant heights.taking advantage of this status quo,hawaiian landowners rarely sold their estates.instead,they frequently leased their land for long terms,often to developers who would construct condominiums on the property and then sell the units subject to the ground lease.id.at.
to break up this pattern and to increase the opportunity for land ownership,the city enacted chapter.chapter provided that when a sufficient number of condominium unit owners within a condominium complex applied,the city would take steps to acquire the property on which their condominium complex was built from the landowner by power of eminent domain.the city would then convey each condominium unit and the appurtenant land to the in fee simple.
specifically,chapter required an application from a minimum of either condominium owners within a development or the owners of at least of the condominium units within the development to trigger its condemnation mechanism.revised ordinances of honolulu a.upon such application,the city department of housing and community development the department would hold a public hearing to determine whether the acquisition of the property though eminent domain would effectuate public purposes as defined in chapter.id.a.if the department issued a finding answering that question in the affirmative,the department would initiate condemnation proceedings unless the landowner agreed to convey the fee interests to the directly.id.finally,before condemnation could begin,the city council was required to adopt a resolution approving the exercise of eminent domain and appropriating the necessary funds to pay just compensation.city county of honolulu rules for residential condominium,cooperative and planned development leasehold conversion.
sally matsuda and the other appellants in this suit the lessees hold leasehold interests in condominium units at the discovery bay condominium complex in honolulu,hawaii.the lessees applied to the city under chapter to convert their leasehold interests into fee simple interests in their units and the appurtenant land.upon receipt of the lessees applications,the city entered into individual written contracts with each lessee in which the lessee promised to pay the city in exchange for the city promise that,upon its successful acquisition of the property at discovery bay,the city would convey a fee interest to each lessee in her unit and the appurtenant land.each contract was expressly conditioned on the city successful acquisition of the property pursuant to chapter,and each party agreed to use its best efforts to effectuate the acquisition.
on july,after a public hearing,the department announced its finding that condemnation of the property at discovery bay would serve the public purpose required by chapter.a few months later,in late october or early november,the lessees received written notice of their final approval to proceed with chapter leasehold conversion procedure.finally,on november,the department designated the lessees leasehold interests in the real property and other common elements at discovery bay for acquisition through the city exercise of eminent domain,finding that the lessees had satisfied chapter numerosity requirement,that the condemnation would effectuate the public purpose of chapter,and that no agreement for a voluntary sale by the landowner had been made.
as the lessees application was progressing,however,the honolulu city council began considering a proposed bill that would repeal chapter.as the proposed bill statement of purpose explained,some members of the council had determined that chapter goal of provid ing affordable housing and strengthen ing the economy through fee ownership had largely been satisfied,rendering the provision unnecessary.
on november,a councilmember introduced a measure seeking a city council resolution to approve the initiation of condemnation proceedings at discovery bay.even though the lessees applications had met all the requirements of chapter,the council deferred consideration of the resolution pending the possible repeal of chapter.
on january,the council enacted ordinance,repealing chapter.the ordinance permitted any condemnation proceeding approved by city council resolution before the effective date of the repeal to continue,but because the city council never took such a step to approve the condemnation of the property at discovery bay,the project failed.
the lessees filed suit against the city in the district court,arguing that ordinance violated the contracts clause,the fourteenth amendment due process clause,and,and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief shortly thereafter,the lessees moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the implementation of the ordinance,which the district court denied.the lessees then filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court denied as well,granting summary judgment in favor of the city instead.matsuda city and county of honolulu,d.the district court concluded that the lessees could not challenge ordinance under the contracts clause because the lessees contracts with the city were unenforceable.it reasoned that the reserved powers doctrine precluded the city from entering into the contracts because they purported to limit the city discretion over the use of its eminent domain power,a power which has been labeled an essential attribute of sovereignty.id.at quoting united states winstar,d.
