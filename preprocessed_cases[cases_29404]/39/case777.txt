introduction 
this case presents an issue of first impression is a city decision to enter into a contract with the county sheriff for law enforcement services,rather than continue to provide such services through the city own police department,subject to the meet and confer requirements of the act mmba,et we answer the question in the affirmative,and we therefore affirm the trial court decision on the issue.
ii.facts and procedural background 
the city of rialto city is a general law city,and its city council city council is its elected body,responsible for policy oversight of city operations.the rialto police department rpd,headed by a police chief,serves as the law enforcement arm of the city.the rialto police benefit association rpba is the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit consisting of all of the police officers and most of the civilian personnel employed by the rpd.
from january through the end of december,the city and rpba were parties to a memorandum of understanding mou.in september,the city administrator submitted a staff report to the city council recommending that the city council accept the proposal of,and authorize the execution of,a contract with the san bernardino county sheriff department sheriff department to provide all law enforcement services for the city.on september,the day of the meeting at which the city council would vote on how future law enforcement services would be handled for the city,the city delivered a letter to the rpba and offered to meet and confer on the effects of the potential decision to contract with the sheriff department,but not on the decision itself.
hours later,after public comment and council discussions,the city council voted to cede authority over law enforcement to the sheriff department.the rpba filed a complaint and petition for writ of mandate seeking to compel the city to meet and confer with regard to the decision to contract with the sheriff department and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief barring the city from entering into the contract.
the rpba moved for a temporary restraining order tro and an order to show cause regarding the preliminary injunction.the city opposed the motion.following a hearing,the trial court granted a tro enjoining the city from implementing a contract with the sheriff department for law enforcement services.
following a later hearing,the trial court issued a preliminary injunction to the same effect as the tro.on november,the trial court held a hearing on the merits.thereafter,the trial court granted a writ of mandate setting aside the city council decision and directing the parties to meet and confer to discuss the issues.
after meeting and conferring pursuant to the judgment and writ,the city ratified and entered into a new mou with the rpba.the city agreed not to contract out law enforcement services,at least during the term of the new mou 
the city filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court in case no.we denied that petition 
other facts are set forth in the discussion of the issues to which they pertain.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
this appeal presents a question of interpretation and application of the act et and does not turn on the resolution of disputed facts.thus,the issues raised in this appeal are subject to de novo review by this court see usher county of monterey th,d,and we are not required to give deference to the trial court ruling or the reasons for its ruling see rodriguez solis th,d.
labor relations between the city and the rpba are governed by the mmba,and under the mmba,the city and the rpba have a duty to meet and confer over matters within the scope of representation as defined in section.however,e ven if the parties meet and confer,they are not required to reach an agreement because the employer has the ultimate power to refuse to agree on any particular issue.citation.claremont police officers city of claremont cal th,d,claremont police officers,quoting building material construction teamsters union farrell cal d,building material.
matters within the scope of representation include,among other things,wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment.but the merits,necessity or organization of any service or activity provided by law or executive order are excepted from the meet and confer requirement.see also claremont police officers,supra,cal th at,d.
as the court in claremont police officers noted,the definition s of scope of representation and its exceptions are arguably vague and overlapping.citations.w ages,hours and working conditions,broadly read could encompass practically any conceivable bargaining proposal and merits,necessity or organization of any service expansively interpreted,could swallow the whole provision for collective negotiation and relegate determination of all labor issues to the city discretion.citation.claremont police officers,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,in building material,supra,cal d at page,the court established a balancing test for determining whether a meet and confer requirement applies to management decisions.see also claremont police officers,supra,cal th at,d,holding that the same test applies to the implementation of fundamental managerial and policy decisions.the court in claremont police officers set forth that test as follows first,we ask whether the management action has a significant and adverse effect on the wages,hours,or working conditions of the employees.citation.if not,there is no duty to meet and confer.citations.second,we ask whether the significant and adverse effect arises from the implementation of a fundamental managerial or policy decision.if not,then,as in building material,the requirement applies.citation.third,if both factors are an action taken to implement a fundamental managerial or policy decision has a significant and adverse effect on the wages,hours,or working conditions of the apply a balancing test.the action is within the scope of representation only if the employer need for unencumbered decisionmaking in managing its operations is outweighed by the benefit to relations of bargaining about the action in question.citation.in balancing the interests to determine whether parties must meet and confer over a certain matter,a court may also consider whether the transactional cost of the bargaining process outweighs its value.claremont police officers,supra,cal th at,d.
here,without question,the city decision to enter into a contract with the sheriff department for law enforcement services affects wages,hours,and conditions of employment of the city police officers within the meaning of the first inquiry under building material.in building material,the city and county of san francisco unilaterally eliminated certain bargaining unit positions,reorganized and reclassified the duties of hospital truck drivers who belonged to the union,and transferred work duties to new positions not covered by the bargaining unit.building material,supra,cal d at.the city and county of san francisco then denied the union request to meet and confer regarding the action on the ground that the matter was outside the scope of the requirements of the mmba.building material,supra,at.the supreme court held,however,that the city and county of san francisco were required to meet and confer with the union because the transfer of duties to a nonbargaining unit had a significant and adverse effect on the bargaining unit wages,hours,and working conditions.id.at.
in reaching its holding,the court in building material cited with approval fibreboard nlrb,d fibreboard and soule glass and glazing cir soule,abrogated on other grounds in nlrb curtin matheson,footnote,d.building material,supra,cal d at.in fibreboard,the supreme court held that the contracting out of work being performed by employees in the bargaining unit was within the literal meaning of the phrase terms and conditions of employment,and as such,was a statutory subject of collective bargaining.fibreboard,at,d.the court explained,a stipulation with respect to the contracting out of work performed by members of the bargaining unit might appropriately be called a condition of employment.the words even more plainly cover termination of employment which,as the facts of this case indicate,necessarily results from the contracting out of work performed by members of the established bargaining unit.id.at.see also soule,supra,at holding that the employer must bargain with respect to the decision to remove work from bargaining unit employees,not merely its effects on the employees dublin professional fire fighters,local valley community services dist.d.dublin professional fire fighters recognizing that the transfer of bargaining unit work to nonbargaining unit employees was a proper subject of negotiations.
here,however,the city contends its action was not contracting out work because the city instead changed the direction and scope of its enterprise by getting out of the business of law enforcement.significantly,the city did not eliminate police services but instead entered into an arrangement under which the sheriff department would provide such services.as the court stated in building material,it is clear that the permanent transfer of work away from a bargaining unit often has a significant effect on the wages,hours,and working conditions of employees.citations.courts have found violations of the duty to bargain,for example,when an employer has transferred work to an independent contractor citations or to established or newly hired employees outside the bargaining unit citations.building material,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.in fire fighters union,supra,cal d,as relevant to the situation currently before us,the court stated,in some situations,such as that in which a layoff results from a decision to subcontract out bargaining unit work,the decision to subcontract and lay off employees is subject to bargaining.citation.id.at.similarly,in dublin professional fire fighters,supra,d,the court concluded that reassigning overtime to temporary personnel was subject to bargaining.id.at.and in interpreting a public labor relations statute similar to the mmba,the educational employment relations act,the court in san diego adult educators public employment relations bd.d,held that a college district had engaged in an unfair labor practice by contracting with an independent agency to provide instruction on a college campus without bargaining with the union.the court stated,the transfer of work from existing employees to employees of others by subcontracting the work is a decision which requires negotiation with the union.it is therefore an unfair practice for an employer unilaterally to shift work by means of contracting the services previously done by its employees to an outside entity.id.at,citing fibreboard,supra,d.based on the above authorities,it is clear that the city decision was subject to the meet and confer requirement under the first part of the test set forth in building material.
the second question under the building material test is whether the public entity decision is excepted from the duty to bargain under the merits,necessity,or organization language of section.building material,supra,cal d at.in state of real property agents state personnel bd.d,for example,the court found that a reduction in workforce because of economic necessity was a fundamental management policy decision within the scope of section.state of real property agents state personnel,supra,d at.in that case,the court held that the effects of the decision had been adequately addressed through meeting and conferring.id.at.
in building material,as in the present case,the public entity argued,citing first national maintenance nlrb,d first national maintenance,among other cases,that the decision to transfer work to employees outside the bargaining unit came within the fundamental managerial policy exception to the mmba,even though layoffs might result.building material,supra,cal d at.in distinguishing the cases on which the public entity relied,the court explained,decisions to close a plant or to reduce the size of an entire workforce,however,are of a different order from a plan to transfer work duties between various employees.the former directly affect the amount of work that can be accomplished or the nature and extent of the services that can be provided,and are therefore fundamental management decisions.the decision to transfer work to nonunit employees in this case had no effect on the services provided by the hospital,but directly affected the wages,hours,and working conditions of the hospital employees.id.at.the court held that the decision to reorganize certain work duties was hardly fundamental.it had little,if any,effect on public services.rather,it primarily impacted the wages,hours,and working conditions of the employees in question and thus was a proper subject for mandatory collective bargaining.indeed,defendants claim to the contrary is in conflict with the statutory framework of the mmba any issue involving wages,for example,would affect the cost of government services,but such matters are specifically included in the scope of representation as defined in section.building material,supra,cal d at.
the public entity in building material further argued that its action involved a matter of fundamental policy because it involved the economical and efficient operation of local government,and as such was exempt from the bargaining requirements of the mmba.building material,supra,cal d at.in rejecting that argument,the court explained that the cases on which the public entity relied were distinguishable.in berkeley police city of berkeley d,for example,the court held that the city was not required to bargain prior to a decision to allow a member of the citizen police review commission to attend police department hearings regarding citizen complaints against police and to send a member of the department to review commission meetings.in san jose peace officer city of san jose d.san jose,the court approved the city change of policy regarding the use of deadly force by police officers.in building material,the court stated that the burden of requiring an employer to confer about such fundamental decisions clearly outweigh ed the benefits to relations that bargaining would provide.building material,supra,cal d at.
none of these existing authorities provides a clear resolution of the issue whether the city decision fell within the exception for fundamental management decisions under section.it is nonetheless unnecessary for us to resolve the if we assume for purposes of argument that the decision to contract out police services to the sheriff department was a fundamental policy decision within the meaning of section,our inquiry does not end.rather,we then proceed to the third step of the building material inquiry when a decision has both a significant and adverse effect on the wages,hours,or working conditions of the employees and is taken pursuant to a fundamental managerial or policy decision,it is still within the scope of bargaining if the employer need for unencumbered decisionmaking in managing its operations is outweighed by the benefit to relations of bargaining about the action in question.citations.building material,supra,cal d at,citing first national maintenance,supra,at,and berkeley police city of berkeley,supra,d at.
in resolving the third inquiry,we first note that the city decision did not involve discontinuing the provision of public safety services rather,it involved the transfer of such services from city employees to the sheriff department.as such,the decision primarily involved a matter of wages,hours or working conditions.see san jose,supra,d at.reasoning that managerial decisions were subject to meet and confer requirements if they primarily involved working conditions.thus,in san jose,the court held that changes to a policy regarding the use of force by police officers were not subject to mandatory meet and confer requirements because we can not say that the use of force policy concerns primarily a matter of wages,hours or working conditions.id.at.
here,on appeal,the city characterizes its decision to contract out services as a relations issue and focuses on the public safety of its citizens as the motivation for the decision.however,the staff r
