this case concerns the constitutionality of section,which,in relevant part,sets a goal that five percent of federal defense contracting dollars for each fiscal year be awarded to certain entities including small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals incorporates the small business act presumption that black americans,asian americans,hispanic americans,and native americans are socially disadvantaged individuals and provides that the department of defense shall give specified forms of assistance to the listed entities and may,when practicable and necessary to achieve the five percent goal,make advance payments to those entities and award contracts to them at prices up to ten percent above fair market cost.
rothe development corporation rothe filed its first complaint in this case in november,bringing an equal protection challenge to section both on its face and as applied by the department of defense and department of the air force together,dod earlier that year,when dod awarded a contract to an business despite the fact that by a caucasian the lowest bidder.since this case began in,congress has reenacted section a number of times,the district court has rendered judgment in this case three times,and we have remanded the case twice without reaching the ultimate question of constitutional muster.most recently,the district court granted summary judgment to dod on rothe facial challenge,rothe dev.dep t of,d rothe vi,and,after rothe claim for monetary relief became moot,entered a final judgment in favor of dod on september.rothe appealed,and we heard oral argument on september.
now,in our third opinion in this case,we must decide whether section,on its face,as reenacted in,violates the right to equal protection as incorporated against the federal government by the due process clause of the fifth amendment.because we will hold that congress did not have a strong basis in evidence before it in,upon which to conclude that dod was a passive participant in racial discrimination in relevant markets across the country and that therefore remedial measures were necessary,we will reverse the district court judgment in part,and will hold that section,is unconstitutional on its face.
background 
relevant statutes and regulations 
section,relevant sections of the small business act,pertinent regulations,and their history are set out in detail in the district court thorough opinion.see rothe vi,d at.a brief review follows here.
section as originally enacted 
congress first enacted section in,for a period.see national defense authorization act of,stat.the statute,titled contract goal for minorities,provided that,except where compelling national security considerations required otherwise 
a goal of percent of the amount of dod procurement,r d,military construction,and maintenance contracts shall be the goal of the department of defense in each of fiscal years,and for the total combined amount obligated for contracts and subcontracts entered into with inter alia,small business concerns,including mass media,owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as defined by section d of the small business act d and regulations issued under such section,the majority of the earnings of which directly accrue to such individuals 
id.a emphasis added.
section d of the small business act and relevant regulations,in turn,provided at that time that black americans,hispanic americans,native americans,asian pacific americans,and other minorities were presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.see d c ii.
subsection e of section,titled competitive procedures and advanced payments,directed dod to take certain measures to attain the goal of directing five percent of contract dollars to businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals such businesses,sdbs.most prominently,the statute provided that 
t o the extent practicable and when necessary to facilitate achievement of the percent goal described in subsection a,the secretary of defense may enter into contracts using less than full and open competitive procedures including awards under section a of the small business act,but shall pay a price not exceeding fair market cost by more than percent in payment per contract to contractors or subcontractors described in subsection a.
e emphasis added.dod implemented this directive by applying a price evaluation adjustment pea to bids submitted by bidders,increasing those bids by ten percent before comparing them to the bids submitted by sdbs.
history of section 
in,before section was set to expire,congress reenacted the statute for another three years.see national defense authorization act for fiscal years and,b,stat.in,congress reenacted section again,this time for seven years.see national defense authorization act for fiscal year,a b,stat.
in,congress amended the statute without yet reenacting it.this amendment required dod to suspend the pea mechanism for an entire year after any fiscal year in which the five percent goal had been met.see strom thurmond national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat.because the five percent goal was met for fiscal year,the pea was suspended in.see suspension of the price evaluation adjustment for small disadvantaged businesses.
congress reenacted section in,again in,and most recently in.see national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat,bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat,national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat.the statute is now set to expire at the end of fiscal year if it is not reenacted before then.see k this section applies in the department of defense to each of fiscal years through.
as the district court noted,dod met the five percent goal in every fiscal year from to,and thus the pea was serially suspended through march.see rothe vi,d at.in february of,while this appeal was pending,dod published notice that it met the five percent goal in fiscal year as well,and that dod would continue to suspend the pea through march.suspension of the price evaluation adjustment for small disadvantaged businesses.
section today 
the present section,as reenacted in,and relevant regulations differ from the original enactment and regulations to some degree,as the district court discussed.see rothe vi,d at.first,in addition to the pea suspension clause added by the amendments,the present statute provides that whenever the pea is not suspended,the size of the adjustment made to bids need not be ten percent,and must be smaller if are being denied a reasonable opportunity to compete see e a the head of an agency shall adjust the percentage specified in the preceding sentence for any industry category if available information clearly indicates that nondisadvantaged small business concerns in such industry category are generally being denied a reasonable opportunity to compete for contracts because of the use of that percentage in the application of this paragraph.see also id.g a to the maximum extent practicable,the head of the agency shall ensure that no particular industry category bears a disproportionate share of the contracts awarded to attain the goal established by subsection a.id.g upon making a determination that a particular industry category is bearing a disproportionate share,the head of the agency shall take appropriate actions to limit the contracting activity use of set asides in awarding contracts in that particular industry category.
second,through changes to pertinent regulations,minorities are no longer presumed to be economically disadvantaged regardless of their wealth,and instead must represent that they meet the same economic requirement met by any sdb applicant.see c in assessing the personal financial condition of an individual claiming economic disadvantage,his or her net worth must be less than after taking into account certain exclusions 
members of certain minority groups are still presumed to be socially disadvantaged,however.see id.b there is a rebuttable presumption that the following individuals are socially disadvantaged black americans hispanic americans native americans american indians,eskimos,aleuts,or native hawaiians asian pacific americans persons with origins from burma,thailand,malaysia,indonesia,singapore,brunei,japan,china including hong kong,taiwan,laos,cambodia kampuchea,vietnam,korea,the philippines,trust territory of the pacific islands republic of palau,republic of the marshall islands,federated states of micronesia,the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands,guam,samoa,macao,fiji,tonga,kiribati,tuvalu,or nauru subcontinent asian americans persons with origins from india,pakistan,bangladesh,sri lanka,bhutan,the maldives islands or nepal id.a in determining whether a firm qualifies as an sdb,the criteria of social and economic disadvantage and other eligibility requirements established in subpart a of this part including apply,including the requirements of ownership and control and disadvantaged status,unless otherwise provided in this subpart.
third,a person who is economically disadvantaged but is not a member of one of the minority groups listed in the small business administration sba regulations may nevertheless pursue sdb status if the person can establish individual social disadvantage by a preponderance of the evidence.id.c emphasis added.although have long had the option to demonstrate social disadvantage,the standard of proof was once higher.see c an individual who is not a member of one of the groups must establish individual social disadvantage on the basis of clear and convincing evidence.emphasis added.
fourth,a business that loses a bid to a sdb because of a pea may protest the disadvantaged status of the successful bidder.see a see also small disadvantaged business program,to be codified at pt.redesignating a as a.the sba can revoke an entity sdb status if the protest contains credible evidence that the entity no longer meets sdb requirements or that the application contains false and misleading information.see c see also small disadvantaged business program.at redesignating c as c.
facts and procedural history 
the procedural history of this case,like the history of the statute itself,is substantial.it is set out in significant detail in the district court most recent opinion,see rothe vi,d at,as well as in our two prior opinions.here,we briefly review the case history with a focus on those arguments and developments that are relevant to the question before us today.
genesis of this dispute 
starting in the late,the department of the air force contracted with rothe to maintain,operate,and repair computer systems at columbus air force base in mississippi.in the late,the air force decided to consolidate rothe contract with a contract for communications services,to issue a solicitation for competitive bids,and to let the contract pursuant to the section program.rothe,owned by a caucasian female,bid million.international computer and telecommunications,ict,a competitor to rothe owned by a couple and certified as a sdb,bid million.although rothe bid was lower than ict bid and was in fact the lowest bid,the air force considered rothe bid to be million,higher than ict bid,because of the pea.therefore the air force awarded the contract to ict.see rothe vi,d at.
rothe suit and the first i,rothe ii,and rothe iii 
rothe filed suit against dod in november of,and moved for a preliminary injunction against dod award of the contract to ict.the district court denied rothe motion,and on february,rothe filed its first amended complaint fac.the fac,which is still the operative complaint in this case,included claims for a declaratory judgment that section is unconstitutional on its face,an injunction prohibiting dod from proceeding with the contract rothe had lost to ict,and recovery of rothe bid preparation costs,in an amount not to exceed,under the little tucker act.
on april,the district court granted summary judgment to dod,upholding the constitutionality of section and denying rothe any relief.rothe dev.dep t of,d,prado,rothe i.rothe appealed to the fifth circuit,and dod moved to dismiss the appeal or to transfer it to the federal circuit because of rothe tucker act claim.on october,the fifth circuit transferred the appeal to us,explaining that the federal circuit had exclusive appellate jurisdiction because the district court jurisdiction in rothe i was based in part on the little tucker act.rothe dev.dep t of,cir rothe ii.
we heard oral argument on november,and issued our opinion on august.rothe dev.dep t of,rothe iii.we agreed with the fifth circuit that appellate jurisdiction lay exclusively in the federal circuit,id.at,but we did not affirm or reverse the district court on the merits.rather,we vacated and remanded for further proceedings,because the district court improperly applied a deferential legal standard rather than strict scrutiny,and also impermissibly relied on evidence to support section constitutionality as reauthorized.id.at.we directed the district court to apply strict scrutiny on remand,particularly in accordance with the principles set forth in richmond croson,d and adarand constructors peña,d adarand iii.rothe iii,at.
the second judgment and iv and rothe v 
on remand,dod moved to dismiss rothe claims as moot in light of factual developments since the decision in rothe i,namely the contract at issue had been superseded by a replacement contract,which was put up for bid outside of the section program,with rothe rebidding and losing to a lower bidder dod had offered to tender to rothe,the full amount rothe could recover on its little tucker act claim and the pea had been serially suspended since.on july,the district court granted dod motion in part,agreeing that rothe little tucker act claim and its requests for an injunction against further work on the contract and for an equitable award of the contract were moot,but holding that rothe could still maintain its claims for declaratory judgments that section is unconstitutional on its face and was unconstitutional as applied to rothe in.rothe dev.dep t of,docket.
in,the district court issued a series of discovery orders that unintentionally but improperly limited discovery regarding rothe facial challenge.these orders repeatedly referenced the reenactment of section which was in effect in,the relevant time for rothe challenge,and were construed by the parties to prohibit some discovery relevant to the facial constitutionality of section,discovery related to the evidence before congress during the statute reenactment.see rothe vi,d at acknowledging that taken out of context,some loose language in those three discovery orders could be construed to limit the issues on remand,but maintaining that scope of discovery could have been resolved in a motion for clarification had the parties chosen to file one.
on july,the district court issued an opinion on rothe remaining claims.rothe dev.dep t of,d rodriguez,rothe iv.the district court held that section was indeed unconstitutional as applied in,because dod failed to demonstrate that there was sufficient statistical evidence of discrimination before congress when the statute was reenacted in.id.at.but the district court held that the statute was constitutional on its face,because there was sufficient statistical evidence of discrimination before congress when the statute was then most recently reenacted in.id.at.in a separate opinion,in august of,the district court also declined to award rothe attorney fees on its challenge.rothe dev.dep t of,no,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
rothe appealed.we heard argument on march,and issued an opinion on june.rothe dev.dep t of,rothe v.we vacated the district court holding that rothe little tucker act claim was moot,explaining that dod offer to tender did not moot the claim because an actual tender is required for mootness,and the dod had not yet tendered the money.id.at.we affirmed the district court holding that rothe claim for an equitable award of the contract was moot,but for slightly different reasons than given by the district court.id.at.in our view,the claim was moot because the disputed contract expired in,not merely because it had been rebid outside of the section program.id.and we affirmed the district court holding that rothe facial challenge was not moot,explaining that though the pea has been serially suspended since,it will only continue to be suspended as long as dod meets the five percent goal,which is not a certainty.id.at.
but,as in rothe iii,in rothe v we did not rule on the merits of rothe facial challenge.rather,we explained that the district court ruling on rothe facial challenge in rothe iv was an unwarranted sua sponte grant of summary judgment.dod had moved to dismiss rothe facial challenge as moot,but dod had not asked the district court to reach the merits of rothe facial challenge,and thus the district court ruling on the merits,in combination with the court errant discovery orders,had unfairly deprived dod of an opportunity to introduce its evidence and arguments on the facial challenge.rothe v,at id.at noting that dod agreed with rothe that the district court findings and legal analysis do not support a holding that the present reauthorization of section is facially constitutional.because the district court discovery orders had clearly limited the issues to exclude the present reauthorization of section,we held that the government was not on notice that it was required to come forward with all of its evidence,and we therefore vacated the grant of summary judgment.id.
though we remanded the case for development of the record,id.at,we preemptively addressed three specific questions pertinent to the facial challenge.first,we held that united states salerno,d,in which the court stated that,to win a facial challenge,a challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid,was a pronouncement of limited relevance here,at most describing a conclusion that could result from the application of the strict scrutiny test.rothe v,at.second,we confirmed that the district court could not rely on any evidence that was not before congress in.id.at t o be relevant in the strict scrutiny analysis,the evidence must be proven to have been before congress prior to enactment of the racial classification.and third,we clarified that rothe argument to exclude certain statistical evidence as stale relates to whether the data itself is outdated,not to whether congress was aware of the data,and thus the district court should consider on remand whether the data presented is so outdated that it does not provide a strong basis in evidence for the most recent reauthorization of section.id.
finally,we held that rothe failed to preserve for appeal the issue of attorney fees for its successful challenge,because rothe had improperly attempted to incorporate arguments into its opening brief by reference to the joint appendix,rather than articulating substantive arguments in the brief.id.at.
the third judgment and vi 
on july,one month after our decision in rothe v,rothe moved in the district court for a preliminary injunction against dod continued use of any procurement programs.the district court denied that motion and rothe motion for reconsideration,and noted that rothe was now attempting to challenge not only the pea mechanism,but also the other provisions of section.see rothe dev.dep t of,no,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.july.the court wrote that 
rothe also objects to the following elements of the program subcontracting incentive programs awards using less than full and open asides to the designated groups of a with no competition,to include awards under section a of the small business act advance payments assistance as provided in c and the provision of sdb status to historically black colleges and universities.
id.internal footnotes and quotations omitted.though rothe had only made its additional objections clear to the district court for the first time in,the court held that it would consider the new arguments to be within the parameters of the fac.see also rothe vi,d at prior to the filing of the motion for reconsideration,this court had always construed plaintiff first amended complaint as objecting only to the pea nevertheless,the court stated that it would consider rothe challenge to the entire program as coming within the parameters of the current complaint.footnote omitted.
because section was reenacted in january of,see national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat,the district court directed the parties to present what,if any,evidence was before congress at the time of this reauthorization,and allowed rothe to conduct some additional discovery for that purpose.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.after that discovery,rothe moved for summary judgment on september,and dod for summary judgment on november.see rothe vi,d at.
on august,the district court granted summary judgment to dod on rothe facial challenge.id.at.in light of the reenactment,the district court held that the facial constitutionality of the and reenactments were moot and outside the scope of our remand in rothe v,and that the proper question was the facial constitutionality of section as reenacted in.rothe vi,d at.on the merits,the court applied strict scrutiny and upheld the statute against rothe facial challenge,concluding that congress sought to further a compelling interest supported by a strong basis in evidence,and that the statute was narrowly tailored to that interest.id.at.we will review this holding in detail below.
in rothe vi,the district court also addressed rothe claim under the little tucker act,which dod had previously attempted to satisfy by offering to tender to rothe.recounting our holding in rothe v that this claim would not be moot until dod produced the subject matter of the tender,by providing rothe with a check or depositing such a check with the court,rothe v,at,the district court ordered dod to deposit with the court registry as a formal act of tender,and held that i t is unnecessary for the court to render a judgment on the merits of rothe little tucker act c laim because the claim will become moot after the government deposits into the registry of the court.rothe vi,d at.
thereafter,on september,dod deposited into the court registry,and rothe made a motion to disburse the money a few days later.the court granted rothe motion on september,and entered final judgment for dod that same day.rothe filed a timely notice of appeal on september.
discussion 
jurisdiction and rothe tucker act claim 
before turning to the merits of rothe appeal,we briefly explain why appellate jurisdiction lies exclusively in this court rather than in the fifth circuit.with certain exceptions not relevant here,we possess appellate jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of a district court of the united states if the jurisdiction of that court was based,in whole or in part,on,known as the tucker act.a.in rothe iii,we possessed jurisdiction because rothe fac contained a claim for recovery of rothe bid preparation costs under the tucker act.see rothe iii,at as a suit to recover its bid preparation costs,rothe complaint invoked the tucker act.thus,this court has exclusive jurisdiction over all issues rothe raises in this appeal.
rothe claim under the tucker act is no longer at issue it has been satisfied by dod tender,and rothe acceptance,of.we retain appellate jurisdiction,however,because under a,as under a regarding patent law,t he path of appeal is determined by the basis of jurisdiction in the district court,and is not controlled by the substance of the issues that are appealed.abbott labs.brennan.of course,the basis of a district court thus the path of change over time in a case,for example,if certain claims are dismissed without prejudice to later refiling.see,nilssen motorola,gronholz sears,roebuck.but that is not what happened here.rather,rothe claim under the tucker act was satisfied,and thus may not be refiled later.chamberlain group,skylink,dismissals divest this court of jurisdiction only if t he parties were left in the same legal position with respect to all patent claims as if they had never been filed.quoting nilssen,at.
further,although the district court explicitly declined to render a judgment on the merits of rothe tucker act claim,rothe vi,d at,the district court ordered dod to deposit with the court in satisfaction of that claim,and thus the court changed the positions of the parties with respect to that claim.chamberlain group,at w henever the complaint included a patent claim and the trial court rulings altered the legal status of the parties with respect to that patent claim,we retain appellate jurisdiction over all pendent claims in the complaint.therefore,jurisdiction is proper in this court.
rothe facial challenge 
we now turn to the merits of rothe appeal.rothe argues that section,on its face as reenacted in,violates the right to equal protection,that the district court was wrong to conclude otherwise,and that the district court was wrong to grant summary judgment to dod instead of to rothe.we agree with rothe,and will reverse the judgment of the district court in this respect 
standard of review and strict scrutiny framework 
though we possess jurisdiction over this appeal,rothe facial challenge does not implicate matters within our exclusive jurisdiction,and we will apply the law of the fifth circuit hutchins zoll med.we will review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same criteria used by the district court in the first instance.scott constr.city of jackson,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
because section incorporates an explicit racial presumption that members of certain minority groups are socially disadvantaged for purposes of obtaining sdb status and the benefits that flow from that status under section statute is subject to strict scrutiny.see parents involved in cmty.sch.seattle sch.dist,d it is well established that when the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications,that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny.thus,to survive rothe facial challenge,section must serve a compelling governmental interest,and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.adarand iii,at.rothe iii,at strict scrutiny is a single standard and must be followed here.
the supreme court has held that government may have a compelling interest in remedying the effects of past or present racial discrimination.shaw hunt,d see also croson,at.it is beyond dispute that any public entity,state or federal,has a compelling interest in assuring that public dollars,drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens,do not serve to finance the evil of private prejudice.however,an effort to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination is not a compelling interest.shaw,at.therefore,before resorting to measures,the government must identify the discrimination to be remedied,public or private,with some specificity,and must have a strong basis in evidence upon which to conclude that remedial action is necessary.croson,at,see also wygant jackson bd.of,d.
although the party challenging a statute bears the ultimate burden of persuading the court that it is unconstitutional,the government first bears a burden to produce strong evidence supporting the legislature decision to employ action.see rothe iii,at.t he court must review the government evidentiary support to determine whether the legislative body had a strong basis in evidence to believe that remedial action based on race was necessary.see also wygant,at.
even where there is a compelling interest supported by a strong basis in evidence,the statute must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.a narrow tailoring analysis commonly involves six factors the necessity of relief the efficacy of alternative,remedies the flexibility of relief,including the availability of waiver provisions the relationship of the stated numerical goals to the relevant labor market the impact of relief on the rights of third parties and the overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness of the racial classification.rothe iii,at see also adarand iii,at.croson,at.united states paradise,d.
compelling basis in evidence 
here,the district court concluded that the government has satisfied its burden of producing a strong basis in the evidence for remedial action.rothe vi,d at.in particular,the district court held that the statistical and anecdotal evidence before congress constitute d prima facie proof of a nationwide pattern or practice of discrimination in both public and private contracting,and that the s tatistical evidence supports the conclusion that african americans,hispanic americans,asian americans,and native americans are currently and have been subject to discrimination in state and local contracting throughout the united states,including in rothe relevant services.id.at.
this statistical and anecdotal evidence,discussed by the district court in some detail,included the following six disparity studies of state or local contracting,conducted by private research and consulting firms between and at the behest of state or local government in the cities of dallas,cincinnati,and new york,in cuyahoga county,ohio and alameda county,california,and in the commonwealth of virginia see id.at a september study by the united states commission on civil rights usccr titled federal procurement after adarand,see id.at letters from individual business owners describing incidents of perceived discrimination in state,local,and private contracting,see id.at various anecdotes regarding discrimination recounted by members of congress in floor statements or remarks,see id.at testimony by small business owners before the house small business committee in and,see id.at and three reports from the small business from and one from the ownership and success rates of small businesses,see id.at.
the district court also discussed three sources of statistical analysis that were available to congress in,but were based on data gathered many years earlier,between the late and mid,namely the appendix to a department of justice study,see proposed reforms to affirmative action in federal procurement,compelling interest for affirmative action in federal procurement a preliminary survey,may,the appendix a report by the urban institute titled do businesses get a fair share of government contracts the urban institute report and the department of commerce benchmark study,see supra note.however,the district court found that the data contained in the appendix,the urban institute report,and the benchmark study is stale for purposes of strict scrutiny review of the reauthorization,and therefore the court concluded that it would not rely on those three reports as evidence of a compelling interest for the reauthorization of the program.rothe vi,d at.dod does not challenge this finding on appeal,dod br.at,so we will not consider the appendix,the urban institute report,or the department of commerce benchmark study,and will instead determine whether the evidence relied on by the district court is indeed sufficient to demonstrate a compelling interest.
six state and local disparity studies 
the primary focus of the district court compelling interest analysis,and of the parties arguments on appeal,is the evidentiary strength of six particular disparity studies conducted at the state or local level.a disparity study,in this context,is a study attempting to measure the the number of contracts or contract dollars actually awarded to businesses in a particular contract market,on the one hand,and the number of contracts or contract dollars that one would expect to be awarded to business given their presence in that particular contract market,on the other hand.disparity studies can be relevant to the compelling interest analysis because,as justice has explained,w here there is a significant statistical disparity between the number of qualified minority contractors willing and able to perform a particular service and the number of such contractors actually engaged by a locality or the locality prime contractors,an inference of discriminatory exclusion could arise.croson,at.see also scott,at given croson emphasis on statistical evidence,other courts considering equal protection challenges to programs have looked to disparity indices,or to computations of disparity percentages,in determining whether croson evidentiary burden is satisfied.
here,the district court reviewed the parameters and findings of one and five local disparity studies,and concluded that these studies analyze evidence of discrimination from a diverse of jurisdictions across the united states,and they constitute prima facie evidence of a pattern or practice of discrimination in public and private contracting.rothe vi,d at.on appeal,rothe argues that the district court was wrong to rely on these studies because the data analyzed by the studies was stale by the time of the reenactment,the studies were not truly before congress,the studies are methodologically flawed and therefore unreliable,and the studies do not establish that dod itself has played any role in the discriminatory exclusion of contractors.we will address each argument in turn.
rothe argues that t he extremely great weight of authority holds that data more than five years old is necessarily stale for purposes of measuring contracting disparities,and that therefore most of the data in most of the six studies and all of the data in some of the studies was stale by the time of the reenactment.rothe br.at rothe points to the recommendation of the usccr that federal officials must discard disparity studies conducted using data that is more than five years old,and to the statements of experts relied on by the usccr in reaching this recommendation including professor george la noue,rothe expert in previous stages of this case.beyond the usccr report,however,rothe points to no judicial authority finding that data more than five years old is stale per se,and we decline to adopt such a per se rule here.
indeed,as the district court noted,other circuit courts have relied on studies containing data more than five years old when conducting compelling interest analyses.see rothe vi,d at states paving.state dep t of,cir relying on the appendix,published in sherbrooke turf.dep t of,cir same.here,the district court considered the usccr recommendation but declined to follow it,explaining that the court must realistically focus on the availability of current data,and finding that the data used in the six studies is not stale because it was the most current data available at the time that these studies were performed between and.rothe vi,d at.while we certainly agree with the usscr that researchers should use current data when possible,we agree with the district court that congress should be able to rely on the most recently available data so long as that data is reasonably.see also rothe iii,at whether evidence is stale is a factual question for the district court to resolve.because these disparity studies analyzed data pertaining to contracts awarded as recently as or even,and because rothe does not point to more recent,available data we affirm the district court conclusion that the data analyzed in these six disparity studies was not stale at the relevant time.
ii.before congress 
rothe next argues that the district court was wrong to rely on the six disparity studies because t here is no proof the studies were ever before congress,or that they were ever subject to any kind of analysis,hearing,or findings.rothe br.at.in rothe v,we explained that for evidence to be relevant in the strict scrutiny analysis,it must be proven to have been before congress prior to enactment of the racial classification.at.it would be error for the district court to rely on studies without a finding that they were put before congress prior to the date of the present reauthorization in relation to section and to ground its enactment.id.taking note of our holding,the district court found in rothe vi that a lthough the full text of these six disparity studies was not printed in the congressional record,the repeated reference to these studies in congressional hearings and floor debates indicates that these studies were before congress.d at.the district court cited floor speeches by senator ted kennedy and representative cynthia mckinney,in which these members of congress referred to the six disparity studies by title,author,and date.see id.at beyond these floor speeches,however,the district court did not identify any further references to the studies in congressional particular,the court did not identify a single hearing at which the studies were named or discussed.on appeal,dod does not identify any hearings to which the district court might have been referring,and rothe uncontroverted by these six studies were not in fact discussed at any congressional hearings.audio recording of oral,available at.cafc.uscourts.gov mp.mp,at.
although we are mindful that congress has broad discretion to regulate its internal proceedings,see am.fed of gov t employees united states,we are hesitant to conclude that the mere mention of a statistical study in a speech on the floor of the house of representatives or the senate is sufficient to put the study before congress for purposes of congress obligation to amass a strong basis in evidence for action.we recognize that there is no dispute that these six studies were completed prior to the reenactment of section,and in that sense they were indeed before the acting legislature.but beyond their mere mention,there is no indication that these studies were debated or reviewed by members of congress or by any witnesses.sherbrooke turf,at relying on the appendix,itself a department of justice summary of more than fifty documents and thirty congressional hearings on businesses prepared in response to the adarand decision emphasis added.and because congress made no findings concerning these studies,we can not even broach the question of whether to defer to congress in any respect regarding them croson,at.the factfinding process of legislative bodies is generally entitled to a presumption of regularity and deferential review by the judiciary but when a legislative body chooses to employ a suspect classification,it can not rest upon a generalized assertion as to the classification relevance to its goals.
ultimately,however,we need not decide whether these six studies were put before congress,because we will hold in any event that the studies do not provide a substantially probative and statistical foundation necessary for the strong basis in evidence that must be the predicate for nationwide,action.
iii.methodology 
rothe contends that the six disparity studies contain methodological defects,relating primarily to the studies availability analyses,which render their conclusions about the existence of certain disparities unreliable.the district court acknowledged rothe contentions,but rejected them as unsupported by expert report s or other competent summary judgment evidence.rothe vi,at see also id.at none of rothe expert reports address the six disparity studies cited by mckinney and kennedy in support of the reauthorization.id.at rothe failed to rebut the statistical evidence contained in any of the six disparity studies with credible,particularized evidence from its own expert reports.id.at rothe generalized objections regarding the alleged deficiencies of the ohio disparity study are conclusory and are not competent summary judgment evidence.id.at t he argument of counsel regarding the alleged deficiencies of the cincinnati study are not competent summary judgment evidence.
this was error.in rothe iii,we instructed the district court to undertake the same type of detailed,skeptical,analysis undertaken by the croson court,because congress is entitled to no deference in determining whether congress had a compelling interest in enacting the racial classification as opposed to deference in the conduct of its factfinding proceedings.at.many of rothe objections to the six disparity studies at issue here are of the same general character as the objections articulated by justice to the statistical evidence offered by the government in,objections to the parameters used to select the relevant pool of contractors.the potential pitfalls of legislation are far too great for a court to dismiss such objections as incompetently offered,rather than to address them on their merits.see regents of of cal.bakke,d opinion of powell,racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination,quoted in parents involved.at fullilove klutznick,d any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,quoted in adarand iii,at,and wygant,at.plurality opinion of powell.
rather than remand this case a third time,however,we will consider here whether these studies are sufficiently probative for purposes of congress burden to amass a strong basis in evidence.we note that although there are six studies,four of them were conducted by the same research tillman employ very similar methodologies.the two remaining cincinnati study,by griffin strong,and the virginia study,by mgt of similar to the others in some basic respects.
as the district court explained,all of the studies sought to calculate a ratio between the expected contract amount of a given group and the actual contract amount received by that group.rothe vi,d at citing the new york city study.in general,a disparity ratio less than,a finding that a given minority group received less than eighty percent of the expected amount indicates a relevant degree of disparity,and might support an inference of discrimination.see,eng g contractors ass of,metro.dade county,cir in general disparity indices of,or greater,which are close to full participation,are not considered indications of discrimination.the district court reviewed the various disparity ratios found by each of the six studies for each of several minority groups in each of several industry categories,see rothe vi,d at,and we will not repeat them all.for example,however,the new york city study determined that black americans represented of available construction firms but received only of prime construction contract dollars,a statistically significant underutilization which can be expressed as a disparity ratio of.other disparity ratios found by the studies included,for further example,for asian american firms in alameda county construction subcontracts,for hispanic firms in virginia professional services contracts,and for native american firms in cincinnati supplies and services contracts during fiscal year.
rothe primary objection to the six disparity studies regards their availability analysis,or benchmark,the steps taken to ensure that only those contractors who are qualified,willing,and able to perform the prime contracts at issue are considered when forming the denominator of a disparity ratio.see croson,at.w here special qualifications are necessary,the relevant statistical pool for purposes of demonstrating discriminatory exclusion must be the number of minorities qualified to undertake the particular task.as professor ian ayres,dod expert in previous stages of this case,explained in a written statement before the usccr,the crucial question in disparity studies is to develop a credible methodology to estimate this benchmark share of contracts minorities would receive in the absence of discrimination,and t he touchstone for measuring the benchmark is to determine whether the firm is ready,willing,and able to do business with the government.at usccr disparity studies,supra note,at.
rothe contends that these six studies misapplied this touchstone of croson,and erroneously included any firm that was deemed willing or potentially willing and able,without regard to whether that firm was qualified.in particular,rothe objects to the studies use of lists compiled by local business associations,and of community outreach,to identify businesses.after reviewing the availability analyses contained in the six studies,we conclude that this defect does not substantially undercut the results of the four studies conducted by mason tillman associates,because the bulk of the businesses considered in these studies were identified in ways that would tend to establish their qualifications,such as by their presence on city contract records and bidder lists.see,at new york city study of available prime contractors owned by minorities or women,percent were identified via prime contractor utilization,percent identified via certification lists,and percent identified via willingness survey of chamber membership and trade association membership lists at dallas study percent of the prime contractors available in the four industries combined were obtained from public agency and certification lists,including m ore than percent of the,while c ompanies identified through outreach only were percent of the at cuyahoga county study percent of the prime contractors available in the four industries combined were obtained from either utilized prime contractors,bidder lists,or certification lists,including percent of the,while percent of the were identified solely through community meetings at alameda county study of available prime contractor,percent identified via alameda county and other government records,percent identified via agency certification lists,percent identified via business outreach events,percent via trade association membership lists,and percent identified via chamber membership lists.
we are less confident in this aspect of the virginia and cincinnati studies,because the availability methodology employed in those studies appears less likely to have weeded out unqualified businesses.see at cincinnati study requiring only that a firm does business within an industry group from which the city of cincinnati makes certain purchases that t he firm owner has demonstrated that he or she believes the firm is qualified and able to perform the work emphasis added and that b y the owner actions,he or she has demonstrated an interest in obtaining work from the entity at virginia study for our analysis we used vendor data as the basis of the availability component using this approach,we assume that all firms in the relevant market area are ready,willing,and able to do work for the commonwealth at the prime or sub level.emphasis added.
we are even more troubled,however,by the failure of five of the studies to account sufficiently for potential differences in size,or relative capacity,of the businesses included in those studies.as professor ayres explained to the usccr,qualified firms may have substantially different capacities,and thus might be expected to bring in substantially different amounts of business even in the absence of discrimination 
firms a and b may both be qualified to do some business with the government,but one firm may be a multinational with many plants,while the other firm may be a sole proprietorship with only a single plant.the counting approach ignores differences in capacity and deems the firm to be equally available to serve the government as the multiplant firm.it might assume,for example,that the manufacturers of a small brand and budweiser are equally available to sell beer.
at usccr disparity studies at emphasis in original.
the eleventh circuit has explained similarly that b ecause they are bigger,bigger firms have a bigger chance to win bigger contracts.it follows that,all other factors being equal and in a perfectly nondiscriminatory market,one would expect the bigger on average firms to get a disproportionately higher percentage of total construction dollars awarded than the smaller mwbe firms.eng g contractors ass n,at.and we ourselves criticized a statistic,offered by dod in an earlier stage of this case,in part because it did not take into account the fact that the sheer number of businesses owned by minorities may not be significantly correlated with the volume of business conducted by businesses.rothe iii,at see also states paving,at t he fact that disadvantaged business enterprises constitute of the washington market does not establish that they are able to perform of the work.
here,each of the six disparity studies accounted for the relative sizes of contracts awarded to businesses,by measuring the utilization of,the numerator in a disparity terms of directed to businesses rather than in the raw number of contracts awarded.but none of the studies took complementary account of the relative sizes of the businesses themselves.rather,each of the studies measured the availability of,the denominator in a disparity the percentage of firms in the market owned by minorities,instead of by the percentage of total marketplace capacity those firms could provide see at dallas study introducing concept of disparity ratio as comparison between the proportion of contract dollars awarded to mbes and wbes and the proportion of available mbes and wbes in the relevant market area emphases added at cuyahoga county study same at alameda county study same at new york city study under a fair and equitable system of awarding contracts,the proportion of contract dollars awarded to would be approximate to the proportion of available in the relevant market area.emphases added at cincinnati study defining disparity index as the percentage of participation in government contracts,the percentage of contracting dollars paid to firms,divided by the percentage of in the relevant population of local firms emphases added at virginia study describing underlying assumption of study disparity analysis that absent discrimination,the proportion of dollars received by a particular mbe group should approximate that group proportion of the relevant population of vendors emphases added.
we do not mean to suggest that the studies completely ignored the question of firm size.in the new york city study,for example,the disparity analysis was restricted to an examination of the prime contract awards of and under to limit the capacity required to perform the contracts subjected to the statistical analysis.at.similarly,the dallas study attempted to control for capacity by ensuring that firms had a demonstrated ability to win large competitively bid contracts,at the study concluded that the majority of the city contracts are small,and t herefore,to perform on most city contracts,even the competitively bid construction projects,the available firms only required minimal capacity.at see also at cuyahoga county study similar approach.
but while these parameters may have ensured that each business in the studies met a capacity,had the capacity to bid for and to complete any one parameters simply fail to account for the relative capacities of businesses to bid for more than one contract at a time,or,borrowing from professor ayres example,the difference between the volume of a particular beer in the marketplace at a given time and the volume of budweiser.this failure renders the disparity ratios calculated by the studies substantially less probative,on their own,of the likelihood of discrimination 
of course,the studies could have accounted for firm size even without changing their methodologies they could have employed regression analysis to determine whether there was a statistically significant correlation between the size of a firm and the share of awarded to it.see eng g contractors ass n,at explaining that regression analysis is a statistical procedure for determining the relationship between a dependent and independent variable,the dollar value of a contract award and firm size,and that t he point of a regression analysis is to determine whether the relationship between the two variables is statistically meaningful.but of the six studies,only the virginia study conducted this type of regression analysis 
the regression analysis which included the independent variables of a of company,owner education level,number of employees,percent of revenue from private sector,and owner experience for industry an r square of,indicating that the independent variables explained only percent of the variations in firm revenue categories.
at.and although the virginia study did find a consistent and negative relationship between mbe status and revenue even after accounting for such independent variables,at,the relatively lax qualified,willing,and able requirements of the virginia study render this conclusion less probative.
to be clear,we do not hold that the defects in the availability and capacity analyses in these six disparity studies render the studies wholly unreliable for any purpose.where the calculated disparity ratios are low enough,we do not foreclose the possibility that an inference of discrimination might still be permissible for some of the minority groups in some of the studied industries in some of the jurisdictions.and we recognize that a firm capacity and qualifications may themselves be affected by discrimination but we hold that the defects we have noted detract dramatically from the probative value of these six studies,and,in conjunction with their limited geographic coverage,render the studies insufficient to form the statistical core of the strong basis in evidence required to uphold the statute.
iv.geographic coverage 
in rothe iii,we explained that,although section is subject to scrutiny that is no less strict than the scrutiny applied to the policies of municipalities,congress nevertheless has,in a sense,a broader brush than municipalities for remedying discrimination,because congress has the power to legislate for the entire nation.at.in particular,we wrote that w hereas municipalities must necessarily identify discrimination in the immediate locality to justify a program,we do not think that congress needs to have had evidence before it of discrimination in all fifty states in order to justify the program.see also adarand constructors,slater,cir adarand vii the fact that congress enactments must serve a compelling interest does not necessitate the conclusion that the scope of that interest must be as geographically limited as that of a local government.however,we were clear that evidence of a few isolated instances of discrimination would be insufficient to uphold the nationwide program,and we left to the district court the question of w here to draw the line in the first instance.rothe iii,at.
the district court has now drawn a line,holding that t hese six state and local disparity studies analyze evidence of discrimination from a diverse of jurisdictions across the united states,and they constitute prima facie evidence of a pattern or practice of discrimination in public and private contracting.rothe vi,d at footnote omitted.it is now up to us to review this holding,and we can not affirm it.we take judicial notice that the united states comprises over three thousand counties and regions and,as of july,there are at least two hundred cities or metropolitan areas with populations above people it may be reasonable to assume that there are some demographic and industrial similarities between many of the larger cities and counties across the country.and we still think that congress need not amass evidence of discrimination in all fifty states to meet its burden.but we would be hesitant to conclude even from methodologically unimpeachable disparity studies of one state,two counties,and three cities that there is a pattern or practice of discrimination in public and private contracting,where the discrimination is on the same order as the local discrimination that might be inferred from the six studies.here,given the weaknesses in the six studies benchmark analyses as described above,we simply can not agree with the district court conclusion.
we stress that in holding these six studies insufficient in this case,we do not necessarily disapprove of decisions by other circuit courts that have relied,directly or indirectly,on municipal disparity studies to establish a federal compelling interest.different studies,in the context of different legislative history,may support different conclusions.in particular,the appendix,relied on by the ninth and tenth circuits in the context of certain measures pertaining to federal highway construction,references the urban institute report,which itself analyzed over fifty disparity studies and relied for its conclusions on over thirty of those studies,a far broader basis than the six studies here provide.see adarand vii,at states paving,at urban institute report,supra note,at 
b.other evidence before congress 
we now turn to the remaining evidence relied on by the district court to hold that congress had a strong basis in evidence for reenacting section in.rather than take each item in turn,however,we will organize our discussion by statistical and anecdotal evidence.ultimately,we will conclude that the remaining statistical evidence is not substantially more probative than that contained in the six disparity studies.without strong statistical evidence,the statute can not be upheld.see rothe iii,at statistical evidence is particularly important to justify legislation indeed,nearly every court of appeals upholding the constitutionality of a classification has relied in whole or in part on statistical evidence.adarand vii,at explaining that b oth statistical and anecdotal evidence are appropriate in the strict scrutiny calculus,but anecdotal evidence by itself is not.
i.other statistical evidence 
the district court considered statistics presented by usccr commissioner michael yaki in his dissent to a september,usccr study titled federal procurement after adarand.for example,the district court noted that although the revenue of businesses grew by sixty percent between and,more than the rate of growth for all united states firms,the revenue of african firms grew only half as much as businesses generally,and less than all firms.rothe vi,d at.the court also noted that m firms with paid employees were much less likely to survive from to than from to,and that african enterprises were less likely to survive than other groups in either period.id.although this data is national in scope and is therefore in a sense more probative of nationwide discrimination than are municipal disparity studies,the data from commissioner yaki dissent dates to the early.thus,as the district court recognized,this data is not by itself highly probative of the state of affairs at the time of the reenactment of section.see id.at the court finds that this statistical evidence is not categorically stale,but it is less probative of discrimination than the six state and local disparity studies previously discussed.
the district court also referred to studies beyond the six disparity studies discussed above,but only in quoting speeches made by members of congress.for example,in a july speech made to support the department of transportation disadvantaged business program,senator kennedy stated that studies completed since show that minority and companies are underutilized in government contracting,and listed studies identified by the department of transportation that he alleged 
show significant disparities between the availability and utilization of minority and firms in government contracting in nebraska in maryland in colorado in georgia in kentucky in ohio in wilmington,de in dekalb county,ga in broward county,fl in dallas,tx in cincinnati,oh in tallahassee,fl and in baltimore.
rothe vi,d at quoting cong.rec,at.these studies themselves,however,are not in the record here,and are not even sufficiently described in this floor excerpt for us to locate them,let alone subject them to detailed,skeptical,analysis.see rothe iii,at.likewise,the district court quoted floor speeches given by representatives watt and menendez in december of,in which they cited,respectively,to a disparity study for north carolina that was performed by mgt america,and a new jersey disparity study by mgt america,and in which these representatives concluded that these disparity studies demonstrated underutilization of minority contractors.rothe vi,d at.these studies are not in the record,and we can not defer to representatives watt and menendez about the studies probative value,particularly in light of our concerns about the virginia study by mgt of america discussed above.see adarand vii,at we can not merely recite statements made by members of congress alleging a finding of discriminatory effects and the need to address those effects.
we conclude that the remaining statistics cited by members of congress in the floor speeches quoted by the district court can not serve as the foundation of a strong basis in evidence,because they are not sufficiently probative of nationwide discrimination against the range of minority groups afforded a presumption under section.nor are the statistics quoted by the district court from the three sba reports sufficient,because they do not account for firm size or qualifications.see,rothe vi,d at noting that the state of small business report found that businesses make up percent of the business population of the united states,but small businesses won just percent of the award dollars in fy and.
ii.anecdotal evidence 
given our holding regarding statistical evidence,we will not review the anecdotal evidence before congress in detail.beyond the anecdotal evidence contained in the six municipal disparity studies in the record,the district court discussed floor speeches by members of congress,in which they related anecdotes submitted by minority business owners concerning their experiences with private sector and good old boy networks and discriminatory government agencies.see rothe vi.at.the house small business committee also heard in hearings about the difficulties faced by minority business owners in federal procurement.see id.at.rothe contests the accuracy of some of these anecdotes,but we need not make credibility determinations,because anecdotal evidence is insufficient by itself to support section.adarand vii,at.
we do pause,however,to consider that while the district court cited complaints about slow payment by government agencies,and the effects of contract bundling in continuing the disparities of contracts awarded to minority business contractors,rothe vi,d at,and cited the small business committee conclusion that much work remains to be done in increasing access to capital and federal procurement markets for minority entrepreneurs,neither the district court in its opinion,nor dod on appeal,cited to a single instance of alleged discrimination by dod in the course of awarding a prime contract,nor to a single instance of alleged discrimination by a private contractor identified as the recipient of a prime defense contract.
this lacuna is quite significant.justice wrote in croson that if a government has become a passive participant in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry,then that government may take affirmative steps to dismantle the exclusionary system.at.here,the district court concluded that dod is a passive participant in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of various state and local contracting sectors because the government has compiled evidence of marketplace discrimination and linked its spending practices to that private or public discrimination.rothe vi,d at citing concrete works,at.but without a single identified incident of discrimination by dod or a recipient of dod funds,the only evidence recited by the district court to establish a link between dod spending practices and discrimination is the fact that dod is one of the largest buyers of goods and services in the world,having procured approximately billion of goods and services in fiscal year,with much of that money being distributed to state and local contractors.rothe vi,d at.
undoubtedly,some state and local contractors have engaged in discrimination.and given the amount of money spent by dod,it is likely that some money injected by dod into the nationwide contract market has made its way into the hands of contractors,subcontractors,or who have engaged in discrimination.but we are skeptical that this bare likelihood would be sufficient to establish dod passive participation in discrimination within the meaning of croson,even the present were to possess a strong evidentiary basis upon which to conclude that there was a nationwide pattern or practice of pervasive discrimination by state,local,and private contractors in the relevant contract markets at the relevant time.even in concrete works,for example,the city of denver offered more than mere dollar amounts to link its spending to private discrimination.as the tenth circuit explained,denver provided testimony from minority business owners that general contractors who use them in city construction projects refuse to use them on private projects,with the result that denver had pa id tax dollars to support firms that discriminate against other firms because of their race,ethnicity,and gender.concrete works,at.we do not know whether,in the present case,dod could have obtained similar testimony from subcontractors at the relevant time,only that dod did not do so.
to conclude our compelling interest analysis,we hold that congress did not have before it,at the time of the reenactment of section,a strong basis in evidence for the proposition that dod was a passive participant in racial discrimination in relevant markets across the country and that therefore remedial measures were necessary.we stress that our holding is grounded in the particular items of evidence offered by dod and relied on by the district court in this case,and should not be construed as stating blanket rules,for example about the reliability of disparity studies.as the fifth circuit has explained,there is no precise mathematical formula to assess the quantum of evidence that rises to the croson strong basis in evidence benchmark.scott constr,at.rather,t he sufficiency of a government findings of discrimination in a local industry,or for that matter in a or nationwide industry,must be evaluated on a basis.id.thus,if congress reenacts section again before it is set to expire in congress is free to can not now predict,nor do we intend to prejudge,whether any such new enactment will be supported by a strong basis in evidence.
narrow tailoring 
because we hold that congress lacked the evidentiary predicate for a compelling interest,we can not determine whether section,as reenacted in,is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest.we make two observations about narrow tailoring,however.
first,we held in rothe iii that the district court in rothe i had thoroughly analyzed and correctly concluded that the program was flexible in application,limited in duration,and that it did not unduly impact on the rights of third parties.at.we have no occasion to revisit that holding today,but note that section and pertinent regulations have been amended over time,and that the amendments have tended to limit,rather than broaden,the application of preferences based on racial classifications.
second,even if we were to reach the other narrow tailoring factors,the absence of strongly probative statistical evidence makes it impossible to evaluate at least one of those factors.without solid benchmarks for the minority groups covered by the statute,we simply can not determine whether section five percent goal is reasonably related to the capacity of firms owned by members of those minority,whether that goal is comparable to the share of contracts minorities would receive in the absence of discrimination.at usccr disparity studies,supra note,at.such benchmarks might have been available here,had the department of commerce made good on its intention to develop new benchmarks and utilization estimates every three years.see supra note.but commerce did not do so.see at usccr disparity studies,supra note,at.
rothe request for attorney fees 
there is one more matter we must address.rothe argues that dod defense of section in this litigation is not substantially justified,and seeks attorney fees and costs under the equal access to justice act eaja.section d a of title sets forth the basis for attorney fees under the eaja 
except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action other than cases sounding in tort brought by or against the united states in any court having jurisdiction of that action,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
we deny rothe request as premature.eaja provides that a party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall submit an application therefore within thirty days of final judgment in the action.id.d b.there is not yet a final judgment in this case.we will remand the case for the district court to enter judgment rothe may submit an application for attorney fees at the appropriate time,though we take no position on the merits of such an application.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that section,on its face,as reenacted in,violates the equal protection component of the fifth amendment right to due process.because the statute authorizes dod to afford preferential treatment on the basis of race,we must apply strict scrutiny.and because congress did not have a strong basis in evidence upon which to conclude that dod was a passive participant in pervasive,nationwide racial least not on the evidence produced by dod and relied on by the district court in this statute fails strict scrutiny.we reverse the judgment of the district court in part,and remand with instructions to enter a judgment denying rothe any relief regarding the facial constitutionality of section as enacted in or,declaring that section as enacted in,the current is facially unconstitutional,and enjoining application of the current.
and remanded 
a present regulation directs that the sizes of price evaluation adjustments are to be determined by the department of commerce on an annual basis,by north american industry classification system naics industry subsector,and region,if any.b.although commerce did issue determinations of price evaluation adjustments in and,and proposed to develop new benchmarks and utilization estimates every three years thereafter,no new benchmarks or price evaluation adjustment determinations have been issued,presumably because the pea has been serially suspended since.see small disadvantaged business procurement reform of affirmative action in federal procurement.june,department of commerce benchmark study office of federal procurement policy small disadvantaged business procurement reform of affirmative action in federal procurement.
in a letter dated october,dod counsel brought to the court attention the recent publication by the small business administration sba of an interim final rule.see small disadvantaged business program,to be codified at pt.the interim final rule relieves sba of the task of certifying sdbs and places that responsibility on the procuring agencies,such as dod.as dod counsel notes,and we agree,the substantive standards governing sdb certification have not changed.thus,although the new rules alter the process of qualifying as an sdb,the new rules have no effect on our constitutional analysis.
rothe claims,without support,that the district court should have also declared the statute unconstitutional as reenacted in and.we agree with the district court that the facial constitutionality of these earlier enactments is a moot question they have been superceded by the reenactment and are no longer the law.thus,a declaratory judgment on the validity of these intervening reauthorizations is a textbook example of advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.rothe vi,d at quoting concrete works of,city county of denver,cir.rothe facial challenge to the reenactment,however,is not moot.while the pea has been suspended since and will continue to be suspended until march,the reenactment of section will remain in effect until september,the end of the fiscal year,and it is not absolutely certain that the pea will be suspended for the period between march and september.see rothe v,at b ecause the government has not proven that the suspension of the adjustment will remain in place,it has failed to prove mootness.
we note that while we stand in the shoes of the fifth circuit,the bulk of relevant,controlling authority comes directly from the supreme court,and we have interpreted much of that authority in our prior opinions in this case.
