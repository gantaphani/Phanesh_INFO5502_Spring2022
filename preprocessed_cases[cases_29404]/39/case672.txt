comtrol,comtrol appeals the decision of the court of federal claims granting summary judgment that comtrol is not entitled to an equitable adjustment of a contract between comtrol and the federal aviation administration faa for construction work at the salt lake city international airport,and that comtrol is not entitled to damages for breach of that contract.comtrol,united states,fed.cl.
comtrol urges five claims on appeal a claim for differing site conditions and defective specifications based on the presence of quicksand at the site a claim for differing site conditions and defective specifications based on the placement of a fuel pipeline a claim for additional costs relating to alleged improvements to three underground duct banks a claim for additional costs including overhead,time,and acceleration costs resulting from numerous change orders,the direct costs of which have already been resolved by the parties and a claim for breach of the implied contractual duties of cooperation,with contract,and good faith and fair dealing.
as to the first claim,we hold that the soils encountered did not constitute differing site conditions because the specification did not indicate that only hard materials would be encountered at the site,and because comtrol can not rely on an engineering report that it did not review before award.we similarly reject the defective specifications claim.as to the differing site conditions and defective specifications claims relating to the fuel pipeline,we hold that the contract was ambiguous as to the existence and location of the pipeline,but that the ambiguity was patent,barring recovery.as to the claim relating to additional costs for alleged improvements of the duct banks,we hold that the court of federal claims erred by treating the issue as depending entirely on the site conditions claim.we vacate and remand for further consideration of that claim.as for the claim relating to additional costs resulting from certain unresolved change orders,we hold that the court of federal claims erred in failing to specifically address this claim,and vacate and remand for further proceedings.as for the breach of contract claim,we hold that the court of federal claims erred in finding that this claim depended entirely on comtrol ability to prove differing site conditions,and vacate and remand for further proceedings.thus,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
background 
in december,faa invited bids for a firm,contract to construct an air traffic control tower and base building at the salt lake city international airport.the contract was awarded to comtrol on april.
soil conditions 
the solicitation included the standard federal acquisition regulation far clauses for differing site conditions and site investigations,and,and the standard changes clause.
paragraph of the solicitation stated that hard material may be encountered,and paragraph defined h ard m aterial as w eathered rock,dense consolidated deposits or conglomerate materials which are not included in the definition of rock but which usually require the use of heavy excavation equipment with ripper teeth or the use of jack hammers for removal.paragraph directed bidders to include in their bids the collection and disposal of surface and subsurface water encountered in the course of construction.paragraph provided that t he contractor shall have the option to provide shoring and sheeting.the solicitation stated that a site visit was encouraged and noted that prior arrangements were not necessary for bidders to visit the faa site.
paragraph of the solicitation,entitled project specific information,incorporated by reference a soils report prepared by rb g engineering,dated august rb g report,and four sets of construction drawings.the rb g report and construction drawings were maintained at the offices of faa architect.comtrol did not review the rb g report before submitting its bid.
the rb g report made numerous representations as to the soil conditions at the site.the report stated that the subsurface material in the upper to feet in test holes through consists of a relatively soft gray clay.the remainder of the soil profile in these four borings generally consisted of interbedded sand and clay layers,and noted that all of the subsurface materials are natural deposits.the report stated that the soils investigated had recently been saturated with water and that groundwater was encountered at an approximate depth of seven feet for one test hole and two feet for the remaining test holes.the report further stated that standard penetration tests indicate that the cohesive material in the upper portion of the soil profile is in a medium stiff condition.the sandy material throughout the soil profile is generally in a medium dense state that t est hole defines the characteristics of the subsurface material that it is apparent from this boring that most of the subsurface material in the upper portion of the profile consists of cohesive material and that the results of these tests indicate that the cohesive material in the upper portion of the soil profile is in a medium stiff condition.
soon after award,comtrol proceeded with the excavation by driving a sheet pile wall around the perimeter of the excavation to contain groundwater.when comtrol began excavating within the sheet pile walls,it encountered loose sand and water.quick conditions were created when the high water table at the site exerted pressure on this loose sand and water.the surrounding soils then subsided and the sheet piling failed,damaging a nearby duct bank.
chevron pipeline 
paragraph of the solicitation stated that no pipes except those indicated,will be encountered.however,one of the drawings referenced in paragraph of the solicitation the pipeline drawing depicted a structure labeled existing chevron pipeline and noted that this pipeline was to be relocated to new utility corridor by others.the drawing also indicated a proposed location for the new utility corridor running beneath a portion of the site that was later proposed as the location of the tower.these drawings were maintained at the offices of faa architect.comtrol did not request or obtain these drawings until after the failure of the sheet pile wall.
comtrol found the pipeline after award when it used precautionary measures to locate and identify existing subsurface features.this pipeline had been relocated after the preparation of the rb g report in august,but before faa invited bids in december.
duct banks 
after the sheet pile failed,faa directed comtrol to uncover and perform additional work on two nearby duct banks that were not damaged during excavation.comtrol wrapped the two duct banks in reinforcing steel,constructed new concrete forms,and poured concrete into the forms around the reinforcing steel.comtrol alleged that this work was unnecessary to cope with the subsidence of the soil because these two duct banks were not affected by the subsidence of the soil.faa further directed comtrol to insert permanent subsurface supports under all three duct banks,including the damaged duct bank.comtrol alleged that the work it performed on the undamaged duct banks constituted unnecessary improvements,and that the work it performed on the damaged duct bank exceeded what was necessary to repair the damage.
change orders 
throughout the work,faa issued proposed contract changes pccs modifying the plans and specifications.faa paid comtrol the direct costs of these change orders.the parties differ as to whether the indirect costs were resolved.
breach of contract 
finally,comtrol alleged that faa breached its implied contractual duties of cooperation,with work,and good faith and fair dealing.
on december,comtrol certified a claim for equitable adjustment that it had presented to faa in october.the faa contracting officer issued final decisions on comtrol claims on may,and october,granting partial relief.
proceedings below 
on may,comtrol filed a complaint with the court of federal claims,seeking compensation for the five items described above.the parties filed for summary judgment as to all claims except the breach of contract claim.the court of federal claims granted summary judgment that the soil and water conditions did not constitute type i differing site conditions,finding that the documents did not represent that quick conditions would not be encountered,and that,in any event,comtrol did not reasonably rely on an engineering report because it did not review that report.comtrol,fed.cl.at.for the same reasons,the court rejected comtrol defective specifications claim.id.at.the court granted summary judgment that the pipeline did not constitute a differing site condition or result from a defective specification because construction drawings put comtrol on notice that the pipeline existed,and a reasonably prudent contractor would have either known of the pipeline or inquired further about it.id.at.the court further granted summary judgment that comtrol was not entitled to costs relating to the duct banks,concluding that t he remedial measures here are born sic of comtrol having undertaken excavation with the unwarranted expectation of encountering hard material and no subsurface obstructions.id.at.the court did not specifically address comtrol claim regarding the change orders.finally,the court sua sponte granted summary judgment that the government did not breach its implied contractual duties after finding that comtrol recovery depended on its ability to establish differing site conditions and defective specifications,claims which the court already rejected.id.at.
comtrol timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
standard of review 
we review a trial court grant of a motion for summary judgment without deference.impresa construzioni geom.domenico garufi united states.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
discussion 
comtrol differing site conditions and defective specifications claims both arise from comtrol allegedly unexpected encounter with quicksand in the course of construction.comtrol alleges that the quicksand constituted a differing site condition,and that the specification was defective for failure to disclose the presence of quicksand.although differing site conditions and defective specifications claims are distinct in theory,they collapse into a single claim under facts such as these,where the alleged defect in the specification is the failure to disclose the alleged differing site condition.where the differing site conditions claim and the defective specifications claim are so intertwined as to constitute a single claim,that claim will be governed by the specific differing site conditions clause and the cases under that clause.
type i differing site conditions consist of subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site which differ materially from those indicated in th e contract.far a.to establish entitlement to an equitable adjustment due to a type i differing site condition,a contractor must prove,by preponderant evidence,that the conditions indicated in the contract differ materially from those actually encountered during performance the conditions actually encountered were reasonably unforeseeable based on all information available to the contractor at the time of bidding the contractor reasonably relied upon its interpretation of the contract and documents and the contractor was damaged as a result of the material variation between expected and encountered conditions.mac,united states.
comtrol claims that it interpreted the solicitation as representing that comtrol could expect to encounter relatively dense and cohesive materials,not loose,sandy materials that would lead to quick conditions.comtrol relies on paragraph,which stated that hard material may be encountered.while conceding that that provision does not affirmatively indicate that only hard materials would be encountered,comtrol contends that paragraph,taken together with other provisions,implied that the soils to be encountered would consist of dense,cohesive materials which could be safely excavated without any protective measures.the other provisions upon which comtrol relies include paragraph,which comtrol argues indicated that the soils would be stable and,since the contractor could,at its option,excavate the soil without providing any shoring or sheeting paragraph,which comtrol argues suggested that standard dewatering procedures could be utilized and supported the inference that the water table need not be lowered before excavation and certain contract drawings that allowed the contractor to brace any shoring after excavation had been completed,thereby implying,argues comtrol,that the soils would remain stable and during excavation.
the court of federal claims concluded that the solicitation states only that hard material may exist,and that a ssuming the pervasive existence of hard material from this statement is not reasonable.comtrol,fed.cl.at.
a contractor is not eligible for an equitable adjustment for a type i differing site condition unless the contract indicated what that condition would be.maffei.wrecking united states.here,the specification did not affirmatively represent that only hard material would be encountered.because the contract made no specific representation as to the type of soil to be encountered,it can not be said that comtrol encountered conditions materially differing from those specifically indicated in the specification.in this respect we conclude that the court of federal claims was correct.
however,comtrol urges that,even if the specification did not represent that only hard material would be encountered,the government rb g report suggested that the contractor would encounter dense and cohesive materials that would require no shoring or sheeting during excavation.comtrol cites the following passages from the rb g report as indicating that dense and cohesive material would be encountered 
standard penetration tests indicate that the cohesive material in the upper portion of the soil profile is in a medium stiff condition.the sandy material throughout the soil profile is generally in a medium dense state test hole defines the characteristics of the subsurface material to a depth of feet.it is apparent from this boring that most of the subsurface material in the upper portion of the profile consists of cohesive material,and the results of these tests indicate that the cohesive material in the upper portion of the soil profile is in a medium stiff condition.
comtrol contends that examining the rb g report would not have caused it to act differently in its bidding or excavation.
the court of federal claims disagreed,finding that the rb g report does not indicate hard materials,but rather relatively soft gray clay and an interbedded sand and clay layer.comtrol,fed.cl.at.comtrol argues that the court of federal claims erred by interpreting the technical rb g report without the benefit of expert testimony,and that there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the rb g report suggested that quick conditions would not be encountered.
we need not resolve this question because comtrol faces an insurmountable never reviewed the rb g report before submitting its bid.the report was incorporated by reference under the heading project specific information in paragraph of the solicitation,and was therefore part of the contract.see joint venture iii dahlberg.comtrol failed to obtain and review this contract document,and can not now rely on that document to support either its differing site conditions or defective specifications theory.
it is that a crucial element of both a differing site conditions claim and a defective specifications claim is reliance.to prevail on a differing site conditions claim,the contractor must show reliance on the representations in the contract.mac,at t o establish entitlement to an equitable adjustment by reason of a type i differing site condition t he contractor must show that it reasonably relied upon its interpretation of the contract and documents.in the closely related area of defective specifications,we have recently held in robins maintenance,united states,that where a contractor seeks an equitabl
