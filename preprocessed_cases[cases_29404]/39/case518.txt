corporation phillips appeals from a decision of the united states court of federal claims granting summary judgment in favor of the government.because the court of federal claims correctly determined that phillips complaint was barred by res judicata,we affirm.
background 
on april,phillips was awarded contract no.the contract,for the design,labor,materials,and equipment necessary to construct the religious ministry facility at the naval air reserve base in fort worth,texas.under the contract,phillips was responsible for the rehabilitation of an existing chapel and the construction of a new building next to that chapel.notice to proceed on the contract was issued on may,and the project was to be completed in calendar days.phillips ultimately completed the work on june,than days after beginning work.the accepted the completed religious ministry facility.phillips was paid for its work the original contract price was increased by due to contract modifications.
between july,and november,phillips submitted to the contracting officer co at ten claims related to its work under the contract.one of these claims,submitted on november,inspection claim,was for delay,of the contract,overzealous inspection and impossibility.at.the co failed to act on any of the claims within the sixty days this failure constituted a denial of phillips claims under c,and gave phillips the right to appeal.the claims became appealable between september,and january.
between october,and january,phillips appealed all but the inspection claim to the armed services board of contract appeals board.because each of the appealed claims involved less than,phillips elected to have these claims tried pursuant to the small claims accelerated procedure,authorized under f,which requires the board to render a decision within days whenever possible.in those appeals,phillips sought compensation for costs incurred while performing the contract,which allegedly resulted from delay caused by the government conduct and from design changes demanded by the government.one of the nine appealed claims was settled while pending before the board.the administrative judge aj heard the other eight appeals between march and april,and issued decisions on them from the bench.five of the appeals were denied,and three were sustained in part and denied in part.ultimately,the parties entered into a global settlement agreement with respect to the nine board appeals,and the board entered judgment in accordance with the agreement on june.
as of january,the co still had not issued a final decision with respect to the inspection claim.on january,phillips filed an appeal of that claim in the court of federal claims.on june,the co denied the claim in its entirety.the co decision determined that pursuant to the legal principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel,phillips was precluded from litigating the issues raised by the inspection claim because they were included in its other,finally adjudicated claims.lee supplemental app.at.
following the co decision,on october,the government moved for summary judgment in the court of federal claims,which granted the motion.the court found that phillips claim involved the same parties as the claims decided in the board appeals,that there had been a final judgment on the merits of those appeals,and that the inspection claim was based on the same transactional facts as the board appeals and should have been litigated along with those appeals.the court further determined that phillips could have appealed the inspection claim along with its other claims,and that phillips could have elected to forgo the small claims accelerated procedure on those other claims in order to litigate all its appeals together.accordingly,the court of federal claims held that phillips was barred from litigating its claim by the doctrine of claim preclusion.
phillips timely appealed the decision of the court of federal claims.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of federal claims decision to grant summary judgment without deference.old stone united states.whether a particular claim is barred by res judicata is a question of law,which we also review without deference.sharp kabushiki kaisha thinksharp.
the doctrine of res judicata involves the related concepts of claim preclusion and issue preclusion.the court of federal claims here relied on claim preclusion,which refers to the effect of foreclosing any litigation of matters that never have been litigated,because of a determination that they should have been advanced in an earlier suit.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.as the supreme court has explained,when a final judgment has been entered on the merits of a case,i t is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand,but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.nevada united states,d quoting cromwell county of sac.claim preclusion applies when the parties are identical or in privity the first suit proceeded to a final judgment on the merits and the second claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the first.ammex,united states.the doctrine is properly applied to the final judgment of an administrative agency,such as a board of contract appeals,that is acting in a judicial capacity and resolved disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate.united states utah constr.mining,d see also sharp,at.
phillips argues that claim preclusion does not apply here because the contract disputes act of,stat.cda,specifically permits a claimant to split claims arising from the same contract between an agency board of contract appeals and the court of federal claims.the cda allows contractors a choice of forum for their appeals 
i n lieu of appealing the decision of the contracting officer to an agency board,a contractor may bring an action directly on the claim in the united states court of federal claims,notwithstanding any contract provision,regulation,or rule of law to the contrary.
phillips argues that section a allows a contractor to choose the appellate forum for each of its claims,and that a court may not interfere with the contractor choice.in support of this view,phillips urges that section d of the act specifically contemplates the splitting of claims between the court of federal claims and the agency boards because it provides for,but does not require,consolidation of such separate proceedings.section d provides 
if two or more suits arising from one contract are filed in the united states court of federal claims and one or more agency boards,for the convenience of parties or witnesses or in the interest of justice,the united states court of federal claims may order the consolidation of such suits in that court or transfer any suits to or among the agency boards involved.
admittedly,the statute is somewhat ambiguous as to whether it permits the filing of all claims arising from a single contract in separate fora,or only claims that do not arise from the same transactional facts.we have not previously addressed this question.however,the history of the cda makes clear that the statute is not designed to alter the usual rules of res judicata.
before the enactment of the cda,claims for equitable adjustment were required to be brought before the agency boards of contract appeals in the first instance,and review under a deferential standard was available in the court of claims.judicial review of board decisions was,however,limited breach of contract claims could be filed only with the court of claims.see utah,at.
the cda established the agency boards and the court of claims as alternative initial venues for the litigation of claims both for equitable adjustment and for breach of contract.decisions of the boards continued to be reviewable in the court of claims under a deferential standard.see cda g,stat.at.thus for the first time a contractor was given a choice of initial forum,as reflected in section a of the statute.indeed,congress identified restor ing the contractor its right to a day in court as one of the key issues resolved by the cda,at,cong.
as reported from the senate committees on governmental affairs and the judiciary,the section of the cda that would become would specifically have permitted claim splitting.subsection d provided 
except as otherwise provided in this act,and notwithstanding any statute or other rule of law,or any contract provision,every claim founded upon the same express or implied contract with the united states shall constitute a separate cause of action for purposes of any suit in a court of competent jurisdiction,and such court may,in its discretion,consolidate separate claims for purposes of decision or judgment,or delay acting on claim pending action on another claim.
cong.rec.daily ed,emphasis added.the bill also included subsection e,providing for consolidation of such split claims by the court of claims 
if two or more suits arising from one contract are filed in the court of claims and one or more agency boards,for the convenience of parties or witnesses,in the interest of justice,the court of claims may order the consolidation of such suits in that court or transfer any suits to or among the agency boards involved.
id.emphasis added.subsection d was removed from the bill before it was passed,and subsection e in the original bill became current subsection d in the statute with the designation of the court of claims being changed first to the united states claims court and then to the court of federal claims.thus congress considered and rejected statutory language in original subsection d that would have altered the usual rules of res judicata by allowing claims based on the same contract to constitute separate claims regardless of their factual overlap.
the elimination of original subsection d strongly suggests that congress did not intend to allow contractors to avoid the effects of claim preclusion by splitting factually related claims.for example,in hamdan rumsfeld,d,the supreme court considered whether the detainee treatment act of,stat.dta,stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction over habeas corpus actions filed by detainees and pending on the date the statute was enacted.see.at.earlier versions of the bill had specifically made the habeas provision applicable to pending actions,but that language had been deleted.the court held the habeas provision inapplicable to pending cases in part because congress rejected earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included the habeas provision within the scope of that directive making certain provisions retroactive.id.at.the court concluded that congress rejection of the very language that would have achieved the result the government urges weighs heavily against the government interpretation.see also doe chao,d rejecting an interpretation of the privacy act that would allow presumed damages when congress cut out the very language in the bill that would have authorized any presumed damages.similarly,in this case,the fact that congress rejected a provision of the cda that would have allowed claim splitting without regard to the usual rules of claim preclusion likewise weighs heavily against phillips proposed interpretation of the statute to achieve that result.
in addition,the amendment deleting the original subsection d was accompanied by the following explanation from senator robert byrd,then senate majority leader,who proposed the amendment 
the amendment is out of a concern that the section might be interpreted as permitting the contractors to split claims arising out of the same set of facts,thereby needlessly multiplying causes of action and encouraging forum shopping.it is not the intention of the committees to change the present law regarding joinder,compulsory counterclaims and definition of separate claims.
cong.rec.daily ed,emphases added.this statement could not have been clearer.congress definitively rejected the idea that the cda was abrogating the doctrine of claim preclusion and permitting the splitting of claims based on the same set of transactional facts we reject phillips argument to the contrary 
phillips also argues,however,that,even under the usual rules of claim preclusion,it was permitted to split its claims in this case because the claims could not have been appealed together.see restatement second of judgments c explaining that the general rule does not apply when plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action because of the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts or other restrictions on their authority.phillips asserts that it could not have appealed the inspection claim to the board along with its other nine claims.
phillips is incorrect that it could not have appealed all ten claims at the same time.phillips points to two alleged obstacles to a combined appeal.first,it urges that at the time the nine claims were appealed to the board,the co had not rendered a decision on the inspection claim.the inspection claim became appealable on january,than three weeks before phillips appealed the last of its other claims to the board.phillips thus could have chosen to appeal the inspection claim to the board at the same time as the others.even if phillips were correct that the inspection claim could not have been appealed at the same time as the others,it was within phillips control to make all ten claims ripe for review at once.this is not a situation in which the claims were required to be brought before different contracting officers,as in florida power light united states.phillips was obligated to prosecute its claims in the same proceeding it could not avoid the application of res judicata through strategic delay.
phillips also urges that it could not have filed all its appeals together in a single proceeding because the inspection claim did not qualify for the small claims accelerated procedure under which the other claims were resolved.although phillips is correct that the small claims accelerated procedure was not available for the inspection claim,which sought more than in damages,nothing in the cda indicates that a contractor has an absolute right to that accelerated procedure that prevents the application of claim preclusion.again,phillips could have joined the larger claim with the others.only its own strategic choice prevented the joinder of all claims.
finally,phillips argues that it was permitted to split its claims without being subject to claim preclusion because the claims are factually distinct.as explained above,the general rule is that claim preclusion applies when the second claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the first.ammex,at.in general,a party will be permitted to split claims if,for example,the two claims involve different sets of transactional facts.see.power light,at finding res judicata inapplicable when the two sets of claims involve d not only different time periods,but also different agencies with different contracting officers and different statutory mandates regarding pricing policy.according to the restatement,the question of whether two claims involve the same set of transactional facts is to be determined pragmatically,giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time,space,origin,or motivation,whether they form a convenient trial unit,and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties expectations or business understanding or usage.restatement second judgments.this rule has been refined in the contracts context,so that claims under a single contract generally must be brought together.see wright,miller cooper contract cases often can be resolved by a simple rule that the first suit must claim every breach that has then occurred.
our predecessor court recognized this rule in container transport international,united states,concluding that res judicata would bar a contract claim for services performed after shipped goods were tendered for delivery,when an earlier action had determined the right to additional compensation for the actual shipment of the goods.a si
