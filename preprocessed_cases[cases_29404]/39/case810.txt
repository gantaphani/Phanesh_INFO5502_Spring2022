procedural background 
on february,tutor filed a complaint alleging a single cause of action for defamation against herrera in san mateo county superior court.paragraph sets forth quoted statements attributed to herrera,which are alleged to be defamatory of tutor.in response,herrera filed a motion to change venue of the case to san francisco.
while the motion to change venue was pending,herrera filed a motion to strike tutor complaint on june pursuant to section.the motion neither challenged the sufficiency of tutor complaint to state a cause of action for defamation,nor did it deny that the statements quoted in the complaint were actually made by herrera.instead,the motion contended that the complaint was filed in retaliation for herrera exercise of his constitutionally protected right of free speech in connection with a matter of public interest.therefore,the complaint fell within the provisions of california statute,subd.b.in addition,herrera asserted that the statements attributed to him were made concerning a federal lawsuit against tutor filed by herrera on behalf of the city and county of san francisco and the state of california and,thus,they were privileged.because the statements were privileged,herrera contended that tutor could not show a likelihood that it would prevail on the complaint merits,and therefore,the motion to strike the complaint must be granted.
on june,herrera motion to change venue to san francisco was granted 
on october,eight months after filing the complaint,tutor filed an ex parte motion seeking limited discovery in connection with the pending motion to strike,subd.g.that ex parte application was denied,without prejudice to renewing the motion at the hearing on herrera motion to strike.tutor was also ordered to file its opposition to herrera motion by october,and any reply was to be filed no later than october.accordingly,the hearing was continued to october.tutor then filed an opposition to herrera motion on october,and herrera a reply brief on october.
following a hearing on october,the trial court filed its order granting herrera motion to strike on november.this appeal followed.
legal discussiona.the statute and the standard of review on appeal 
we recently had occasion to discuss at considerable length california statute,including the applicable standard of review.as we said in thomas quintero th,d section,commonly referred to as the law,provides in relevant part a the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly.b a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.in making its determination,the court shall consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.if the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability that he or she will prevail on the claim,neither that determination nor the fact of that determination shall be admissible in evidence at any later stage of the case,and no burden of proof or degree of proof otherwise applicable shall be affected by that determination.e as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
under the statute,the court makes a determination first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e citation.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b navellier sletten cal th,d,see also equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon enterprises city of cotati cashman cal th,d.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at d.

herrera motion to strike was properly granted 
neither in the trial court nor on appeal does tutor contend that the alleged defamatory statements described in its complaint were not protected activity within the meaning of section,subdivision e.thus,it was tutor burden in opposing herrera motion to demonstrate a probability that it would prevail on its defamation claim,subd.b.the sole impediment to a showing that the claim had legal merit was herrera assertion that the statements were privileged under the official duty privilege,subd.a,as well as under the prosecutorial and discretionary immunities.
undisputed facts presented in connection with the motion reveal that herrera was first elected san francisco city attorney in december,and took office in january.on or about july,herrera,together with outside counsel,filed a second amended complaint sac for damages and penalties in case no.cw in the united states district court for the northern district of california.the sac contains causes of action,and names tutor and others as defendants.claims asserted included violations of state and local false claims acts,violations of rico,fraud,and breach of contract,among others.in summary,the sac seeks to recover tens of millions of dollars of public funds that the tutor defendants pocketed as the result of a pervasive and elaborate pattern or racketeering,false claims,fraud and unfair business practices perpetrated on several major construction projects at the san francisco international airport.
the allegedly defamatory statements attributed to herrera were made on march,during a keynote address entitled what price,justice at the annual dinner of the cadc,which he attended in his capacity as city attorney.the full text of that speech was attached as appendix a.after an appropriate salutation to the host group,and a reference to a string of eventful days at city hall in the last week,herrera explained that here the reason today was eventful for me,and began his comments relating to the federal litigation against tutor,and recent action taken at city hall in connection with the pending action 
as you may or may not be aware,mayor brown this evening vetoed an ordinance that had been unanimously approved by the board of supervisors directing the airport commission to allocate million for litigation against tutor.
within the mayor veto message is an opaque suggestion which some may read as agreement on my part in the mayor decision.
to avoid confusion,i want to make this absolutely clear i oppose the mayor veto.
and i urge the members of the board of supervisors to do the right thing and stand by their votes in it.
if you have heard much about the lawsuit,i fill you in on a few of the details.
tutor is a construction giant.in fact,it one of the largest and most politically connected in the nation.
tutor contracted to manage construction of sfo international terminal and several related projects,winning approximately billion in business from the city and county of san francisco based largely on its joint participation with businesses.
what no one knew at the what no one now that in many instances tutor did use minority subcontractors to do work at the airport.
instead,it used minority front companies,while subcontractors got the bulk of work and proceeds.it did so 
to win an enormously valuable contract.
to cheat legitimate minority contractors of their fair share of work.
and to defraud a city program that has for nearly two decades ensured equal opportunity and fairness to businesses traditionally in municipal bidding.
herrera went on to express his beliefs concerning the value of minority business preferences and his commitment to our program,indicating that he had filed legal actions against a number of companies and individuals for attempting to defraud it.he pointed to his concern for the pernicious effect mbe fraud has on the community like the kind that tutor committed at sfo.he then turned to discuss another reason he filed suit against tutor 
another reason is fraud 
and make no mistake about it the evidence is there.
in fact,the evidence we seen in san francisco fits a similar pattern of fraud and false claims that was established against tutor in los angeles w here a court awarded the metropolitan transportation agency million in damages,fees and costs.
over the last several weeks,the board of supervisors has heard the evidence of my office case against tutor.and without a single opposing vote with the support of every member of the board,in fact they directed the airport commission to fund the litigation with million out of the airport million reserve fund.
now to put this dollar amount in context the sum requested to pursue tutor for its fraudulent conduct is roughly equivalent to what the airport commission itself approved to fund a free luggage cart program in its customs area.
to argue that fiscal responsibility requires turning a blind eye to fraud is manifestly absurd 
to those who ask,what price,justice who question the value of enforcing our laws through the narrow lens of costs me give you an honest answer 
yes,going after fraud is expensive but not going after fraud is more expensive.
the fact is,the lawsuit my office is pursuing against tutor and its joint venture partners at sfo is about many important issues 
it about promoting equal opportunity.
it about protecting taxpayer dollars.
it about preserving the public trust.
and,perhaps most important,it about affirming the values we share.
following his speech,the text was posted on the official web site of the san francisco city attorney office,which was created and maintained at city hall.
the official duty privilege reposes in civil code section,subdivision a,which states with remarkable succinctness a privileged publication or broadcast is one made a in the proper discharge of an official duty.
within the factual context of this case,the most important court decision impacting the question of whether herrera statements fell within the official duty privilege is kilgore younger cal d.indeed,it is discussed and quoted by both parties in their respective briefs.younger involved former state attorney general evelle younger,who had commissioned a study of organized crime in california.the report named persons suspected of involvement in organized crime,including kilgore,who was identified as being engaged in an illegal bookmaking operation.id.at.the report was made public by younger at a press conference during which he distributed copies to the media,and proclaimed that he adopted its findings.id.at.kilgore then sued for defamation and related torts.
in affirming judgment on demurrer entered in favor of younger,the supreme court noted that the official duty privilege is absolute and applies to public statements made by governmental officers in the discharge of their official duties.the absolute privilege is extended to state and federal officials,such as the president of the united states,the governor of any state or territory,cabinet officers of the united states and the corresponding officers of any state or territory citation on the rationale that their ability to function would be impaired and society adversely affected if they were not absolutely free of the threat of suit by the defamed seeking recompense for injury.id.at.
similar to the argument made in this case by tutor,kilgore claimed that younger was politically motivated and was acting as a candidate when he held the press conference.the court rejected this contention,noting younger alleged activity,though it may well have been taken to produce a popular and appealing law enforcement image,was for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from actions initiated by public officials truly oblivious to the political ramifications of their moves.here,younger called his press conference in his capacity as attorney general,purported to act in such role throughout its duration and,at least as is here relevant,dealt exclusively with law enforcement issues.as such,it may not be said that his actions were outside the scope of his official duties,or that his motives were in fact improper.id.at.
in royer steinberg d,the court of appeal extended the official duty privilege to all state and local officials engaged in the policy making process and to any statement by a public official,so long as it is made a while exercising functions,and b within the scope of his official duties.id.at.see also copp paxton th,d.
most recently,and factually the most analogous to this case,the sixth district decided ingram flippo th,d.there,the monterey county district attorney was sued for declaratory and injunctive relief by a local school board member after issuing a press release charging the school board with minor violations of california brown act,et.although the district attorney denied any intention to prosecute for the minor violations described in the press release,the court nonetheless found the privilege applied t he district attorney issued a press release summarizing the r
