the practice of favoring close family members or friends with lucrative government contracts is hardly a new one,but,at least in modern times,it is usually forbidden.this case involves a variant of that story,in which a jury found defendant lazanda moore guilty of violating a,by participating in a scheme to conceal a material fact from the city of milwaukee the city,which in turn was receiving federal monies from the department of housing and urban development hud.in urging that her conviction should be overturned,moore argues primarily that she had no duty to disclose the fact that she was her mother daughter to the city and hence to the federal government.she challenges her conviction on a number of grounds related to this basic point,none of which we find persuasive.we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
moore mother,rosa cameron,founded the williamsburg heights community block club association wh in milwaukee.wh was a organization that cameron established to carry out neighborhood social programs it was largely funded by hud block grants awarded by the city of milwaukee.after a while,cameron ran for and was elected to be an alderwoman on milwaukee common council.at that point,she put her larosa cameron and later defendant lazanda charge of wh.throughout this time,federal hud monies continued to flow through the city to wh.because that funding process figures importantly in the charge against moore,we describe it here.
testimony at trial indicated that in recent years,hud had provided approximately million per year to the city of milwaukee under its community development block grant cdbg program.although the city is responsible for awarding and administering particular grants,its operations must comply with hud regulations,and it must ensure that the grant recipients,such as wh,comply with hud regulations.each year,the city block grant office solicits applications for funding its staff evaluates these applications and then recommends action to the community development policy committee of the milwaukee common council.upon receiving those recommendations,that committee holds hearings to decide which organizations it wishes to fund,although individual alderpersons both those on and those off the committee also meet informally with the applicants from their respective geographic areas during the deliberation process.that committee recommendations then move to the full council and the mayor for action.after a block grant is awarded to an organization,the organization must sign a contract with the city.the organization submits a budget,and then submits monthly activity and cost reports to the city.the city reviews the reports,and,if all is in order,it sends a check in the approved amount to the organization.
one of the hud regulations governing this process concerns conflicts of interest.see b.that regulation prohibits elected officials who participate in decisions about block grant funds from obtaining a financial benefit from a beneficiary organization,either for themselves or those with whom they have business or immediate family ties id.the regulation specifically covers elected officials of the recipient of the hud funds,as well as employees of subrecipients,such as wh.id.c.this regulation was specifically incorporated into the form contracts the city of milwaukee signed with recipients of hud block grant funds,including wh.
cameron was still the executive director of wh on september,when wh signed a block grant contract with the city for,to handle snow removal on vacant lots during.cameron and her daughter larosa using the name roberta allen,as we explain below,and acting as wh assistant director signed the contract on wh behalf,with cameron third daughter,robin bennett,signing as a witness.the city was not aware that larosa or roberta and robin were cameron daughters.some time before the april municipal elections in milwaukee,cameron decided to run for alderwoman.her plan was to get on the committee that controlled block grants,so that she could funnel more money to wh.cameron won her election in april,and was sworn in as alderwoman on april.four days earlier,again acting for wh,she and roberta had signed another block grant contract with the city,this one worth,for cutting grass.
at that point,larosa,still using the name roberta allen,succeeded cameron as the executive director of wh.despite appearances,larosa use of the name roberta allen was not entirely random.larosa full maiden name was larosa roberta cameron upon her marriage four months later on august,she changed her name to larosa roberta allen.cameron other daughters also changed their names defendant lazanda moore had been lazanda perine before her marriage,while her sister robin cameron became robin bennett upon marriage.moore became executive director of wh in september.
in late april,assistant city attorney ellen tangen explained the hud regulations to cameron,who by then was as planned a member of the community development policy committee.tangen told cameron that,since she had responsibility over the commitment of block grant funds,no member of her immediate family could be in a paid position at wh if wh were to receive any awards.on may,cameron wrote a memo to the city attorney stating that her husband and daughter singular worked at wh only as volunteers.that statement was false,as shown by payroll records at wh reflecting the fact that both allen and bennett were paid employees at the time.nevertheless,the city believed that any potential conflict had been resolved because,as tangen testified,it appeared from the memo that the alderwoman understood the regulation and would be in compliance with it.meanwhile,cameron decided that she would shift the grass cutting and snow removal work from her,hilton rollins,to a company moore had formed called perine maintenance.perine began to receive checks from wh on june,the first five checks were signed by allen.checks written after november were signed by moore in her capacity as executive director,and then endorsed by moore for perine with moore signing one name on the front of the check moore and another on the back perine.
the next block grant awarded to wh was a family affair.in august,wh applied for the grant allen signed the application as executive director and perine moore signed as secretary of wh governing body.cameron,as alderwoman,voted to award the grant.neither moore,allen,nor cameron ever disclosed their familial relationships during the grant process.wh paid all three of cameron daughters well past the date of cameron election to the milwaukee common council allen received in bennett received and defendant moore received directly,while her company perine received.in january,cameron again falsely told tangen that her daughter again singular was just a volunteer at wh,although allen,moore,and bennett were all at that point on wh payroll.on february,moore as executive director and allen as office manager signed the form contract,the earlier contracts that incorporated the hud the full text of the hud regulation.
by may,the city began to suspect that allen was cameron daughter,although it did not realize that moore might be too.it consulted with hud and took other steps to look into the matter.cameron continued to deceive the city,writing to the city attorney that allen was a former employee of wh who had left,and failing to reveal that moore was now wh executive director.
some of the evidence related specifically to moore role in the scheme.one wh employee testified that she overheard a telephone conversation between moore and a woman from the city block grant office in which moore told the woman that she had no idea that allen was cameron daughter.on may,juanita hawkins,the head of the block grant office,wrote a letter explicitly quoting the regulation and noting that,a ccording to a staff roster and payroll information it appears that roberta allen,who is the daughter of alderwoman rosa cameron,is a paid employee of wh,and then also raising six additional questions about the cost reports.two days later,moore wrote back,responding to the six questions about documentation with regard to conflicts of interest,moore wrote only,we feel it is unmerited for you to pend sic our grant for the reason being possible conflict of interest.notably,moore did not bother to mention that she too was one of cameron daughters.she also remained silent in a series of conversations with other city officials who were trying to get to the bottom of the conflict problem.on august,moore faxed a letter to the block grant office falsely stating that the conflict had been removed,because allen had been gone from wh since february,even though payroll records showed that allen was paid through july.her letter again failed to mention that she was also cameron daughter.on september,moore sent yet another letter to the city,asserting this time that allen last day of work was march.and,also in september,moore signed off as executive director on another application for block grant funds,this time seeking for crime prevention neighborhood organizing.
by the end of,the game was up.cameron tried denying to hawkins that moore was her biological daughter,but apparently the city had been fooled long enough,and wh lost its funding.nevertheless,in,it paid a total of to moore and allen,and another to perine maintenance.the initial indictment was handed down on october,charging rosa cameron,larosa cameron aka roberta allen,and lazanda moore with various violations of federal law.cameron and allen pleaded guilty,but moore went to trial and was convicted on a superseding indictment charging only the violation.moore was sentenced on july,to two years probation and ordered to pay a fine.
sufficiency of indictment and evidence 
moore raises a number of arguments on appeal,all concerning her conviction.first,she claims that the superseding indictment fails to allege facts that constitute an offense under,because it does not allege facts that demonstrate that moore had a duty to disclose her familial relationships.this court reviews the sufficiency of an indictment de novo.united states webster,cir.an indictment,according to federal rule of criminal procedure c,must be a plain,concise,and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.an indictment is sufficient if it first,contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,and,second,enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.webster,at quoting hamling united states,d.
we have identified five elements of a false statements charge under a,which,stated more generally,also apply to a scheme to conceal a material fact prohibited by a the defendant must make a statement,or have a duty to disclose the information the statement must be false,or there must be acts amounting to concealment the statement or concealed facts must be material the person must make the statement or conceal the facts knowingly and willfully and the statement or concealed information must concern a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal department or agency.see united states ross,cir.moore argues that the superseding indictment failed to meet several of these elements first,that she had a duty to disclose second,that she committed an affirmative act of concealment and third,that the information she was concealing was material.
we are not persuaded by her position.the opening paragraph of the superseding indictment charged that moore,with cameron and allen,knowingly and willfully planned and executed a scheme to conceal a material fact,which they had a duty to disclose emphasis added.the indictment goes on to charge that the material fact in question was that members of the immediate family of rosa cameron were receiving a financial benefit from williamsburg heights community block club association while it was being funded,in significant part,by community development block grants cdbg funded by the united states department of housing and urban development hud and awarded by the common council of the city of milwaukee.finally,the indictment specifically charged that as part of the scheme moore,then serving as executive director of williamsburg heights,sent a letter to the city of milwaukee community development block grants in response to an inquiry over whether roberta allen was a daughter of rosa cameron who was working for williamsburg heights,and that the letter from moore falsely stated that roberta allen had stopped working at williamsburg heights on march.we could go on,but this is enough to show that the indictment adequately charges the crime.whether moore actions met these allegations,including whether she indeed had a duty to disclose,is another matter relating more to the sufficiency of the evidence to convict,to which we now turn.
moore spends most of her time arguing that she had no duty to disclose her relationship with cameron,attempting to draw a line between the prohibited conflict itself and the information she was required to disclose.when we review the sufficiency of the evidence,we ask only if,after viewing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the government,and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom,a rational trier of fact could not have found the essential elements of the crime,beyond a reasonable doubt.united states rivera,cir citing jackson virginia,d.the government accuses moore of characterizing the scheme too narrowly.in its view,the material fact that she had a duty to disclose was that members of cameron family were receiving financial benefits from wh while it was being funded by hud block grants.thus,the government argues,moore had a duty to disclose not only her own relationship to cameron,but also the fact that she,allen,and bennett were receiving financial benefits in the form of paychecks from wh.this duty arose both when moore signed contracts on wh behalf and in the course of her communications with city officials who were investigating the problem.
our starting point in considering this argument is the language of the contracts that wh signed with the city.importantly,these are essentially form contracts,the content of which was dictated by hud and the terms of the block grant program.thus,these particular contracts are the functional equivalent of any other government form.the contract covering the period from january,through december,which moore herself signed,is typical.article xxi of that contract is entitled conflict of interest pursuant to cfr,cfr and omb circular.subsections a and b specify that no officer,employee,or agent of the city a or member of the governing body of the locality b shall have any financial interest,direct or indirect,in the contract.subsection c reads as follows 
interest of contractor and employees.the contractor covenants that no person described in article xxi,a and b above,who presently exercises any functions or responsibilities in connection with the contract has any financial interest,direct or indirect,in this contract.the contractor further covenants that presently has no interest and shall not acquire any interest,direct or indirect,which would conflict in any manner or degree with the performance of services hereunder.the contractor further covenants that in the performance of this contract no person having any conflicting interest shall be employed.an interest on the part of the contractor or employees must be disclosed to the city 
emphasis added.the subsection that immediately follows replicates hud regulation for cdbg grants,which makes clear that among the prohibited conflicts are those in which an elected official obtains a financial interest or benefit from a activity either for herself or her immediate family.
while it may have been possible theoretically to cross the t and dot the i more perfectly in this language,its import is unmistakable conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the city,and one type of conflict arises when an elected official or the immediate family of an elected official benefits financially from the cdbg grant.the evidence before the jury easily permitted it to conclude that moore,who signed this contract to obtain hud block grant funds,knew what the standards were and delibera
