plaintiff and appellant michael leslie productions,dba ready golf centers ready golf appeals from the judgment of dismissal entered by the trial court following the sustaining of the demurrer of defendant and respondent city of los angeles city to ready golf original complaint without leave to amend.ready golf contends it stated a valid claim entitling it to relief by writ of mandate,and that even if there were defects in its original pleading,the trial court abused its discretion in refusing ready golf at least one opportunity to amend.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the city operates seven public golf courses through its department of recreation and parks department two courses at the sepulveda golf complex,two courses at griffith park,the hansen dam golf course,the rancho park golf course,and the woodley lakes golf course.almost golf carts,on average,are in operation at the city golf courses on any given day.in,the concession at the city golf courses was handled by a private entity,kishi company kishi.kishi had operated the concession for a number of years under a written contract with the city,but that contract expired in,and kishi continued to operate the concession thereafter on a basis.
in july,the department issued a request for proposal,inviting private entities to submit bids to contract with the city for the concession at all seven golf courses.the request for proposal included notice to proposed bidders that the department would also conduct an analysis in accordance with section of the city charter to determine whether it was more economical or feasible for the city to the concession.the results of the analysis and plan for would be evaluated with the proposed bids received from private entities.
the request for proposal also gave notice that the board of recreation and park commissioners board was the contract awarding authority for the department and would,at a public meeting,select the bidder to be awarded the contract.the selected concessionaire would then complete final paperwork and execute the contract directly with the city.proposed bidders were also given notice that section of the city administrative code required the proposed contract to be approved by the city council because the term of the proposed concession exceeded three years.and,proposed bidders were further advised that under section of the city charter,the city reserved the right to reject any and all bids or proposals and waive any informalities in any bid received if to do so was to the advantage of the city.
in response to the request for proposal,the department received five bids.two of those bids were rejected during the initial review for noncompliance with the required bid documentation set forth in the request for proposal.the bids from ready golf,kishi and a third entity,angeles management services,proceeded to the next stage of the evaluation process.
to assist in administering the request for proposal,the department hired economic research associates,an independent consultant.economic research associates selected a panel composed of individuals from other municipalities experienced in public golf course management.the independent panel interviewed the three proposed bidders and evaluated their respective bids using scoring criteria for six different categories,including ability to finance,qualifications and background,description of proposed golf carts,cart maintenance and cart replacement,business plan,proposed rental payment to city,and capital improvements.each bidder was evaluated and ranked in each category,with a perfect score being.ready golf received the highest overall score of points.kishi was second with a score of,and angeles management services was ranked third with a score of.
the panel unanimously recommended that ready golf be awarded the contract.economic research associates concurred with the panel assessment and forwarded the recommendation to the department.in may,john mukri,general manager of the department,prepared a report for consideration by the board,summarizing the evaluation process and recommending that ready golf be awarded the contract.mukri also reported that the department analysis under section of the city charter showed it was more economical to award the contract to ready golf than for the city to attempt to the concession.
at its june,meeting,the board voted unanimously to award the contract to ready golf.the two losing bidders,kishi and angeles management services,asked the board to reconsider its decision.at another lengthy public meeting held july,the board once again voted unanimously to award the contract to ready golf.
the proposed contract with ready golf contained a provision that the concession would last for years,with one year renewal option.section of the city administrative code required city council approval of the proposed contract because it was for a term of more than three years.pursuant to the mayor executive directive,the contract also had to be reviewed by the mayor office.
upon receipt of the proposed contract,the mayor office ordered a report to be prepared by the office of the city administrative officer cao.following its review of the proposed contract with ready golf,the cao issued a report dated october,recommending that the city council approve and authorize the board to execute the contract,subject to approval as to form by the city attorney in accordance with section of the city charter.
the cao report was not released publicly,nor was the proposed contract forwarded to the city council for a vote.instead,the mayor office asked the cao to review the proposed contract again.in december,after reevaluating the ready golf contract,the cao released its second report,once again recommending that the city council authorize and approve execution of the proposed contract.the report also concurred in the department assessment that it would be more economical for the city to contract with ready golf than to the concession.
because ready golf had not received notice of the scheduling of a vote on its contract,ready golf made numerous inquiries of the mayor office as to the status of the proposed contract.ready golf was told by a representative of the mayor office that the cao got it wrong,but despite several requests,ready golf was unable to obtain release of the cao reports.after continued inquiries by ready golf,the mayor office finally released the cao reports to the city clerk in july,and the proposed contract was forwarded to the arts,parks,health and aging committee of the city council for review in preparation for a vote by the full council.
the committee,headed by councilmember tom labonge,voted two to zero to approve the proposed contract with ready golf.the contract was then placed on the city council agenda for a vote on july.during the hearing,a vote on the contract was put on hold on the motion of councilmember jan perry on the grounds that michael yamaki,a lawyer for kishi,was not present.yamaki is the nephew of kishi principal,as well as a former member of the board of police commissioners and the fire commission,and an adviser to los angeles county sheriff lee baca.yamaki was also president of the riviera country club and regularly played golf with city officials.
without any explanation to ready golf,the proposed contract was sent back to the arts,parks,health and aging committee,whereupon the committee once again voted to approve the contract and to have the matter voted on by the full council.in light of the unexplained delays and procedures,ready golf believed yamaki was lobbying members of the city council to vote to reject the ready golf contract.
on september,the proposed contract was reset for a vote by the city council.several individuals including the president of the board,and mukri,the general manager of the department,argued for approval of the contract.the city council was advised that kishi was being audited for alleged underreporting of revenues to the city and other possible financial irregularities.the city council voted eight to seven to disapprove the proposed contract with ready golf.during that same session,the city council passed two motions asking the board to award a contract to kishi,and asking the department to study the feasibility of transitioning to of the concession at the end of the period.
kishi was allowed to continue to operate the concession on a basis while the department undertook an analysis of the city council requests.the audit of kishi was completed in august.the audit confirmed that kishi had underreported revenues to the city and otherwise questioned kishi internal accounting procedures.after issuance of the final audit report,the general manager of the department issued a third report on the request for proposal of the concession.based on a reevaluation of the feasibility of,the department came to the revised conclusion that was the best option,providing a higher rate of return to the city,even as compared with what the department expected under the ready golf bid.the department further recommended that any further relationship with kishi be terminated.the department also recommended that the request for proposal be cancelled,and that all bidders be sent notices of rejection with deposits returned.ready golf received a notice of rejection dated september,along with a return of its bid deposit.
ready golf filed this action in november stating claims for ordinary mandamus and administrative mandamus,and requesting the issuance of a writ of mandate directing the city to submit the proposed contract with ready golf to the city council for a vote compelling the award and execution of the proposed contract with ready golf.the city demurred,contending there was no basis for a writ as a matter of law because the city can not be compelled to exercise its discretion in a particular manner.
after briefing and oral argument,the trial court sustained the city demurrer without leave to amend and entered a judgment of dismissal on april.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the central question we must resolve is whether the trial court,in sustaining the city demurrer without leave to amend,erred in determining that ready golf failed as a matter of law to state a claim for traditional mandamus pursuant to code of civil procedure.our review of the court determination of the legal sufficiency of the complaint is de novo.we exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.citations.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and viewing its parts in context.citations.we deem to be true all material facts properly pled.citation.we must also accept as true those facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.citation.citation.westamerica bank city of berkeley th,d westamerica bank.
our review of the court decision denying leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion.when the trial court sustains a demurrer without leave to amend,we must also consider whether the complaint might state a cause of action if a defect could reasonably be cured by amendment.if the defect can be cured,then the judgment of dismissal must be reversed to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to do so.the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating a reasonable possibility to cure any defect by amendment.citations.citation.westamerica bank,supra,th at,d.
we conclude the demurrer was properly sustained and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.
writ of mandate code civ.
a public entity award of a contract,and all of the acts leading up to the award,are legislative in character.citation.sn sands city and county of san francisco th,d sn sands accord,marshall pasadena unified school dist.th,d.a traditional writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section is a proper remedy for review of a legislative determination.marshall,supra,at,d accord,mike moore hour towing city of san diego th,d.
judicial review of such a determination is limited.a traditional writ may issue to compel the performance of a ministerial duty,and to correct those acts and decisions of administrative agencies which are in violation of law,where no other adequate remedy is provided.bodinson california com.cal d,see also code civ.generally,code of civil procedure section may only be employed to compel the performance of a duty which is purely ministerial in character.citation.a ministerial act is an act that a public officer is required to perform in a prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority and without regard to his own judgment or opinion concerning such act propriety or impropriety,when a given state of facts exists.discretion,on the other hand,is the power conferred on public functionaries to act officially according to the dictates of their own judgment.rodriguez solis th,d.mandamus does not lie to compel a public agency to exercise discretionary powers in a particular manner,only to compel it to exercise its discretion in some manner.aids healthcare foundation los angeles county of public health th,d accord,landsborough kelly cal d,landsborough.
to the extent ready golf attempted to plead a cause of action for a writ of administrative mandamus pursuant to code of civil procedure section,we find there is no basis,as a matter of law,for stating such a claim because,on the facts pled,the challenged decision was not in nature.see monterey mechanical sacramento regional county sanitation dist.th,d monterey mechanical see also ghilotti construction city of richmond th,fn,d.indeed,ready golf does not argue on appeal any claim for administrative mandamus.we therefore limit our discussion to the viability of ready golf claim for traditional mandamus.
