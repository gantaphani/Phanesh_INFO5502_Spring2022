in response to the petition for panel rehearing filed by intervenor jardin minerals and bruiere minerals,and having duly considered the response and the reply,we grant rehearing,withdraw the prior panel opinion,in its entirety and substitute the following 
the united states appeals a judgment that its mineral royalty,attached to mineral servitudes on the relevant land,had except for a acre tract prescribed in accordance with louisiana law because of the lack of qualifying production for a period in excess of ten years.we vacate and remand.
in,acting under the authority of the migratory bird conservation act,et,the united states purchased approximately acres of land in cameron parish,louisiana,from plaintiff lacassane,lacassane,to be included in the lacassine national wildlife refuge.a portion of the acreage was subject to a mineral servitude the gardiner servitude held by a previous owner of that tract the gardiner servitude was a interest in the minerals contained in the relevant parcel.
in its deed of sale,lacassane reserved for itself all mineral rights in the entire acreage the lacassane servitude.because the gardiner servitude was created first,the lacassane servitude was subject to the gardiner servitude.as a result,after selling the land to the government,lacassane held all mineral rights in the land not subject to the gardiner servitude and a mineral interest in the land subject to the gardiner servitude.
at the time the united states acquired the land,all mineral servitudes in louisiana were subject to the rule of liberative prescription.a servitude would prescribe if it went unused for ten years,and parties could not contract to extend the prescription period in,however,louisiana passed act,which provided as follows 
when land is acquired by conventional deed or contract,condemnation or expropriation proceedings by the united states of america,or any of its subdivisions or agencies from any person,firm or corporation,and by the act of acquisition,order or judgment,oil,gas or other minerals or royalties are reserved,or the land so acquired is by the act of acquisition conveyed subject to a prior sale or reservation of oil,gas,or other minerals or royalties,still in force and effect,the rights so reserved or previously sold shall be imprescriptible.
united states little lake misere land,d quoting the statute see also.stat.current successor to act.act was meant to facilitat e federal land acquisitions by removing uncertainty on the part of reluctant vendors over the duration of mineral reservations retained by them.little lake misere,at.
despite the apparently purpose of the act,the louisiana supreme court held that it applied even to federal acquisitions,such as the government purchase of land from lacassane,that had taken place before the act was passed.see whitney bank little creek oil,so d.in addition,the court held that act superseded not only the prior default statutory rule of prescription but also preexisting contractual terms of prescription.see leiter minerals,cal,so d.under the regime set up by the louisiana supreme court,servitudes on land owned by the united states,which were prescriptible by statute or by contract when created,became imprescriptible under act.
in little lake misere,at,the united states supreme court reversed,in part,these decisions of the louisiana supreme court,holding that when a land acquisition by the united states arises from and bears heavily on a federal regulatory program,state law can not,of its own force,govern the acquisition.instead,federal law must provide the rule of decision.although state law often should be borrowed as the federal rule of decision,specific aberrant or hostile state rules do not provide appropriate standards for federal law.id.at.the court held that act could not be borrowed as the law governing certain federal land acquisitions pursuant to the migratory bird conservation act,because 
a s applied to a consummated land transaction under a contract which specifically defined conditions for prolonging the vendor mineral reservation,retroactive application of act to the united states deprives it of contractual interests to permit state abrogation of the explicit terms of a federal land acquisition would deal a serious blow to the congressional scheme contemplated by the migratory bird conservation act and indeed all other federal land acquisition programs.
having determined that act could not govern the federal land acquisitions at issue,the court did not need to choose between adopting residual louisiana law louisiana law excepting act and formulating an independent federal common law rule of prescription.the explicit prescription terms of the acquisition contract controlled,rendering the servitudes at issue prescriptible and already prescribed.id.at.
the instant plaintiffs,intervenors,and their ancestors in title,holders of the lacassane and gardiner servitudes,were in a position similar to that of the little lake misere plaintiffs.the united states had acquired the land subject to said servitudes before passage of act,and the acquisition contract contained an express term of prescription for the lacassane servitude the holders of the gardiner and lacassane servitudes sued in federal court in,seeking a declaratory judgment that their servitudes,although prescriptible pursuant to little lake misere,had not yet prescribed 
in,the parties entered into a settlement agreement with the united states,which confirmed that the gardiner and lacassane servitudes remained validly in existence.in exchange,the servitude owners agreed to carve a mineral royalty and bonus and rental rights out of the servitudes and to convey them to the united states.pursuant to the settlement,the servitude owners executed an act of conveyance,which granted the united states of all royalties received by the servitude owners on oil,gas,or other minerals attributable to the land subject to the lacassane and gardiner servitudes,with certain articulated exceptions.the servitude owners also conveyed to the government of all rentals and bonuses received by the servitude owners under the terms of any oil,gas and mineral lease of the subject land from and after such time as of the income from such bonuses and rentals shall equal the sum of.
under louisiana law,a mineral royalty is the right to participate in production of minerals from land owned by another or land subject to a mineral servitude owned by another.unless expressly qualified by the parties,a royalty is a right to share in gross production free of mining or drilling and production costs.stat.when a royalty right is created by one whose title terminates at a particular time or upon the occurrence of a certain condition,such as an owner of a servitude,the royalty extinguishes when the underlying title extinguishes.id.
in addition,royalty rights,like servitudes,are real property rights owned separately from perfect title in the land and are subject to prescription after ten years of nonuse.see id.there are different rules for servitudes and royalty rights,however,with regard to what counts as a qualifying use capable of interrupting the prescription period.
most notably,good faith drilling operations,even if unsuccessful,interrupt prescription running against a servitude.see id.et.on the other hand,only actual production of minerals subject to the royalty interest interrupts prescription running against a royalty.see id.et.thus,while a mineral royalty carved out of a servitude is always extinguished when the servitude ceases to exist,it also can be extinguished before the servitude expires.the royalty,in other words,is prescriptible separately from the servitude.
in,waterfowl limited liability company waterfowl,holder of a interest in the gardiner servitude,and lacassane,holder of the lacassane servitude,sued for a declaratory judgment that the government mineral royalty on production from the gardiner and lacassane servitudes had with the exception of a acre tract subject to the garrison well prescribed in accordance with louisiana law as a result of the lack of qualifying production for a period in excess of ten years.in an amended complaint,waterfowl and lacassane included a claim under the quiet title act,seeking a determination that the mineral rights conveyed by the servitude owners to the united states had been extinguished by application of the louisiana mineral code.
the district court allowed jardin minerals company jardin and bruiere minerals company bruiere to intervene because they own mineral rights affected by the government royalty.jardin holds a interest in the gardiner servitude,and bruiere holds the mineral royalty and executive rights attributable to jardin interest 
the government stipulates that its royalty has prescribed under louisiana law,but it contends that louisiana law does not govern the rights established in the settlement agreement and the implementing act of conveyance.rather,the government argues that pursuant to little lake misere and central pines,federal law controls the rights at issue.furthermore,the government contends that the relevant rules of the louisiana mineral code can not be borrowed as the federal rule of decision because the state rules are hostile to the government interests.the government asserts that the terms of the settlement agreement and act of conveyance establish that the royalty is not separately prescriptible and can cease to exist only when the underlying servitudes are extinguished.
the parties forewent a trial and agreed that the district court should enter final judgment on the basis of the stipulations,submitted documentary evidence,and briefs.applying louisiana law of its own force,and in the alternative borrowing state law as the federal rule of decision,the court entered judgment in favor of the servitude owners as to all claims.the united states appeals.
we review questions of law,including choice of law and contract interpretation,de novo because this matter involves determining whether federal or state law applies,and also involves interpreting a settlement agreement,we utilize that standard here.
little lake misere sets up a inquiry for determining what law governs the rights at issue in cases such as this.first,we must determine whether federal law controls or state law applies of its own force.second,if we decide that federal law controls,we must determine the content of the applicable federal law.specifically,we must decide whether to adopt state law as the federal rule of decision.because the government has conceded that its royalty has prescribed under louisiana law,it can succeed only if federal law applies and state law is not borrowed as the federal rule of decision.
in answering the initial choice of law question,the court in little lake misere,at,placed particular emphasis on whether the transaction at issue is one arising from and bearing heavily upon a federal regulatory program.if this condition is met,state law can not apply to the transaction of its own force.in determining that federal law controlled the particular acquisition before it,the court reasoned as follows 
we deal with the interpretation of a land acquisition agreement a explicitly authorized,though not precisely governed,by the migratory bird conservation act and b to which the united states itself is a party.as in clearfield and its progeny,the duties imposed upon the united states and the rights acquired by it find their roots in the same federal sources in absence of an applicable act of congress it is for the federal courts to fashion the governing rule of law according to their own standards.
id.at.quoting clearfield trust united states.
in central pines,we dealt with a federal land acquisition similar to the one in little lake misere,with one notable distinction.in little lake misere,the acquisition contract contained an express term of prescription for the relevant servitude created at the time of the acquisition.the servitude at issue in central pines,however,was already in existence when the united states purchased the relevant land thus,there was no express term of prescription in the acquisition contract,because the government was incapable of bargaining for such a term.we held that the absence of an explicit contractual right was not enough to render state law applicable of its own force where the remaining operative conditions of little lake purchase pursuant to a federal statute with the united states as a party to the present.we stated that 
w hether or not the united states bargained over the creation of the servitude,the acquisition subject to the existing servitude created a federal interest in the potential prescription of the mineral servitude conveyed by the deed via the rule of prescription in place at the time of contract the term at issue in little lake in effect set the prescriptive period for the reserved mineral servitude.the government contract right was to obtain the mineral rights after the contractual prescriptive period had elapsed.similarly,in this case the government right is to obtain the mineral rights after the default prescriptive period has elapsed.this right,as in little lake,is arguably weaker because it arises from a default rule.
based on little lake misere and central pines,federal law undoubtedly controlled the rights at issue in the brewer litigation out of which the government mineral royalty arose.by purchasing the land subject to the gardiner and laccassane servitudes pursuant to the migratory bird conservation act and before the passage of act,the united states acquired interests in the reversion of the mineral rights on the extinction of those servitudes following the end of the contractual period of prescription with respect to the lacassane servitude and the end of the statutory prescription period with respect to the gardiner servitude.those reversionary interests,per little lake misere and central pines,are governed by federal law.
the question,however,is whether the royalty right conveyed to the united states as part of the settlement of the brewer litigation must also be governed by federal law.the servitude owners argue,and the district court agreed,that because the royalty was obtained as consideration in a settlement agreement rather than as part of a land acquisition pursuant to a federal program,federal law does not control.the government contends,to the contrary,that rights obtained in the settlement of a dispute over federal interests are equally matters of federal law.the government argues that by modifying the rights established between the parties as part of the acquisition,the brewer settlement did not displace the migratory bird conservation act as the legal foundation for those rights.
we agree with the government.the united states was able to obtain the instant royalty interest only because it had the authority under the migratory bird conservation act to purchase the land to which the royalty was attached and to acquire,as part of that purchase,reversionary interests in the mineral rights on that land.the fact that the united states obtained the royalty as part of a reorganization of the rights the parties held under the initial deed should not render federal law inoperative.in the language of clearfield trust,the government royalty right finds its root in the same federal source that allowed the acquisition.accordingly,federal law controls the right,including its prescriptibility.
having determined that federal law controls the royalty right in issue,we must decide whether to adopt louisiana law as the federal rule of decision,notwithstanding that louisiana law does not apply of its own force.as we have noted,the court stated in little lake misere,at,that specific aberrant or hostile state rules do not provide appropriate standards for federal law.the court asserted that,at the very least,state law should not be borrowed as the rule of decision where doing so would deprive the government of a contractual interest.id.at.
we elaborated on little lake misere in central pines,stating that we 
begin with the premise that state law should supply the federal rule unless there is an expression of legislative intent to the contrary,or,failing that,a showing that state law conflicts significantly with any federal interests or policies present in this case.refusing to ap
