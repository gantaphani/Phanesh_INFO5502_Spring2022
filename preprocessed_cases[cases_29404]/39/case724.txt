the factual and legal setting of this case is complex,involving the legislature decision to dissolve the many redevelopment agencies which became a fixture of local government financing over decades,and involving the way the moneys remaining in the redevelopment agency coffers around the state would be redistributed.
but the narrow dispute on appeal turns on the straightforward interpretation of a few statutes.as the trial court correctly reasoned,those statutes authorized plaintiffs city of emeryville and successor agency to the emeryville redevelopment agency collectively,emeryville to reenter into three agreements entered into before the dissolution of redevelopment agencies.and,contrary to the view of defendant california department of finance department,nothing in the statutory scheme providing for the orderly distribution of redevelopment funds subsequently invalidated these reentered agreements.accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment,which in effect compels the department to acknowledge the validity of those agreements.
background 
general legal background 
as briefly summarized by our supreme court in the aftermath of world war ii,the legislature authorized the formation of community redevelopment agencies in order to remediate urban decay.citations.the community redevelopment law was intended to help local governments revitalize blighted communities.citations.it has since become a principal instrument of economic development,mostly for cities,with nearly redevelopment agencies now active in california.california redevelopment matosantos cal th,matosantos.
however,as our supreme court explained,a perception had grown that some redevelopment agencies were used as shams to divert property tax revenues that otherwise would fund general local governmental services,and legislative efforts were made to address these concerns.matosantos,supra,cal th at see meaney sacramento housing redevelopment agency th.ultimately,a more draconian measure was adopted by the legislature responding to a declared state fiscal emergency,in the summer of the legislature enacted two measures intended to stabilize school funding by reducing or eliminating the diversion of property tax revenues from school districts to the state community redevelopment agencies.assem.bill.enacted as stats,chs.hereafter assembly bill and assembly bill.assembly bill bars redevelopment agencies from engaging in new business and provides for their windup and dissolution.assembly bill offers an alternative redevelopment agencies can continue to operate if the cities and counties that created them agree to make payments into funds benefiting the state schools and special districts.matosantos,supra,cal th at.
our supreme court invalidated assembly bill,because it conflicted with a provision of the california constitution forbidding the payments required thereunder.matosantos,supra,cal th at.following that decision,the only lawful option for redevelopment agencies was windup and dissolution,as provided by assembly bill,set forth in the health and safety code,although matosantos judicially reformed certain dates in assembly bill to best effectuate the legislature intent.matosantos,at.
the principal statutes in contention 
assembly bill provided that successor agencies would e xpeditiously wind down the affairs of the redevelopment agency pursuant to the provisions of this part and in accordance with the direction of the oversight board.health,subd.h.each oversight board consists of members appointed as set forth by statute,subd.a,and has a fiduciary duty towards holders of enforceable obligations and the taxing entities that benefit from distributions of property tax,subd.i to carry out its duties,which include the duty to review specified actions by the successor agencies,including establishment of the recognized obligation payment schedule rops,subd.g.the rops is the document setting forth the minimum payment amounts and due dates of payments required by enforceable obligations for each fiscal period,subd.h.the successor agency has a duty to c ontinue to make payments due for enforceable obligations,subd.a.thus,to help insure the orderly windup and dissolution of the redevelopment agencies,the rops lists what remaining enforceable obligations exist.
to ensure each rops is accurate,both the department and the state controller,not a party herein,have the authority to require documentation of purported enforceable obligations,and they and any taxing entity have authority to sue to prevent a violation under this part,subd.a.the department also has authority to review an oversight board action taken pursuant to assembly bill,subd.h.
under assembly bill,section,subdivision a provided as follows 
commencing on the operative date of this part,agreements,contracts,or arrangements between the city or county,or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the redevelopment agency are invalid and shall not be binding on the successor agency provided,however,that a successor entity wishing to enter or reenter into agreements with the city,county,or city and county that formed the redevelopment agency that it is succeeding may do so upon obtaining the approval of its oversight board.italics added.
further,section,subdivision h requires oversight board approval of a request by a successor agency to enter into such an agreement.
however,effective june,assembly bill stats,ch,hereafter assembly bill added the following sentence to section,subdivision a 
a successor agency or an oversight board shall not exercise the powers granted by this subdivision to restore funding for an enforceable obligation that was deleted or reduced by the department pursuant to subdivision h of section unless it reflects the decisions made during the meet and confer process with the department or pursuant to a court order,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch.
assembly bill made other significant changes as well.originally,section,subdivision h in part provided,the department may review an oversight board action taken pursuant to the act adding this part.as such,all oversight board actions shall not be effective for three business days,pending a request for review by the department,and upon such review,the department had days from the date of its request to approve the oversight board action or return it to the oversight board for reconsideration and such oversight board action shall not be effective until approved by the department.stats,ch,italics added.assembly bill delayed the effective date of oversight board action for five days,gave the department days to review such action,and provided that,upon such review,the department may eliminate or modify any item on that schedule prior to its approval and shall provide notice as to the reasons for its actions,subd.h,as amended by stats,ch.
assembly bill also added new section,providing in part as follows 
a successor agencies shall lack the authority to,and shall not,create new enforceable obligations or begin new redevelopment work,except in compliance with an enforceable obligation that existed prior to june,before the effective date of assembly bill.
b successor agencies may create enforceable obligations to conduct the work of winding down the redevelopment agency 
c successor agencies shall lack the authority to,and shall not,transfer any powers or revenues of the successor agency to any other party,public or private,except pursuant to an enforceable obligation on a rops approved by the department.any such transfers of authority or revenues that are not made pursuant to an enforceable obligation on a rops approved by the department of finance are hereby declared to be void,and the successor agency shall take action to reverse any of those transfers 
d any actions taken by redevelopment agencies to create obligations after june,are ultra vires and do not create enforceable obligations.
e the legislature finds and declares that the provisions of this section are declaratory of existing law.stats,ch.
emeryville redevelopment projects 
on february,before assem.bill had passed,emeryville and its redevelopment agency had entered into a contract under which the agency pledged funds to emeryville for redeveloping projects.emeryville realized that contract was subsequently invalidated by assembly bill specifically,the first clause of section,subdivision a.however,it also realized that the statute also provided that a successor entity wishing to enter or reenter into agreements with the city that formed the redevelopment agency that it is succeeding may do so upon obtaining the approval of its oversight board,subd.a.
on june,emeryville and the successor agency executed five agreements,restating the provisions as to five of the original projects,and on june,one day prior to the effective date of assembly bill,discussed immediately above,and purportedly under the earlier,assembly bill version of section,subdivision a,its oversight board approved three of these five agreements these agreements were included in an amended rops submitted on june,the day after assembly bill passed.on july,three business days later,the department told emeryville it was reviewing the rops.on july,it sent a letter to all successor agencies stating it would not accept rops revisions and rejected emeryville amended rops.the trial court found that this action effectively disapproved the agreements.
the present litigation 
emeryville sued the department,seeking to compel the department to recognize the enforceability of the three reentered agreements,filing a combined petition for writ of administrative mandamus and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.the trial court issued a thorough written opinion in favor of emeryville,and granted relief in a formal judgment and writ of mandamus 
the department timely filed this appeal therefrom.
discussion 
the original assembly bill statutes appeared to authorize emeryville to reenter into the agreements at issue,subject to approval by the oversight board and review by the department.emeryville obtained approval by its oversight board for the agreements,which,when so approved,were valid unless disapproved by the department.if disapproved,the department was to return the rops to the oversight board for reconsideration within days.former,subd.h,added by stats,ch.in this case,the department did not substantively disapprove the amended rops,it simply refused to process it,claiming it was untimely 
we note that the department asserts the reentered agreements covered the subject matter of agreements disapproved in an earlier rops submission,but agrees they had new and different terms.the department point seems to be that they were not merely reentered but different agreements.however,the department does not articulate any material differences,and it was the department burden to explain any basis for reversal on which it seeks to rely.see denham superior court cal d,see also estate of palmer d.
the department suggests throughout its briefing that emeryville acted with improper motives by rushing these agreements through with knowledge of a pending legislative change.however,it is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed,see crowe boyle cal,southern cal.underground contractors,city of san diego th.even assuming,as the state alleges,that the oversight board disregarded legal advice,as an elected body it was free to do so.nor is it necessarily sinister for a party to hasten to comply with a law before adverse changes occur.finally,as the trial court explicitly found,the oversight board thoroughly debated the issues,and approved only three of the five agreements submitted to it,showing discretion was actually exercised.
essentially,the department arguments boil down to two claims.first,the department asserts that the statute allowing reentry of certain agreements,section,is too narrow to encompass the three agreements here,because of certain statutory arguments we address in more detail in part i,post,and because of the policy inherent in assembly bill.second,the department claims that assembly bill passed after emeryville reentered the three agreements had retrospective effect,including section,quoted above.emeryville conceded in the trial court and appellate briefing that this claim,if correct,would invalidate those agreements.as we shall explain,we are not persuaded by either of the department claims.
emeryville legal authority to reenter into the agreements 
citing various parts of assembly bill and its general goal,the department asserts section,subdivision a did not authorize emeryville to reenter into the agreements at issue herein.we hold the statute unambiguously allowed emeryville to do what it did.
first,the department policy claim cites several disparate sections of assembly bill to establish the legislature desire to halt redevelopment agency activity and freeze existing assets.but an uncodified statement of legislative intent explicitly sets forth the purposes of assembly bill,which included barring existing redevelopment agencies from incurring new obligations,and requiring successor agencies to expeditiously wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies and to provide the successor agencies with limited authority that extends only to the extent needed to implement a winddown of redevelopment agency affairs.stats,ch,subd.j.our supreme court validated assembly bill purpose in these regards.see matosantos,supra,cal th at.
but this general legislative purpose was implemented through specific statutes,including section,statutes that must be effectuated.the will of the legislature must be determined from the statutes intentions can not be ascribed to it at odds with the intentions articulated in the statutes.people knowles cal d.t he meaning of a statute is to be sought in the language used by the legislature.in re miller cal d.we see nothing in the undisputed policy of section assembly bill to dissolve redevelopment agencies that changes the language of section,or raises any latent ambiguity therein.see people snook cal th,if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said brown gardner,d,ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.an ambiguity arises only if there is more than one construction in issue which is semantically permissible,more than one usage which makes sense of the statutory language given the context and applicable rules of usage.city of sacramento public employees retirement system th,sacramento.
the department reading of section as excluding the authority to maintain existing redevelopment projects by means of reentering into agreements providing therefor is not plausible,because it nullifies the language permitting a successor agency to enter or reenter contracts.as the trial court reasoned the concept of reentering into an agreement presupposes the existence of a prior agreement,in this case an agreement between the former redevelopment agency and the city.thus,section was intended to allow prior agreements to be re entered,subject to oversight board approval,and possible review by the department.nowhere in its briefing does the department tender an alternate meaning of reenter.instead,its briefing reads that word out of the statute.we reject that course.an interpretation which gives effect is preferred to one which makes void.if possible,significance should be given to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose citation a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.
the department cites a number of specific statutes in its effort to restrict the scope of the authority to reenter into agreements under section,but none raise an ambiguity in the meaning of reenter.for example,one section prevents redevelopment agencies from incurring or expanding monetary obligations,but contains the proviso except as provided in this part.other statutes would preclude incurring debt or new obligations.nor were successor agencies to take any actions that would further deplete the corpus of the agencies funds,subd.a.asset transfers between a redevelopment agency and its organic body after january,were to be restricted to the extent not prohibited by state and federal law,and any such transfer was deemed not to be in furtherance of the community redevelopment law and is thereby unauthorized.most agreements between former redevelopment agencies and their organic bodies were invalidated,subd.a,as emeryville conceded.a definitional section provides for purposes of this part,enforceable obligation does not include any agreements,contracts,or arrangements between the city,county,or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency,subd.d.
as the department explains,these provisions facilitate the dissolution and winddown of the redevelopment agencies.but none of these statutes,individually or collectively,change the fact that in the very same bill,assembly bill,the legislature explicitly authorized successor agencies to enter or reenter into agreements,subject to approval by oversight boards.and emeryville points to a statute that partly defines one kind of enforceable agreement as any legally binding and enforceable agreement or contract that is not otherwise void as violating the debt limit or public policy,subd.d e.emeryville plausibly reads these statutes together to provide a limitation on the types of agreements that may be reentered.this undermines the department argument that if section allows reentry of some redevelopment agreements,all redevelopment agreements could be reentered,undermining the point of assembly bill.emeryville concedes it could not reconstitute its redevelopment agency because that would violate the public policy behind the dissolution statute,in contravention of section,subdivision d e.further,section,subdivision i imposes a fiduciary duty on oversight boards to holders of enforceable obligations and the taxing entities that benefit from distributions of property tax finally,the department,the state controller,and any adversely affected taxing entity can sue the oversight board for a violation of such fiduciary duty.thus,the scenario posited by the department has no basis in the law or reality.
the department also makes the more nuanced claim that section refers to a very narrow class of agreements capable of being reentered,and that the three at issue here fall outside its ambit.the department points out that section,subdivision b explicitly authorizes three types of agreements none like the ones at issue in this case.but that subdivision begins,notwithstanding subdivision a,any of the following agreements are not invalid and may bind the successor agency,and then lists three types of agreements,subd.b.that is not language of limitation,language limiting subdivision a authority to reenter into agreements to those agreements specified in subdivision b,but language of enlargement,permitting additional agreements.as we read the statute,in addition to agreements permitted by subdivision a,subdivision b lists other agreements n otwithstanding subdivision a that may bind the successor agency.this language does not raise any ambiguity about the meaning of the word reenter as used in subdivision a of section.
the department also notes two sections permitting loans from a county treasury necessary to ensure prompt payments of redevelopment agency debts,subd.c,and agreements necessary to operate the successor agency,such as rent,equipment,and supplies,subd.d f,and contends those are the only agreements that could be reentered under section,subdivision a.the department then proceeds to posit that if emeryville view of the breadth of section were correct,there would be no need to describe specific agreements.we disagree.the fact that a county treasurer is vested with authority to loan funds to pay a redevelopment agency enforceable debt does not equate to an enforceable agreement,nor does the provision authorizing agreements to pay administrative expenses of successor agencies address reentered agreements.
finally,although the department asserts the reentered agreements flatly contradict other winddown provisions,no citations follow this assertion,so we have no other specific sections to address to refute the department contention that emeryville reentered agreements violate assembly bill,in letter or spirit 
instead,as the trial court found,by enacting section,subdivision a,the legislature provided a means to continue some redevelopment work,and the bulwark against abuse is vested in the oversight board,subject to review by the department.although the department timely invoked its authority,subd.h,as adopted by assem.bill,thereafter,it did not give emeryville substantive grounds for denying the enforceability of the reentered agreements,nor return the matter for reconsideration ibid,but deemed the amended rops untimely and invalid therefor,a position abandoned on appeal.see fn,ante.
accordingly,we reject the department claim that section is limited either by the general purpose of assembly bill,or any of the specific statutes cited to us 
retrospectivity of assembly bill 
the department contends that a portion of assembly bill retrospectively invalidated the reentered agreements.we disagree.
as quoted earlier,section,subdivision c partly provides that,successor agencies shall lack the authority to transfer any powers or revenues of the successor agency to any other party except pursuant to an enforceable obligation on a rops approved by the department.any such transfers of authority or revenues that are not made pursuant to an enforceable obligation on a rops approved by the department are hereby declared to be void.subdivision a of section precludes new redevelopment work,except as to enforceable obligations that existed before assembly bill took effect.subdivision d partly provides any actions taken by redevelopment agencies to create obligations after june,are ultra vires and do not create enforceable obligations.subdivision e provides the legislature finds and declares that the provisions of this section are declaratory of existing law.see stats,ch.
emeryville acknowledges section,subdivision c grants the department veto authority over any obligation included in a rops.the department contends it does not matter that emeryville reentered the three agreements before assembly bill passed,because the bill permits the department to refuse to recognize as enforceable any agreements between a successor agency and another party.
we reject the department view that assembly bill has such retrospective effect.
as summarized by our supreme court generally,statutes operate prospectively only.citations.t he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our republic.elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly for that reason,the principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.citations.the presumption against statutory retroactivity has consistently been explained by reference to the unfairness of imposing new burdens on persons after the fact.mcclung employment development cal th,mcclung.
the general rule is that a statute may be applied retroactively only if it contains express language of retroactivity or if other sources provide a clear and unavoidable implication that the legislature intended retroactive application.mcclung,supra,cal th at.here,assembly bill does not state that it is to be applied retrospectively.
the department emphasizes that section,subdivision e states the section is declaratory of existing law.further,the department relies on section,subdivision d,which states any actions taken by redevelopment agencies to create obligations after june,are ultra vires and do not create enforceable obligations,and section,subdivision a,which partly provides successor agencies shall lack the authority to,and shall not,create new enforceable obligations under the authority of the community redevelopment law or begin new redevelopment work,except in compliance with an enforceable obligation that existed prior to june.the department claims the only extant obligat
