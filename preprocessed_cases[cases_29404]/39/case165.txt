background 
hall established advanced integrated management services,aimsi,which provided environmental,information technology,engineering and nuclear detection services to the united states government.aimsi was awarded several subcontracts by the prime contractor of the oak ridge national laboratory ornl in tennessee.ornl is funded entirely by the united states department of energy but managed by a private contractor 
pursuant to the terms of its subcontracts,aimsi was reimbursed by the government for a portion of its indirect costs related to performance of the subcontracts in the form of a biweekly advance,calculated using a provisional rate,or estimate,set at the beginning of the fiscal year.these advances are referred to in government contracting as interim reimbursements.aimsi subcontracts required it to perform a reconciliation comparing the interim reimbursements it received with the actual overhead expenses it incurred.ja.if the overhead expenses it incurred were less than the total of interim reimbursements received,aimsi was required to return the overpayment to the department of energy through the prime contractor.
in,and,hall prepared fraudulent purchase orders for work that was never performed.at hall direction,stan stevens the owner of sws,and david reeder,the owner of biosterile technology of tennessee,then submitted fraudulent invoices from their businesses requesting payment from aimsi.after receiving payment for the fictitious work,stevens and reeder remitted a substantial portion of the funds to other companies owned or controlled by hall.
aimsi used deltek,a sophisticated accounting software program,to track its business expenses and revenue.ja.within the deltek system,hall categorized payment for the fraudulent transactions as indirect costs related to aimsi subcontracts with the prime contractor.
at any given time,a certain amount of the funds in aimsi general bank account were derived from the receipt of interim reimbursement funds from the government.at trial,the government expert witness,alice peterson,provided testimony demonstrating that the checks that hall provided to sws and biosterile for fictitious work were honored at least in part with interim reimbursements aimsi had received.peterson demonstrated that of the payments for fictitious work drawn from aimsi bank account in fiscal year were derived from interim reimbursements.in fiscal year,the percentage was,and in,it was.ja.peterson applied these percentages to the payments for fictitious work to determine that hall stole approximately in government funds over the course of several years.
each month,hall accountant provided him with a monthly summary comparing the amount of interim reimbursements aimsi had received to the actual overhead costs it had incurred to date.ja.this summary informed hall whether his overhead costs were on track with the provisional reimbursements.in both and,hall september summary,which he received just a few weeks before the conclusion of the fiscal year,indicated that he had not incurred indirect expenses at the rate predicted by the provisional rate,and thus,that he would be required to return the overpayments to the government.ja.however,late in september both years,hall authorized payment of approximately to sws and biosterile,respectively,for fictitious work.id.the payments to these two booked to overhead accounts within aimsi deltek that aimsi overhead expenses for those years met the government interim payments,allowing aimsi to retain all of the interim reimbursement funds it had received.
at the end of each fiscal year,aimsi was required to certify that all overhead expenses claimed were actually incurred and allowable under the terms of the subcontracts and federal regulations.in its documents for fiscal years,and,aimsi certified that all the expenses it had billed as overhead,including the amounts booked pursuant to the fraudulent invoices,were actually incurred and allowable under the federal regulations.ja.
trial court proceedings 
the indictment charged hall with theft of government property in violation of hall filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the funds at issue were not property of the united states.the district court denied the motion,stating 
t he record reflects that there are indicia of government supervision and control over the funds at issue,such as the requirement that aimsi adopt an acceptable method of accounting and that its accounts are subject to audit by the government.most importantly,aimsi is required to submit a final indirect cost submission at the conclusion of the contract which could result in funds being repaid to the government t he court can not conclude as a matter of law on the present record that the funds at issue were not money of the united states.
at the close of the government proofs at trial and at the close of all the evidence,defendants filed a motion for judgment of acquittal,again asserting that the government had failed to establish that the funds at issue were property of the united states.ja.the district court denied these motions as well.
the jury convicted hall of conspiracy to commit money laundering theft of government property,and money laundering and reeder of aiding and abetting money laundering.on appeal,defendants assert that the district court erred in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the funds in question did not belong to the government.in addition,defendants contend that the government did not present sufficient evidence to establish the necessary elements of theft.finally,defendants request that the court allow them to preserve the right to challenge their sentences under santos united states,cir,should the supreme court uphold the seventh circuit ruling.
ii.motion to dismiss indictment 
standard of review 
the facts in this case are undisputed.accordingly,we review the trial court denial of defendants motion to dismiss de novo.united states klingler,cir.
defendants assert that this court should only review the evidence that was presented to the trial court for consideration of the motion to dismiss.defendants contend,however,that e ven if the trial testimony is considered,the result is the same.as defendants note,the same evidence of government control over the funds was presented to the district court before trial and to the jury that convicted defendants.accordingly,this court does not find it necessary to distinguish between the and trial evidence and motions.
discussion 
to support a conviction of theft of government property in violation of,the government must establish that the defendant knowingly stole or converted to the use of another something of value of the united states.united states forman,cir.the third the funds belonged to the united at issue here.
in united states klingler,this court examined the cases applying and discerned four types where the stolen property clearly belongs to the government and federal jurisdiction is undisputed where the federal government,or one of its agents,acts as a custodian or bailee of property,so that the transitory possession makes it the property of the united states where property that originated with the federal government passes to private hands,but the government retains sufficient control so that the funds remain federal property and where a government employee or agent has received property but fails to convey it to
