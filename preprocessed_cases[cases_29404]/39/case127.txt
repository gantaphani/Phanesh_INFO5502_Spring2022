appellants,five hospitals providers,sued the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,alleging that cms method for calculating reimbursement payments for costs incurred by providers psychiatric units between and violated b a and was inconsistent with the agency own regulations.the district court granted cms motion for summary judgment,holding that the agency interpretation of the governing statutory and regulatory provisions was reasonable.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse and remand.
a brief review of the regulatory scheme governing medicare reimbursements for providers is necessary to understand the parties dispute.hospitals participating in medicare are typically compensated pursuant to the prospective payment system pps,whereby they receive a fixed amount for services rendered to each patient.however,psychiatric units within hospitals,such as providers,were excluded from the pps regime and paid pursuant to a reimbursement program enacted in the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra.
tefra reimbursements were determined through a process.first,a target amount was calculated for each hospital.during a hospital first year under the system,the target amount consisted of the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services for the preceding cost reporting period.b a i.in subsequent years,the target amount from the previous year was updated by the applicable percentage increase specified by the statute.b a ii.after determining the target amount for a particular year,a reimbursement ceiling was calculated by multiplying the target amount for a hospital by the number of discharges from that hospital in the same year.see a.reimbursements could not exceed the ceiling.cms issued regulations implementing tefra scheme of calculating the target amount in a base year and updating it in subsequent years.see c i ii.trispan health services trispan,one of cms fiscal intermediaries,calculated providers reimbursements pursuant to c ii,which set each hospital target amount equal to the previous year target amount increased by a statutory update factor.
in the balanced budget act of bba,congress enacted additional limits on reimbursement payments,including those for the psychiatric units in providers hospitals.see b h.for fiscal years fy through,the target amounts for those hospitals could not exceed the percentile of target amounts for all hospitals in the same class of providers.see id.much like tefra,the bba provided that this capped amount must be multiplied by update factors prescribed as part of the cap scheme for each year of the period.b h i.
cms promulgated regulations implementing the bba cap scheme.see c iii.the cap regulation specified the calculation of a target amount,defined as the net allowable costs in a base period increased by the applicable update factors for the subject period.c iii a.that amount was then to be compared to the percentile of the target amount for hospitals in the same class.c iii b.the final target amount for reimbursement is the lower of the amounts specified in subsections c iii a and b.for the providers in this case,the capped amount was the lesser of the two figures and thus,the bba provisions resulted in significantly lower reimbursements.
in,congress enacted the medicare,medicaid,and schip balanced budget refinement act bbra,further refining the reimbursement rules for providers.congress directed cms,beginning at the end of the cap period in fy,to make payments for inpatient hospital services furnished by psychiatric hospitals or units in accordance with the prospective payment system,stat.however,cms did not implement congress directive until.thus,during the period from the expiration of the bba cap provisions in until,cms had to determine how to calculate target amounts under the existing statutory and regulatory framework.
in,after the bba cap provisions expired,providers submitted their reimbursement requests to trispan on the basis of the target amounts under c iii a.trispan rejected those figures,and based on cms directives,calculated reimbursements pursuant to c ii,using the target amount actually applied to each provider in the previous year,that is,a capped amount.providers dispute this calculation,arguing that by basing their fy target amounts on the fy capped amount,cms has impermissibly extended the impact of the bba cap provisions beyond their expiration date.
providers appealed trispan calculation to the provider reimbursement review board,which granted expedited judicial review because resolution of the claim required a decision on the legality of cms regulations.in the district court,providers argued that their reimbursements in,and should have been calculated using an uncapped target amount based on reasonable cost.cms argued that under b a ii and c ii,the reimbursable target amount in subsequent years must be based on the previous year amount,even if that amount resulted from bba caps.the difference in the reimbursement methods is illustrated as follows 
fiscal year target amount percentile capped amount under the bba final target amount actually providers believe that their target amount should be,which is derived by applying the statutory update factor to the target amount of.in other words,providers argue that the target amount was always equal to the allowable costs from the base year as adjusted to the current year.cms,on the other hand,contends that the proper reimbursement in is,derived by applying the statutory update factor to the previous year final target amount of actually paid to the providers under the percentile cap.thus,according to cms,the capped amount becomes a hospital target amount for purposes of calculating its subsequent year reimbursement.
the district court granted cms motion for summary judgment,concluding that the agency method for calculating target amounts for psychiatric hospitals and units was consistent with the governing statutes and regulations.applying the test articulated in chevron,natural resources defense council,the district court first concluded that the statute was ambiguous.it then concluded that the method cms used to calculate reimbursement payments between and was permissible.the court also rejected providers argument that c iii compelled cms to calculate providers target amount based on the target amount,rather than the actual target amount applied in the previous year,a capped amount.
providers appeal,claiming that the court erred in finding cms method for calculating reimbursements permissible under the governing statutes and finding cms calculations consistent with its own regulations.
we review the district court decision de novo,both because it is a summary judgment,and because it requires us to answer issues of statutory interpretation.ex rel.dickson hood,cir.
in determining whether cms interpretation of the tefra reimbursement provisions at issue is permissible,this court must first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if the statute is clear,then the court must enforce it as written.see id.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,id.at,the court must assess the administrative process to determine whether the agency action is entitled to chevron deference.united states mead,see also bcca appeal group epa,cir.a dministrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.mead,at.if the agency decision resulted from a sufficiently formal process to warrant deference,see id.at,then we assess whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute,chevron,at.a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.id.at see also.office of pub.util.counsel fcc,cir the question is not whether we might have preferred another way to interpret the statute,but whether the agency decision was a reasonable one.
our first step is to determine whether the statute is ambiguous.both providers and cms argue that congress directly spoke to the issue of how to calculate hospital reimbursements during the disputed years.the district court disagreed.although the district court found that congress had specifically defined target amount in b a,and congress had explicitly defined how caps were to be calculated from to,the court concluded that congress had not spoken clearly about how cms was to calculate reimbursements for any gap period between the expiration of the caps and the implementation of the new pps payment regime.accordingly,the district court determined that the statute was silent as to the gap period.
we begin with the text of the statute.the reimbursable target amount is defined as follows 
t he term target amount means,with respect to a hospital for a particular cost reporting period i in the case of the first such reporting period for which this subsection is in effect,the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services for such hospital for the preceding cost reporting period,and ii in the case of a later reporting period,the target amount for the preceding cost reporting period,increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph b for that particular cost reporting period.
b a.the bba cap provision,governing reimbursements from to,specified that cms was to estimate the percentile of the target amounts for such hospitals within such class and update the amount for each cost reporting period by a factor equal to the market basket percentage increase.b h.it further specified that the target amount for such a hospital or unit may not exceed the amount calculated under the percentile formula specified.id.
cms argues that a straightforward reading of these provisions plainly supports its interpretation.subsection b a ii defines target amount for any reporting period after the first period as the target amount for the preceding cost reporting period.since it is undisputed that,and qualify as later reporting periods,the agency argues that subsection b a ii unambiguously directed it to calculate providers reimbursements based on the preceding year target amount.and,because subsection b h requires that from to,the target amount may not exceed the percentile capped amount,cms was required to use the final capped target amount paid in rather than the full amount to calculate the target amount.
providers counter that the relevant statutory provisions unambiguously support their interpretation.providers first argue that cms reading only makes sense if b a ii is read in isolation,and that an inquiry into the meaning of the statutory language must bear in mind the act structure or relationship to other statutes.see amoco prod.vill.of gambell.accordingly,providers contend that b a ii must be read in light of the immediately preceding subsection.subsection b a i defines target amount for the first reporting period as the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services.subsection b a ii defines the target amount for subsequent periods as the target amount for the preceding cost reporting period,which,according to providers,ties the definition for later reporting periods in subsection b a ii to the initial target amount defined in subsection b a i.in other words,a hospital target amount equals its allowable costs from the base year trended forward to the current year.
to bolster that contention,providers point out that b j refers to the amount calculated under b h as the limiting or cap amount,while the target amount is the amount determined under b a.although b h states that the target amount may not exceed the percentile,according to providers,congress choice of language in b j makes clear that it intended to distinguish between a cap amount under b h and the target amount under b a.thus,providers argue,the use of the words target amount in subsection b a ii could not have referred to a capped amount even if that capped amount was the amount actually paid in the preceding year.
finally,and perhaps most persuasively,providers make two arguments based on legislative intent.first,they argue that congress intent in passing tefra was that reimbursements always be based on cost.in b a i,congress directed that the target amount be based on a number,and then updated each year from that original number.and,although congress did not intend hospitals above the percentile of costs to be reimbursed based on their actual costs during the bba cap period,congress intended that the bba cap exception to the usual scheme of reimbursing based on cost was to be.additionally,providers argue that cms interpretation thwarts congress clear intent that the bba caps end in.cms interpretation has the contrary effect of perpetuating the caps beyond the cap period by using the cap reimbursement amount as the basis for reimbursement calculations in subsequent years.in fact,under cms interpretation,congress could have achieved the same result by enacting bba caps for only a single year.but it did not do so.rather,it imposed caps for a limited time period of five years.
although both sides make persuasive points,we need not determine which is the better argument.rather,we are tasked with determining whether congress has spoken clearly.based on the plausible,competing arguments put forth by the parties,we are compelled to find the statute ambiguous.see,united states valle,cir a statute is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation or more than one accepted meaning.quotations omitted.
congress did not specify how cms was to calculate reimbursements after the expiration of the caps because congress had directed cms to implement a pps regime.however,because the pps regime was not in place by,cms was left to calculate reimbursements in the gap.as cms points out,b a ii defines target amount for later reporting periods as the target amount for the preceding twelve months.and although providers attempt to persuade us that the b a ii definition must be read in light of b a i,it is not,on the face of the statute,completely obvious that the allowable operating cost language in b a i should be read into b a ii.on the other hand,although cms textual argument is strong,the structure of the provision indicates that reimbursements in a later reporting period should bear significant relation to the initial amount.moreover,providers present a strong argument that cms reading of the statute is contrary to congress intent that the bba caps exist only from to.but,on the other hand,congress enacted the bbra reforms to shift providers to the pps system at the end of the bba cap period.thus,congress intent changed as to the type of reimbursements providers were entitled a model of reimbursements to congress expected would be in place at the end of the cap period.
because neither side is able to demonstrate that congress unambiguously spoke to the precise issue of how to calculate the target amount in,and,we find that under the first step of chevron analysis,the statute is ambiguous.see also.state hosp.leavitt,wl,at,finding the statute somewhat unclear as to the factors to be taken into account in calculating the target amounts after chalmette med,dep t of health human,wl,at,finding the statute unambiguously directed cms to calculate the target amount based on the capped amount because when the target amount exceeded the cap,the target amount became the cap amount,but assuming arguendo that the statute was silent and proceeding to the second step of the chevron analysis.
the parties agree that cms regulations are entitled to chevron deference if the statute is ambiguous.indeed,courts have long recognized congress delegation of extremely broad regulatory authority to the agency in the medicare and medicaid area.dep t of health family servs.blumer.congress has delegated general rulemaking authority with respect to medicare to the secretary,who in turn has delegated that authority to cms.see,a the secretary shall prescribe such regul
