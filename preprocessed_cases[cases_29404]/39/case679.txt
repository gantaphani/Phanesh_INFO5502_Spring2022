protective agency,appeals from a judgment of the united states court of federal claims dismissing,as untimely,the contract action that brought against the government and holding,in the alternative,that the government was entitled to summary judgment based on a previously executed release.see protective agency united states,slip op.at the same time,the trial court rejected assertion that it had executed this release under duress,meaning according to that neither the release nor the applicable limitations period barred its contract claim.

by letter to dated april,the co reiterated her concern about whether price for the contract was known,given its claim for additional compensation under the contract.the co maintained that the intent of the parties at the time of contract formation was that would provide breakers within the contract price for the first months of performance,and that the principle that breakers are not separately compensable was firmly established by contract performance.consequently,the co indicated that she would have to consider the government future potential liability when deciding whether to exercise future options on the contract.
on may,submitted a certified claim to the co seeking recovery of for breaker hours from the date of the contract inception to april.in september,the co denied this claim in its entirety,finding that the contract was a contract and that all the costs of contract performance were therefore included in original bid price.the relevant contract terms stated this is a fixed price and time and materials contract the initial day period of the contract will be a fixed price arrangement.after the initial day period,the contract will become time and materials.nevertheless asserted that the contract was a time and materials contract.the co further explained that i n actual performance and in accord with section b of the contract,the contract is firm,with a composite billing rate that utilizes time and materials terms to ensure performance and payment.the co also found that cost proposal contain ed several elements which provide for compensation for providing supervisor and guard breaks.did not appeal the co decision.
