the secretary of the navy the navy appeals the decision of the armed services board of contract appeals board in favor of all state construction all state or the contractor.all state,asbca,cch,at.this case presents the question of whether the navy was entitled to withhold progress payments from all state.the navy offers two justifications for the withholding that the government is entitled to withhold progress payments when a default termination is imminent and that the government is entitled to withhold progress payments pursuant to its right of and also pursuant to section.of the contract.we disagree with the navy first theory,but agree with the second.accordingly,we reverse the board decision and remand.
background 
on september,the navy awarded all state a contract valued at for the construction of a hazardous waste storage facility.the contract required completion by may.the navy unilaterally extended the period for completion to september,the extension was based,in part,on the unavailability of the site during a portion of that period.the project was not completed by the extended completion date.
in response to revised construction schedules submitted by all state,the navy sent letters dated october,and august,informing all state that the navy was forbearing termination of the contract for default while reserving the right to later terminate the contract for default and to assess liquidated damages.the august letter provided a revised completion date of november.however,in a show cause notice dated october,the navy indicated that a t present it is apparent that the work will not be completed by november.at.the notice further stated that s ince you have failed to make progress toward completing the work by november,the government is considering terminating the contract under the provisions for default of this contract.id.
on october,all state submitted an invoice requesting payment of,representing compensation for percent completion of the project less reimbursement previously received.there is no claim on this appeal that the progress payment had not been earned.the board specifically found that the amount of the claimed progress payment was an undisputed earned amount for completed work.all state,cch at.however,the claimed progress payment amount was less than the government pending claim for in liquidated damages.id.on october,the contracting officer informed all state that he was recommending termination of the contract for default.on october,the navy contracting officer refused payment of the october,invoice because t he amount to be retained for liquidated damages exceeds the amount of the invoice.id.the contract was terminated for default on november.
on march,all state appealed the navy default termination of the contract to the board.the complaint included four counts,all requesting that the termination be treated as a termination for the convenience of the government.the first count alleged that the delay in contract performance which was the basis of the default termination was,in fact,the fault of the navy due to constructive and actual contract changes and differing site conditions.the second count alleged breach of contract on the part of the navy based on the contract plans and specifications issued by the navy.the third count alleged that the navy waived the contract completion date.the final count alleged that the navy failure to make progress payments constituted a breach of contract.
all state moved for summary judgment on all four counts.the board granted summary judgment in favor of all state on the fourth count,finding that the navy breached the contract by retaining percent of the amount that all state had earned.the board held that federal acquisition regulation far d as incorporated in the contract limited the permissible retention of progress payments to percent of the amount earned the board concluded that the contract was terminated for the convenience of the navy and that all state obligation to perform was discharged.the board stated i n view of this result,we need not address the issues in the other counts.all state,cch at.the navy timely appealed.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to b and g b.the standard of review applied to board decisions is prescribed by statute 
t he decision of the agency board on any question of law shall not be final or conclusive,but the decision on any question of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside unless the decision is fraudulent,or arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
b.the sole issue on appeal is whether the navy failure to make the progress payment operated as a breach of contract because the amount withheld was more than ten percent of the earned amount.
the navy first argues that it permissibly withheld the progress payment because it was considering terminating the contract for default,and default termination was imminent.thus,the navy position is that,when the government is about to declare a default termination,it is discharged from its contractual obligation to make progress payments because of the possibility that the contractor owes breach damages to the government.we conclude that,in the absence of a contract clause permitting such action,the navy had no such authority.
the navy does not cite any provision of the contract or regulation as authorizing it to withhold the progress payment in anticipation of a default determination.instead,the navy argues that t he purpose of progress payments is to provide the contractor with the funds that he needs to continue performance,a purpose that was vitiated by the impending default.appellant br.at.the far,as incorporated into the contract,expressly defines the government contract termination rights for default.there is no regulation,however,permitting the government to withhold progress payments when the government is considering declaring a default termination.the government has no right to withhold progress payments simply because it is considering a termination for default,except to the extent of the government contractual ten percent retainage rights.
this approach is confirmed by pigeon united states.there,the contracting officer withheld progress payments upon the ground that the work was not progressing as it should,and that he would retain not only the ten per cent but the compensation for the work as an indemnity to the defendants for the faithful performance of the agreement.id.at.the court held that the contracting officer action to secure indemnity for the government against the chances of probable failure upon the part of the contractor was improper and breached the contract.id.at it was not in the government power to withhold the pay in order that it might be secured against the consequences of a probable or possible failure see also brooklyn queens screen united states.
the government alternatively argues that it was entitled to withhold progress payments by virtue of its common law right of,which it urges is specifically recognized in the language of this contract.the seminal case recognizing the government rights is the supreme court decision in united states munsey trust.in munsey,the government had retained percentages of the progress payments due to the contractor on six contracts.id.at.the contractor defaulted on a subsequent contract,resulting in damages to the government,which the government set off against the retained progress payments.id.the court held that t he government has the same right of which belongs to every creditor,to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor,in his hands,in extinguishment of the debts due to him.id.at.
