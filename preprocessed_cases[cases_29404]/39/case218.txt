atlantic research corporation atlantic seeks partial reimbursement from the united states for costs incurred in an environmental cleanup.atlantic claim is based on the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara,stat.the issue for consideration is whether cercla forbids a party such as atlantic,which has voluntarily cleaned up a site for which it was only partly responsible,to recover part of its cleanup costs from another liable party for the reasons that follow,we hold that cercla permits such a cause of action.
background 
atlantic retrofitted rocket motors for the united states from through.it performed this service at its camden,arkansas,facility.the work included using water spray to remove rocket propellant.once removed,the propellant was burned.residue from burnt rocket fuel contaminated the arkansas site soil and groundwater.
atlantic voluntarily investigated and cleaned up the contamination,incurring costs in the process.it sought to recover a portion of these costs from the united states by invoking cercla a and f atlantic and the government began to negotiate in an effort to resolve these financial matters.
the negotiations ended with the united states supreme court decision in cooper industries,aviall services,d aviall.in aviall,the court found a party could only attempt to obtain f contribution during or following a or a cercla civil action.id.at.at.as no action had been commenced against atlantic under either or a,the aviall decision barred its f contribution claim.
with its f claim,atlantic amended its complaint.the amended complaint relied solely on a and federal common law.in lieu of answer,the government moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing this court decision in dico.amoco oil,cir dico foreclosed atlantic claim.the district court agreed.atlantic appeals.
as will be discussed in more detail below,dico held that a liable party could not bring an action under.dico,at.we recognize the generally preclusive effect of a previous panel ruling.united states blahowski,cir.but this rule is not inflexible.where the prior decision can be distinguished,or its rationale has been undermined,a subsequent decision can depart from the prior path we are convinced dico is such a case it is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar,and its analytic is undermined by aviall.
ii.analysis 
as this case turns on the interpretation of cercla,a federal statute,our review is de novo.iowa group,internal revenue service,cir.we undertake this review,recognizing our obligation to effectuate the intent of congress when interpreting federal statutes.id.to resolve the question before us,we must briefly review the intertwined history of cercla and,and then analyze this history in light of aviall.
cercla cost recovery and 
cercla is congress monumental attempt to encourage the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites,and place the cost of that response on those responsible for creating or maintaining the hazardous condition.control data,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.to achieve these ends,cercla effectively transformed centuries of real property and tort liability law by making those who contaminate a site strictly liable for the costs of subsequent cleanup by others.see alexandra klass,from reservoirs to remediation the impact of cercla on common law strict liability environmental claims,wake forest.ronald aronovsky,federalism cercla rethinking the role of federal law in private cleanup cost disputes,ecology.
when the federal or a state government conducts the cleanup,cercla permits the sovereign to recover its costs from whomever is liable for the contamination.a a.cercla also provides three methods by which private parties may recover cleanup costs.the first is found at a b,a part of the original statute in.congress added the others,f and f b,as part of sara 
sections a and f are central to our analysis.the eighth,and many of its sister circuits,have previously held that liable parties seeking reimbursement must use f,and may not use for that purpose.today,we consider whether this ruling remains viable in the world.
cercla a provides that covered persons,which we will call liable parties,are liable for,among other things 
a all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the united states government or a state or an indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan 
b any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.
a a,b.courts have found in cercla reference to any other necessary costs of response and any other person,authority to allow private suits under a b.see walls waste resource,cir collecting cases.
section contains a subsection entitled contribution,the first part of which states 
any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under a,during or following any civil action under or a.such claims shall be brought in accordance with this section and the federal rules of civil procedure,and shall be governed by federal law.in resolving contribution claims,the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under or.
there is some similarity in the remedial responsibilities borne by liable parties under a and f.the supreme court has termed these sections remedies similar and somewhat overlapping,yet clearly distinct.compare key tronic united states,d with aviall,at.at.each requires proof of the same elements.redwing carriers,saraland apartments,cir.they differ,however,in procedure and scope.
section a remedies 
section a has a statute of limitations,and allows a plaintiff to recover of its response costs from all liable parties,including those which have settled their cercla liability with the government.g,a.prior to sara enactment,some courts implied a right to contribution from,see mardan music,cir collecting cases,or as a matter of federal common law.united states new castle county.the right initially was thought to be uncertain in light of the supreme court traditional reluctance to imply rights of action in the context of other statutes.see,texas,radcliff materials,d declining to imply an antitrust right of action for contribution.
section remedies 
congress resolved the uncertainty when enacting sara in by adding to clarif y and confirm a right to cercla contribution.united technologies,cir,citing,sess.section explicit right to contribution is more restricted than that afforded by.section right is subject to a statute of limitations plaintiffs can recover only costs in excess of their equitable share,and may not recover from parties.f,f,g.
the section a section 
congress addition of posed a dilemma.courts saw that cercla,as amended,created a situation where litigants might quickly abandon section in favor of the substantially more generous provisions of section,thus rendering a nullity.new castle county halliburton nus,cir.
to prevent from swallowing,courts began directing traffic between the sections.see united,at bedford affiliates sills,cir.as a result,regardless of which cercla section a plaintiff invoked,courts typically analyzed and together,aiming to distinguish one from the other.see bedford affiliates,at centerior serv.acme scrap iron metal,cir pneumo abex high point,thomasville denton,cir pinal creek group newmont mining,cir new castle county,at redwing carriers,cir united states colorado eastern,cir united,at akzo coatings,aigner,cir amoco oil borden,cir.
dramatically narrowed by judicial fiat.on its face,a b is available to any person other than the sovereigns listed in a a.see control data,at.in practice,however,courts gradually steered liable parties away from and required them to use was reserved for innocent plaintiffs who could assert one of the statutory defenses to liability.see bedford affiliates,at pinal creek,at new castle county,at redwing carriers,at centerior service,at united,at akzo coatings,at.this cramped reading of prevented liable parties from using it to evade constraints,thus preserving the vitality of.see new castle county,at eastern,at united,at.
in the analysis,was presumed to be available to all liable parties,including those which had not faced a cercla action.see akzo coatings,at liable party claim for costs voluntarily incurred held barred by settlement pinal creek,at liable party claim for costs voluntarily incurred governed by both and.accordingly,most courts concluded liable parties could not use.see pneumo abex,at collecting cases but see pinal creek,at holding liable parties could not seek direct recovery under,but that implicitly incorporates a claim for contribution which remains available to liable parties through combined operation of both sections united,at suggesting,in dicta,that a liable party may bring contribution action under.
our opinion in dico was the last in this line.the environmental protection agency epa had forced dico,and another party to clean up an iowa site which both had contaminated.dico sued the other party,seeking direct recovery of of its costs under and for contribution under.the other party settled with the epa and moved for summary judgment in dico lawsuit.the district court granted the motion.it found dico claims were barred by the settlement and,as a liable party,dico had no right to recover its full cleanup cost under.
dico appealed the dismissal of its claim,arguing the supreme court opinion in key tronic allowed liable parties a claim in direct recovery.we disagreed,noting key tronic dealt with a implied right to contribution.dico,at.when we affirmed the dismissal,we joined other circuits in narrowly construing,and holding a liable party may only assert a contribution claim under.id.at,citing among others bedford affiliates,at centerior service,at pinal creek,at redwing carriers,at colorado eastern,at united,at akzo coatings,at and amoco oil,at.we now see that aviall undermines dico,and the analytic upon which it relies.
b.the effect of aviall 
aviall facts are similar to those at hand.aviall services,purchased contaminated aircraft maintenance sites from cooper industries.the texas natural resource conservation commission directed aviall efforts at environmental cleanup,but neither the commission,the epa,nor any private party brought a cercla action against aviall.
after the cleanup,aviall sued cooper for both cost recovery under and contribution under.it later amended its complaint,seeking recovery only under,on circuit its rights would be preserved in the claim.the district court granted cooper motion for summary judgment,holding aviall had no right to relief absent a prior or cercla enforcement action,and that aviall amended complaint abandoned any potential claim.a fifth circuit panel affirmance was reversed,en banc.
on certiorari,the supreme court reversed again.justice thomas,writing for a majority,construed during or following language.he said,t he natural meaning of this sentence is that contribution may only be sought subject to the specified conditions,namely,during or following a specified civil action.aviall,at.at.the court found the words during or following established a condition precedent to a f claim.as such,a court which allowed a contribution claim,absent the prior or action,would render s precondition a nullity.
having made this determination,the court turned to its previous key tronic reference to cercla similar and somewhat overlapping remedies.the court explained that and remedies were only similar in that both allow private parties to recoup costs from other private parties.id.at.at.the court carefully noted,however,that the two remedies are clearly distinct.id.
dissenting justices ginsburg and stevens analyzed key tronic differently.they said the key tronic court had not questioned whether afforded liable parties a cause of action against other liable parties.it simply disagreed whether the right was implied or explicit.id.at.at.justices ginsburg and stevens did not agree that aviall amended complaint abandoned a claim,which they would have allowed to proceed.id.at.the majority explicitly avoided this question,see id.at.at,reserving it for another day.
c.the matter at hand 
that day has arrived.we now ask can one liable party recover costs advanced,beyond its equitable share,from another liable party in direct recovery,or by contribution,or as a matter of federal common law 
the second circuit is the only court which has considered this question since aviall that court revisited its precedent,much as we have done here,and concluded that allowed one liable party to recover voluntarily incurred response costs from another.consolidated edison ugi utilities,cir.in reaching this conclusion,the court distinguished its holding in bedford affiliates,rejected a liable party direct recovery claim under.id.at.
in light of aviall holding that and remedies are distinct,the second circuit held it no longer makes sense to view section f as the exclusive route by which liable parties may recover cleanup costs.see consolidated edison,at.the court looked to section a b any other person language,and found no basis for reading into this language a distinction between innocent parties and parties which,if sued,would be held liable under section a.id.at.so saying,the second circuit reopened cost recovery to liable parties.
our court now stands at the same crossroad.we agree with our sister circuit,and hold that it no longer makes sense to view as a liable party exclusive remedy.this distinction may have made sense for parties such as dico,which was allowed to seek contribution under.but here,atlantic is foreclosed from using.this path is barred because suit before,rather than during or following,a cercla enforcement action.atlantic has opted to rely upon to try to recover its cleanup costs exceeding its own equitable share.we conclude it may do so.
the supreme court emphasized that and are distinct.accordingly,it is no longer appropriate to view remedies exclusively through a prism,as we did in dico,and as the government requests.we reject an approach which categorically deprives a liable party of a remedy.like the second circuit,we return to the text of cercla,and find no such limitation in congress words.
we have held that any other person means any person other than the statutorily enumerated united states government or a state or an indian tribe.control data corporation,at.atlantic is such a person,see cercla g no one disputes its having incurred necessary costs of response.on its face applies.
as the second circuit stated,e ach of those sections,a and f,embodies a mechanism for cost recovery available to persons in different procedural circumstances.consolidated edison,at.thus,a liable party may,under appropriate procedural circumstances,bring a cost recovery action under.this right is available to parties who have incurred necessary costs of response,but have neither been sued nor settled their liability under or.
we recognize that allows cost recovery.some cases justified denying liable parties access to,reasoning congress would not have intended them to recover of their costs and effectively escape liability.see,united,at it is sensible to assume that congress intended only innocent parties who were themselves be permitted to recoup the whole of their expenditures.we agree,and reaffirm dico holding that a liable party may not use to recover its full response cost.
but is not limited to parties seeking to recover of their costs.to the contrary,the text of a b permits recovery of any other necessary costs of response consistent with the national contingency plan.while these words may suggest full recovery,united,at,they do not compel it cercla,itself,checks overreaching liable parties if a plaintiff attempted to use to recover more than its fair share of reimbursement,a defendant would be free to counterclaim for contribution under f.consolidated edison,at,redwing carriers,at.accordingly,we find that allowing atlantic claim for direct recovery under is entirely consistent with the text and purpose of cercla.
