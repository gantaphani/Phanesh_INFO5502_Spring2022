nvt technologies,nvt,appeals from a final decision of the united states court of federal claims,denying nvt motion for summary judgment and granting the government for summary judgment on the administrative record,in nvt protest over the final cost comparison determination of a bid evaluation process.nvt,united states.the court of federal claims concluded that the solicitation at issue in this case was not ambiguous,that the government interpretation of the solicitation was correct,and that the agency bid evaluation determination would stand.the trial court further opined that,in the alternative,if the solicitation was ambiguous,the ambiguity was patent and nvt could not prevail for that reason.because we hold that the solicitation was ambiguous and the ambiguity was patent,we affirm the judgment of the court of federal claims.
background 
on november,the united states department of the navy navy or agency issued solicitation number r to obtain bids for facility maintenance and utility services,including facilities maintenance and repair,utilities operations and maintenance,facilities planning,engineering,and environmental support services,for the marine corps recruit depot in san diego,california.the depot is used by a population of up to people,including permanent personnel and between and marine recruits.the appearance of the facility is key,and subject to a policy that the unique be maintained in a professional manner as a projection of marine corps pride that is world renowned.
the solicitation was issued as part of a government cost comparison effort to determine whether it was more efficient to accomplish the specified maintenance and services for the depot under an outside contract or by government performance of the tasks.office of management and budget omb circular no.a sets forth an elaborate mandatory process for comparing the costs of and private production.in performing the cost comparison under omb a,the agency is to compare the bid of the private sector source with the cost of providing the good or service with government facilities and personnel,or the agency most efficient organization or meo.see am.fed of gov t employees united states.the meo is not necessarily an existing organization,but the organization the agency would establish if it were competing for the work.id.at.if government performance is determined to be more economical,no award is made under the request,and the solicitation may be canceled.
the bid process was to consist of three steps.first,interested bidders from the private sector would submit statements of qualifications.these submissions would be evaluated and the agency would inform each offeror,based on that evaluation,whether it was considered to be a viable competitor.bidders,however,would be able to continue to the second step of the bid process regardless of the evaluation results.next,each offeror would submit technical and price proposals.these proposals would be reviewed,and a competitive and acceptable offer would be selected as the offer to compete against the agency proposal.finally,the selected offer would be compared to the proposal to ensure that both offers offered the same level of performance and the proposed costs would be compared.the initial award would then be given to the lowest cost bidder.
in response to the solicitation,the navy received statements of qualifications from three offerors,including nvt.after evaluation,only nvt was determined to be a viable competitor,and nvt alone elected to continue in the remainder of the competition.prior to the closing date for receipt of nvt technical and price proposals,the naval audit service certified that the agency management plan satisfied the performance work statement requirements and that the cost estimate was reasonable.the agency bid was then sealed.
after nvt technical and price proposals were submitted,the agency conducted two rounds of discussions with the company.the agency determined that nvt final revised proposal was acceptable,and a price evaluation board further found nvt proposed price to be realistic,complete,and reasonable.the agency thus selected nvt proposal as the offer to compete against the government plan.a navy quality comparison team then evaluated the agency plan to ensure that the technical proposals of nvt and the government offered the same level of performance and performance quality.the team found that the plan was balanced in performance and quality to that proposed by nvt.the navy then proceeded to a cost comparison and concluded that performance of the specified work would cost less than performance by nvt.specifically,nvt adjusted cost at was found to be higher than the agency proposed cost of.the initial award went to the meo on july.
on august,nvt appealed the cost comparison decision to the administrative appeal authority aaa,alleging inter alia that the estimate for materials was too low,but identifying no particular provision it believed was misinterpreted.on august,the agency revised its estimate in response to other allegations in nvt appeal,increasing its cost proposal.however,the agency revised estimate was still less than nvt proposal.on september,the aaa issued a final determination,accepting the agency amended estimate and denying the remainder of nvt allegations,including the low materials estimate.on october,nvt protested the aaa final decision to the general accounting office gao.in addition to raising several issues it had raised before the aaa,nvt also argued that the government estimate was too low with respect to roof leak repairs,raw labor estimates,and performance of ceramic tile repair.on january,the gao issued a decision denying nvt protest.
on january,nvt filed a complaint in the court of federal claims,alleging that the government had unlawfully concluded that it should continue base operations and maintenance services.in particular,nvt contended that the government interpretation of the volume of ceramic tile repair specified by the solicitation was wrong,and that if the proper interpretation had been used in the estimate,nvt bid would have been lower,entitling nvt to the award.the government responded that nvt reading of the solicitation is not supported,that the government interpretation is reasonable,and that the award to the meo should be affirmed.on june,the court of federal claims heard oral argument on these issues.at argument,the trial court questioned whether nvt had made a mistake of bid and whether the aaa had an obligation to ferret out that mistake and allow nvt to correct it.the trial court then ordered supplemental briefing on the bid mistake issue and on the government obligation to inform nvt of nvt misreading of the required specifications.
at the heart of the proceedings before the trial court,and on appeal to this court,is solicitation attachment j c a,a table containing hundreds of estimates.the table includes a paragraph number reference to the text of the solicitation a title,identifying the item and three columns,headed number,unit of measure,and frequency,reflecting the scope of work for that.an exemplary entry related to preventative maintenance pm for the motor vehicle wash facility is reflected in the following line item 
this line item requires the contractor to assign sufficient staff at the appropriate skill level and pay grade to perform preventative maintenance on each of spray nozzles once a month.the contractor also was required to include costs of materials to perform the stated tasks.because the bids were to be based on a cost proposal,the frequency column provided an indication of how often,in a year,each of the listed tasks were to be performed.for example,based on the above line item,the offeror price would be determined by multiplying the cost of spray nozzle maintenance times nozzles,times the twelve monthly occurrences required.it is undisputed that this is the proper interpretation for all but thirteen line items in attachment j c a.
the specific table entries in dispute in this case are the first twelve of the thirteen line items in attachment j c a,headed misc ceramic tile repair.all thirteen line items in this category are reproduced below 
the last of the thirteen items listed in this category is like the example noted above,and its interpretation is not in question.
in calculating its estimate for the twelve disputed line items,nvt multiplied the number column by the frequency column and prepared its technical and price proposals based on a total of square feet of tile and of labor.meo bid instead took the figures in the number column to represent the total square feet of tile for each line item.the meo did not use the frequency column as a multiplier,and its cost estimate was thus based on square feet of tile and of labor.
before the court of federal claims,both parties argued that the solicitation plainly supported their respective interpretations.the trial court concluded that the solicitation was not amenable to two reasonable interpretations,that only the government reading was reasonable,and that the solicitation was therefore unambiguous.the trial court went on to conclude that,even if nvt reading of the provisions at issue was also reasonable making the solicitation ambiguous any ambiguity was patent,and nvt could not prevail.on the issue of mistake in bid,the trial court analysis focused on whether a different rule for mistake in bid should apply in a cases if the agency had notice of the error.the trial court rejected nvt contention that the solicitation was defective,which would require a rebid of the solicitation,concluding that nvt should have instead sought clarification about the solicitation.for these reasons,the court of federal claims granted the government motion for summary judgment on the administrative record and denied nvt motion for summary judgment.
nvt timely appealed to this court,asserting that the court of federal claims erred in concluding that the government interpretation was reasonable that nvt interpretation was not reasonable that the solicitation was not ambiguous and that the ambiguity,if any,was patent.nvt also appeals the mistake in bid issue.jurisdiction over this a bid protest case was proper before the court of federal claims.see am.fed of gov t employees,at.we have jurisdiction over final decisions of the court of federal claims under a.

bid protest actions are subject to the standard of review established under section of title of the administrative procedure act apa,b,by which an agency decision is to be set aside only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a.see impresa construzioni geom.domenico garufi united states,advanced data concepts,united states.

was the solicitation ambiguous 
the threshold question in this appeal is whether the solicitation plainly supports only one reading or supports more than one reading and is ambiguous.to show an ambiguity it is not enough that the parties differ in their respective interpretations of a contract term.rather,both interpretations must fall within a zone of reasonableness.metric constructors,nasa,citations omitted.before this court,each party argues that there is no ambiguity because its respective interpretation of the solicitation is plainly supported,and thus reasonable,while the other party interpretation is unreasonable.
contract interpretation begins with the language of the written agreement.foley united states.when interpreting the contract,the document must be considered as a whole and interpreted so as to harmonize and give reasonable meaning to all of its parts.mcabee,united states.an interpretation that gives meaning to all parts of the contract is to be preferred over one that leaves a portion of the contract useless,inexplicable,void,or superfluous.gould,united states.
in preparing its estimate,nvt multiplied the figures in the number column by the corresponding figures in the frequency column for all of the hundreds of items in the solicitation attachment j c a,including each of the twelve disputed line items in the misc ceramic tile repair portion.for example,nvt interpreted the first disputed line item,form,place finish concrete,to call for square feet of concrete,or square feet of concrete poured and finished twelve times per year x.
nvt argues that its interpretation was reasonable.nvt notes that the words monthly,quarterly,or weekly appeared in the frequency column for most of the hundreds of line items in attachment j c a and that to prepare the estimate for each of these line items,the value in the number column needed to be multiplied by the number,or,respectively,representing the number of times in a calendar year that the work was to be performed.nvt used the same approach for the twelve line items in question,using the number in the frequency column as a multiplier as it had for the numerical equivalent of the words in the frequency column for all of the other line items.nvt argues that its interpretation,applying the same logic to the line items in question as to the other line items in the schedule,is a harmonious reading of all of the provisions of the contract.nvt further notes that nothing in the specification suggests that a different methodology be used for the line items in dispute.
finally,nvt argues that its price estimate is reasonable.although nvt calculated a total of square feet of tile to be replaced,nvt contends,over the government objections,that while that figure was large,the total floor space of the depot is over million square feet.thus,nvt figure is only of the total floor space.moreover,nvt notes that the solicitation emphasized the importance of the appearance of the depot and the heavy volume of traffic.for these reasons,although nvt bid of over million for the miscellaneous ceramic tile work alone is a significant portion of the million total bid,nvt contends that there is nothing to indicate or suggest that this was not what was called for in the solicitation.
the government argues that nvt interpretation is incorrect and unreasonable because it is inconsistent with other portions of the solicitation.in particular,the government notes that nvt construction results in a disproportionate amount of tile,given that the corpus of the solicitation only refers incidentally to ceramic tile.further,the government asserts that nvt interpretation is contrary to the terms maintenance and preventative maintenance,as defined in the solicitation.maintenance is defined as t he recurrent,periodic or scheduled work required to preserve or restore a facility to such condition that it may be effectively utilized for its designed purpose.preventative maintenance means s ervicing accomplished on a scheduled or recurring basis to lengthen the equipment life.the effort involves visual inspection,operational tests,lubrication,adjustments and the repair or replacement of minor defective component parts.given these definitions,the government argues that nvt interpretation,resulting in the installation of football fields worth of replacement tile per year,is unreasonable,while the government estimate,resulting in much less replacement tile,is reasonable.the government further contends that nvt interpretation is unreasonable given the information available to each bidder in the solicitation in the form of explanatory facility history files,technical library materials,and a software database file.the government argues that this information would have informed nvt bid and that nvt failed to take advantage of these resources.for these reasons,the government asserts that nvt interpretation is inconsistent with the corpus of the solicitation and therefore is unreasonable.
the government interprets the line items in question as not requiring multiplication of the number and frequency columns as was done by nvt.rather the government interpretation considers only the number column and does not use the numbers in the frequency column as multipliers.the government contends that this was reasonable because it was apparent that these line items should be treated differently,based on the presence of numbers rather than words in those line items,as well as the fact that the numbers bear no relationship to the regular and periodic repetitions signaled by the words.the government asserts that its reading is consistent with the rest of the solicitation,because the ceramic tile repair is denoted as miscellaneous and because if the disputed line items were intended to represent such a large portion of the contract,more information would have been given about these tasks in the specification.
nvt contends that the government interpretation,where the figures in the frequency column for the disputed line items are simply ignored,violates the contract interpretation canon that a reading that renders terms superfluous is disfavored.nvt argues that for the government interpretation to be consistent with the remainder of the document,the frequency column should have read annually or been left blank,which is not the case.nvt also argues that the government interpretation renders meaningless the thirteenth line item cyclic maint to repair ceramic tile in messhalls.
we conclude that both nvt and the government interpretations are within the zone of reasonableness.metric constructors,at.nvt interpretation is reasonable,because it applies the same logic to the thirteen disputed line items as applied to the hundreds of other line items present in the schedule.the schedule nowhere indicated that the data in the number and frequency columns were to be treated differently for the thirteen items in question or that the frequency numbers for those items should be ignored.moreover,although nvt interpretation resulted in an extensive amount of tile replacement,the amount was not wholly unreasonable a given that the amount only represents a small percentage of the total floor space of the facility b given the extensive use of the facility and c given the mandate in the solicitation that the appearance of the depot is of great importance.further,despite the emphasis that the government places on the fact that nvt failed to avail itself of the external resources provided by the navy,the government points to no particular portion of the external resources that would be inconsistent with nvt interpretation.
we also find the government interpretation to be reasonable.the government interpretation is consistent with the notion of incidental repair and maintenance,as noted in the corpus of the solicitation.moreover,the portion of the price attributable to tile repair and maintenance in the government estimate is proportional to what would be expected for a small set of line items that received no special treatment in the solicitation.there was no evidence in the record illuminating the government understanding of the significance of the numbers in the frequency column for the disputed line items,and in fact,at oral argument,government counsel admitted that he was unaware of the significance of those numbers however,the point is not what the numbers in that column meant,but rather whether it was unreasonable for the government to treat them differently from the words used in the frequency column for all of the other line items.recognizing that on their face,the numbers in the frequency column are different from the words used elsewhere in the attachment,and further recognizing that those numbers do not have any apparent correlation to the regular and periodic repetitions signaled by the words used for the other line items,we do not think it was unreasonable for the government not to use them as multipliers,especially because the use of the numbers as multipliers results in such seemingly disproportionate totals and the of the numbers as multipliers yields totals that are entirely consistent with the corpus of the solicitation and the attention given in the solicitation to the line items in dispute.
because both interpretations fall within a zone of reasonableness,metric constructors,at,we conclude that the solicitation,with respect to these disputed line items,was ambiguous.
was the ambiguity patent 
because we hold that the solicitation was ambiguous,we turn now to the question of whether the ambiguity was patent.an ambiguity will only be construed against the government if it was not obvious on the face of the solicitation and reliance is shown.see,edward marden united states.if the ambiguity is patent,it triggers a duty to inquire.a patent ambiguity is one that is obvious,gross,or glaring,so that plaintiff contractor had a duty to inquire about it at the start.h m moving,united states.if an ambiguity is obvious and a bidder fails to inquire with regard to the provision,his interpretation will fail.triax,west.
nvt argues that while the line items in question used numbers unrelated to the calendar in the frequency column,and differed in that respect from the remaining hundreds of line items that made reference to regular and periodic calendar occurrences as frequency entries,these differences do not create a patent ambiguity.rather,nvt contends that instead of focusing on the uniqueness of the disputed line items,it is more important to understand that there is nothing about those line items that prohibits a reasonable reading consistent with the remainder of the solicitation.the government argues that the fact that numbers were used in the frequency column for these twelve line item entries,and not for the others,should have raised a red flag for nvt,requiring nvt to inquire.the government also argues that in tallying its estimate and noting that these thirteen line items accounted for a large portion of its total price estimate approximately million out of a million bid,or some despite their being treated as incidental in the solicitation,nvt was also put on notice that it should have inquired.where,as here,a certain set of line items is expressed in a manner so different from hundreds of other line items,yielding totals disproportionate to the remainder of the solicitation,we find the differences to be obvious,gross,or glaring,h m moving,at,requiring nvt to inquire.because the solicitation was ambiguous,but any ambiguity was patent,and because it is undisputed that nvt did not inquire into such ambiguity,nvt can not prevail.
mistake in bid 
finally,nvt argues that even if we find the solicitation ambiguous,its bid mistake argument may still prevail,based on in re it corporation,wl.july.the government counters that the trial court correctly denied nvt mistake in bid claim because nvt failed to avail itself of the full information available and referenced in the specification.moreover,the government notes that it was unaware of any solicitation defect at a time when a correction would be appropriate,before the selection of the private sector best proposal because the significance of the disputed line items was not raised until nvt appeal before the gao.the government also distinguishes the it corporation case,because in that case,the agency concluded that all of the information available to the offerors did not adequately identify the work required to meet the needs of the contract.
it corporation,which does not bind this court,stands for the proposition that if a solicitation is defective,such that bidders can not know on what they are bidding,the solicitation must be rebid.after receiving supplemental briefing from the parties,the trial court carefully analyzed this issue and concluded that the fact that this was an a solicitation did not affect the analysis of this issue,because the associated far provisions give no additional rights to bidders of
