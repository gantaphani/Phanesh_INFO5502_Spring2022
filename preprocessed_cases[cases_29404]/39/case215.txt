larry harris appeals the order of the district court granting summary judgment to the city council of north little rock and the city mayor and five city council members in their official and individual capacities collectively,the defendants on harris claims of discrimination and deprivation of a property right under and.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the city of north little rock,arkansas city implemented the year sidewalk program to bring city sidewalks into compliance with the americans with disabilities act.the city opened phase i of the project for bids,expressly stating in the bid package that the city reserved the right to add or subtract sidewalks from the contract as funds allowed.harris,an,submitted the lowest bid of and was awarded the phase i contract.the city subsequently removed some sidewalks from the package,and harris signed the phase i contract for.
some of the sidewalks removed from the phase i contract later were included in the phase ii contract.the lowest bid of for the phase ii contract was submitted by tom brooks,a caucasian.harris bid of was only the bid.the city awarded phase ii to brooks.again,the city removed sidewalks from the package,and in brooks signed the phase ii contract for.
brooks had never performed work for the city before,but he was with city engineer mike smith and had done work on smith residence.brooks also was acquainted with at least two of the city council members.during performance of the phase ii contract,brooks offered to keep his constant at the level if the city agreed to extend his contract for successive phases without.smith informed the city council that the price of new bids likely would rise each year and that,in his opinion,brooks offer was financially advisable.the city council passed an ordinance extending the contract with brooks without new bids.
arkansas law required a municipality to award contracts exceeding through competitive bidding,except in exceptional situations where competitive bidding is deemed not feasible or practical by the city government.ann.b.the city generally provided for waiver of competitive bidding only in emergency situations involving imminent danger of damage.no evidence of an emergency was advanced to justify the award of the extended sidewalk contract to brooks without competitive bidding.
when the year sidewalk program finally was opened again to competitive bidding in,brooks and seven other contractors submitted bids.harris did not bid.the contract was awarded to an contractor who was the lowest bidder.
harris brought a claim against the defendants under for racial discrimination in the awarding of the phase ii contract and a claim under for deprivation of a property right under color of state law in violation of due process.the defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that the challenged contract decisions were made for financial reasons the district court granted the summary judgment motion,holding that harris failed to create a reasonable inference that the contract decision was based on racial discrimination and that harris had no property right in the extended portion of the phase ii contract.harris appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.cottrill mfa,cir.
a.the claim 
section protects citizens rights to make and enforce contracts.the mcdonnell douglas framework applies to motions for summary judgment in cases arising under where there is no direct evidence of discrimination roxas presentation college,cir.under this framework,the claimant first must establish a prima facie case of discrimination if a prima facie case is established,the burden of production shifts to the defendant to show a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action and if the defendant proffers such a reason,the burden of production shifts back to the claimant to establish that the proffered reason is a mere pretext for discriminatory animus.id.at.a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case under by showing membership in a protected class the intent to discriminate on the basis of race on the part of the defendant and discrimination interfering with a protected activity,the making and enforcement of contracts.daniels dillard,cir.one way for the claimant to establish the second element,the defendant intent to discriminate,is to show that he was treated differently from similarly situated nonmembers of the protected class.turner gonzales,cir.
harris did not establish his prima facie case because he did not present evidence sufficient to create an inference that the defendants intended to discriminate against him on the basis of race harris argues that he was treated differently from brooks in several respects and that brooks,a caucasian,was a similarly situated nonmember of the protected class.however,each of harris allegations of disparate treatment fails.
first,harris notes that the value of his phase i contract was reduced from to and that some of the removed work was shifted to the phase ii contract awarded to brooks.however,the bid solicitation expressly reserved the right to add or remove work based on available funding,and in fact brooks phase ii contract also was reduced from to.therefore,harris was not treated differently from brooks.
second,harris cites as evidence of discriminatory intent the city decision to extend additional work under brooks phase ii contract without competitive bidding after the city refused harris request to extend his phase i contract without competitive bidding.again,brooks was not similarly situated to harris because brooks offered to keep his constant at the level for three years if the city agreed to the extension,while harris did not make a similar pricing offer in his request for extra work.
third,harris notes that at some point during brooks contract,brooks was allowed to ignore the contract specification to use nycon,an expensive concrete additive.harris contends that he could have submitted a lower phase ii bid if he had been told that the nycon requirement would not be enforced.there is no disparate treatment in this instance because brooks and the other four contractors who submitted lower phase ii bids than harris had to account for the cost of nycon when they bid the contract,just as harris did.absent evidence that at the time of bidding the city informed brooks,but not the bidders,that the nycon requirement would be dropped at some point,this later change does not create an inference of discrimination against harris in the awarding of the contract.
fourth,harris argues that the city inspected brooks work less rigorously than it inspected harris work during phase i.the deposition testimony on which harris relies suggests that,at most,city engineer smith was very informal when working with brooks because of their social relationship.again,this evidence does not create an inference of racial discrimination in the awarding of the contract 
because harris did not present sufficient evidence to create an inference of an intent to discriminate on the basis of race on the part of the defendants,harris can not establish a prima facie case for his claim.therefore,the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on that claim is appropriate.
b.the claim 
harris claims that the extension of brooks phase ii contract in contravention of ann.b violated harris due process property right in the extended portion of the contract.to have a property interest in a benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.board of regents of state colleges roth,d.arkansas statutes create a property interest in a competitively bid public contract for the lowest bidder that complied with the bidding specifications and procedures.l h sanitation,lake city sanitation,cir.
we need not decide whether a similar protected property right arises in a public contract that should have been,but was not,open to competitive bidding.assuming arguendo that such a pr
