in the city of los angeles adopted a living wage ordinance lwo prescribing a minimum level of compensation for employees of private firms who work on service contracts benefiting the city.admin.code,et the ordinance provides an employee is eligible for lwo wages and benefits if he or she spends any of his or her time on a city service contract,subd.f.former regulation regulation,promulgated by the city agency entrusted with implementing the lwo,provided,prior to its rescission in,if an employee of a private contractor works at least hours during the month on a city service contract,he or she must be paid the appropriate wages mandated by the lwo for each hour worked on the subject agreement.if,however,the employee works less than hours per month on a city service contract,he or she is not eligible for any lwo wages.do regulation rule and component limiting lwo wages to the time actually spent on a city service contract conflict with the lwo 
the plain language of the lwo,coupled with its legislative history,reflect an unmistakable intent to afford a living wage to employees of city service contractors who spend any time working on city service contracts,no matter how much or how little that participation may be.by limiting lwo eligibility to those who work hours a month or more on city contracts and the amount of lwo wages to the hours actually spent on the city contract,regulation directly conflicts with the lwo articulated remedial purpose of raising wages for low wage service workers and ameliorating the burden placed on city social services caused by payment of inadequate compensation.because the trial court erred in concluding regulation was a valid and enforceable clarification of the lwo,we grant the petition for writ of mandate filed in this class action lawsuit by hermelinda aguiar,alicia maria aldrete,aurora banuelos,maria alicia gonzalez and josefina contreras on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated collectively plaintiffs and direct respondent los angeles superior court to vacate its order upholding regulation and to enter a new and different order invalidating regulation on the ground it conflicts with the lwo.
factual and procedural background 
cintas corporation contract with the city 
cintas corporation and cintas corporation collectively cintas lease and launder garments and other goods for their customers.in and again in the city awarded cintas a contract to lease and launder uniforms and other items for use by employees of the los angeles department of water and power dwp.under each contract cintas was required to pick up soiled uniforms and materials,such as dust rags,towels and blankets,used by dwp employees from numerous dwp locations,launder the items,make any necessary repairs and return them to their respective dwp site.items generally were picked up from dwp sites each business day and returned clean within a week of receipt.cintas used its whittier,pico rivera and ontario facilities at various times to process the dwp items.each contract required cintas to comply with the lwo for all covered employees,including the salary,vacation and sick time and notification provisions.for each contract cintas signed a declaration of compliance,certifying it would comply with the lwo.the city terminated its contract with cintas for cause on january,
the class action lawsuit by cintas employees 
in a group of cintas employees sued cintas alleging it had failed to properly compensate them under the lwo and the labor code.the complaint was amended in march to name the current plaintiffs and include allegations that plaintiffs represented not only themselves individually,but also a class of cintas current and former employees of its whittier,pico rivera and ontario facilities who have worked at least hours per month on cintas contracts to provide rental,uniform and laundry services to the dwp.on january,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in which they reiterated most of their class action allegations,but eliminated the allegation restricting the proposed class to workers who had spent at least hours per month performing services on the dwp contracts.in conjunction with the second amended complaint,the plaintiffs also filed a motion to certify the proposed class,consisting of more than production and stockroom workers at cintas whittier,pico rivera and ontario facilities during the period from may,the effective date of cintas original contract with the dwp to january,the date the city terminated its contract with cintas.
cintas opposed the motion for class certification,arguing the named plaintiffs were not adequate class representatives and common issues of law and fact did not predominate over the individual determinations that would be required to determine who was a member of the putative class.specifically,to demonstrate applicability of the lwo,cintas maintained each named plaintiff and putative class member would be required to demonstrate he or she had worked at least hours per month on the dwp contracts.
the trial court agreed with cintas and denied the motion,finding the proposed class was not ascertainable,the putative class members lacked a community of interest and class adjudication was not the superior means of resolving the litigation because plaintiffs evidence did not demonstrate substantial benefits would accrue to either the litigants or the court if the lawsuit were maintained as a class action.
the appeal from the denial of class certification 
plaintiffs appealed,contending the trial court had implicitly assumed the validity of regulation rule and then used it to determine class treatment was not the appropriate means to resolve the litigation.we reversed the order denying class certification in aguiar cintas.th,d aguiar i,holding any perceived barriers to class certification identified by cintas could easily be resolved by dividing the putative class into two subclasses those employees who worked at least hours per month on the dwp contracts and those who did not.accordingly,we did not reach the validity of regulation rule.see id.at,d the validity of the rule need not be resolved at this stage of the litigation and is not a bar to class certification because the putative class can be divided into subclasses of those employees who worked at least hours per month on the dwp contracts and those who did not.
repeal of regulation 
in august,shortly before our decision in aguiar i,supra,th,d,the los angeles city council revoked the rule,finding it inconsistent with its earlier intent to have the lwo apply to all employees who had worked on any city contract.regulation was rescinded in its entirety at the same time language in regulation that both the rule and the limitation in regulation was deleted from the regulation.
the third amended complaint and pretrial motions 
following our decision in aguiar i,supra,th,d,the trial court certified two subclasses consisting of cintas employees who had worked at least hours a month on dwp contracts and those who did not.class notice was sent on october.on august,pursuant to a stipulation of all parties,plaintiffs filed the third amended complaint,which included an additional cause of action seeking a declaratory judgment concerning the validity of regulation.
on november,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication,seeking,among other things,a judicial declaration that regulation was invalid.cintas opposed the motion and filed its own motion for summary judgment summary adjudication.the court heard and denied both motions in january.with respect to the declaratory relief claim,the court found there were factual issues that must be determined before the validity of regulation could be resolved.
in february plaintiffs moved in limine to exclude cintas from submitting any evidence or argument that regulation was enforceable or applicable.cintas filed a cross motion in limine to exclude plaintiffs from submitting any evidence or argument that the regulation was not enforceable.both sides acknowledged the validity of the regulation was exclusively a legal issue for the court.
at a pretrial status conference on february,the court agreed certain legal issues disputed by the parties could be resolved prior to trial,but suggested in limine motions were not the proper vehicle to present those issues.the parties then entered into a stipulation identifying the questions to be decided by the court on a jointly submitted record.pursuant to the parties stipulation,the trial court vacated the february,trial date and scheduled a hearing to decide the legal issues identified in the stipulation,including the threshold issue of regulation validity 
on may,the trial court held the hearing and found regulation valid,concluding it appears to properly clarify the lwo.after ruling on other pretrial motions in separate orders,the trial court set a new trial date of october.
the instant petition for writ of mandate 
on june,plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandate seeking to vacate the trial court may,ruling that regulation was valid as a clarification of the lwo.on july,we issued an order to show cause why the trial court should not be compelled to vacate its may,order declaring regulation valid and enforceable in this case and ordered further proceedings in the trial court stayed pending further order of this court.on august,cintas filed its return,and on august,plaintiffs filed their reply in support of the petition.
discussion 
the los angeles living wage ordinance 
the city adopted the lwo to assure a minimally adequate level of compensation for employees of service contractors who benefit from city contracts.according to the city council legislative findings,experience indicates that procurement by contract of services has all too often resulted in the payment by service contractors to their employees of wages at or slightly above the minimum required by federal and state minimum wage laws.such minimal compensation tends to inhibit the quantity and quality of services rendered by such employees to the city and to the public.underpaying employees in this way fosters high turnover,absenteeism,and lackluster performance.conversely,adequate compensation promotes amelioration of these undesirable conditions.through this article the city intends to require service contractors to provide a minimum level of compensation that will improve the level of services rendered to and for the city.the inadequate compensation typically paid today also fails to provide service employees with resources sufficient to afford life in los angeles.it is unacceptable that contracting decisions involving the expenditure of city funds should foster conditions placing a burden on limited social services.the city,as a principal provider of social support services,has an interest in promoting an employment environment that protects such limited resources.in requiring the payment of a higher minimum level of compensation,this article benefits that interest.
to achieve the goals outlined in its legislative findings,the lwo provides that all employers who are recipients of a service contract with the city must pay covered employees a specified minimum hourly rate the initial rates were per hour with health benefits defined as the payment of at least per hour toward the provision of health care benefits for employees and their dependents or otherwise per hour and the ordinance provides for annual rate increases,subd.a.employers must also provide employees with compensated days off per year for sick leave,vacation or personal necessity at the employee request and,if that time is exhausted,an additional days per year of uncompensated time for sick leave for the illness of the employee or a member of his or her immediate family.id.at,subd.b.in addition,employers are required to notify employees who earn less than per hour of their potential right to the federal earned income credit and make available related forms.id.at.
regulations implementing the living wage ordinance 
at its inception the lwo required the los angeles city council by resolution to designate a department or office the designated administrative agency to promulgate rules for its implementation and to otherwise coordinate administration of its requirements.as the recipient of that designation,the department of public works,bureau of contract administration,office of contract compliance promulgated rules and regulations implementing the living wage ordinance.regulation,entitled the rule,was one of those regulations.
by its terms,former regulation limits the situations in which an employee is entitled to the benefits of the lwo for purposes of the lwo and unless otherwise exempt,an employee of a service contractor will be covered by the lwo if he or she works at least hours during the month a on a service contract if an employee has worked at least hours on the subject agreement during the month,the employee must be paid the appropriate lwo wage rate for each hour worked on the subject agreement during that month.the employee must also accrue compensated and uncompensated time off during that month.if the employee does not work at least hours on the subject agreement during the month,the employer will not be required to compensate the employee at the lwo rate for that month.the compensated and uncompensated time off requirements will also not apply for that month.see also former regulation employers are required to pay the living wage rate to employees working on the city agreement who meet the requirements of regulation.if an employee meets the conditions stated in regulation,the employer shall pay the employee the living wage rate for each hour the employee works on the city agreement.
standard of review 
neither party disputes the meaning of regulation.the question presented is whether regulation rule or limitation of lwo wages to hours worked on city contracts conflicts with the lwo.
when a statute empowers an administrative agency to adopt regulations implementing the legislation,the agency acts in a capacity,having been delegated the legislature lawmaking power.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.judicial review of actions is limited to the determination whether the regulation is within the scope of the authority conferred and is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute under which it is enacted.see id.at,d,woods superior court cal d.in deciding whether the regulation conflicts with its legislative mandate,the court does not defer to the agency interpretation of the law under which the regulation issued,but rather exercises its own independent judgment.see murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,fn,d,w hile the agency construction of a statute is entitled to consideration and respect,it is not binding and it is ultimately for the judiciary to interpret this statute yamaha,at,fn,d,t he court,not the agency,has final responsibility for the interpretation of the law under which the regulation was issued see also california of psychology providers rank cal d,a dministrative regulations that alter or amend the statute or enlarge or impair its scope are void and courts not only may,but it is their obligation to strike down such regulations.
regulation conflicts with the living wage ordinance 
in interpreting the lwo we are guided by principles of statutory construction.carson harbor village,city of carson mobilehome park rental review bd.th,d w e interpret ordinances by the same rules applicable to statutes see amaral cintas.th,d amaral zipperer county of santa clara th,d.our fundamental task is to ascertain the legislature or,as here,the city council intent and thereby effectuate the purpose of the ordinance.smith superior court cal th,d.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.day city of fontana cal th,d.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such circumstances,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.see smith,at,d.
regulation rule is inconsistent with the lwo 
by its terms the lwo requires employers who are recipients of a service contract with the city to pay covered employees lwo wages,subd.a.an employee is defined as any is not a managerial,supervisory,or confidential employee and who is not required to possess an occupational is employed as a service employee of a contractor or subcontractor on or under the authority of one or more service contracts and who expends any of his or her time thereon,subd.f,italics added.
the language of the ordinance is clear any employee of a city service contractor who spends any time at all working on a city service contract subject to the lwo is eligible for lwo wages.to find otherwise would ignore the use of the term any,resulting in a restriction not contemplated by the plain language of the ordinance.see,delaney superior court cal d,statute providing that newsperson shall not be adjudged in contempt for refusing to disclose any unpublished information was not limited in scope to information obtained in confidence the word any means without limit and no matter what kind utility cost management indian wells valley water dist.cal th,d,statute providing limitation period for commencement of any judicial action to review,set aside or annul an ordinance,resolution or motion adopting a new fee or service charge applied to tax refund action use of the word any served to broaden the applicability of the provision.
other language in the lwo supports the conclusion the city council did not intend to limit lwo wages to those who met specific time minimums.see dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.specifically,in the same paragraph authorizing payment of lwo wages to employees who spend any time on city service contracts,the city expressly limited lwo eligibility for employees of city financial assistance recipient s private companies receiving economic development or job growth funding from the lwo wages for those employees only if they expend at least half their time on the premises of the city financial assistance recipient directly involved with the activities funded by the city,subd.f.plainly,the city knew how to,and did,limit lwo coverage based on minimum time requirements,but elected not to impose any such restriction on employees of private companies who were awarded city service contracts.see,simmons ghaderi cal th,d,inclusion of a good cause exception in the work product privilege statutes shows the legislature clearly knew how to enact a statutory good cause exception,but it chose not to do so in the mediation confidentiality statutes see also rojas superior court cal th,d.
cintas insists regulation rule does not conflict with the lwo,but merely serves as a to fill in the details of the authorizing legislation.see yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.by mosk,statutory scheme may explicitly or implicitly delegate this interpretive or authority to an administrative agency ford dealers department of motor vehicles cal d,an administrative agency is not limited to the exact provisions of a statute in adopting regulations to enforce its mandate.the absence of any specific statutory provisions regarding the regulation of an issue does not mean that such a regulation exceeds statutory authority citations.the dmv is authorized to fill up the details of the statutory scheme.yet,cintas fails to identify where in the ordinance the purported gap exists.at best,cintas observes that,absent a specific hour minimum in the lwo itself,there can be no conflict between the lwo and the minimum time requirements in regulation.not only is this argument circular,but also it wholly disregards the term any time in the statute itself that denotes an express legislative intent not to impose a minimum time requirement.
our conclusion the lwo was intended to apply to any employee of a private company who works on city service contracts without regard to minimum time requirements is reinforced by the legislative history of the lwo.see cal.sch.employees governing bd.cal th,d,ordinarily,if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.citation.nonetheless,a court may determine whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose.citation.we need not follow the plain meaning of a statute when to do so would frustrate the manifest purposes of the legislation as a whole or lead to absurd results.see also day city of fontana,supra,cal th at,d,legislative history materials reinforce our conclusion that the statute applies to plaintiff action.prior to its enactment,the proposed draft of the lwo included a percent minimum time eligibility requirement that would have limited lwo eligibility to those employees of city service contractors who expended at least half their time on a city service contract.at the request of the city council committee entrusted with creating the ordinance,the city attorney removed that limitation from the proposed legislation retaining it only for employees of city financial assistance recipients and replaced it with language authorizing coverage if the employee spent any time on the designated contract the codified version of the lwo approved by the city council preserves that intended distinction between employees of city service contractors and city financial assistance recipients,reinforcing the city council intent not to impose time limitations in connection with lwo eligibility for employees of service contractors.see,varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d,citing legislature deletion of conditional stay provision in statutes as supporting interpretation of statutes to mandate automatic stay on appeal in re mehdizadeh th,fn,d t he rejection of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive that the act should not be interpreted to include what was left out wilson city of laguna beach th,d but graham daimlerchrysler cal th,fn,d,u npassed bills,as evidence of legislative intent,have little value.
the city council subsequent repeal of the rule to,in its words,reaffirm the council intent to have a minimum living wage paid to all employees who work on city service contracts is also powerful evidence of the city intent in adopting the lwo.see eu chacon cal d,a lthough a legislative expression of the intent of an earlier act is not binding on the courts in their construction of the prior act,subsequent expressions of intent may properly be considered together with other factors in arriving at the true legislative intent existing when the prior act was passed accord,people cruz cal th,d,peralta comty.college dist.fair employment hous.com.cal d,t he declaration of a later legislature is of little weight in determining the relevant intent of the legislature that enacted the law when,as here,such declared intent is without objective support in either the language or history of the legislation and until recently is contrary as well to the practice of the affected agency.
faced with the plain language and legislative history of the lwo,cintas nonetheless contends interpreting the lwo to authorize a living wage to employees for any time spent on a city service contract would lead to absurd results.according to cintas,it would require a city contractor to pay employees higher hourly rates even if they only touched a dwp garment for an instant.that argument,however,ignores the employer authority to determine the extent to which an employee works on a city contract,if at all.see,amaral,supra,th at,d a contractor with many employees might choose to limit its obligations under a living wage ordinance by segregating city contract work and assigning this work to a smaller subset of employees.it also disregards the lwo express purpose,that is,to require those who procure city contracts to pay their employees who work on those contracts at a level that both fosters quality performance and ameliorates the burden placed on the city social services caused by payment of inadequate compensation.far from absurd,the ordinance as drafted authorizing minimum compensation without accompanying time minimums fulfills the city council articulated intent.see miklosy regents of university of california cal th,d,although in rare cases the literal meaning of the statutory words may be disregarded to avoid absurd results,the absurdity argument is not well taken if there also exists a rational,nonabsurd basis for legislation.
b.the component of regulation is not enforceable 
regulation provides that,if the employee worked at least hours on the subject agreement during the month,the employee must be paid the appropriate lwo wage rate for each hour worked on the agreement.similarly,regulation,in language that was also deleted in august,provided,if an employee meets the conditions stated in regulation,the employer shall pay the employee the living wage rate for each hour the employee works on the city agreement.cintas argues that,regardless of the validity of the rule,this aspect of regulation is fully consistent with the lwo and is severable from the rule.
at the threshold,it is at best,indeed,neither party cites any case the severance doctrine is applicable to administrative regulations,as opposed to the legislation those regulations are intended to implement.santa barbara school dist.superior court cal d,severance of unconstitutional portion of statute is possible and proper where the language of the statute is mechanically severable and the remainder is complete in itself and would have been adopted by the legislative body had the latter foreseen the partial invalidity of the statute long beach lesbian gay pride city of long beach th,d city ordinance.furthermore,even if severance were applicable to administrative regulations,nothing in the regulation suggests the component was intended to stand alone in the event the rule was invalidated.to the contrary,although the lwo itself contains a severance clause there is no similar provision in any of the regulations implementing the lwo.see,schenley affiliated brands kirby d.a declaration of severability,although not conclusive,is persuasive evidence of the enacting body intent legislature eu cal d,severance of particular provisions is permissible despite absence of a formal severance clause if,among other things,the legislature or voters intended the clause to stand independently had they foreseen that part of the legislation would be declared invalid.in fact,the two portions of the regulation appear inextricably linked,with the rule serving as the component necessary predicate.that is,if the employee works hours or more a month on a city service contract,then the employee is entitled to lwo wages for each hour worked on the city contract.that conclusion is reinforced by the parallel language that had existed in regulation.the rescission of regulation in its preserving the component of the its contemporaneous deletion of language in regulation containing the limitation further suggest the component is inseparable from the rule.
in any event,even if the hours worked component of regulation could be severed from the regulation rule,we would still find the former provision in conflict with the lwo itself.the lwo provides,employers shall pay employees a wage of no less than the hourly rates set forth in this article,subd.a.this language imposes a minimum hourly wage for the hours worked by the employee,not one for each hour worked by the employee on the city contract.the same is true for other compensation benefits authorized by the lwo.for example,the lwo authorizes compensated days off per year as part of the lwo benefits for any covered employee.it does not require that an employee spend working on a city service contract to earn the compensated day off and does not reduce the compensated days off to a percentage of the time spent on the city contract.it is the employee status as a covered employee that is determinative.
cintas asserts,if the term any of his or her time in the section defining employee means anything,it must limit lwo payments to the amount of time spent on the city contract.yet,as we have explained,the term any of his or her time defines when an employee is lwo eligible,not the manner in which his or her wages are to be calculated.the amount of wages,authorized in a separate section of the lwo entitled payment of minimum compensation to employees,contains no link between the amount of time actually worked on city service contracts and the lwo wages earned.see admin.code.to be sure,the city could have limited lwo wages to the hours an employee of a private contractor actually worked on city contracts or the city could have chosen to afford lwo eligibility to all employees of private contractors who receive city contracts without regard to whether the employee ever actually worked on the city contract see,rubalcava martinez th,d city zoning ordinance setting minimum wage requirements for all city hotel workers in exchange for city financing street improvements and job training.it did neither.instead,the lwo provides for a living wage based on an employee he or she worked on the city limiting those wages to the hours actually worked.see amaral,supra,th at,d had city intended to include nexus between the amount of time worked on a city contract and the wages earned,it could have easily included it in the ordinance itself.
cintas made a similar argument in amaral,supra,th,d,asserting a living wage ordinance adopted by the city of hayward dictated a minimum level of pay only for those hours the eligible employee actually worked on a city contract the first district rejected cintas construction of the hayward living wage ordinance hayward lwo explaining,n o provision of the hayward lwo limits the contractor obligation by mandating a living wage only for the time an employee spends performing tasks related to the service contract with hayward.if the city of hayward had intended to restrict the application of the hayward lwo in this manner,it could have easily inserted the phrase for hours worked on the contract in the subdivision describing the ordinance living wage requirements.citations.it did not.id.at,d.the court of appeal also observed the hayward lwo also included compensated days off,but did not link those benefits to the time spent on a hayward city contract if the city had intended to impose the limitation cintas now urges,it could have stated that employees not fully engaged in work on or under a service contract would also accrue compensated days off at a proportional rate.it did not.ibid.although the hayward lwo and the instant lwo are not identical,they are very similar,and cintas has provided no persuasive reason for us to depart from the first district analysis in amaral.
unable to rely on the plain language of the lwo,cintas once again raises its gap filler rationale in support of the now repealed regulation.that is,cintas asserts,absent any language in the lwo mandating a broad application of lwo wages as part of an employee overall compensation without regard to the hours spent on the city contract,the regulation limiting such wages to the actual hours worked is not in conflict with the ordinance,but rather fills in its details.see,ford dealers department of motor vehicles,supra,cal d at.yet,the regulation can not be justified as a when limiting lwo wages to the hours spent on the city contract would conflict with the lwo articulated remedial purpose.see day city of fontana,supra,cal th at,d.as discussed,the lwo was adopted in recognition that service contractors benefitting from city service contracts too often paid their workers low wages,thereby inhibiting the quantity and quality of services provided to the public by those employees.the city council was also concerned that inadequate compensation typically paid today also fails to provide service employees with resources sufficient to afford life in los angeles,pars.the lwo ameliorates these conditions by mandating a minimum living wage for employees of
