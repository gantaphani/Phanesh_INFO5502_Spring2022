oxbow carbon minerals,llc,appeals from a judgment denying its petition for writ of mandate.the petition for writ of mandate followed an adverse administrative ruling by respondents state of california,department of industrial relations department or dir and its director,john duncan director.the director found that work performed under two separate contracts constituted public works pursuant to labor code section because the work was paid for in part out of public funds,and it was therefore subject to california prevailing wage law the trial court agreed.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
the subject of this appeal is a building at pier g,pad in the city of long beach,which appellant oxbow carbon minerals,llc oxbow uses pursuant to a lease agreement with real party in interest city of long beach long beach.oxbow involvement with pad began after its purchase in of applied industrial materials corporation aimcor,a company which,like oxbow,was in the business of buying and selling petroleum coke,a of the process.
aimcor originally leased pad from long beach in.for a time,aimcor used the premises to receive petroleum coke by truck and store it until it could be loaded on to vessels.
in,aimcor entered into a new lease with long beach,pursuant to which aimcor constructed a structure that was open at the top,roofless,and various other implements.the purpose of these improvements was for the storage and conveyance of petroleum coke,which was delivered by truck to a location outside the structure.coke would be lifted up by a stacker and dumped into the structure from overhead.after sitting in storage,it was conveyed from the floor of the structure to available ships.
in december,aimcor was sold and merged into oxbow.oxbow planned to enclose the structure at pad by placing a roof on it.in february,long beach and oxbow as a successor to aimcor executed an amendment to the lease.this amendment stated that long beach would reimburse oxbow up to for the construction of conveyors at pad,and that,following the construction and upon reimbursement,title to the conveyors would be transferred to long beach.the lease amendment also stated,construction of the pad conveyors shall be accomplished in accordance with the laws governing public works.lessee acknowledges that the reimbursement makes this work paid for in whole or part out of public funds within the meaning of california labor code.the conveyors would be used to transport coke from the outside of the structure to the inside,a task previously performed by the stacker.
the lease amendment did not mention the planned roof.however,a december,memorandum from the director of properties for the port of long beach requesting approval of the lease amendment by the board of harbor commissioners noted how the goal of long beach and oxbow was to maximize the use of the facility in compliance with rule,and i n order to accomplish this,a roof and receiving conveyors will have to be constructed the memorandum further explained that oxbow would be responsible for the cost of constructing the roof,while long beach would reimburse at least part of the cost of the conveyors.in addition,a south coast air quality management district permit was issued for a petroleum coke receiving and storage system at the site,consisting of,among other things,enclosed conveyors and a storage building.a harbor development permit described the approved work as install a roof on the existing walls on pad upgrade existing conveyors and add new conveyors to bring the facility into full rule compliance upgrade an existing dust suppression system and upgrade the existing electrical system.
oxbow entered into a new conveyors erection contract with bragg investment,for erection of the new conveyor system.it entered into a separate petroleum coke enclosure design and erection contract with allen construction,for construction of the roof,which it paid for with private funds 
the conveyors contract called generally for a system consisting of three enclosed conveyors,an open shuttle conveyor,and also an enclosed transfer tower.the first conveyor,which is completely enclosed,runs outside the storage building and conveys coke from ground level up to the enclosed transfer tower,which is also outside the building.once it reaches the transfer tower,coke is transferred to the second conveyor,which takes coke from the transfer tower through a cupola in the roof of the storage building.the second conveyor is independently enclosed up to the point where it encounters the cupola.the coke is then dumped onto the third conveyor,which runs the length of the structure just under the new roof and dumps it into piles on the floor.the third conveyer is not independently enclosed but,as with the rest of the interior of the building,it is covered by the roof.
the enclosure contract stated that its purpose was to completely enclose the existing storage facility for compliance with rule.pursuant to the enclosure contract,a roof was built over the storage building,a cupola was built to allow entry of the second conveyor into the building,and framing was built to support the third conveyor inside the structure.it appears that construction of the enclosure and the conveyor system occurred relatively contemporaneously.
administrative determination and decision 
in january,real party in interest iron workers union local requested a determination from the department as to whether construction of the building enclosing the conveyors on pier g was a public work under section on october,the director issued a public works coverage determination determination that found the replacement conveyor and enclosure improvement work is a single,integrated public works project subject to prevailing wage requirements.the determination stated that c onstruction under the enclosure and conveyor contracts produced one structure that functioned as a unified system for the distribution and storage of coke,and that the replacement conveyors were designed as an essential element of the improved enclosure,not as a undertaking.
oxbow and long beach thereafter filed an administrative appeal of the determination,arguing that the work performed under the enclosure contract was separate from that performed under the conveyors contract,and,though the conveyor work was public work,the enclosure work was private on july,the director issued a decision on administrative appeal,affirming the determination.this decision stated that the conveyor and enclosure improvements constitute parts that are put together to form a complete integrated object,a petroleum coke handling and storage facility,and that w ithout performance under both contracts,construction would be incomplete and not viable.the decision affirmed the determination that the enclosure and conveyance work was construction paid for out of public funds,constituting a public work subject to the prevailing wage law requirements.
trial court proceedings 
on september,oxbow filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court for the county of los angeles seeking an order requiring the department to determine that the enclosure improvement was not a public work subject to california prevailing wage law the administrative record was lodged with the trial court and no new evidence was presented.
the trial court denied the petition,and its minute order held the administrative decision correct as a matter of law.citing lusardi construction aubry cal th,lusardi,the minute order stated that parties may not by agreement between themselves,thwart or limit the rights of workers to be paid prevailing wage rates on public projects,and t he fact that the parties structured their deal so as to limit the obligation to pay prevailing wage rates on a project does not prevent the director from deciding to the contrary.
judgment was entered in favor of the director and department on august.the appeal is timely.
discussion 
the facts here are undisputed.our task,therefore,is a matter of statutory interpretation,determining whether the work at issue was public work under california prevailing wage law.
standard of review 
in determining whether the prevailing wage law applies,we must exercise our independent judgment in resolving whether the project at issue constituted a public work within the meaning of the prevailing wage law.city of long beach department of industrial relations cal th,city of long beach,citing mcintosh aubry th,mcintosh.an agency interpretation of a statute is one among several tools available to the court when judging the meaning and legal effect of a statute.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,yamaha.thus,the court considers the director interpretation of labor code section.see state building construction trades council of california duncan th,state building plumbers steamfitters,local duncan th.nevertheless,it is the judiciary which has the ultimate authority for determining the meaning of a statute.state building,at,citing yamaha,at culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization cal d,morris williams cal d.
therefore,although we consider the director interpretation,we must independently determine whether the public work was only the work performed under the conveyors contract,or whether it also included the work performed under the enclosure contract.
b.the prevailing wage law 
overview of the prevailing wage law 
the purpose of california prevailing wage law,is to protect and benefit employees on public works projects.lusardi,supra,cal th at.the legislature has declared that it is the public policy of california to vigorously enforce minimum labor standards in order to ensure employees are not required or permitted to work under substandard unlawful conditions,and to protect employers who comply with the law from those who attempt to gain competitive advantage at the expense of their workers by failing to comply with minimum labor standards.citation.the conditions of employment on construction projects financed in whole or in part by public funds are governed by the prevailing wage law.citations.ibid.
the coverage of the prevailing wage law is broad,and a number of specific goals are subsumed within its objective to protect employees from substandard wages that might be paid if contractors could recruit labor from distant areas to permit union contractors to compete with nonunion contractors to benefit the public through the superior efficiency of employees and to compensate nonpublic employees with higher wages for the absence of job security and employment benefits enjoyed by public employees.lusardi,supra,cal th at.the law was enacted to protect and benefit workers and the public and is to be liberally construed.city of long beach,supra,cal th at.
section provides that,aside from certain exceptions not relevant here,all workers on public works projects must be paid at least the general prevailing rate of wages.section gives the director the responsibility of determining general prevailing wage rates,and the director also has the initial authority to determine whether a specific project is public work subject to the prevailing wage law,tit,subd.a.
the issue presented here is the scope of section,specifically section,subdivision a,which provides a definition of public works.subdivision a reads as used in this chapter,public works means construction,alteration,demolition,installation,or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,except work done directly by any public utility company pursuant to order of the public utilities commission or other public authority.for purposes of this paragraph,construction includes work performed during the design and preconstruction phases of construction including,but not limited to,inspection and land surveying work.
the parties do not dispute that the work done under the conveyors contract was paid for out of public funds and subject to the prevailing wage law.the question is whether the work done under the enclosure contract was also subject to the prevailing wage law.if the enclosure work fell within the scope of construction paid for in whole or part out of public funds then it also fell within the definition of public works,and was subject to the prevailing wage requirements.
oxbow argues that the enclosure work and the conveyor work were two separate,independent constructions,that public funding only paid for construction of the conveyor system,and that the roof work was not a public work subject to the prevailing wage law.the department contends that oxbow constructed a single,rule coke loading and storage facility,that construction of the facility was paid for in part out of public funds,and that all of the construction was a public work.
as explained further below,we hold that because the conveyor and enclosure work turned an unusable structure into a functioning coke receiving and storage facility,this constituted construction,and since the construction was paid for in part out of public funds,it was a public work.the work performed under both the conveyors contract and enclosure contract therefore was subject to the prevailing wage requirements.
c.the scope of section,subdivision a 
oxbow contends that this centers on the scope of construction paid for in part out of public an issue of first impression.although oxbow may have framed the issue in a somewhat unique manner,a number of cases have examined the effect of section,subdivision a and its term construction.
we are guided by several principles in determining the effect of section,subdivision a.to determine the intent of legislation,we first consult the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.dafonte,cal th,mcintosh,supra,th at.in making this determination,an individual phrase or term may not be divorced from the statute as a whole rather,all parts of the statute must be considered.state building,supra,th at that construction is not to be reached by examining bits and pieces of the statute,but after a consideration of all parts of section in order that we may effectuate the legislature intent.finally,our foremost concern is enforcing the purpose of the legislation.lusardi,supra,cal th.
construction is not precisely defined in the labor code,although section,subdivision a was amended in see city of long beach,supra,cal th at to explicitly include preconstruction activities that previously were not referenced for purposes of this paragraph,construction includes work performed during the design and preconstruction phases of construction including,but not limited to,inspection and land surveying work.while this definition makes clear that for purposes of subdivision a construction includes design and preconstruction work,it does not explain what construction itself is or when it is considered paid out of public funds 
dictionary definitions of construction aid in our analysis.two definitions were cited approvingly by the supreme court in city of long beach,supra,at page the act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object.webster new internat.dict.t he action of framing,devising,or forming by the putting together of parts erection,building.oxford english dict.ed.
case law also provides definitions of the term.in priest housing authority d,in the context of a case examining section,this district devised the following definition of construction as one thinks of construction one ordinarily considers the entire process,including construction of basements,foundations,utility connections and the like,all of which may be required in order to erect an structure.more recently,construction was defined the plain meaning of the term construction includes not only the erection of a new structure but also the renovation of an existing one.plumbers steamfitters,local,supra,th at.
inherent in these definitions of construction is the concept that construction is the creation of the complete integrated object which is composed of individual parts.the director found that the conveyor and enclosure improvements constitute parts that are put together to form a complete integrated object,a petroleum coke handling and storage facility,and the trial court relied on a similar analysis to hold that the entirety of the work was construction paid in part out of public funds.given the facts of this case,we agree that focus on the complete integrated object is the best approach.
this approach is consistent with the use of the term construction throughout section.numerous subdivisions refer to construction in terms of a complete product,and none limits the term to the formation of individual pieces of a whole furthermore,the amendment to subdivision a evidences the legislature intent to give construction a broad meaning,since it expanded construction to include design and preconstruction work.
a reasonably broad interpretation of a public work in the context of construction paid for in whole or in part out of public funds is also in keeping with the purpose of the prevailing wage law.as stated by the supreme court in lusardi,the object that a statute seeks to achieve is of primary importance in statutory interpretation.citations.the overall purpose of the prevailing wage law,as noted earlier,is to benefit and protect employees on public works projects.lusardi,supra,cal th at see also state building,supra,th at labor code section embodies the public policy of california to require employers engaged on public works projects to pay the prevailing wage to their workers if the project is paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.
thus,an emphasis on the complete integrated object is required in this case.
d.the conveyor and enclosure work constituted construction paid for in part by public funds 
oxbow argues that the construction of the enclosure was separate and independent from the construction of the conveyor system and so can not be considered paid for out of public funds.oxbow relies on the fact that its amended lease with long beach only referenced the planned conveyor work and stated that this work would be reimbursed by long beach and subject to the prevailing wage law.as correctly noted by both the director and the trial court,however,the danger of oxbow argument is that if given effect,it would encourage parties to contract around the prevailing wage law by breaking up individual tasks into separate construction contracts.
this sort of behavior was directly criticized in lusardi.in lusardi,the supreme court held that the obligation to pay prevailing wages may not be based solely on contractual provisions,but that the obligation instead flows from the statutory duty embodied within the prevailing wage law.lusardi,supra,cal th at.the lusardi court reasoned that an awarding body and a contractor often have strong incentives to avoid the prevailing wage law and thus may structure their contracts to circumvent it.id.at.the court held that such circumvention conflicts with the law to allow this would reduce the prevailing wage law to merely an advisory expression of the legislature view.id.at.
by looking at the totality of the underlying facts here,it is clear that no matter what the terms of the amended lease were,the purpose and end result of the construction were a functioning coke receiving and storage facility.giving effect to oxbow and long beach agreement to limit public funds to the conveyor system would run afoul of the lusardi rule.
upon enactment of rule,the structure at pad became unusable,and remained in that state for several years.after aimcor was purchased by oxbow,oxbow,through dealings with long beach,made plans to make the site usable again.the december memorandum from the director of properties for the port of long beach stated how the goal of long beach and oxbow was to maximize the use of the facility in compliance with rule,and that i n order to accomplish this,a roof and receiving conveyors will have to be constructed the south coast air quality management district permit stated that the petroleum coke receiving and storage system would consist of enclosed conveyors and a storage building,and the harbor development permit noted how work would bring the facility into full rule compliance through installation of the roof,completion of the conveyor work,and other associated tasks.
contrary to oxbow assertions,the conveyor system and enclosure work were not separate and independent.both the construction and conveyance work occurred at the same site and at or near the same time.the enclosure contract specifically noted that the other work would be interfacing to or in close proximity to the enclosure work,and that oxbow was to assist the enclosure contractor in coordinating its work with the work to be performed by the conveyors contractor 
rule generally requires that coke be enclosed,including when on a conveyor.although the first conveyor is independently enclosed,the second conveyor relies on the cupola constructed pursuant to the enclosure contract to enter the building,and the third conveyor is not independently enclosed at all,but relies entirely on the newly constructed roof to meet the rule enclosure requirement.the framing necessary to support the third conveyor was also built pursuant to the enclosure contract.thus,the work performed under the conveyors and enclosure contracts was interdependent,and without the work performed pursuant to the enclosure contract,the conveyor system would be unusable.
in order for the pad facility to be functional,it needed to incorporate both a method of enclosing the coke and of moving the coke into the facility.oxbow contends that the conveyors may not have been necessary to render the site compliant with rule and speculates that other methods could have been used.oxbow acknowledges that use of a stacker became impossible,however,and the record does not reveal any consideration of methods aside from the conveyors for loading coke into the enclosed facility.but even if alternatives had been considered,this would not change our analysis.a method of loading coke into the structure was required.the conveyor system was the chosen method and,in tandem with the enclosure work,it rendered the facility rule and usable 
we therefore find that since the construction of the lawful and functional coke receiving and storage facility was paid for in part by public funds,it was a public work,and the work performed under both the enclosure contract and conveyors contract was subject to the prevailing wage law 
oxbow project approach argument 
oxbow takes issue with the director use of the term project in his determination and decision.it argues that the director improperly equated construction with project,and that this project approach is not authorized by section,subdivision a.
oxbow is correct that section,subdivision a does not include the term project.it is also correct that a determination of a public work pursuant to section,subdivision a must be based on the actual terms in the section,and analyzing whether something is a project paid for by public funds to the exclusion of analyzing whether it is construction paid for by public funds would be improper.oxbow concerns with the use of the term project in this case are overblown,however.project is a term often used in conjunction with or in place of construction,both in the context of the labor code and in areas far removed.see,subd.b p erformance of construction work by the state or political subdivision in execution of the project,subd.c construction or rehabilitation of privately owned residential projects,subd.c d project consist ing of new construction,or expansion,or rehabilitation work,referring to public works projects lusardi,supra,cal th at the conditions of employment on construction projects financed in whole or in part by public funds are governed by the prevailing wage law state building,supra,th at labor code section embodies the public policy of california to require employers engaged on public works projects to pay the prevailing wage to their workers if the project is paid for in whole or in part out of public funds see also trb investments,fireman fund ins.cal th,referring to construction project in insurance coverage dispute lewis jorge construction management,pomona unified school dist.cal th,pertaining to alleged lost future profit damages on construction projects.the fact that the director and the trial court decisions refer to a projec
