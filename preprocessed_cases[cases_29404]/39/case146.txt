this appeal raises the question whether centerpoint energy houston electric and centerpoint energy entex collectively centerpoint may collect from harris county toll road authority and harris county collectively harris county costs of relocating their utility facilities when harris county constructed the westpark tollway along the westpark drive in houston,texas.centerpoint also seeks to collect attorney fees and prejudgment interest.we hold that of the texas transportation code requires reimbursement of centerpoint relocation costs,and that the district court failed to provide reasoning sufficient for review of the denial of attorney fees or prejudgment interest.thus,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for centerpoint awarding its relocation costs,vacate the denial of attorney fees and prejudgment interest,and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
the material facts are undisputed.centerpoint is a utility provider servicing the city of houston under a franchise agreement originally executed in.centerpoint has no such agreement with harris county.centerpoint maintains electric and gas facilities within the of houston city streets,including westpark drive,now the westpark tollway.centerpoint has no easement rights in the property.
in june,harris county began constructing the westpark tollway.the construction of the tollway required centerpoint to relocate gas and electric utilities at a cost of over ten million dollars all of the relocated facilities are within the city of houston.centerpoint requested the relocation costs from harris county both before and after the relocation.harris county refused payment and this suit followed.
based on centerpoint claims under both the united states and texas constitutions,the action was removed to federal court based on and.the parties agreed that there were no material issues of fact,and accordingly submitted for summary judgment.the district court denied harris county motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment for centerpoint,holding that and of the texas transportation code required harris county to reimburse centerpoint relocation costs in the amounts of and,respectively,to centerpoint energy houston electric and centerpoint energy entex.the court ordered postjudgment interest of per annum.both parties appealed harris county appealed the judgment centerpoint appealed the district court denial of attorney fees and prejudgment interest.
we review the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo,respecting the same legal standards that the district court applied to determine whether summary judgment was appropriate.lamar adver.cont l cas,cir citations omitted.a summary judgment motion is properly granted only when,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the evidence presented demonstrates no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
the primary issue presented is whether a texas utility or the county government must bear utility relocation costs caused by county road construction.the common law principle requires that a utility forced to relocate from a public must do so at its own expense.norfolk redevelopment housing auth.chesapeake potomac.of,d.texas has adopted a similar rule concluding that,because the main purposes of roads and streets are for travel and transportation,it is clear that utilities may be required to remove at their own expense any installations owned by them and located in public rights of way whenever such relocation is made necessary by highway improvements.state city of austin.see also benbrook water sewer auth.city of benbrook,city of grand prairie city of irving,city of grand prairie am,cir all holding as a general rule that utilities can be required to relocate from the public at their own expense,and that such rule has been adopted by the state of texas when applying this rule,t here is no material difference between a utility company and a municipal corporation.city of austin,at.thus,if this appeal were determined by common law principles,centerpoint would be required to bear its own relocation costs.the common law,however,controls only where there is no conflicting or controlling statutory law.see,taylor leonard,d common law.jur d statutes.we thus turn to examine the applicable statutes.
centerpoint correctly contends that and of the texas transportation code apply in this case section provides a means for counties to acquire property to build or improve roadways.as a part of that process,mandates that a county shall include the cost of relocating or adjusting an eligible utility facility in the expense of right of way acquisition.transp.code ann.as we are clearly dealing with a cost of relocating resulting from the acqui sition of a,the question is whether centerpoint is an eligible utility facility within the meaning of.
section of the transportation code itself does not provide any guidance as to the meaning of eligible utility facility.still we are required to search out carefully the intendment of a statute,giving full effect to all of its terms.highway com el paso const.trades council,see bd.of adjustment wende,courts must attempt to give effect to every word and phrase if it is reasonable to do so.to give full meaning to the modifier eligible,we turn,to the traditional tools of statutory interpretation.
the primary rule in statutory interpretation is that a court must look to the intent of the legislature and must construe the statute so as to give effect to that intent.union bankers ins.shelton,citations omitted see also crimmins lowry,a fundamental rule controlling the construction of a statute is to determine,if possible,the intent of the legislature as expressed in the language of that statute.to determine the intent of the legislature,ordinarily we first look to the words of the statute itself.see hightower texas hosp.ass n,cir when courts interpret statutes,the initial inquiry is the language of the statute itself.however,we have examined the statute,as noted above,and find that the words eligible utility facility remain ambiguous.if intent can not be determined from the words of the text we look to other sources.in this case,those sources have been identified for us in of the texas government code,as discussed infra.
it is important as background to our analysis to understand that texas has been in the process of,and is currently nearing the end of a general recodification of its laws.see legal research guides,texas statutes and regulations,last visited.this fact is relevant because in,the texas legislature passed senate bill,the texas transportation act transportation act,which completed the recodification of texas law relating to transportation.the transportation act created the texas transportation code which includes the current and see.sess.law serv.chpt.west now codified at.transp.code ann,et.the purpose of the transportation act was to provide a cogent and organized codification of texas transportation to create substantive changes in the law 
the transportation act gives specific instructions relating to its interpretation.section of the transportation act,now codified in the transportation code,provides that chapter,government code code construction act,applies to the construction of each provision in this code except as otherwise expressly provided.transp.code ann.because does not expressly provide otherwise we will look to chapter of the texas government code for interpretive aids.
section of the texas government code provides a list of construction aids to be used i n construing a statute,whether or not the statute is considered ambiguous on its face.gov code ann.two aids are particularly pertinent,the title caption,preamble,and emergency provision and second former statutory provisions,including laws on the same or similar subjects.id.each will be considered in turn.
we examine first the title and preamble.the transportation act provides that as a part of the t he general statutory revision program,it contemplates a revision of the state general and permanent statute law without substantive change.see.sess.law serv.chpt,a west now codified at.transp.code ann.a.specifically the transportation act is a n act relating to the adoption of a nonsubstantive revision of statutes relating to transportation.id.at preamble emphasis added.because the transportation act was not intended to create a substantive change in the law,we must conclude that and retain their meaning before codification.
we turn now to the second construction aid former statutory provisions,including laws on the same or similar subjects to discern the meaning of eligible utility facility.
the versions of and of the transportation code were texas civil statute articles and.see.transp.code ann,historical and statutory notes.one of these provisions,article,provides definition to the phrase eligible utility facility and the other,article,applies that phrase in the context of county acquisitions 
our first step in determining the meaning of eligible is to examine its use in article entitled costs of relocating or adjusting eligible utility facilities in acquisition of.civ.stat.although that provision addressed acquisitions by the texas highway department,the provision gives meaning to the phrase eligible utility facilities in the context of the relocation of utility facilities for roadway projects.the provision states in the acquisition of all highway by or for the texas highway department,the cost of relocating or adjusting utility facilities which cost may be eligible under the law is hereby declared to be an expense and cost of acquisition.civ.stat.thus,in article,the title and text combine to provide that eligible describes a utility that incurs a relocation cost as a result of a highway acquisition by the texas highway department,which cost is eligible under the law for reimbursement.although this reasoning is still circular,we do understand that eligible is a modifier of cost.and,although the statute is in reference to acquisition by the texas highway department,when the acquisition of the right of way here was by the county,the use of the same term in article gives meaning to the phrase in the context of this case.
article of the same title states the county should include the cost of relocating or adjusting eligible utility facilities in the expense of acquisition.civ.stat.we can only conclude that the texas legislature intended the term eligible utility facilities to be interpreted and applied consistently in each of its uses in the title.see dallas county cmty.college dist.bolton,wl we must interpret a statute according to its terms,giving meaning to the language consistent with other provisions in the statute.mcintyre ramirez,w e will not give an undefined statutory term a meaning that is out of harmony or inconsistent with other provisions in the statute barr bernhard,o ne provision will not be given a meaning out of harmony or inconsistent with other provisions,although it might be susceptible of such a construction if standing alone.consequently,the meaning of the term used in both article and article is the same thus,where a utility facility incurs relocation costs resulting from a county acqui sition of real property,through the process outlined in article,and those relocation costs are eligible under the law,that utility is an eligible utility facility due county reimbursement.see.civ.stat.
we have thus determined that and were intended to retain the same meaning of eligible utility facilities as in the statute additionally we have concluded that the term eligible utility facility refers to a utility incurring relocation costs that are eligible under the law for reimbursement.we turn now to consider whether the costs incurred by centerpoint are such costs,that is to say,whether centerpoint is an eligible utility facility within the meaning of.
the first requirement of is that the cost claimed for reimbursement must have resulted from a county acquisition of for highway construction.this requirement is satisfied.section authorizes a county to exercise the power of eminent domain in a municipality to condemn and acquire real property,a,or an easement in public or private property necessary or convenient to any road that forms or will form a connecting link in the county road system.transp.code ann.although harris county contends otherwise,its activity falls squarely within this statutory provision it acquired the along westpark drive needed to construct the westpark tollway,a road that harris county admits is a connecting link between the city of houston and the surrounding county.see supra note.the parties do not dispute that the construction of the westpark tollway on the of the former westpark drive necessitated the relocation of centerpoint utility facilities.thus centerpoint satisfies the requirement of as having incurred costs resulting from a county acquisition for highway construction.
the second requirement under is that the costs incurred must be eligible under the law.to give contextual meaning to these words,we look to the texas supreme court and the case of state city of austin,in city of austin,the texas supreme court addressed the validity of a statute requiring similar repayment of relocation costs to a utility although city of austin addresses the validity of a legislative mandate that the state repay a utility relocation costs,the focus of the court analysis was on the constitutional limitations of public reimbursement of relocation costs to private utilities.as such we find no reason in law or fact to restrict the principle of its holding to the state obligation consequently,the case is determinative of costs eligible under the law for purposes of of the transportation code.
the petitioner in city of austin,the state of texas,sought declaratory relief regarding the payment of relocation costs incurred by a private utility.see city of austin,at.the petitioner contended that the state reimbursement to a private utility constituted an illegal payment of public funds to a private entity in violation of the texas constitution.id.in denying relief to the state,the texas supreme court held that t he legislature acting for the state has primary and plenary power to regulate public roads and streets and i t may delegate that power to counties or municipal corporations.id.at.as in city of austin,we have before us an instance where the legislature has empowered a governmental entity,harris county,to acquire the property necessary to construct highways.that grant of authority is conditioned,however,by the requirement that the utilities be reimbursed for the expense which they incur.id.at.the court emphasized that a legislative act directing a particular payment must be obeyed unless it violates the texas constitutional provision prohibiting donation for a private purpose.a payment to a utility,the court stated,is not prohibited by the texas constitution so long as the statute creating the right of reimbursement operates prospectively,deals with the matter in which the public has a real and legitimate interest,and is not fraudulent,arbitrary or capricious.id.at.payment under of the transportation code to centerpoint satisfies this standard.
first,there is no contention that operates retrospectively in this could there be.the cost was incurred long after the statute requiring payment was passed.second,the public has a direct and immediate interest in the relocation of utility facilities which would otherwise interfere with highway improvements.city of austin,at.finally,there is no evidence or contention that the statute,nor the proposed payment to centerpoint,can be said to be fraudulent,arbitrary or capricious in sum,because relocation costs incurred by centerpoint are eligible under the law for reimbursement,centerpoint is an eligible utility facility under of the texas transportation code.
accordingly,the district court judgment for centerpoint ordering the payment of relocation costs is affirmed 
on centerpoint contends that the district court erred in denying its request for attorney fees and prejudgment interest.a denial of attorney fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion southwestern bell.city of el paso,cir.t
