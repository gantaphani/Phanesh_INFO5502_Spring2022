following the rejection of its protest to the award of a public contract to real party in interest sharp electronics sharp,plaintiff imagistics international,imagistics filed the present petition for a peremptory writ of mandate directing defendant department of general services dgs to accept its protest,or for a declaration that the award of the contract to sharp was void.in bifurcated proceedings,the trial court first found that the standard of strict compliance was appropriate for the procedures for filing a protest,which plaintiff imagistics had not satisfied.in its subsequent order,it did not find any basis for excusing plaintiff imagistics from exhausting this administrative remedy.
plaintiff imagistics promptly appealed.it renews its arguments here,as well as invoking new ones for the first time we shall affirm.
background 
in march,defendant dgs solicited proposals for the purchase of photocopiers and related support services.the value of the contract approximated million.
the bidding process had two phases.the first solicited responses to technical and administrative specifications of the proposal.bidders that satisfied these criteria could then participate in a reverse auction that provided the opportunity to view the lowest existing bid and place a lower one.
the solicitation included a notification that the dgs would be conducting it under the auspices of an alternate procedure in which unsuccessful bidders must submit any protests to binding arbitration.pub.contract code,et in the regulations governing protest arbitration,defendant dgs has designated a coordinator to supervise any protests to a solicitation under the program,tit.ccr,e.
while plaintiff imagistics submitted the lowest bid in the reverse auction,real party sharp bid had a higher score in the first phase.as a result,its overall score was higher,and defendant dgs issued its notice of intent to award the contract to sharp.plaintiff imagistics sent its notice of intent to protest the award on june.in its response to the plaintiff,defendant dgs reiterated the need to file a detailed written statement of protest sop no later than on july,along with a filing fee and a deposit for estimated arbitration costs.
under the pertinent regulations,a protest is filed by the submission of the sop and any exhibits specified in section a check for the oah filing fee of and the arbitration deposit to the coordinator by see ccr c on the working day after the time for written notice of intent to protest a protesting party who fails to comply with this subsection waives its right to protest.ccr a,italics added.if the sop is sent to the dgs by fax,the protesting party must remit the required deposit and filing fee to the coordinator by any reasonable means.if sending via carrier,the postmark date shall be used to determine timeliness,b.in the provisions governing the format and contents of the sop,the material portions of the solicitation must be included as exhibits,the length is limited to typed pages excluding exhibits,and a ny exhibits submitted shall be paginated,b,b,c,d.failure to comply with these provisions forfeits the right to protest,g.
the plaintiff attorney sent an associate and an assistant to the offices of defendant dgs at on july to the sop with its accompanying exhibits.they discovered that a check for the fee and deposit was not in the envelope.they told dgs employees that someone would bring them a check however,the dgs employees emphasized that was the absolute deadline for submitting a check in person.while this was taking place,the fax machine in the dgs office began to receive the plaintiff sop.however,the transmitted sop did not include any of its accompanying exhibits.a second assistant from the plaintiff attorney office arrived with a check just after the dgs office closed its doors at.the plaintiff three representatives saw an assistant deputy director of defendant dgs legal department in the hallway and attempted to persuade him to accept the check,but he refused the proffer about,dgs sent a fax to the plaintiff and its attorney notifying them that their protest was incomplete for want of a check for the fee and deposit,and therefore was terminated.dgs simultaneously faxed notice to all interested parties that the protest was now closed.
shortly before that evening,defendant dgs received a fax from the plaintiff attorney that was a copy of a cover letter for the check for the fee and deposit.on the next day july,defendant dgs received the original and the check in an envelope postmarked july.defendant dgs returned the check the same day,stating that the late submission of payment did not meet filing requirements.the plaintiff attorney also sent a letter on july to the dgs attorney in response to the july faxed notice that its protest was considered terminated.this letter was replete with criticisms chiding the dgs attorney for failing to accept the check because this was a reasonable means of delivering payment to the coordinator when filing by fax,pointing out that dgs employees were still at work after an assertion overlooking the deadline as defined in the regulations,and complaining of the brusk sic and inappropriate handling of this matter.defendant dgs awarded the contract to real party sharp on july.
on july,the plaintiff filed the present petition with a supporting memorandum of points and authorities.at the initial hearing in this matter two days later,the trial court issued an order bifurcating the issues,with the matter of the timeliness of the plaintiff protest to be considered first.it directed the responding parties to file briefs by on july for the july hearing.
defendant dgs and real party sharp filed answers responding to allegations involving these issues on july,along with their opposition briefs,but apparently only real party sharp filed these before defendant dgs included declarations from several of its employees as exhibits to its answer.in its reply,plaintiff imagistics asserted that the failure of defendant dgs to file its answer by the court purported deadline meant that all the allegations of the petition must be deemed uncontroverted as to defendant dgs,and thus the trial court must disregard the declarations filed with the untimely answer.
as noted at the outset,the superior court concluded that strict compliance with requirements for filing a protest was necessary in the context of awards of major contracts subject to the alternative protest procedure.in doing so,it cited policy statements in attachments to defendant dgs declarations,therefore implicitly overruling plaintiff imagistics objection to the answer applying the principle of strict compliance,it ruled that the plaintiff could not appear in person with the sop and exhibits but without a check as required under ccr a,or fax the sop and mail a check postmarked on the deadline but fail to fax the exhibits as required under ccr b.the court rejected the argument that the plaintiff could aggregate partial compliance with each of two provisions into a species of actual compliance.it also rejected an argument that the failure explicitly to refer to the need to fax exhibits in the latter regulation meant that it was unnecessary to fax them.it filed a transcript of its oral remarks as part of its order.
real party sharp filed its supplementary answer to plaintiff imagistics remaining allegations on august.the plaintiff filed a memorandum of points and authorities on the remaining issues,raising the issue yet again of the failure of defendant dgs to answer the remaining allegations.defendant dgs eventually filed its answer and opposition brief in,along with additional declarations.it asserted that its answer was not due until the hearing noticed for october.
at the hearing,the court framed the threshold issue as whether a bidder could simply evade the need to exhaust the administrative remedy for protesting bids through the device of calling itself a taxpayer and bringing an action in that capacity to determine whether the award of a contract was a waste of public funds.in rejecting this argument,the court stated that it would have needed to resolve this issue of law regardless of whether defendant dgs had filed a timely answer,and therefore did not expressly resolve whether or not the answer was timely.the court rejected other theories to excuse the plaintiff failure to exhaust the administrative remedy as being an afterthought mechanism that had not been part of the gist of the petition as filed.the court ruling again included a transcript of its remarks at the conclusion of the hearing.
discussion 
citing the unquestioned principle that a failure to answer a writ petition admits the truth of its allegations reis biggs unified school dist.th,d,plaintiff imagistics renews its arguments that the trial court should have ignored the answers of defendant dgs because they were untimely.it asserts ipse dixit that the superior court did not have any authority to accept any evidence into the record controverting the factual allegations in the writ petition.
plaintiff imagistics is incorrect.even if the time to answer had expired,a trial court has discretion to decide whether to strike a answer.cuddahy gragg.plaintiff imagistics has not demonstrated any abuse of this discretion in the present matter.
plaintiff imagistics contends that it strictly complied with the regulations governing a bid protest under a reasonable reading of them.in the alternative,it argues that it substantially complied with the regulations without providing any analysis of the superior court reasoning in favor of strict compliance.independent roofing contractors california apprenticeship council th,d duty of appellant to demonstrate error in trial court reasoning.
taking up the latter issue first,the regulation does not grant the protest coordinator any discretion to accept a late filing rather,it specifically calls for forfeiture of a protest for noncompliance.under these circumstances,the doctrine of substantial compliance is inapplicable,as a court does not have the power to issue a writ of mandate to accept a late filing.barnes wong th,d ordinance not allowing discretionary acceptance of late filing in absence of good faith mistake regarding deadline represents sound policy avoiding uneven and inconsistent administration of preelection procedures and is the most reliable way to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and equally no discretion to abuse or any ministerial duty to petitioner to accept late filing,so mandate will not lie sonoma county nuclear free zone superior court d.no abuse of discretion in setting deadline no discretion to ignore deadline,so mandate will not lie.
plaintiff imagistics does not appear to argue that it satisfied the requirements for personal delivery of its sop,other than through a belated invocation of government code section after it had filed its opening brief.this statute provides,in pertinent part,if a remittance to cover a payment required by law to be made to the state or to a state agency on or before a specified date is sent through the mail,it shall be deemed received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped upon the envelope containing the remittance even if we were to exercise our discretion to allow plaintiff imagistics to raise a legal argument for the first time on appeal to obtain a reversal see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,the statute does not add anything to the analysis.it neither expressly nor through any reasonable implication creates some bifurcated procedure for filing under which an agency is obligated to accept documents in person for filing on the final day that are unaccompanied by a required fee,so long as the fee is separately mailed that day.it is not as if plaintiff imagistics were attempting to assert the timeliness of a protest mailed with all necessary documents and fees on july.
this leaves what the trial court found to be a tenable but ultimately unacceptable argument based on the imprecise wording of the protest provisions.as noted above,the regulation that governs the content and format of an sop distinguishes between the sop itself and any exhibits.ccr.the subdivision generally prescribing the time to file explicitly refers both to the sop and its exhibits ccr a,but the subdivision governing fax filings mentions only the sop,b.from this plaintiff imagistics derives an intent to permit fax filings without exhibits given the legibility issues that often arise with faxed documents at the party risk of the matter being decided in the absence of the supporting evidence.given that the entire purpose of the alternate protest procedure is to filter out frivolous protests expeditiously,and that the coordinator must make a preliminary determination that a protest is frivolous by five working days after receipt ccr b,we can not discern any rational basis for allowing those who choose to fax their protest to file exhibits at some unspecified future time.this would either delay the determination of the coordinator or require a determination without all the pertinent evidence.finally,an sop without exhibits is contrary to specific provisions for the contents of an sop,which require at least the material portions of the solicitation as exhibits.ccr b,b.we therefore conclude that the lack of an explicit reference to exhibits is merely an unintentional ellipsis.
finally,the plaintiff contends in cursory manner that defendant dgs was not prejudiced from the failure to fax the exhibits,because dgs was in possession of all the exhibits prior to the deadline as a result of hand delivery.plaintiff imagistics fails to supply any authority for considering an absence of prejudice in the context of strict compliance.moreover,this assertion disregards the massive number of contracts and proposals that defendant dgs administers and apparently is premised on the belief that it would be a simple matter to coordinate piecemeal protests presented in person and by fax.we reject this theory.
plaintiff imagistics suggests two established bases excuse it as an unsuccessful bidder from the need to exhaust the administrative protest remedy.it relies on the doctrine of futility,and on purported ways in which the administrative procedures violate due process.
the entirety of the plaintiff argument on futility claims that historical statistics demonstrate the alternate protest procedure is effectively a sham and resort to it is ineluctably an exercise in futility.this exception,however,is a very narrow one.county of contra costa state of california d.unless a litigant can demonstrate that the administrative agency has indicated its predetermined decision in the litigant particular case,it does not apply even if the outcome in other similar cases is adverse to the litigant position.id.at.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,economic empowerment foundation quackenbush th,d which summarizes various cases where a litigant produced the necessary facts.as a result,the plaintiff resort solely to the historical statistics contained either in his declaration or in the decisions of which he requests we take judicial notice is unavailing 
if an administrative remedy fails to satisfy the standards of due process,the exhaustion requirement is excused.bockover perko th,d.
the plaintiff first contends that it violates due process for the regulations to specify the same limited judicial review of protest arbitration that applies to contractual arbitration awards.ccr.it argues that its situation is akin to bayscene resident negotiators bayscene mobilehome park th,d.the case is inapposite,involving a party compelled to participate in binding arbitration under threat of criminal prosecution.id.at,d.it is only under such compulsory circumstances that the resulting arbitration award might violate due process if judicial review were confined to the narrow grounds for contractual arbitration.id.at,d.the case expressly distinguishes parties who voluntarily agree to subject themselves to arbitration as a condition of bidding on a state contract.id.at,d.
the plaintiff next asserts that the administrative remedy violates due process because the protest coordinator and the oah are aligned with defendant dgs the former being an employee and the latter being a subordinate agency.however,plaintiff imagistics does not provide
