background 
the following description is based on the complaint filed by biltmore and the undisputed facts.for simplicity we confine this description to issues pertinent to this appeal.
biltmore participated in an fcc auction for a broadcast license in biltmore forest,north carolina.as part of the implementation of its mission to achieve diversification of ownership,fcc rules limit the cognizable interest in licenses that one person or single entity is allowed to control.see.the fcc requires submission of a family media certification to determine the extent to which media interests owned by immediate family members are subject to common influence or control.see clarification of commission policies regarding spousal attribution.under existing policy,applicants for new construction permits and for transfers or assignments of licenses are required to report the broadcast interests of all immediate family members parents,siblings and offspring,as well as spouses of any party to the application.id.at.in addition,applicants must file exhibits to these applications,which provide full disclosure regarding the nature and extent of such familial interests.id.
the fcc rules themselves do not specify at which stage in the proceedings the required certification must be submitted.however,the public notice for this license auction addressed the question.biltmore ii.at citing notice and filing requirements for auction of am,fm,tv,lptv,and fm and tv translator construction permits scheduled for september,hereinafter public notice.the official public notice announcing the auction required,as part of the application,submission of a certification of media interests held by family members,stating that all applicants must provide the information set forth in this section.at emphasis omitted.the public notice also stated that b idders must certify compliance with the commission policies relating to media interests of immediate family members.id.one of the instructions warned that f ailure to submit required information by the resubmission date will result in dismissal of the application and inability to participate in the auction.id.at emphasis omitted.
ultimately,liberty productions,liberty was the highest bidder and biltmore was the second highest bidder.biltmore ii.at.unlike biltmore,liberty did not file a family media certification prior to the auction.id.at.however,liberty filed its family media certification within a month of the auction conclusion.id.at.
prior to the conclusion of an auction,are precluded from contesting the ability of other to participate in that auction.id.at.t he commission concluded that the fairer and more expeditious approach would be to resolve any outstanding qualification issues after the auction.implementation of section j of the communications act,see also id.at we deny reconsideration of our determination to defer until after the auction basic qualifications issues.
after the auction conclusion,in administrative proceedings before the fcc,biltmore argued that liberty should have been disqualified for failure to submit a timely family media certification and that the license should have been awarded to biltmore as the next highest bidder.biltmore forest broad.fm,fcc,biltmore i.biltmore noted that b of the fcc regulations provides that t o participate in an auction,all applicants must timely submit applications,along with all required certifications,information and exhibits,pursuant to the provisions of section a and any commission public notices.final,biltmore,at,wl.july,emphases in brief.the public notice stated that all applicants must provide the family media certification and that f ailure to submit required information by the resubmission date will result in dismissal of the application and inability to participate in the auction.at emphasis omitted.
biltmore argued,moreover,that b of the fcc rules also required disqualification.that provision stated any application that does not contain all of the certifications required pursuant to this section is unacceptable for filing and can not be corrected subsequent to the applicable filing deadline.the application will be dismissed with prejudice and the upfront payment,if paid,will be returned.b biltmore theory was,thus,that the public notice together with the fcc rules required that liberty submit a family ownership certification together with its original application and that the fcc could not allow this defect to be cured after the completion of the bidding process.in re liberty,adopted april,released may.biltmore did not raise a contract claim to the fcc.
in a memorandum opinion and order adopted on april,the fcc held that liberty was not disqualified due to the late submission of the family ownership certification,granted liberty application for a construction permit,and dismissed biltmore mutually exclusive application.id.at.the fcc first addressed whether b of its rules required disqualification.id.at.the fcc found that the fcc rules do not expressly provide that a application omitting this particular certification is unacceptable for filing and will be dismissed with prejudice,with no opportunity to supply the missing certification after the filing deadline.id.the fcc concluded that section b of the rules requires the dismissal with prejudice,without the opportunity to correct after the applicable filing deadline,only of a narrow category of information.id.the family ownership certification does not fall into that narrow category.id.at.the fcc also concluded that b does not require disqualification.even though b provides that applicants must comply with any commission public notices in order to participate in an auction,it does not provide notice that the omission of a family media certification will result in the dismissal of the application with no opportunity to amend.id.at.in addition,the public notice does not expressly state that the omission of this particular certification will render the application defective,such that it can not later be amended.id.at.rather,it is merely a general admonishment which echoes the general requirements applicable to all information.id.at.fairness demands explicit notice for a severe sanction,such as the dismissal of an application.id.at.this public notice does not provide sufficient notice that a application not containing the familial certification must be dismissed.id.
biltmore appealed the fcc licensing decision to the district of columbia circuit,pursuant to b.biltmore ii.at.biltmore argued that liberty should have been disqualified.biltmore urged that the fcc interpretation conflicted with the plain language of its rules,and that,even if the rules were ambiguous,the fcc interpretation should not be given deference because the fcc stood to gain monetarily by the interpretation.
the district of columbia circuit affirmed the fcc award of the license to liberty.biltmore i,at.the court held that the fcc was correct that a family certification is not one of the specifically required documents under b,which would require immediate disqualification without an opportunity to amend.id.at.deferring to the agency interpretation,which was controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,the court held that the fcc did not act unreasonably in determining that neither its rules nor the public notice required the dismissal of liberty application for failure to timely file a family media certification.id.the court stated that the fcc need not disqualify liberty after the auction on the basis of an omission that,according to the public
