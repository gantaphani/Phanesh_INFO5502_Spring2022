appellant abraham gale gale worked for ten weeks for nec,pbnec.after being fired by pbnec,gale filed a qui tam action against that company under the false claims act fca,alleging that it had committed fraud by selling computers to the government as new even though they contained used parts.the government declined to intervene in gale fca suit,but nonetheless initiated criminal and civil investigations into pbnec allegedly fraudulent practices.the united states attorney allowed gale to review documents obtained during at least one of those investigations,as well as during its investigation into one of pbnec,appellee zenith data systems,zenith.after learning from the government documents he saw in the office of the united states attorney,as well as from oral disclosures by government attorneys in that office,that zenith was probably involved in the same type of fraud as pbnec,gale filed a separate fca action against zenith.the government,pbnec,and zenith subsequently reached a proposed settlement to which gale objected.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court held that it did not have jurisdiction over gale fca action against zenith and dismissed the complaint.gale appeals that dismissal.
we agree with the district court that it lacked jurisdiction over gale zenith action,and we affirm.
gale was employed for ten weeks by pbnec as manager of the computer department.he was fired during his probationary period,in december.three months later,gale wrote a letter to the government alleging that pbnec had committed fraud against the government.pbnec sold to the government computers that it claimed were new and for which it charged prices.gale alleged that in fact those computers contained used parts.gale mentioned only pbnec in his letter.he made no mention of zenith,a company that had an alliance agreement or joint manufacturing agreement with pbnec during and 
gale filed a qui tam complaint under the fca against pbnec in april.although the government investigated pbnec and proposed a settlement,it never intervened in gale action.at about the time gale filed his fca complaint against pbnec,compaq computer corporation compaq sued pbnec,claiming unfair competition due to pbnec alleged practice of selling computers with used parts as new.during discovery in its suit,compaq questioned pbnec witnesses about the relationship between pbnec and zenith.in august and september,the united states attorney office usao discussed the government pbnec investigation with lawyers for compaq,and in september the usao initiated an investigation of zenith.the air force office of special investigation osi also launched an investigation of zenith at the request of the usao.in the course of these investigations,the usao obtained a substantial amount of information about zenith sales practices.
although gale was not an active participant in the pbnec investigations,the usao allowed him to examine documents that it had obtained.from january through may,gale reviewed pbnec documents that government lawyers had obtained through a department of defense subpoena issued to pbnec.those documents contained information raising the possibility that zenith had committed fraud on the government similar to that committed by pbnec.government lawyers state that they also orally informed gale that there was a possibility that some zenith computers sold to the government had contained used pbnec parts.
in april,gale filed a separate qui tam action under the false claims act,this time against zenith.in october,the government,pbnec,and zenith proposed a settlement,to which gale objected,that would have disposed of both cases.zenith asserts that gale demanded an million payment in return for his agreement to the settlement,and that the other parties refused this offer.
in march,the district court held that it had jurisdiction over gale fca case against pbnec,and it held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether it had jurisdiction over his case against zenith.gale maintained in the district court that he had first seen the documents he had reviewed in the united states attorney office during his employment at pbnec,and that the government had needed his help to make sense of the information they contained.the district court found that gale was not credible.among other things,it found that gale did not know about the alleged zenith fraud until he started to review documents at the united states attorney office overall,it is clear to this court that even if some form of zenith fraud did occur,gale was not aware of it from his experiences at packard bell.gale did not learn about the alleged zenith fraud from any independent investigation he conducted after his employment at packard bell but prior to his review of documents at the attorney office.
the district court held that the government disclosure to gale of documents and information in the packard bell case which contained allegations or transactions about the zenith fraud was a public disclosure pursuant to e a.it further held that gale was not an original source of the information within the meaning of e a,and under our holding in united states ex rel.barajas northrop,cir.it then dismissed gale fca suit against zenith,holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the case.
the government settled gale fca suit against pbnec for million,and gale recovered a relator share of fifteen percent of that settlement.gale appeals the dismissal of his fca suit against zenith.
the false claims act is a tool to fight fraud on the government.under the fca,the government or a private party may bring a civil action against a party allegedly committing such fraud.a,b.the qui tam provisions of the pertaining to private incentives for insiders with knowledge of fraud on the government to come forward with that knowledge.d.if a private party brings a qui tam action,she does so as a relator,on behalf of the government,which may choose to intervene in the action.if the relator is successful,she is entitled to a share of the recovery,whether or not the government intervenes.d.
the compensation available to relators,however,encourages parasitic lawsuits in which those with no independent knowledge of fraud use information already available to the government to reap rewards for themselves without exposing any previously unknown fraud.the fca reflects congress attempt to find the golden mean between adequate incentives for insiders with genuinely valuable information and discouragement of opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant information to contribute of their own.united states ex rel.devlin california,cir quoting united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.
in earlier versions of the fca,the statute was abused by qui tam suits brought by private plaintiffs who had no independent knowledge of fraud.see,united states ex rel.marcus hess.in marcus,the supreme court held that a private plaintiff might bring a qui tam action under the fca,as it then existed,even though his knowledge of fraud was gained from a government criminal indictment.id.at.in reaction to marcus,congress amended the fca in to bar jurisdiction over qui tam suits that were based on evidence or information the government had when the action was brought.b superseded.this amendment led to unintended consequences,however,as it deprived courts of jurisdiction over suits in which the relators had given their information to the government before filing their claims.see,united states ex rel.wisconsin dean,cir.
congress amended the fca in to its current form in an attempt to achieve the proper balance.the relevant text provides 
a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on
