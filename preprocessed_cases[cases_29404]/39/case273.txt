kenneth beck and the city of upland,california,engaged for months in an escalating series of disputes arising from beck protests against a city contract granted to one of his competitors.in the incident that gave rise to this case,beck was arrested six days after he confronted two city police officers over what he felt to be unfair treatment by the city.beck arrest was pursuant to a warrant for two felony violations of a california statute prohibiting threats of violence made to deter police officers from performing their duties.the warrant,we did the state courts considering the criminal entirely without probable cause.all charges against beck were dismissed.
beck maintains that his first and fourth amendment rights were violated when he was arrested and imprisoned without probable cause for his protected speech and then forced to incur the cost of defending himself against the criminal charges.the question we consider is whether beck subsequent suit under for these constitutional violations and for various state law causes of action against the city of upland,its police department,and the officers who engineered his arrest,police chief martin thouvenell and sergeant jeff mendenhall,may go forward to trial.the district court held that it may not,because a san bernardino county prosecutor authorized the filing of a criminal complaint before the police officers obtained an arrest warrant,thereby acting as an intervening cause of beck injuries and cutting off liability under and california state law immunized the officers.see smiddy varney,smiddy i cir discussing the liability of the arresting officers in such circumstances cal.civ.code a state law immunity.
after the district court decision,the united states supreme court decided hartman moore,d,clarifying the elements of a constitutional tort under for retaliatory arrest or prosecution.we hold,relying in part on hartman,that causation issues arising from the criminal complaint do not preclude beck case,and that california immunity law does not either.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment against beck.
background 
a.the rubble removal contract and the zoning investigation 
early in,beck heard about a business opportunity from city officials upland was planning construction work in town,and there would be a significant amount of rubble to remove and recycle beck thought his business,dineen trucking,was a good fit for the job it had been operating in town since and often did rubble removal and recycling work.beck believed the rubble had significant resale value and would have been willing to remove it for free in exchange for the right to resell it.so beck was surprised when,on september,the city council awarded a contract,without public notice or comment,to an competitor,intravaia rock sand.because the city normally put all projects over out to bid,beck suspected that there were irregularities in the contracting process.
acting on his belief,beck called the mayor of upland the next day and told him that he planned to raise his concerns about the contract at the next city council meeting,on september.on the,ron willemsen,president of intravaia,visited beck and confronted him about the contract.soon after willemsen visit,the mayor called beck and asked him not to speak publicly about the contract.that night,instead of speaking at the city council meeting,beck met with willemsen,chief thouvenell,and the city public works director and was advised to work out a deal with willemsen to share the contract.as it turned out,the two were not able to agree,and no deal was reached.
instead,beck took his grievances to the city manager,michael milhiser,this time successfully.in early october,the city backed out of the intravaia contract.at about the same time,willemsen again came to beck office and promised to have every agency down on top of him because of his efforts to block willemsen contract.
on november,a zoning complaint letter arrived at upland city hall,sent by a law firm that represented intravaia.the letter suggested that rubble piles on beck land,which he maintained as part of his business and which included rubble resulting from an earlier city project,were out of compliance with zoning changes that had occurred in.the rubble piles had been there since at least the early,but beck had not previously been informed of any zoning problems.police officer michael ollis was assigned to investigate the complaint.
the decision to investigate was unusual.at the city council meeting at which the zoning changes were adopted,business owners had raised concerns over enforcement against existing nonconforming businesses in beck part of the city and were assured that their existing uses of their properties were not threatened.upland senior planner had indicated that she was not aware of one single incidence sic where the city ha d enforced against a nonconforming use existing at the time a new zoning ordinance was passed such uses had all been allowed to continue,as long as they continue.also,the city director of community planning confirmed at that meeting that the city policy was to enforce zoning ordinances only against new property uses.
ollis and sergeant mendenhall,along with the city engineer,arrived at dineen trucking to serve beck with a notice of zoning violations signed by chief thouvenell on january.beck had not previously known of the investigation,and the ensuing discussion was heated.beck believed the investigation to be retaliatory,and summarily ended the meeting by ordering the three city officials to leave his property.
b.the confrontation 
the next week,beck and his wife brenda beck went to a party celebrating the opening of a local bank.as they were leaving the event,beck saw chief thouvenell and sergeant mendenhall standing by the buffet.beck decided it was the right time to go over there and talk to thouvenell about the way the city was treating him.
after saying hello,beck bluntly told thouvenell to get ollis off my ass.in the course of the brief ensuing discussion,thouvenell at one point retorted,ken,we should have taken care of you a long time ago,to which beck responded you do know who you dealing with.the conversation ended there,and both the becks and the officers left the function.
both chief thouvenell and sergeant mendenhall later declared that they believed beck was threatening their position or employment as police officers.neither ever indicated any belief that beck had threatened them with violence.
the day after the incident at the bank opening,the upland chamber of commerce held a meeting triggered in part by the zoning investigation of beck business.chief thouvenell,sergeant mendenhall,and the city manager,milhiser,attended the meeting.they were quite exercised over beck statements of the night before.milhiser,for example,maintained that beck had been way out of line and very offensive,and said that thouvenell had exercised a lot of restraint in not hooking up beck that night.and thouvenell told the chamber to back off from this whole beck issue,leave it alone,stay out of their way,and warned the chamber members that he would make contact with the attorney general office if they persisted in their interference.
c.the police report and the complaint 
even before the chamber meeting,sergeant mendenhall and chief thouvenell were preparing to take action against beck.immediately after the confrontation at the bank,mendenhall told thouvenell that he believed beck had violated a criminal law against threatening police officers.thouvenell told him to look into the matter.
mendenhall did so and prepared a police report on the incident.thouvenell then indicated that mendenhall should present the report to the district attorney office,which he did on february.the report describes mendenhall impressions of the conversation with beck at the bank opening party and contains statements from other witnesses.the report does not contain thouvenell statement to beck.
sergeant mendenhall also submitted a form to the district attorney providing basic information on beck and the witnesses.at the top of the form,under,mendenhall wrote pc threatening an officer.california penal code criminalizes,in pertinent part,attempts,by means of any threat or violence,to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon such officer by law.the offense may be charged either as a felony or as a misdemeanor.mendenhall circled felony rather than misdemeanor on the form.
deputy district attorney joseph gaetano reviewed the police report.he conducted no additional investigation,factual or legal,and later stated he suppose s he generated a criminal complaint on his computer.the program he uses to do so allows him simply to click a box to format the complaint and to select the charge all other information is typed in by a clerk.he had the complaint,charging beck with two counts of felony violation of,ready for mendenhall to sign that day.
in a deposition concerning his decision,gaetano testified that mendenhall did not tell him to prosecute beck alleged crime as a felony and did not tell him to prosecute beck as a favor to the police department.gaetano asserted privilege,however,when asked whether his decision to charge beck with a felony had been swayed by the fact that felony was circled on the police report,and again when asked if he felt any pressure to file charges against beck.
a superior court judge issued a warrant for beck arrest shortly thereafter,after receiving the complaint and a declaration by sergeant mendenhall in support of the warrant.the judge received no document signed by gaetano before he issued the warrant.
d.the arrest and subsequent judicial proceedings 
two days after the warrant issued,three officers,each in his or her own vehicle,pulled up in front of dineen trucking.beck was at his desk.wearing bulletproof vests and with weapons unharnessed,the officers entered beck office,arrested him,and handcuffed him.the officers took the handcuffed beck outside and waited with him at the front of his business.sergeant mendenhall had arrived but remained off the property,watching the arrest from his car.after half an hour,another police car arrived to take beck to the police station and then to jail.beck spent five hours in jail before he posted bail,which was set at.
at beck preliminary hearing the judge described himself as troubled by this case on many levels,not the least of which is that it been filed as a felony.regarding the standard of proof in a preliminary hearing as minimal,the judge allowed the case to go forward but urged the defense to challenge the court ruling via.california penal code allows a court to set aside an indictment or information for,among other things,lack of probable cause.
beck lawyer did file a motion,and a second judge set aside the charges.citing people superior court of san francisco anderson,d,which requires a threat of violence to support a threat violation of,the judge held that obviously,beck statement does not contain any element of violence that i can find,and that there was no indication of any immediate threat of physical violence whatsoever.he dismissed the criminal case against beck.a few months later,upland voluntarily dismissed the zoning charges against beck as well 
e.the litigation 
beck then brought this case.in addition to the federal cause of action,beck alleged eight causes of action under state law.the allegations here at issue were that beck was falsely arrested,unlawfully detained,and falsely imprisoned in violation of his fourth amendment rights and that the arrest was perpetrated in retaliation for beck exercise of his first amendment rights against defendant,martin thouvenell,as well as for whistle blowing on the intravaia contract of beck state law causes of action,the second negligence,third assault and battery,fourth false imprisonment,and fifth intentional infliction of emotional distress are the subject of this appeal.beck sought damages for the costs he incurred in defending himself,and also sought punitive and compensatory damages,attorneys fees,and costs.
the officers claimed qualified immunity,arguing that,on all the federal constitutional causes of action,smiddy i immunized them from liability for harm suffered after the complaint was filed,and also asserted state law statutory immunity.on november,the district court granted summary judgment against beck on his causes of action,holding that,under smiddy i,gaetano decision to prepare the complaint was an independent and intervening cause that immunized the upland defendants from liability for any damages suffered by beck as a result of his subsequent arrest and detention.the court further held that,even if beck could overcome smiddy i,his statements at the party provided probable cause to support the warrant.finally,the court held beck state law causes of action precluded by california statutory immunity 
this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review and analytic framework 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,making all justifiable factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.blankenhorn city of orange,cir.if a rational trier of fact might resolve the issue in favor of the nonmoving party,summary judgment must be denied.id.alteration omitted.
our analysis of the qualified immunity defense in a suit under follows the familiar framework of saucier katz,d,asking first whether the officers conduct violated a federal right and,second,whether the right was clearly established at the time.see blankenhorn,at see also malley briggs,d applying the qualified immunity standard in a false arrest case duran city of douglas,cir applying the standard in a first amendment retaliatory arrest case in this instance,however,the officers,relying on smiddy i,maintain that they can not be held liable for violating beck first or fourth amendment rights by arresting him,because an independent prosecutor authorized prosecution before the officers sought and obtained an arrest warrant 
we disagree.we hold that,on the summary judgment record,beck has shown,with regard to either of the asserted constitutional violations,that the prosecutor actions were not an intervening cause shielding the officers from liability,albeit for different reasons that the officers lack qualified immunity and that the officers may not avail themselves of the california statutory immunity they assert.
b.the presumption of prosecutorial independence and the causation problem 
a prosecutor independent judgment may break the chain of causation between the unconstitutional actions of other officials and the harm suffered by a constitutional tort plaintiff.see hartman,d discussing the issue in the first amendment context smiddy i,at discussing the issue in the fourth amendment context.put in traditional tort terms,the prosecutor independent decision can be a superseding or intervening cause of a constitutional tort plaintiff injury,precluding suit against the officials who made an arrest or procured a prosecution.see restatement second of torts et discussing causation problems in tort cases.
the method we have prescribed for addressing this causation question in fourth suits differs somewhat from the method the supreme court recently set out in the context of first amendment retaliatory prosecution suits we first discuss both methods in some detail before explaining how they apply to beck appeal.
we first consider our fourth amendment causation law,in which we have used a approach.in smiddy i,a false arrest case,we adopted an evidentiary presumption,see galbraith county of santa clara,cir,that the prosecutor filing a criminal complaint exercised independent judgment in determining that probable cause for an accused arrest exist ed,thereby breaking the chain of causation between an arrest and prosecution and immunizing investigating officers from damages suffered after the complaint was filed.smiddy i,at see also smiddy varney,smiddy ii cir discussing the presumption.the smiddy i presumption may be rebutted if the plaintiff shows that the independence of the prosecutor judgment has been compromised.smiddy i,at.
smiddy i provided examples of circumstances in which the presumption of independent judgment will be considered rebutted,emphasizing that t hese examples are not intended to be exclusive.id.at.the enunciated circumstances,elaborated upon in later cases,include situations in which the prosecutor was pressured by police or was given false information,id.at the police act ed maliciously or with reckless disregard for the rights of an arrested person,id.at the prosecutor relied on the police investigation and arrest when he filed the complaint instead of making an independent judgment on the existence of probable cause for the arrest,id or the officers otherwise engaged in wrongful or bad faith conduct that was actively instrumental in causing the initiation of legal proceedings,awabdy city of adelanto,cir.once the plaintiff has introduced evidence to rebut the presumption,the burden remains on the defendant to prove that an independent intervening cause cuts off his tort liability.smiddy i,at.critically for this case,i f for reasons of privilege or otherwise the relevant evidence to challenge the presumption is not available,no presumption will arise,id.at,and the defendant has the burden to show that the prosecutor judgment was independent 
having described our approach in fourth amendment arrest cases where a prosecutor actions have intervened,we turn to the supreme court recent resolution of the similar causation issues arising from prosecutorial actions in first amendment retaliatory prosecution cases.the court set out its approach in hartman,published,as we have noted,after the district court decision in this case.see at.discussing the causation problem hartman addressed an allegedly retaliatory prosecution in which the plaintiff contended that postal inspectors retaliated against his constitutionally protected speech by procuring his prosecution.id.at.the plaintiff sought to hold the inspectors liable for the prosecution.id.the court noted that the prosecutor presence in the causal chain meant that the requisite causation between the defendant official retaliatory animus and the plaintiff injury is usually more complex than it is in other retaliation cases,id.at,because e vidence of an official animus does not necessarily show that the official induced the action of a prosecutor who would not have pressed charges otherwise.id.at.this difficulty,coupled with the longstanding presumption of regularity accorded to prosecutorial decisionmaking,and the fact that it would be unrealistic to expect a prosecutor to reveal his mind,id.at,gave the court considerable pause in determining the circumstances in which a plaintiff alleging a prosecution can bridge the gap created by the independent judgment of the prosecutor between the government agent motive and the prosecutor action.see also id.at.citing smiddy i as an example of the causation problem.
considering the dilemma created in a first amendment retaliatory prosecution case by the prosecutor intervening decision to prosecute,the court developed a,objective standard as a substitute for inquiries into the prosecutor subjective state of mind.noting that there will always be a distinct body of highly valuable circumstantial evidence available and apt to prove or disprove retaliatory causation,namely evidence showing whether there was or was not probable cause to bring the criminal charge,id.at,the court held that a retaliatory motive on the part of an official urging prosecution combined with an absence of probable cause supporting the prosecutor decision to go forward are reasonable grounds to suspend the presumption of regularity behind the charging decision,id.at.so,under hartman,if a plaintiff can prove that the officials secured his arrest or prosecution without probable cause and were motivated by retaliation against the plaintiff protected speech,the plaintiff first amendment suit can go forward 
we see no reason to limit hartman probable cause requirement solely to first amendment retaliatory arrest and prosecution cases.rather,its logic extends to fourth amendment false arrest cases like beck,at least to the extent that the plaintiff must prove the absence of probable cause to rebut the presumption of independent prosecutorial judgment,when a prosecutor actions are interposed between the actions of investigating officials and the arrest.ordinarily,however,the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the absence of probable cause anyway in a fourth amendment false arrest case.proving lack of probable cause is usually essential to demonstrating that the plaintiff fourth amendment rights were violated.as a practical matter,consequently,hartman will rarely add to the plaintiff ultimate burden in a false arrest case.
hartman and smiddy i 
more difficult is the question whether hartman requires that we overrule smiddy i entirely.smiddy i requires that plaintiffs bear a burden of proof,beyond proving the absence of probable cause,to overcome the presumption of prosecutorial independence.there is considerable tension between the approach taken by the court in hartman and the approach set out in smiddy i and the cases following from it.after hartman,it is questionable that smiddy i detailed evidentiary inquiry into the independence of the prosecutor judgment should still be employed to address the causal chain problem in fourth amendment cases.the supreme court simpler,approach may be all that is required with regard to the causation issue in the fourth amendment context.
the causal problem is,of course,essentially identical in both contexts,and smiddy i requires an inquiry into the prosecutor actual mental processes to resolve it,an approach decisively rejected in hartman.hartman does require retaliatory animus,as well as the absence of probable cause,as elements of the constitutional tort there at issue.but the retaliatory animus requirement arises out of the first constitutional tort alleged in hartman.proof of the absence of probable cause,it appears,is the sole factor necessary to resolve the chain of causation problem.applying that reasoning,it could be held that that sole factor would also be sufficient in the fourth amendment false arrest context,where the absence of probable cause is the substantive lynchpin of the constitutional tort and must be proven in any event 
but hartman did not involve a fourth cause of action.nor did hartman explain how its reasoning should be applied in such cases.we are mindful that,as a panel,our ability to overrule circuit precedent is limited.see miller gammie,cir en banc.although the reasoning we have outlined above has a great deal to recommend it,whether hartman is clearly irreconcilable with smiddy i is unclear,see id.at hartman addressed itself only to the details specific to cases,at.as it turns out,beck can satisfy both hartman and smiddy i on the present record.we therefore need not decide whether hartman overruled smiddy i,and do not do so.
causation in first and fourth amendment cases after hartman 
to summarize we hold,first,that to the degree smiddy i could be understood under our case law to apply to a first retaliatory arrest or prosecution cause of action,smiddy i is inconsistent with hartman and can not stand.in such cases,we will not separately inquire,through application of a presumption or otherwise,into the prosecutor actual state of mind.instead,a showing of a retaliatory motive on the part of an official urging prosecution combined with an absence of probable cause supporting the prosecutor decision will suffice to rebut the presumption of regularity and settle the causation issue.hartman,at.
second,in any constitutional tort case,including fourth cases,in which a prosecutor has instigated a prosecution,it is necessary,if not sufficient,that a plaintiff seeking to sue officials alleged to be responsible for the arrest or prosecution show the absence of probable cause.if that were not so,smiddy i would be irreconcilable with hartman.see miller,at 
third,we do not overrule smiddy i rebuttable presumption approach in the fourth amendment context,leaving the question whether it should be overruled for a case in which the answer matters.instead,we demonstrate that beck survives summary judgment even if smiddy i does apply.
to implement our approach,we address beck first and fourth amendment causes of action separately.but,as the causes of action share the common requirement that beck show that probable cause for his arrest was absent,we first address that issue and hold that probable cause was,indeed,lacking.
we next hold that beck has satisfied hartman,preserving his first amendment cause of action,because he has alleged and shown retaliatory animus under two distinct theories,both of which are viable on the present summary judgment record.see blankenhorn,at.turning to the fourth amendment cause of action,we observe that the prosecutor,gaetano,asserted privilege rather than testifying as to whether he felt pressure from the police to make his charging decision and whether he was influenced by the police officers felony submission.critical evidence necessary to rebut the smiddy i presumption of independence is therefore unavailable,and,under the express language of smiddy i itself,beck is not required to rebut the presumption of prosecutorial independence.in the absence of the presumption,a rational jury could well conclude that the officers had not met their burden to show an independent intervening cause cuts off their tort liability.smiddy i,at.beck fourth amendment cause of action therefore also survives.
beck constitutional causes of action 
absence of probable cause 
we have little difficulty concluding that there was no probable cause to arrest beck.as we have noted,beck was arrested for threatening the officers,in violation of california penal code.that provision may be violated by attempting to deter executive officers from their duties by threat or violence.cal.penal code emphasis added see also in re,d.
to assure that the statute does not violate the first amendment by sanctioning constitutionally protected challenges to police officers activities,see city of houston,hill,d,california courts adopted a narrowing construction.under that construction,adopted as early as,the statute threat provision is applicable only to threat s of unlawful violence used in an attempt to deter an officer.in re manuel,cal th,d,see also anderson,d.same.
as a result of this limiting construction,the threats that have been held to violate have been unmistakably threats of violence,including me and my home boys are going to start killing you and your friends,in re manuel g,cal th at,d,i tired of you guys fucking with us,and you better watch out,we going to start knocking you guys off,we get your house.we get your cars.you ca be with your family hours a day,in re,d at.and i am going to kill you.this is a threat.you dead.people hines,cal th,d.
beck statements bear scant resemblance to those that have been held to violate.in the context of a heated discussion over zoning violations at a civic function,beck told chief thouvenell that he did know who he was dealing with.at worst,if we suppose that the more version of beck comments that the officers recall is accurate,beck may also have sworn and told the officers to back off.regardless of the version of his statements we consider,beck could not have been understood in context to threaten violence.in fact,both officers so declared,maintaining only that they thought he was threatening their job security.
we conclude,as did the state court deciding beck motion,that there was no probable cause to arrest beck for a violation of,much less for a felony violation of that statute.he has therefore made the probable cause showing necessary to support both his first and fourth amendment causes of action.we next turn to the other requisite of the first amendment cause of action,retaliatory motive.
the first amendment cause of action retaliation 
scope of appellate review 
we recognize that the district court did not have the opportunity to consider hartman and,given the way it conducted the smiddy i analysis,did not directly address the retaliation question.although it will often be the better approach to remand in such cases for the district court to apply the appropriate standards,see in re exxon valdez,cir,t he matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals,to be exercised on the facts of individual cases.singleton wulff,d.
we are comfortable resolving the hartman retaliation issue on the facts of this case,where the new legal standard arose during the briefing of this appeal,the standard was brought to our attention by one of the parties,and,critically,the retaliation issue was extensively litigated in the district court,albeit under a somewhat different legal framework.see also kimes stone,cir courts may take up an issue for the first time on appeal when a change in law raises a new issue while an appeal is pending quotation in original omitted golden gate hotel ass san francisco,cir certainly there are circumstances in which a federal appellate court is justified in resolving an issue not passed on below,as where the proper resolution is beyond any doubt.quoting singleton,at.
the reason the retaliation issue was litigated in the district court,including on the defendants smiddy motion for summary judgment,is this under smiddy i,proof that officials have deliberately or recklessly misled a prosecutor is sufficient to show that the prosecutor has not exercised independent judgment.see galen county of los angeles,cir.as part of beck theory of deliberate falsehood,he argued that the officers were motivated by retaliatory animus to create a false case against him.the parties therefore litigated that question,which had first been raised in beck complaint because the retaliation issue has therefore been present in the case from the start,all parties have had ample opportunity to investigate it and to bring forward evidence and legal arguments regarding it.
nor does the applicability of hartman come as a surprise.although hartman was published after beck opening brief was due,it issued before the officers filed their answering brief.so,in addition to having addressed the retaliation issue throughout the litigation,the officers had a chance to address the hartman beck did in his reply they failed to do so.
further,because we are reviewing a summary judgment record,we resolve factual disputes in favor of the party and decide legal issues de novo.it therefore does not matter whether the officers might have paid more attention to rebutting retaliation had they addressed hartman.we would still view the facts in the light most favorable to beck in sum,the officers suffer no prejudice,see kimes,at,if we consider here the same retaliation issue which the parties have already litigated in the context of the smiddy i framework.
for these reasons,and because it has already been four years since beck arrest and three years since this case was filed,considerations of judicial efficiency lead us to resolve the matter today.justice would not be served by subjecting the parties to further disputes over immunity when the matter can be clearly settled on the present summary judgment record.
retaliation 
beck alleges that his arrest was retaliatory in two regards first,he maintains that the officers arrested him in retaliation for his brusque comments to chief thouvenell at the bank opening party.second,he contends that the officers actions were the culmination of the extended dispute between beck and upland that began with his protests against the rubble removal contract and were in retaliation for that protest.on the summary judgment record,a rational jury could find for beck on either theory,see blankenhorn,at,satisfying hartman.
as to the first theory beck presented evidence showing that he had a heated confrontation with chief thouvenell and sergeant mendenhall at the bank opening party.he could show that,in the heat of the moment,thouvenell had told him that we should have taken care of you a long time ago.he also presented evidence from the chamber of commerce meeting,indicating that thouvenell,mendenhall,and milhiser had been agitated over beck comments and that thouvenell,in particular,had threatened that he would take legal action against chamber members who interfered with this whole beck issue.
beck also could show that the police,the alleged victims of his crime,did not investigate the matter beyond making a few phone calls before going to the district attorney to file charges and secure an arrest warrant.further,the police report left out thouvenell hostile comment to beck and reported the crime as a potential felony,rather than as a misdemeanor,suggesting that it was written to cast beck in the worst possible light.
as viewed most favorably to beck,the facts in this regard resemble those in duran,in which a police officer stopped and arrested a man who first exchanged a few heated words with him and who then made obscene gestures at him just before the arrest.at.in that case,we first held that probable cause for the stop was absent and then warned that it appeared that the officer stopped the plaintiff at least partly in retaliation for the insult he received from him.id.at.beck showing of a heated personal confrontation followed by a hasty arrest likewise could rationally support a finding of retaliatory animus.
even if it did not adopt the above theory based on personal retaliatory animus,a rational jury could find that the arrest was the culmination of beck dispute with upland over his efforts to block the rubble removal contract.beck presented a substantial case that his protests created the tensions that led to his arrest.first,beck could show that chief thouvenell himself had advised him to work out a deal with his competitor to share the contract.second,he could demonstrate that his competitor had suggested investigating him for zoning violations after threatening that every agency in upland would be down on top of beck.beck could present evidence that such investigations of existing nonconforming businesses were against city policy,and that,at the time of the relevant zoning changes,upland senior planner was not aware of one single enforcement action against an existing nonconforming use in upland history.further,he could demonstrate that chief thouvenell and sergeant mendenhall were involved in the code enforcement action,and that beck and mendenhall had had a dispute when mendenhall arrived to discuss the zoning problems with him.in addition to these showings,he could add the incidents we have already described,including,in particular,chief thouvenell statements at the chamber of commerce meeting.in short,even if the jury did not believe that the police would retaliate against beck solely because of the confrontation at the bank opening party,beck could make out a case that the confrontation was the culmination of a longer conflict rooted in his contract protest,and that the arrest was in retaliation for beck overall role in that conflict.
viewed in that light,the facts in this case closely parallel those in hartman.the plaintiff in hartman,moore,made equipment used by the postal service and successfully lobbied against a policy that would have favored his competitors.hartman,at.after he succeeded,postal service inspectors began to investigate him for various crimes he was prosecuted but was cleared of all charges.id.at.record evidence showed that the inspectors had pressured the attorney to prosecute,had thin evidence to support their criminal allegations,and had been angered by moore activities.see moore hartman,similarly,beck lobbied against government action that would have favored his competitors and found himself under investigation.while beck might or might not ultimately succeed in convincing a jury that his advocacy efforts prompted the zoning investigation that escalated into the arrest,a rational jury looking at the present record in the light most favorable to beck could so infer.
thus,under either view of retaliatory animus,beck has met the retaliation prong of hartman.as we have discussed,he has also shown that probable cause was absent.he has therefore completed the hartman showing,and his first amendment cause of action survives.
the fourth amendment cause of action invocation of privilege 
the absence of probable cause also supports beck fourth amendment cause of action.the smiddy i framework,however,requires more.for the reasons we have explained,we address that framework here.
we need not,however,consider,as did the district court,whether the evidence beck presented was sufficient to meet the plaintiff smiddy i burden of rebutting the presumption of prosecutorial independence.smiddy i held that where invocations of privilege render relevant evidence concerning the prosecutor decision to prosecute unavailable,no presumption of prosecutorial independence arises,and the plaintiff need not rebut it.at here,the prosecutor,gaetano,invoked privilege to shield relevant evidence.
the basis for this limitation on the plaintiff smiddy i burden is the same concern that led the supreme court in hartman to abjure a subjective inquiry into the prosecutor state of,that ascertaining that state of mind is likely to be exceedingly difficult.see hartman,at.where the prosecutor claims privilege regarding key factual inquiries essential to rebutting the smiddy i presumption,it is unfair to the plaintiff to apply the presumption,and,pursuant to smiddy i caveat,we may not do so.
gaetano did answer some questions with regard to his charging decision he explained the nature of the process and said that he had not actually been ordered by chief thouvenell or sergeant mendenhall to prosecute beck.but gaetano twice asserted privilege when asked if he had been swayed or pressure d by the police in his charging decision.
the answers to the questions gaetano refused to answer are obviously central to the presumption of independent judgment that underlies smiddy i causal analysis.among the bases for overcoming the smiddy i presumption is a showing that the district attorney was pressured or caused by the investigating officers to act contrary to his independent judgment.smiddy i,at.with gaetano answers to questions directed precisely at that consideration off the table,beck can not be required to come forward with evidence to rebut the presumption of gaetano independent judgment.instead,the burden of showing that gaetano acted independently falls on the officers.
a rational jury could find that the officers had not met their burden to show that gaetano judgment was sufficiently independent as to amount to an intervening cause shielding them from liability.see id.at.the officers were the purported victims of the crime.their own descriptions of the incident were at the core of the brief police report.gaetano testified that he conducted no additional legal or factual investigation of his own.even when privilege is not asserted,we have expressed concern about the application of the smiddy i presumption where t he prosecutor only information came from the police reports.barlow ground,cir see also blankenhorn,at newman county of orange,cir borunda richmond,cir.here,in addition to the presence of police as victims and gaetano failure to do any additional investigation,gaetano decision to charge beck comments as a felony,as the police report suggested,and the omission of thouvenell comments to beck in the police report all call the independence of gaetano judgment into serious question.
in short,beck has demonstrated that there was no probable cause for his arrest,and the officers have not met their burden to show that gaetano judgment acted as an intervening cause.we therefore hold that,on the present record,beck fourth amendment cause of action may go forward.
qualified immunity 
beck has met his burden to establish causation on both his first and fourth amendment causes of action.the remaining issue on the causes of action is whether chief thouvenell and sergeant mendenhall are entitled to qualified immunity we address that question now.
we have already explained that,on this summary judgment record,beck was arrested in retaliation for his speech and that the arrest was without probable cause.those explanations satisfy the first step of the qualified immunity inquiry with regard to the first and fourth amendment issues,and we will not repeat them here.see saucier,at.discussing step one of the qualified immunity inquiry all that remains is to determine whether the pertine
