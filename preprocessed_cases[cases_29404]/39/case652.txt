william petitions for review of the decision of the merit systems protection board board,no,affirming the decision by the administrative judge that engaged in improper conduct,but reversing the judge mitigation of the agency penalty from removal to a suspension.we have jurisdiction under b.we vacate the board decision and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on september,the united states postal service postal service issued a letter of proposed removal,claiming that he engaged in improper use of personal identifiers.the notice accuses of improperly using the personal information of a,joseph cummins cummins,to help another,valerie davis taylor taylor,obtain a mortgage.
the alleged plan to help taylor obtain a mortgage developed from taylor having made an deposit towards the purchase of a new home,without first securing approval for a mortgage.in late,taylor applied for a mortgage with american financial mortgage corporation,but was told that she was unable,on her own,to qualify for the loan.to avoid losing her deposit,taylor and approached cummins and asked if he would assist taylor in obtaining the mortgage.cummins agreed,at least initially.on october,someone completed a loan application,employment verification request,and credit verification request in the name of joseph cummins.these forms contained cummins personal information,including his address,social security number,and description of assets and liabilities.someone signed cummins name on the forms.the employment verification form was sent to cummins employer,henzy at the havertown branch post office.henzy completed the form,returned it to the mortgage company,and gave a copy to cummins,who expressed confusion about the form because he claimed to have no knowledge of applying for a mortgage.cummins stated that the signature on the form was not his own and that he did not give anyone permission to use or sign his name.henzy then initiated an investigation that eventually led to the removal and arrest of and taylor.
denies that he completed the mortgage application and related forms using cummins name and information.however,he does admit that he accompanied taylor to the build site of the home she wished to purchase and identified himself to the builder as cummins.also admits calling the mortgage company on at least one occasion,purporting to be cummins.according to,cummins consented to these actions when he agreed to help taylor obtain a mortgage.cummins,on the other hand,contends that he withdrew his consent shortly after agreeing to help taylor.
in november,and taylor were arrested for theft and forgery based on their attempt to help taylor obtain the mortgage.the charges against were dismissed when he completed the accelerated rehabilitative disposition program.on september,the postal service issued its notice of proposed removal.failed to respond to the notice and on october,the postal service terminated employment.then filed an appeal with the board.after a hearing,the administrative judge found that engaged in improper conduct by using cummins personal information without his consent,but that the penalty of removal should be mitigated to a suspension because removal exceeded the bounds of reasonableness.united states postal,no,slip op.at,initial decision.the postal service then filed a petition for review with the board,which reinstated the agency penalty of removal because it found conduct to be egregious and removal a reasonable penalty.united states postal,final decision.
now petitions for review of the final decision,arguing that his conduct was not so egregious as to warrant removal and,moreover,that removal is an unreasonably harsh penalty when all of the relevant factors are considered under douglas veterans administration,mspb.also argues that the administrative judge erred by not informing him that he needed to present sworn testimony in support of his version of what happened,thus leading the judge to erroneously conclude that engaged in improper conduct.according to,who appeared pro se,the judge should have told him that his unsworn statements were not evidence.
in reviewing a final decision of the merit systems protection board,this court 
shall review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action,findings,or conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence 
c.when,as here,the decision of the full board differs from that of its presiding official the administrative judge,this court will engage in a more searching scrutiny of the record.connolly united states dep t of justice.
an agency decision to dismiss a federal employee must have a rational basis supported by substantial evidence from the record taken as a whole.mitchum.valley,quoting vanfossen dep t of hous.urban.when all of the agency charges are sustained,the agency original penalty may nevertheless be mitigated to a maximum reasonable penalty when the agency penalty is too severe.lachance devall.
the administrative judge found that the postal service removal of was too severe a penalty because several factors weighed in favor of mitigation,including 
first,while the charged act of misconduct is serious,it is not egregious.second,the appellant more than years of service of consistently satisfactory service is a significant factor to be considered.third,the record does not show that the appellant gained financially from his misconduct.fourth,the appellant potential for rehabilitation.
initial decision at.the board disagreed with the administrative judge,finding that conduct was egregious.final decision at.the board opinion,however,is based on an erroneous version of the facts that is not supported by the record or the original charge against.
first,the final decision states that filed the mortgage application using cummins personal information.id.at.the notice of proposed removal,however,does not specifically charge with filing the mortgage application.rather,to support the general charge of improper use of personal identifiers,the notice specifies that 
engaging in criminal activity is a violation of postal service regulations contained in the postal service code of ethical conduct.by your actions you are in violations of but not limited to the following sections of the employee and labor relations manual part behavior and personal habits and,unacceptable conduct,which states 
no employee will engage in criminal,dishonest,notoriously disgraceful or immoral conduct.conviction of any criminal statute may be grounds for disciplinary action by the postal service.
by your actions you have violated the provisions of the employee and labor relations manual,including but not limited to,the code of conduct,and the administrative support manual.your behavior can not and will not be tolerated by the united states postal service.
while the notice details various suspected aspects of taylor attempt to secure a mortgage,the only conduct specifically attributed to is his arrest,his admission that he accompanied taylor to the home site while purporting to be cummins,and his admission that he called american financial mortgage company purporting to be cummins.the notice does not accuse of forging and filing the mortgage application.the agency counsel also stated at the hearing before the administrative judge that we never charged him with signing the forms.
similarly,the final decision states that the investigative memorandum indicates that the appellant and taylor even went so far as to falsify cummins address on w forms so that it would appear that cummins lived with taylor.id.at.in fact,the two investigative memoranda in the record implicate taylor for falsifying cummins forms,which taylor admitted faxing to american financial mortgage company.the notice of proposed removal also did not specifically charge with falsifying cummins address on the forms.rather,the notice merely reported that told the investigator that he never saw cummins or pay stubs and that he did not know why cu
