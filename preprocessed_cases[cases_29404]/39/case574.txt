wesleyan company,wesleyan appeals the decision of the armed services board of contract appeals board dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction its breach of contract claim against the united states.wesleyan,asbca,bca,wl april.because the board erred in concluding that the contract disputes act of,a,a cda,does not confer subject matter jurisdiction over a portion of wesleyan claim,we reverse and remand.
in the early,wesleyan communicated to the united states army its concepts for its drinking system,which allows a soldier to consume liquid from a canteen without removing his protective mask,and its fist fountain system,designed to enable soldiers to fill empty canteens in a contaminated environment collectively,wesleyan system.beginning in early,and acting upon the army advice,wesleyan sent the first of three unsolicited proposals for the wesleyan system to multiple army components.the army soldier and biological chemical command,army soldier system center in natick,massachusetts natick labs assumed responsibility for the analysis of the wesleyan system.natick labs rejected wesleyan proposal in april because it did not contain a defense acquisition regulation dar legend discussing government use of the unsolicited information.
after discussions with natick labs,wesleyan resubmitted the unsolicited proposal with dar a included and executed a memorandum of understanding mou,both of which prohibited the government from disclosing information in the proposal to third parties and from using the information for any purpose other than evaluating the proposal 
after determining that the wesleyan system was technically feasible,natick labs requested in november that wesleyan lend a prototype system to ilc dover,a manufacturer of protective suits and masks,for incorporation into a prototype protective suit.the bailment agreement,executed on december,was silent as to the safeguarding or use of proprietary data in the wesleyan system,but did state that the bailment was being made for the limited purpose of determining its use in demonstrating and testing its ability to perform the intended services.the bailment agreement expressly stated that the wesleyan system remained wesleyan property.
beginning on may,the army initiated purchases of the wesleyan systems,which were used in field tests at natick labs and other army units,including the infantry school at fort benning,georgia,and the chemical school at fort leonard wood,missouri.the army purchased nine systems during.
on january,the army required wesleyan to sign a policy statement for continued evaluation of the wesleyan system.the policy statement contained the following clause 
the voluntary submissions will be handled in accordance with established government procedures for safeguarding such articles or information against unauthorized disclosure.in addition,the data forming a part of or constituting the submission will not be disclosed outside the government or be duplicated,used or disclosed in whole or in part by the government,except for record purposes or to evaluate the proposal.
following execution of this policy statement,the army purchased an additional twenty wesleyan systems during.in january,the army required wesleyan to execute a second,similar policy statement.following execution of this second policy statement,the army purchased systems in,and systems in,for a total of systems.
the army purchases were governed by six purchase orders,all of which were silent as to the safeguarding or use of proprietary data.however,four of the six purchase orders stated that the purchases were being made for evaluative or demonstrative purposes in,the army completed its testing and terminated consideration of the wesleyan system.
beginning in,natick labs initiated development of the land warrior modular lightweight load carry equipment system molle,which included a hydration system,and awarded a primary contract for molle in may to specialty plastic products of pa,specialty.the commercial hydration system then used in molle was received poorly by users,and the marine corps noted that a large number of marines instead were purchasing a commercially available hydration system produced by camelbak products,camelbak.specialty replaced the hydration system in molle with camelbak hydration system in.
on april,wesleyan submitted a claim for nearly million to natick labs,alleging that the army improperly disclosed wesleyan proprietary data to third parties,and that its proprietary information was subsequently incorporated into the camelbak system.the army contracting officer co issued a final decision denying wesleyan claim for lack of jurisdiction under the cda on july,and wesleyan appealed to the board.
on may,the board granted the army motion for partial summary judgment,holding that,to the extent any proprietary data was disclosed publicly in wesleyan patents the army was entitled to disseminate that information.in other words,the board held that all information disclosed to the army and not taught by the patents was to be protected from third parties.
the board also determined that the army acceptance of wesleyan unsolicited proposals created a contract permitting the government to use the proposal data in accordance with the dar legend and memoranda of understanding.the board then held that the resulting confidentiality agreement applied only to the unsolicited proposals,not to the subsequent bailment agreement or purchases,and sua sponte requested the parties to brief whether the board possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute.following the submission of briefs,the army moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and the board granted that motion on april.
wesleyan appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
the sole issue on appeal is whether the pleaded contracts are covered by the cda.statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.power and light united states.
we begin our analysis with the language of the statute.institut pasteur united states.pursuant to the cda,the board has subject matter jurisdiction over any express or implied contract entered into by an executive agency for the procurement of property,other than real property in being.a.procurement is the acquisition by purchase,lease or barter,of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the federal government.new era constr.united states,emphasis in original.
here,three types of agreements are at issue the unsolicited proposals the bailment agreement and the purchase orders.although the bailment agreement does involve,and the unsolicited proposals arguably involve,the transfer of property,neither involve acquisition by such means as renting or leasing,as wesleyan did not receive any value in exchange.as such,the unsolicited proposals and bailment agreement were donative in nature.
the purchase orders,in contrast,involve the exchange of property for money,and thus involve procurement.the board erred by ignoring this critical exchange.accordingly,the board erred by categorizing wesleyan as a bidder,and thus in relying on our decision in coastal united states.in coastal,the army had not engaged in any procurement activities,and had instead cancelled a bid solicitation prior to awarding a contract.id.at.we held that the cda deals with contractors,not with disappointed bidders.id.at.wesleyan,however,is more than a disappointed bidder.although here,the army had not yet awarded wesleyan a final contract to provide the system to soldiers,the army had purchased prototypes for testing.this purchasing activity was sufficient to transform the army relationship with wesleyan from that of evaluator and bidder to that of buyer and seller.accordingly,coastal is distinguishable.
we turn now to the question of whether the information contained in the purchase orders was sufficient to constitute a procurement contract.the purchase orders specify the parties involved,delivery instructions,price,payment terms,and transportation instructions.no essential term is missing although wesleyan did not sign the purchase orders,it performed,which clearly signals acceptance.taken together,the purch
