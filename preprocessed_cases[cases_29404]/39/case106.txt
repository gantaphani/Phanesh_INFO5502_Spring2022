the trustee in bankruptcy of esa environmental specialists,esa appeals from the affirmance by the district court of the award of summary judgment by the bankruptcy court to the hanover insurance hanover.the bankruptcy court concluded that esa transfer of million to hanover within days of esa filing a petition for bankruptcy was not an avoidable preference under b.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the award of summary judgment to hanover.
background and proceedings below 
esa was an environmental and industrial engineering firm that sought and performed construction projects under contract with the federal government.pursuant to the miller act,esa was required to obtain and furnish to the government two types of surety as a condition precedent b efore any contract of more than could be awarded for the construction,alteration,or repair of any public building or public work of the federal government.b.these surety bonds functioned to secure esa obligation to complete its contract and pay its vendors and subcontractors.see id.
in,hanover issued surety bonds on behalf of esa prior to the federal government award of eight contracts to esa the existing projects.in april,esa borrowed million from prospect capital prospect to,among other things,meet current working capital needs,repay existing indebtedness,and fund costs associated with entering into and fulfilling government contracts.in may,esa asked hanover to issue additional surety bonds the new bonds in conjunction with seven additional government contracts that esa sought to obtain the new contracts and collectively with the existing projects,the government contracts.esa could not commence work on the new contracts until it tendered the new bonds to the appropriate government agencies,as the new bonds were a condition precedent to the final contract award to esa.hanover,concerned about esa financial stability,would not issue the new bonds without additional security over and above the bond premiums.the parties agreed upon a letter of credit as the additional security by which hanover would agree to issue the new bonds.esa was required to obtain an irrevocable letter of credit from suntrust bank suntrust in the amount of million with hanover as the beneficiary the letter of credit.the letter of credit would collateralize the new bonds but also all of hanover existing guarantees and surety obligations on behalf of esa.the bond premiums on the new bonds totaled,and the face value of the new bonds totaled million.
as a condition precedent to issuance of the letter of credit,suntrust required esa to fund a certificate of deposit at sun trust in the amount of million the cd as security for the letter of credit.esa had limited cash reserves,so it turned to prospect for the additional capital necessary to fund the cd.prospect and esa then amended their existing credit agreement to increase the principal amount of prospect existing loan to esa by a total of million the prospect loan on may and may,in two separate transfers,prospect tendered the prospect loan funds directly to esa,and esa deposited those funds into its bank account.on may,esa transferred million of the prospect loan proceeds to suntrust to fund the cd to secure the letter of credit for hanover suntrust then issued the letter of credit,and hanover in turn issued the new bonds,which esa delivered to the appropriate federal government agencies for final award of the new contracts.
despite being awarded the new contracts,esa financial condition continued to deteriorate and it filed a voluntary chapter petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina on august.hanover then drew on the letter of credit,receiving the million face amount from suntrust,which liquidated the cd.
in the course of esa bankruptcy proceeding,the bankruptcy court approved the sale of substantially all of esa assets to prospect.as part of that sale,esa assigned to integrated contract services ics,an affiliate of prospect,i its rights under the government contracts,ii all of its litigation claims or causes of action,including its preference and avoidance claims the litigation rights,and iii its right to the return of any collateral remaining upon the completion of the government contracts.shortly thereafter,ics ceased operations and assigned esa assets,including the litigation rights,back to prospect.neither ics nor prospect commenced work on the government contracts,but hanover remained bound by the surety bonds to provide for successful completion of those contracts.
in february,the bankruptcy court entered an order allowing hanover to take responsibility for the completion of the government contracts.hanover represents,without contradiction,that s ince entry of that order,hanover fulfilled its obligations,including ensuring that the g overnment c ontracts were completed and subcontractors paid.appellee br.
also in february,on prospect motion,the bankruptcy court entered an order converting esa case from chapter to a chapter proceeding and directing the appointment of a chapter trustee.stanley campbell was duly appointed as the chapter trustee for esa the trustee and took control of esa bankruptcy estate.in july,the bankruptcy court entered an order approving a stipulation agreement between prospect and the trustee,under which prospect assigned the litigation rights to the trustee,and the trustee agreed to split the proceeds from any successful actions with prospect 
subsequently,the trustee filed an adversarial proceeding against hanover,alleging that hanover was an indirect beneficiary of esa transfer of the prospect loan proceeds into the cd and that this transfer was an avoidable,preferential transfer under.hanover asserted two affirmative defenses to the trustee claims in the bankruptcy court that the transfer was not a preference because the prospect loan proceeds were earmarked specifically for payment to hanover,and that esa received new value in exchange for the prospect loan proceeds.hanover contended either of these affirmative defenses barred the trustee claims as a matter of law and moved for summary judgment.
the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of hanover,holding both the earmarking and new value defenses applied to prevent a determination that esa transfer of funds was a preferential transfer and avoidable by the trustee.further,the bankruptcy court also opined that i t would be inequitable to require hanover to return the portion of the prospect loan used to cover the costs to complete the government contracts when hanover did the work,and paid the obligations.the trustee appealed the bankruptcy court judgment to the united states district court for the western district of north carolina,which affirmed.from the district court affirmation of the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment,the trustee now timely appeals.we have jurisdiction under.
standard of review 
when considering an appeal from a district court acting in its capacity as a bankruptcy appellate court,we conduct an independent review of the bankruptcy court decision,reviewing factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.see banks sallie mae serv.in re banks,cir.a bankruptcy court properly grants summary judgment when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
a trustee in bankruptcy 
may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made 
made while the debtor was insolvent 
made on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition 
that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if the transfer had not been made.
b.the trustee bears the burden of proving the avoidability of a transfer under b.id.g.
hanover does not contest that the trustee has presented a prima facie case under b for the avoidance of the transfer to it of the million.instead,hanover contends that it has established three affirmative defenses to avoidance earmarking,new value,and equity.first,the trustee argues that the bankruptcy court improperly applied the earmarking defense because esa did not use the prospect loan proceeds to pay an antecedent debt.second,the trustee argues that the bankruptcy court improperly applied the new value defense because hanover did not prove with specificity the amount of the new value it provided esa and the bankruptcy court clearly erred in its findings of fact.third,the trustee argues that the bankruptcy court improperly held in favor of hanover on independent equitable grounds,which are not recognized as a defense to an avoidance action in bankruptcy.we address each argument in turn.
earmarking 
the earmarking defense in bankruptcy is a judicially created exception to the statutory power of the bankruptcy trustee under to avoid or set aside an otherwise preferential transfer of assets see mccuskey bank of waterloo in re bohlen,cir.the earmarking defense applies w hen a third person makes a loan to a debtor specifically to enable that debtor to satisfy the claim of a designated creditor.collier on bankruptcy a ed.see.bank woodson in re decker,cir holding that a transfer was not an avoidable preference when it was made for the specific purpose of paying at least a portion of a particular debt.the proceeds of such an earmarked loan never become part of the debtor assets and therefore no preference is created because the transfer does not diminish the value of the debtor estate collier on bankruptcy a see decker,at as a general rule,such a payment,in and of itself and without more,will not create a voidable preference since there has been no diminution of the value of the estate.
this circuit has previously recognized the earmarking defense in decker,but only in the limited circumstance of a direct payment from one creditor to another.at.in decker,the debtor had overdrawn his bank accounts by about.id.at.shortly before filing for bankruptcy,the debtor sister paid the bank the existing debt to cover the overdrafts and became a creditor of the debtor in approximately the same amount as he had owed the bank.id.at.the debtor trustee in bankruptcy attempted to avoid the transfer from the debtor sister to the bank as preferential,arguing that the payment was in essence a loan to the debtor and that the debtor estate diminished when the was paid to the bank.id.
in considering this argument,we first noted the basic principle of bankruptcy that,i f an unconditional loan is made to a bankrupt,the loan proceeds become part of the bankrupt free assets.id.we then concluded that in the case at bar,it is clear that the payment of the by miss decker was not an unconditional loan for the benefit of all creditors but was made for the specific purpose of paying at least a portion of a particular debt owed to the bank.id.at.we concluded that a s a general rule,such a payment,in and of itself and without more,will not create a voidable preference since there has been no diminution of the value of the estate.id.we then stated that t he test is not what the creditor receives but what the bankrupt estate has lost.it is the diminution of the bankrupt estate,not the unequal payment to creditors,which is the evil sought to be remedied by the avoidance of a preferential transfer.id.at.
since our opinion in decker,courts have uniformly held that the earmarking defense applies whether the proceeds of the loan are transferred directly by the lender to the creditor or are paid to the debtor with the understanding that they will be paid to the creditor in satisfaction of his claim,so long as the proceeds are clearly earmarked.collier on bankruptcy a.courts continue to recognize,though,that a payment by a debtor with borrowed money may constitute a preference when the loan so used was not made upon the condition that it should be applied to the particular creditor to whom it was paid over.collier on bankruptcy a citing brown first bank of little rock,cir smyth kaufman in re koplik,cir.
the bankruptcy court here correctly recognized that the fourth circuit adopted the concept of the earmarking defense as an affirmative defense in bankruptcy in decker.however,the bankruptcy court erred in its determination that the earmarking defense applies in this case.the transfer from prospect to esa to suntrust and later to hanover lacks a critical element of an earmarking defense the funds at issue were not used to pay an antecedent debt.
the million at issue in this case was not transferred directly from creditor to creditor,from prospect to hanover.instead,esa received the funds from prospect,placed the funds in its own bank account,and only later deposited the funds with suntrust to secure hanover.the parties argue at length over whether esa had control over the prospect loan proceeds so that those funds could not be deemed earmarked under our precedent in decker.resolution of that factual dispute,however,is irrelevant to the determination of whether hanover earmarking defense applies because hanover failed to prove a fundamental element of earmarking that the transferred funds paid an antecedent debt of the debtor,esa.
the earmarking doctrine applies only when the debtor borrows money from one creditor and the terms of that agreement require the debtor to use the loan proceeds to extinguish specific,designated,existing debt.see collier on bankruptcy a citing brown,at smyth,at.accordingly,the proper inquiry is whether the debtor had the right to disburse the funds to whomever it wished,or whether the disbursement was limited to a particular old creditor or creditors under the agreement with the new creditor.adams anderson,in re superior stamp coin,cir.without the satisfaction of an antecedent debt of the debtor by the new creditor,the concept of earmarking can not apply there is no debt by which one creditor is substituted for another.see decker,at it is clear that it was the intention of vivian decker,as a new creditor,that the paid by her to the bank was to be applied toward satisfaction of an antecedent debt of decker,the debtor in bankruptcy,to the bank.in the case at bar,a new debt was created where none previously existed.
even were we to assume,arguendo,that prospect loaned esa the funds at issue for the specific purpose of securing hanover,esa did not use the loan proceeds to pay an existing debt.here,esa borrowed money from prospect incurring new debt and used those funds to collateralize both existing obligations to hanover as well as the new bonds a new debt not previously owed to any creditor.esa did not use the prospect loan funds to pay antecedent or old debt,nor did esa merely substitute one creditor for another so that the pot available to pay existing creditors was unaffected by the transfer.to the contrary,esa now owes a much higher total debt than it did before the prospect loan,thereby diminishing the share available from esa bankruptcy estate for repayment of esa existing creditors.
hanover does not contest that esa used the prospect loan proceeds to secure its obligations to hanover rather than to pay an antecedent debt.nor does hanover assert that esa in fact substituted one creditor for another.consequently,the earmarking defense can not apply in this case.the bankruptcy court therefore erred in holding that an earmarking defense applied to prevent the trustee from avoiding the transfer to hanover under 
in contrast to the judicially created earmarking defense,the new value defense is an explicit statutory defense to a b preference action 
the trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer 
to the extent that such transfer was 
a intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and 
b in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.
c.the statute defines new value as 
money or money worth in goods,services,or new credit,or release by a transferee of property previously transferred to such transferee in a transaction that is neither void nor voidable by the debtor or the trustee under any applicable law,including proceeds of such property,but does not include an obligation substituted for an existing obligation.
