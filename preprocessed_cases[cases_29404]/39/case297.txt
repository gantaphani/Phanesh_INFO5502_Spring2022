background 
on july,francisco jose rivero,president of pacific internment services,pacific,signed a contract with the city and county of san francisco the city to provide funeral and mortuary services for the city indigent dead.pacific had publicly bid and won its first indigent dead contract in.prior to,the contract had been performed by the san francisco college of mortuary science for almost years.pacific contract had been administered by the san francisco department of public health,but the contract was administered by the san francisco medical examiner office the meo.pacific contract ran from august,through july,with an optional term of extension.the contract contained a provision allowing the city to terminate the contract,without cause and for its convenience,on thirty days written notice.
in may,the san francisco mayor office instructed its department heads to investigate ways to reduce expenditures.san francisco administrative coroner joseph surdyka suggested that savings could be realized if the meo began performing the services pacific was performing under its contract.boyd stephens,chief medical examiner,then proposed to chief administrative officer rudolf nothenberg various ways to reduce the meo budget,including performing the indigent dead contract.after reviewing stephens proposal,nothenberg recommended to the mayor and the board of supervisors that they terminate pacific contract.the mayor and the board of supervisors approved nothenberg recommendation,and on may,the city gave pacific written notice of its intent to terminate the contract on june,just over a year before it was due to expire.
rivero and pacific responded by suing the city,surdyka,stephens,and deputy coroner herbert hawley to recover damages for breach of contract by the city for inducing breach of contract by the individual defendants for interference with the contract based on rivero race in violation of by the individual defendants and for retaliation and interference with rivero first amendment rights in violation of by the individual defendants.plaintiffs alleged that in the course of obtaining and performing the contract,rivero became aware of illegal actions by the individual false billings,false reporting of funeral cases,illegal embalming of bodies,and illegal bribes and kickbacks.rivero reported these activities to the media and to the san francisco district attorney criminal investigations unit.rivero also testified before a criminal grand jury,which issued a report highly critical of the defendants.according to plaintiffs,the meo thereafter gained control over the administration of the indigent dead contract from the department of public health,and the individual defendants then procured the cancellation of pacific contract in retaliation for rivero whistleblowing.
the individual defendants moved before trial for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.the magistrate judge,to whom the parties agreed to have the case transferred for final disposition,denied the motion.the defendants did not take an interlocutory appeal,and the case went to trial.in,a jury found there had been no breach of contract and necessarily no inducement of breach of contract,and found no racial discrimination in violation of.it found,however,that surdyka and stephens had retaliated against rivero for exercising his first amendment rights,in violation of,and awarded damages.surdyka and stephens then filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law based on qualified immunity or for a new trial based on inconsistency in the verdict.the magistrate judge held that surdyka and stephens were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but ordered a new trial.surdyka and stephens did not take an interlocutory appeal from the denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law.
before the new trial could take place,the defendants moved for summary judgment based on lack of causation and qualified immunity.the district judge,to whom the case reverted after recusal by the magistrate judge,granted summary judgment based on lack of causation.he specifically declined to reach the question of qualified immunity.the plaintiffs appealed.surdyka and stephens did not.in their brief to us,surdyka and stephens argued both that the magistrate judge had properly granted a new trial based on the inconsistency of the verdict,and that the district judge had later properly granted summary judgment.they argued in support of the summary judgment on alternative of causation the ground relied upon by the district judge and qualified immunity the ground not reached by the district judge.
we reversed.in an unpublished memorandum disposition,we held that the magistrate judge had erred in granting a new trial because the verdict was not inconsistent in finding that the city had not breached the contract,but that surdyka and stephens had nonetheless violated.see rivero city county of san francisco,cir table rivero i.the rationale for our holding was that the city may not have been liable for breach of contract because it did not know of the improper motives of surdyka and stephens in recommending the termination to nothenberg,but that surdyka and stephens could nonetheless be liable for violating because their retaliatory actions caused the city to terminate the contract.our rationale necessarily meant that we disagreed with the district judge order granting summary judgment based on lack of causation.we noted the defendants qualified immunity argument in a footnote,but did not reach it.we reversed and remanded.
before the district court entered judgment on remand,surdyka and stephens filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law based on qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion and entered judgment on the verdict.surdyka and stephens timely appeal.
