in at t iii,this court held en banc that the navy violation of section did not void the navy contract with at t.that opinion recites in detail the relevant facts of this case.for convenience,this court briefly restates the relevant background.
section states 
none of the funds provided for the department of defense in this act may be obligated or expended for fixed contracts in excess of for the development of a major system or subsystem unless the under secretary of defense for acquisition determines,in writing,that program risk has been reduced to the extent that realistic pricing can occur,and that the contract type permits an equitable and sensible allocation of program risk between the contracting parties provided,that the under secretary may not delegate this authority to any persons who hold a position in the office of the secretary of defense below the level of assistant under secretary of defense provided further,that the under secretary report to the committees on appropriations of the senate and house of representatives in writing,on a quarterly basis,the contracts which have obligated funds under such a fixed developmental contract.

during the,the navy sought to develop detection technology for tracking submarines of the soviet union.as part of an integrated sonar system,the navy solicited bids for the reduced diameter array rda.at t bid for the rda contract on a basis against competitors that the navy judged more technically competent.on december,the navy awarded at t the rda contract based on the substantially reduced price of its best and final offer bafo.in a bid protest,one of at t competitors challenged that price as erroneous.gould,ocean,b,cpd may.at t retained the rda contract in a vigorous bid defense.id.at t eventually performed the rda contract at a cost of over million,greatly in excess of the contract adjusted final price of about million.
the navy awarded the rda contract to at t as a contract just nine days after enactment of section.contrary to that section provisions,the navy awarded the rda contract without the under secretary of defense for acquisition written determination that rda program risk had been reduced so that realistic pricing could occur.
this court held en banc that violation of section did not render the contract void ab initio 
both the dod administration of,and the congressional response to this administration,make clear that congress did not intend that this enactment would terminate fully performed contracts because of this flawed compliance.
at t iii,at.therefore,the en banc court remanded to the court of federal claims to determine what remedy,if any,was available to at t for the navy violation of section.in a opinion,the court of federal claims held that with section is not an actionable wrong p laintiffs can not claim a protectable interest in the proper application of section for congress intended to give them none.at t iv,fed.cl.at.the court of federal claims also found that federal regulations and dod directives did not remove the contracting officer discretion to negotiate the rda contract on a basis.for these reasons,the court of federal claims dismissed at t complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.at t has sought reformation of its contract with the navy.this court has jurisdiction under a.

this court must again consult the meaning of section.mobil oil higginbotham,d courts have no authority to substitute their views for those expressed by congress in a duly enacted statute.the language of section does not explicitly create a cause of action for enforcement of its expenditure prohibitions.instead the only explicit provision with enforcement consequences in section requires quarterly reports to the committees on appropriations of the senate and the house of representatives in writing.thus,section envisions enforcement,if any,through legislative procedures.the language permits the appropriate legislative committees to monitor compliance and,presumably,guarantee enforcement in the form of future reductions in,or limitations on,appropriated funds.indeed,appropriation bills often contain this kind of oversight provision that permits the appropriation committees to properly monitor federal spending programs.department of defense appropriations act,stat,t he secretary of defense may issue loan guarantees in support of united states defense exports p rovided t hat the secretary shall provide quarterly reports to the committee on appropriations.department of defense appropriations act,stat,see also departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development,and independent agencies appropriations act,stat,none of the funds shall be used to enter into any new lease unless the secretary submits,in writing,a report to the committee on appropriations of the congress.based on that oversight,the committees and congress can then adjust the spending allotments in future bills to ensure compliance with legislative objectives.thus section is an appropriations oversight provision that envisions enforcement,if any,in the form of legislative spending adjustments in future bills.section does not make any provision for judicial enforcement.
as already noted,this court held en banc that section does not terminate fully performed contracts because of dod flawed compliance.at t iii,at.for that reason,the en banc court held that the navy noncompliance with the supervisory and reporting instructions in section did not render the rda contract void.id.at citing longshore united states.instead,this court emphasized the supervisory role of the legislative branch in ensuring compliance with the policies of section.more specifically,in at t iii,this court held that section functions as an internal review and reporting procedure for congressional oversight.id.at.
indeed congressional response to dod flawed administration of section confirms this meaning of the statutory language.following enactment of section,congress was apparently dissatisfied with dod initial compliance with that section.id.at.in response,subsequent legislation tightened that section reporting provisions to require reports rather than quarterly reports.id.again,reports would permit congress to respond with funding reductions or limitations in appropriations bills.in considering enactment of those stricter reporting provisions,the senate armed services committee stated expressly that noncompliance with section should not be the basis for litigating the propriety of an otherwise valid contract 
the committee recognizes that there are circumstances in which development contracts are appropriate,when costs and foreseeable program risks can be reasonably anticipated,and the committee expects the department to establish clear guidelines under this section for use of such contracts.
