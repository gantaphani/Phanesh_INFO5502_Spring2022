order certifying questions to the supreme court of california 
once again,we respectfully request the california supreme court to exercise its discretion and decide the certified questions presented below.see cal.we previously certified these questions to the california supreme court in an order that,in addition to certifying the questions,determined that the plaintiffs had standing to maintain this action.city of san diego,cir.we stayed our certification order pending disposition of a petition for rehearing en banc.that petition was denied on december,and we directed the certification order to be delivered to the california supreme court,cir.the boy scout defendants filed a petition for certiorari,however,challenging our certification order ruling that the plaintiffs had standing to maintain the action.pet.for,wl.the supreme court of california then entered an order stating that our request for decision of certified questions was denied without prejudice and may be after the issue of standing is finalized.order,april.
upon receipt of the order of the supreme court of california,we stayed further proceedings in our court pending the decision of the supreme court on the boy scouts petition for certiorari,and the decision of the supreme court in salazar buono,cert.granted,which raised a similar standing issue,cir.
on april,the united states supreme court decided salazar buono,wl,but a majority of the court did not decide the relevant standing issue because it was foreclosed by an earlier decision in the same litigation that the government did not appeal.salazar buono,wl at plurality opinion.shortly thereafter,the supreme court denied certiorari in boy scouts,wl may.
we conclude,therefore,that the issue of standing has become finalized within the meaning of the order of the california supreme court of april.in accordance with that order,we take this opportunity to our certification of issues and request for decision by the california supreme court.our certification of issues remains the same as in the previous submission the discussion of standing has been modified to reflect the developments described above.
the resolution of any one of the questions we certify could determine the outcome of this appeal and no controlling california precedent exists.see cal.we are aware of the california supreme court demanding caseload and recognize that our request adds to that load.but we feel compelled to request certification because this case raises difficult questions of state constitutional law with potentially broad implications for california citizens civil and religious liberties.considerations of comity and federalism favor the resolution of such questions by the state highest court rather than this court.

ii.statement of facts 
because the district court granted summary judgment against it,we take the facts in the light most favorable to the party,the desert pacific council.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.
a.the parties 
the desert pacific council the council is a nonprofit corporation chartered by the boy scouts of america to administer scouting programs in the san diego area.congress chartered the boy scouts of america to promote the ability of boys to do things for themselves and others and to teach them patriotism,courage,and kindred virtues.while scouting focuses primarily on outdoor activity,the boy scouts rules include a prohibition against allowing youths or adults who are atheists,agnostics,or homosexuals to be members or volunteers.boy scouts of am.dale,holding that the boy scouts have a constitutional right to exclude homosexuals.these rules bind the council.the boy scouts maintain that agnosticism,atheism,and homosexuality are inconsistent with their goals and with the obligations of their members.see randall orange county council,boy scouts of,cal th,reciting that,in defending its right to exclude atheists,the boy scouts introduced evidence intended to establish that requiring the inclusion of nonbelievers would interfere with the organization efforts to convey its religious message.
the boy scouts do not require scouts to affiliate with any religious organization,and the boy scouts style themselves absolutely nonsectarian.er,art.ix,cl.see also,er er,er.
the san diego boy scouts are not a house of worship like a church or synagogue.er er.still,the organization has a religious element.all members and volunteers take an oath to do my best t o do my duty to god and my country and to remain morally straight.er.the organization mission is to prepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the scout oath and law.er.duty to god is placed first in the oath as the most important of all scouting values.er.members also must agree to uphold the scout law,which provides that a scout is faithful in his religious duties.er.membership and leadership applications contain a declaration of religious principle,which explains that no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to god.er.the boy scouts instruct leaders to be positive in their religious influence and to encourage scouts to earn the religious emblem of their faith.er.
the plaintiffs are a lesbian couple and the plaintiffs breens are agnostics.because of their sexual and religious orientations,they can not be boy scout volunteers.both couples have sons old enough to join the boy scouts,and they would like their sons to use the leased facilities,but the parents refuse to give the approval required for membership.as part of the membership application,a parent must promise to assist his or her son in observing the policies of the boy scouts of america to serve as his adult partner and participate in all meetings and approve his advancement.id.the application also includes the scout law and the declaration of religious principle.the and the breens believe that the boy scouts policies are discriminatory,and they refuse to condone such practices by allowing their children to join the boy scouts.
b.the leases 
in accord with its long history of encourag ing nonprofit organizations to develop cultural,educational,and recreational programs on the city property,the plaintiffs home town of san diego has leased public properties to various nonprofit organizations ser.one of these organizations is the desert pacific council,which leases,occupies,and operates portions of two popular city parks.other portions of those parks are extensively used by the plaintiff families.under the original lease,the council paid one dollar per year in rent.in the parties entered into a new lease,which requires the desert pacific council to pay one dollar in annual rent and a annual administration fee.
the city negotiated this lease with the council on an exclusive basis,as it sometimes does with groups,religious or secular,that it deems to be appropriate operators of a particular piece of city property.er,ser.other organizations receive similar terms.some of the city leases to including nineteen leases to recreational require no rent or rent less than the fee the council pays,and fifty of them have terms years or longer.ser.although they produce little to no revenue,these leases save the city some money by placing the costs of maintenance and improvement upon the lessee organizations.ser.the city spends nothing on the properties leased to the council.ser.
the council leases from the city sixteen acres in balboa park known as camp balboa.camp balboa offers a unique urban camping opportunity in the heart of the city.er.the site includes campgrounds,a swimming pool,an amphitheater,a program lodge,a picnic area,a ham radio room,restrooms and showers,and a camp ranger office.the lease requires the council to maintain the property and to expend at least million for capital improvements over seven years.er.the boy scouts have landscaped,constructed recreational facilities,and installed water and power on the property.ser.
similarly,under the fiesta island lease,the boy scouts spent approximately million to build the youth aquatic center ser.the facility offers the use of kayaks,canoes,sail and row boats,and classroom space to other youth groups at inexpensive rates.ser.
occupancy of the land 
the desert pacific council makes exclusive use of portions of balboa park for its own benefit.the council has its headquarters on park property.from this facility it oversees its million budget,manages its thirty employees,and processes applications for membership and leadership positions.the council also has a print shop on park land that it uses to print literature for its members.these portions of the park are unavailable for public use.
other portions of camp balboa and the youth aquatic center are available for use by groups,but the council manages reservations of these recreational facilities.campsites at camp balboa are available on a,basis.ser.thus,if the plaintiffs were to use the land,they would have to do so subject to the council oversight.the council can declare the camp closed,determine how many people are going to attend the camps,and then open up only the unreserved facilities to the public.nonetheless,numerous other groups have camped in the campsites while camp was in session,and the san diego boy scouts have not turned any group away from camp balboa during that time.ser see also ser.the camp charges a small fee for camping,but the revenue from fees is insufficient to cover the cost of maintaining the camp facilities.ser.
the council also leases land from the city on fiesta island in mission bay park.in,the city entered into a,lease with the desert pacific council for acre of waterfront property on fiesta island.the city entered into this lease after the desert pacific council approached it about building and operating an aquatic center on the island.the council was awarded the lease on the condition that it expend million to build the youth aquatic center.at a cost of about million ser,the council built and now operates the aquatic center,which offers boating,sailing,canoeing,and kayaking to san diego youth.
as at camp balboa,reservations to use the youth aquatic center are made through the council.the aquatic center has a formal,policy,but the policy has exceptions for scout members.the desert pacific council is permitted to reserve up to of the facilities seven days in advance.the council also hosts a camp for four weeks each summer.the reservation books during camp say yac closed for summer camp,although the boy scouts use of the aquatic center during those weeks is not exclusive.ser.while the public can not use the aquatic center during summer camp for activities,it can reserve dormitories or other facilities the scouts are not using.in practice,often use portions of the facilities more than members do.ser.the san diego boy scouts have not turned away any group while scouting is in session,either at camp balboa or at the aquatic center.ser.the center charges fees for use,but there is no evidence that the fees equal or exceed the cost of maintaining the facilities.
there are no religious symbols either at camp balboa or at the youth aquatic center.
d.the plaintiffs injury 
the plaintiffs never applied to use the youth aquatic center or camp balboa there is no evidence that the council actively excluded them.ser.rather,they testified that the council occupation and control of the land deterred them from using the land at all.the plaintiffs desired to make use of the recreational facilities at camp balboa and the youth aquatic center,but not under the council authority.as a result,they actively avoided the land.they refused to condone the boy scouts exclusionary policies by seeking permission from the boy scouts to use the leased facilities or by using the leased facilities subject to the boy scouts ownership and control.er,ser.they had an aversion to the facilities and felt unwelcome there because of the boy scouts policies that discriminated against people like them.er ser.
the plaintiff families brought this action against the city of san diego,the boy scouts,and the desert pacific council,alleging that leasing public land to an organization that excludes persons because of their religious and sexual orientations violates the federal establishment clause,the california constitution no and no clauses,the federal and state equal protection clauses,the san diego human dignity ordinance,and state contract law.the district court found the plaintiffs had standing as municipal taxpayers and then allowed them to file an amended complaint.both parties sought summary judgment.the court found that the leases violated the federal establishment clause and the california no aid and no preference clauses and granted summary judgment in the plaintiffs favor.boy scouts of,d.in the amended final judgment,the court enjoined the balboa park and fiesta island leases.the city then notified the council that under the terms of the balboa park lease,the term tenancy was terminated and converted to a tenancy.the plaintiffs have since settled with the city.the scout defendants appealed the district court ruling.
iii.jurisdiction 
we have statutory jurisdiction over this appeal under,but the parties presented challenges to the existence of a case or controversy that is essential to our constitutional jurisdiction under article iii.see harrison united states,cir.
we ruled on those challenges in our prior certification order,city of san diego,cir.first,we held that the city termination of the balboa park lease did not moot that controversy because the desert pacific council still retained a tenancy,and because the termination itself was contingent on the outcome of this appeal.id.at.second,we held that the plaintiffs had standing to maintain this action because they suffered an caused by the boy scouts activities.id.at.en banc review of that standing decision was denied,cir,and the supreme court denied certiorari,wl may.thus the challenges to this court jurisdiction have been rejected,and we proceed with this certification and request for decision.
iv.explanation of certification 
the need to avoid federal constitutional questions 
f ederal courts should not decide federal constitutional issues when alternative grounds yielding the same relief are available.see kuba agric,cir.if the california constitution provides an independent basis for relief,then there is no need for decision of the federal issue.city of mesquite aladdin castle.yet any interpretation by this court of the state constitutional clauses,unlike an interpretation by the california supreme court,can
