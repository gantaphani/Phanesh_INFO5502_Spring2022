background 
the sonny montgomery veterans affairs medical center va solicited bids on may,for provision of medical care to veterans in meridian,mississippi.the solicitation stated that the va would evaluate proposals based on technical capability,past performance,and price.the solicitation was a best value procurement and noted that technical capability was weighted slightly higher than past performance.however,of the total points possible,technical capability was assigned ninety and past performance was assigned only ten.in the final evaluation of the proposals,technical capability and past performance were combined into a single technical score worth a maximum of points.the score for bid price made up the remaining points.
three companies submitted proposals for the project galen,downing the incumbent contractor,and cr associates.six evaluators used score sheets awarding point values based on the evaluators opinion of how well each proposal met the criteria set forth in the bid solicitation.one of the six evaluators,frank tuminello,was also listed in downing proposal as a reference.on june,the va concluded its evaluations,and galen received an overall score of technical score and price score.downing scored technical and price,and cr associates scored technical and price.galen bid price was,and downing bid price was.
on june,the va asked the competitors to submit best and final offers bafos by june,but downing,according to the trial court,submitted some documents after the request date for the bafos.after the bafos were submitted,the va evaluators the proposals.downing had lowered her bid price to and received a new score of technical and price.galen received a new score of technical and price.in a letter dated july,the va notified galen that the contract had been awarded to downing.
on august,galen informed the va that it wanted to engage the agency protest process and requested an opportunity for discussions with the agency pursuant to federal acquisition regulations.galen also requested documentation regarding the acquisition process.however,the va supplied only the names of the bidders and denied galen request for discussions.
galen filed a formal protest with the va alleging bias and wrongful award of contract.the va took no action,and galen notified the va that it would file a protest with the general accounting office gao if the va did not address its assertions.the va responded with three letters dated august supplying additional documentation regarding the solicitation.
on august,galen filed a formal protest with the gao alleging a pattern of procurement violations.before any action by the gao,the va elected to perform corrective action and decided to permit the bidders to submit new proposals for evaluation.as part of the corrective action,the va changed the solicitation characterization of the weight of technical capability from slightly more important to significantly more important than past performance.after the va agreed to take corrective action,the gao dismissed galen protest as moot.
galen asked the va whether the new solicitation would be with or without discussions,and the va replied that the solicitation was a negotiated procurement,that all offerors had an opportunity to proposals,and that the va was currently in the negotiation process.galen submitted its new bid with a reduced price of,but did not change its technical proposal.downing bid price was unchanged.cr associates first submitted a bid price of,but later revised its proposal and lowered its price to.va contracting officer concluded that cr associates revised proposal did not meet the solicitation technical specifications,therefore,the evaluators considered only cr associates unrevised bid with a price of.
of the members of the original panel,only gloria matory was an evaluator in the action evaluation.but again,one of the evaluators for this evaluation,ron kirkpatrick,was listed as a reference by downing.kirkpatrick had been the contracting officer technical representative cotr for downing clinic.this time,the evaluators gave downing bid a score of technical and price,galen bid a score of technical and price and cr associates bid a score of technical and price.the va again awarded the contract to downing.
galen filed another protest with the gao,but after concluding that galen proposal failed to include an adequate site for the clinic and was thus ineligible for the award,the gao dismissed the case for lack of standing on april,galen filed a complaint with the united states court of federal claims pursuant to incorporating the standard of alleging that the va contract award was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.galen also asserted that va officials were biased in favor of downing during the evaluation process,a violation of e which provides,g overnment personnel involved in the acquisition shall not engage in conduct that favors one offeror over another.e.
the court of federal claims determined that,rather than rejecting galen proposal as ineligible because of a lack of an adequate facility,the va had evaluated it on the merits and reduced galen score.the court noted that galen had a substantial chance of receiving the award and therefore had standing.the court allowed limited discovery specifically,depositions were permitted only to determine what documents existed that must be considered part of the administrative record.after discovery,the parties for judgment on the administrative record.oral argument was heard on march.one week after oral argument,the court of federal claims issued an order and opinion,noting that the va may have been sloppy and that the agency could have been more forthcoming in its discussions with galen,but nonetheless granted the defendants motions for judgment on the administrative record because galen had not offered sufficient evidence of bias or any other basis for finding an arbitrary and capricious award of the contract.

a disappointed bidder may make a claim against the agency pursuant to the administrative procedure act,which states 
a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.an action in a court of the united states seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the united states or that the united states is an indispensable party.

because the bid protest at issue here involved a negotiated procurement,the protestor burden of proving that the award was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law is greater than in other types of bid protests.labarge,west,citing burroughs united states.the higher burden exists because the contracting officer engages in what is inherently a judgmental process.omega world travel united states,citing burroughs,at.t he greater the discretion granted to a contracting officer,the more difficult it will be to prove the decision was arbitrary and capricious.burroughs,at.in formally advertised bidding the pertinent statutes and regulations are far more strict about the conduct of the procurement than in a negotiated one,consequently in negotiated procurement the contracting officer is entrusted with a relatively high degree of discretion.id.
additionally,as the contract was to be awarded based on best value,the contracting officer had even greater discretion than if the contract were to have been awarded on the basis of cost alone.bliss united states,procurement officials have substantial discretion to determine which proposal represents the best value for the government.where an evaluation is challenged,we will examine the agency evaluation to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria and applicable statutes and regulations,since the relative merit of competing proposals is primarily a matter of administrative discretion.id.quoting in re general offshore,b,b,comptroller procurement decisions federal publications,at.

as a threshold matter,where,as here,a challenge to a contract award is based on alleged violations of regulation or procedure,a claimant must show a clear and prejudicial violation of applicable statutes or regulations.banknote,at quoting impresa,at.to establish prejudice,the claimant must show that there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award but for that error.statistica,christopher.downing argues galen has not suffered any prejudice because the facilities listed in its proposal did not meet the technical specifications of the va solicitation,and therefore,galen could not have been awarded the contract.the court of federal claims found that the va did not reject galen proposal because of facilities,but rather,only reduced its technical score.galen.at.the court also found that galen finished second after both evaluations,and therefore,but for the alleged errors,had a substantial chance of receiving the award.id.at.we agree,and proceed to the merits.
galen asserts the court of federal claims erred by applying an improper standard of proof to its bid protest action.specifically,galen argues the court required galen to establish bias beyond a shadow of a doubt.
we reject this argument.the court stated the standard of proof as follows 
we note first that our standard of review in bid protest cases is narrow.we may only set aside the contract if the va actions were arbitrary and capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.additionally,we assume that the government acts in good faith while contracting and a protester needs irrefragable proof that the government had an intent to injure it to overcome this presumption.the burden is therefore on the plaintiff to show that,but for the alleged error in the procurement,it likely would have been awarded the contract.a protestor burden is higher for a negotiated procurement because the contracting officer has broad discretion when engaging in an inherently judgmental process.
id.at citations omitted emphasis added.galen,however,points to the court statement during oral argument on motions for judgment on the administrative record before the court of federal claims 
it would not be possible for me to write a decision with a straight face,saying i am so well satisfied that there was bias here,or an abuse of the system to try to benefit downing that it clear beyond a shadow of a doubt and this whole procurement has to be undone.
tr.we rely on the court written opinion rather than its oral statement during a hearing on a motion for judgment on the administrative record.we conclude the court clearly stated the proper standard of proof,and we see no evidence that it applied a different standard than articulated in its opinion.
at oral argument,galen asserted that it requested depositions of all the va evaluators,but that this request was denied by the court of federal claims.however,after review of the court of federal claims status conference transcripts,we conclude that galen did not request depositions of all four action evaluators,did not object when the court of federal claims tentatively limited the depositions scope to whether certain documents existed that should be part of the administrative record,and did not properly preserve any issue of insufficient discovery for appeal.galen failure to pursue broader discovery and to object to its denial constitutes waiver of the issue and we will not consider it here.
galen also argues the court erred in not considering all the facts in their totality,but instead viewed each fact in isolation from the others.we disagree.the court stated 
plaintiff complaints regarding the initial solicitation,however,were rendered moot when the va vacated the award and agreed to amend the solicitation.on the other hand,plaintiff allegations of a pattern of bias are based on these same events as well as events relating to the amended solicitation.we will assume,without deciding,that a long pattern of questionable activity might be relevant to prove agency bias.in considering plaintiff claims,therefore,we take into account all circumstances surrounding the procurement.
galen.at emphasis added.the court then went on to address serially the multiple events of each solicitation that galen asserted as evidence of the va alleged bias in favor of downing.the court concluded its discussion of the events surrounding the action evaluations,saying,i n short,none of these assertions individually or collectively demonstrate bias.id.at emphasis added.that the court also considered galen numerous allegations one by one does not demonstrate that,despite its statement quoted above to the contrary,it actually viewed each fact only in isolation.we discern no error in the court method of analysis.
additionally,galen asserts that the court erred by ignoring or improperly discounting clear violations of the statutes and regulations governing the procurement at issue.before the court of federal claims,galen asserted that the va failed to conduct meaningful discussions with offerors after the action solicitation as was supposedly required under d.however,the court of federal claims held that the va was permitted to forego discussions by section a,which states,a ward may be made without discussions if the solicitation states that the government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.a.the court found that the va solicitation stated that the contract would be awarded without discussions.it is galen burden to show that the court finding was clearly erroneous,and we can discern no clear error.
on appeal,galen also argues that the va waived the without discussions provision and then violated d by communicating with downing but not with galen.but no evidence established any such communication with downing.the trial court did not clearly err in failing to find such communication proven.moreover,in the context of a government contract proposal,the term discussions has a specific legal definition discussions involve negotiations and are undertaken with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal.info,at quoting d.in contrast to discussions,clarifications are limited exchanges,between the government and offerors,that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.a.the regulation further states 
i f award will be made without conducting discussions,offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals,the relevance of an offeror past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond or to resolve minor or clerical errors.
a emphasis added.thus,even if the va received clarifying information from an offeror such as downing during the bidding process,such communication was not a prohibited discussion.
galen points mainly to certain changes made to downing action bid price by the contracting officer,newton,as evidence she was in improper communication discussions with downing.moreover,galen argues that erasures made by evaluators harbor and matory during the action evaluation indicate that some of those evaluators must have improperly received new information from downing 
we doubt that the va behavior before corrective action could constitute a waiver of a action solicitation provision.we need not make that determination here,because,as discussed below,galen has failed to show the va engaged in improper,indeed any,discussions with downing.the court of federal claims concluded that galen complaints regarding the initial solicitation were rendered moot when the va vacated the award and agreed to amend the solicitation.we agree that the complaints based on action events are moot where charged as a specific violation of a code or statute,but are relevant in order to establish a possible pattern of bias.
regarding newton change to downing bid price during the action solicitation,the court of federal claims found that newton change was in the nature of a correction of an obvious mathematical error,and,moreover,actually increased downing bid price.that finding of fact is correct.certainly,galen has failed to show clear error in it.galen does not contest the nature of the error in the bid,it only asserts newton must have been told to correct it by downing.however,even if an exchange of information leading to a correction of this type occurred,it would fall squarely within the definition of clarification rather than discussion.in light of the legal definition of discussions and the court finding of fact concerning the nature of the error in downing bid,we conclude that galen has failed to show clear error in the court conclusion that newton change to downing bid price was not the result of an improper discussion between newton and downing.
as to the evaluators changed score sheets,the court of federal claims stated 
the evaluator score sheets were works in progress.the lack of explicit evaluator documentation of changes by itself does not support a finding of bias.moreover,without strong evidence to the contrary,unexplained changes to the score sheets are assumed to be properly within the scope of the evaluation.
galen.at.as galen has presented no evidence to the contrary,we conclude the court finding that the score sheets were works in progress was not clearly erroneous.evaluators need not document every clerical step taken during filling out score sheets as part of the bid evaluation process.additionally,the record shows many of galen scores were explained on the face of the score sheets.galen,however,argues the absence of complete documentation of all changes demonstrates that improper discussions must have occurred.however,galen burden was to produce evidence of improper discussions,not simply advance a theory as to why changes were made to score sheets during an ongoing scoring process.in fact,galen produced no evidence,and instead asked the court of federal claims to draw inference upon inference in its favor.the court declined,and we think properly so.whether examined separately or as a whole,galen purely speculative assertions fail to support a conclusion that improper discussions occurred between the va and any offeror.accordingly,we conclude that the va did not conduct improper discussions with downing,and has not violated section d.
in addition,galen states that it adduced evidence of several examples of the va failure to properly document the proposal and award process and that the grant of judgment on so incomplete an administrative record was per se legal error.specifically,galen alleges that gaps in the administrative record prevented the court from conducting a meaningful review of the award process,and,therefore,that the contract award should be set aside.as evidence of improper gaps in documentation,galen again points to several undocumented changes in evaluators scores.as explained above,galen has failed to show clear error in the court of federal claims finding that the score sheets were works in progress.as such,they need not have been documented at every turn.also,the many comments that did appear on the score sheets themselves added information to the record and would have assisted the court to conduct a meaningful review.
galen also argues that no documentation was produced explaining the need for a second,different evaluation panel.the court of federal claims made no findings of fact on this issue.however,it is apparent from the record that the evaluation panel was changed only after galen formal protest to the gao spurred the va voluntarily to undertake corrective action and request submittal of new proposals.galen was so informed.galen has offered no reason why further explanation is necessary,and we find none.
galen also asserts that a gap in documentation arises because the instructions provided to each evaluation panel were not in written form.there again,the court made no finding of fact on this issue,but we discern from the deposition testimony of newton,the va contracting officer,that no written instructions are legally required and as a general practice,they are not provided.rather,only oral instructions are given.therefore,an absence of written instructions for the evaluators is not evidence of failure to make or keep required records,or otherwise improper.we have considered galen many other assertions concerning inadequate documentation and consider them also to lack merit.the court entered final judgment in favor of the defendants,and by implication,found that the administrative record was not so incomplete as to preclude meaningful review.we agree.
galen alleges va officials failed to provide a statement advising offerors of a debriefing in the action solicitation and failed to provide information about what documents were subject to disclosure,violations of e and.galen also alleges the va refused to engage in open and frank discussions as required by.we agree with the court of federal claims that such alleged violations were rendered moot by the order of a new solicitation by the.
galen also alleges the va violated by not establishing a source selection strategy.it is unclear from galen brief whether it is referring to the solicitation or the solicitation.the court of federal claims made no findings of fact on this issue,indeed,it is not apparent whether it was raised before this appeal.in any event,the evidence presented by galen is entirely unpersuasive.galen points only to newton deposition testimony where she states she in fact drafted a source selection strategy as reflected in the score sheets.
galen asserts that the va evaluation process manifested a conflict of interest,or that the va acted in bad faith.
galen points to an alleged conflict of interest on the evaluation panel.specifically,galen asserts that because downing listed one of the action technical evaluators as a past performance reference,the evaluation panel was tainted with a conflict of interest.the amended solicitation requested three references to validate past experience and any current contracts providing services of this type.in her proposal downing listed as past performance references tuminello,dayton,and kirkpatrick.tuminello served as an evaluator on the first round evaluation panel,and kirkpatrick served on the action panel.the action panel was comprised of six members,and the action panel had only four members.
in order to prevail on its conflict of interest claim,galen must establish a violation of statutory or regulatory conflict of interest provisions.see c.the mere presence of one of downing past performance references on each evaluation panel alone does not constitute proof of a conflict of interest.the court of federal claims commented on downing list of past performance references 
plaintiff highlights downing incumbent status and her close ties with the va as evidence of bias.for example,two of downing references participated as evaluators during the solicitation process.accepting plaintiff argument,however,would improperly penalize downing simply for the experience and familiarity with the agency she acquired as the incumbent contractor.the mere fact that downing references were included on the panel as evaluators does not support a presumption of bias.
galen.at emphasis added citing omega world travel,fed.cl.at.we agree.indeed,to the extent there is a presumption,it is that government officials act in good faith.am pro protective agency,at.
this court case law does not define conflict of interest so broadly as to include the mere listing of an evaluator as a past performance reference to validate past experience.no case so holding has been cited by galen.indeed,our precedent points to the contrary.for example,in caci,federal,we discussed whether a conflict of interest existed when four of the five members of the proposal evaluation board were alleged to have prior professional and social relationships with the vice president of the successful bidder.at.this court reversed the trial court decision that the award of the contract was arbitrary,capricious and an abuse of discretion,rejecting the argument that discussions of employment between two evaluators and the successful bidder supported reversal of the contract award,and noting that the discussions were only preliminary exploratory talks,directed to possibilities that never materialized,not negotiations,and occurred long before the department issued the request for proposals.id.at.we also rejected the argument that an increase in scores for the successful bidder in the second round of bidding showed favoritism toward that company,where the scores for the losing company were also increased and the losing company received the highest score on its technical proposal.id.at.
in contrast to the facts in caci,the va evaluation panel in the present case had only one evaluator out of four with alleged ties to downing.during the action evaluation,one of downing three references was on a panel of six technical evaluators.during the action evaluation,one reference was on a panel of four technical evaluators.moreover,there is no evidence that either tuminello or kirkpatrick had been contacted and agreed to serve as a reference for downing,and thus no evidence that they were interested in her success as opposed to simply more knowledgeable about her.indeed,va officials with direct knowledge of an incumbent service provider past performance would seem to have enhanced utility as evaluators.it was kirkpatrick prior work experience at the va that gave him insight into downing performance.the incumbent service provider then included kirkpatrick as a reference.this fact alone does not disqualify kirkpatrick as a technical evaluator in a bid solicitation involving that service provider,and neither reason nor precedent so requires.here,galen has not shown any active close or pecuniary relationship between downing and either evaluator at any time.therefore,the mere fact that downing listed an evaluator as a past performance reference does not constitute a conflict of interest.
it is also significant that no code section forbids an agency official listed as one to validate past performance reference from serving as an evaluator.this gap is especially noteworthy in light of the specificity with which the regulations restrict certain activities such as employment negotiations,receipt of gifts or favors,and disclosure of proposal information.
and even to the extent the regulations require that any conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest in relationships be avoided,galen has failed to show any potential symbiotic relationship between the technical evaluators and downing.indeed,galen has not shown that kirkpatrick or any other evaluator had any interest or any appearance of an interest in an award of the contract to downing.galen has presented no evidence of any impact an award of the contract to either downing or galen would have on any of the evaluators.for even an appearance of a conflict of interest to exist,a government official must at least appear to have some stake in the outcome of government action influenced by that individual.galen has shown no such connection here.as required by the solicitation,downing listed past performance references to validate downing past experience and any current contracts providing services of this type.the mere presence of an individual name on list of past performance references does not indicate any interest on the part of that individual in the final outcome of the evaluation.
galen further alleges that the evaluations were biased in favor of downing.in order to prevail on an allegation of bad faith,galen must show almost irrefragable proof.info.tech.applications,at.as evidence of bad faith,galen argues that an examination of the technical scores given by kirkpatrick and tuminello is instructive.during the first round,tuminello scored both galen and downing a ten on past performance and cr associates a five.galen lowest score from any evaluator for past performance was a ten,downing was an eight,and cr associates was a five.in the overall technical score,tuminello gave galen a,downing a and cr associates a.galen highest technical score received from any evaluator was a,and its lowest was an.downing highest technical score was a and her lowest was a.
during the action evaluation,kirkpatrick gave galen a six of a possible ten for past performance,galen lowest score from any evaluator.however,kirkpatrick als
