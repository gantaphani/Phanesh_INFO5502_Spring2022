appellants,a corporation and two of its officers,seek review of their convictions of various bribery charges.the government charged that appellants bribed certain officials of jefferson county,alabama in return for government contracts.the jury found appellants guilty on all charges.we have reviewed the lengthy record and find no reversible error.
background 
in,after a clean water act lawsuit alleging that untreated waste illegally entered the area rivers and streams,jefferson county county entered into a consent decree requiring the county to repair and rehabilitate its sewers and wastewater treatment plants.the cost of the rehabilitation amounted to nearly billion.
the consent decree process required the county to hire engineering firms through contracts.the jefferson county environmental services department jcesd supervised the process of rehabilitating the sewer and treatment plants.county commissioner jewell chris mcnair mcnair oversaw the operation of the jcesd,which included jcesd director jack swann swann,assistant director harry chandler chandler,and chairman,product review committee donald ellis ellis.mcnair supervised the jcesd from until his march,retirement.
mcnair decided which engineering firms to hire for the project and selected infrastructure,usi as the primary design firm.usi was awarded over million in contracts during the sewer rehabilitation project.
sohan singh singh founded usi in and remains its president and principal owner.edward key,key is vice president of usi.
mcnair owned and operated the chris mcnair studio and art gallery mcnair studio,which,as explained by his daughter kim mcnair brock brock,was a family business where we do photography,custom framing.and after a period of time,we had an art gallery and banquet facility.the mcnair studio was a private enterprise unrelated to mcnair position with the county.
on august,a federal grand jury sitting in birmingham,alabama returned a count second superseding indictment that,inter alia,charged usi,singh and key with conspiring to commit bribery by paying mcnair approximately for work not actually performed by mcnair count,bribing mcnair by giving him checks for that bogus work counts,conspiring to commit bribery by giving mcnair approximately in cash drawn from usi funds count,bribing chandler with a gift card to parisian department store count and an envelope containing in cash count,and obstructing justice by intentionally withholding documents from the grand jury and providing a false letter of compliance with the grand jury subpoena count.the indictment also charged key and usi with bribing ellis with an envelope containing in cash count.the district court severed the indictment into five separate trials,of which this trial was one.the jury found appellants guilty on all counts 
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
appellants attack the sufficiency of the evidence as to the bogus invoice scheme and the cash bribes conspiracy.appellants also claim that the government failed to prove that appellants possessed corrupt intent.
standard of review 
this circuit reviews the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and resolving all reasonable inferences and credibility issues in favor of the guilty verdicts.united states suba,cir.this circuit will not overturn a conviction on the ground of insufficient evidence unless no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states wright,cir quoting united states christo,cir.the evidence need not be inconsistent with every hypothesis other than guilt,as the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.suba,at.
bribery of mcnair 
to sustain the conspiracy convictions,the government must prove the existence of an agreement to achieve an unlawful objective,here,exchanging things of value for mcnair influence the defendant knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.suba,at.since illegal conspiracies are secretive by nature,the existence of the agreement and the defendant participation in the conspiracy may be proven entirely from circumstantial evidence.accord united states massey,cir conspiracy to commit bribery.to hold otherwise would allow defendants to escape liability with winks and nods,even when the evidence as a whole proves that there has been a meeting of the minds to exchange official action for money.massey,at quotation omitted.the meeting of the minds is provable through inferences drawn from the participants conduct or other circumstantial evidence of the scheme.united states obregon,cir.
to sustain the bribery convictions,the government must prove that appellants paid the bogus mcnair studio invoices with the corrupt intent to influence or reward mcnair.united states castro,cir.
several mcnair studio employees testified that the studio did not and could not have created the materials for which usi was billed.the evidence demonstrating the materials mcnair studio supposedly created for usi include checks by which usi paid mcnair studio,each one signed by singh mcnair studio invoices to usi that correspond to the checks usi copies of the mcnair studio invoices and the actual materials mcnair studio supposedly created and billed to usi.brock worked at the studio from through,where she handled mcnair checking account and the studio cash receipts.for each invoice brock prepared for usi,she received,either from mcnair or by fax from usi,a usi worksheet containing purchase order numbers and billing information.brock testified that without the worksheets,she would have had no idea what to put on the invoices.brock would prepare an invoice,tell her father when the invoice was finished,and then she or her sister would fax or send the invoice to usi.for every invoice shown to her at trial,brock was unaware of any work that mcnair studio performed to earn the payments that usi made pursuant to the invoices.the amount of the bogus invoices totaled nearly.in to,mcnair built an addition that more than doubled the studio size.brock was sure that mcnair could afford it,or,you know,how is he going to do something on a large scale like that,and told mcnair so.
shenita hatcher hatcher,the mcnair studio graphic designer,did not create and never saw the materials supposedly created for usi.she never created any documents while at mcnair studio that even resembled those exhibits.she was unaware of anything at mcnair studio that resembled the binders that contained the purported projects for usi.she also explained that mcnair studio did not have the lamination machine necessary to create such binders.
several usi employees testified that usi actually created the materials.angela wilson wilson explained that she or other usi employees created a series of presentations,proposals and statements of qualifications contained in the exhibits.the text for these documents came from usi files,and the materials for the documents were available at usi.usi purchased a laminating machine in.wilson did the binding and laminating herself.wilson prepared the documents at key request and did not talk to or work with mcnair studio in creating any of the documents.
mary duffy duffy,another usi employee,identified a invoice from mcnair studio for marketing and proposal services for atlanta proposal,but explained that usi prepared the proposal by using a kinko copy service.she acknowledged that the mcnair studio invoice described work that usi itself performed.
rosherren williams williams,who worked at usi for several months in,typed a series of letters of interest for key.the letters were essentially form letters that required little effort to produce.at least one letter that usi prepared after williams left the company bore williams initials as the typist.
the record is devoid of any evidence that mcnair consulted with usi in any of the projects.significantly,the jefferson county contracts awarded to usi during the relevant time strictly prohibited usi from hiring mcnair,or any other county employee,in any capacity.
usi gave mcnair studio invoices special attention.from to the middle of,usi paid its vendors weekly,and,after the middle of,paid them.in contrast,usi typically paid mcnair studio either that day or the day after usi received mcnair invoices.while singh did not typically checks to any other vendor,singh routinely delivered the check to either mcnair or his studio.
usi gave preferential treatment to jcesd officials,particularly mcnair.singh told duffy that t he department heads at jefferson county were considered friends of the company,and we were to treat him with the utmost respect and generally be friends with them.a usi document said that when sohan is here,he will only take calls from clients,county officials,and other vip.the document listed people to be put through to sohan,without question,with mcnair at the top,followed by other jcesd officials.
mcnair admitted to william dawson dawson,an engineering contractor who received contracts from the jcesd between and,that singh bribed him.dawson was convicted separately of paying bribes to mcnair.dawson testified that mcnair called him in late and asked for money,telling him that singh had been helping him pay his mortgage,but that singh had stopped doing so.specifically,dawson testified that mcnair said that singh had been making a note for him mcnair,and that he had to quit doing that,and he was behind and he needed some help.dawson explained that the agreement was reached that i would buy a framed piece of art that was in his studio for.
as this circuit noted in suba,a common purpose or plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.at quotation omitted.the evidence shows an extended plan or scheme by usi,a company that received million dollars in government contracts over a period of years,to pass nearly through bogus invoice payments to the county commissioner almost wholly responsible for that million.the large sum of money on both sides strongly suggests a common goal to increase each other wealth through illegal means.see,united states poole,cir intent to distribute illegal drugs can be shown from the quantity of drugs involved united states perez,cir same.in united states sutherland,cir,maynard and walker each collected numerous traffic tickets that were favorably disposed of by sutherland,a municipal court judge.significantly,for any specific ticket there was no evidence that the ticket was delivered by walker or maynard to sutherland,that money was delivered by walker or maynard to sutherland,or that sutherland favorably disposed of the ticket in exchange for such money.at.nevertheless,this court affirmed their conspiracy convictions based on the overwhelming circumstantial evidence introduced by the government.id.
the record is more than sufficient to sustain the jury verdict on the bogus invoice conspiracy.to the extent appellants challenge the substantive bribery convictions based on the same arguments,this challenge is also rejected.
appellants also claim that the government failed to prove that the usi defendants intended to reward and influence mcnair.yet mcnair admitted to dawson that singh had been paying his mortgage.
the cash bribes conspiracy 
the indictment charged a pattern of substantial cash withdrawals from usi funds and comparable cash deposits by mcnair into his personal bank account at similar times.mcnair deposits totaled in december,in january,and in july.mcnair gave brock the cash and told her to complete deposit slips for him or to make the deposits herself.although brock did not know where her father got the cash for the deposits,she knew it did not come from the mcnair studio register or cash box and was not reflected in any of mcnair studio books.brock thought it unusual that her father had so much cash,but when she asked him about it,h e would tell us to just do what he asked,to make the deposit,or whatever he asked us to do.mcnair had no business other than mcnair studio.
the same day or the days immediately preceding mcnair deposits,key and singh would cash usi checks or withdraw thousands of dollars in cash,sometimes in amounts identical to the mcnair deposits,from accounts at compass bank and amsouth bank in birmingham 
in january,key deposited a check from usi into a newly opened personal account at compass bank and immediately began a series of withdrawals the following month key deposited a second check into the account,and the withdrawals continued.in july,key deposited a third check,this time into his account at amsouth bank.
the day before the first check was issued to key,singh requested two checks from usi.the first check was for,the second was for.usi issued the checks after singh said that he had loaned money to the company and he wanted to be reimbursed.usi accounting records did not indicate that usi owed singh.an fbi agent testified that he traced the check to a new account in the name of singh and his son in nashville.the second check to key came from this account.
when questioned about his usi stock and his inability to account for the three checks that he deposited to his accounts,key made inconsistent claims that he gave his stock back for free and that he was paid for that same stock.key also claimed that he did not recall receiving and depositing a check,which was similarly incredible.the evidence showed that much of the was withdrawn in roughly increments at times when mcnair was making similar cash deposits.the record was more than adequate to support the jury guilty verdicts on count.nor are the two conspiracies inconsistent in theory evidence establishing appellants participation in the bogus invoice conspiracy also supports appellants participation in the cash bribes conspiracy.
bribery of chandler and ellis 
key and singh told chandler of their intent to hide the fact that they had given things of value to jefferson county employees.in and,key gave chandler various gifts,including a gift card for parisian department store worth,cash,a watch,and another in cash.chandler,assisting the government,recorded a conversation in which key told him that the cash chandler received ai ever going to come to light here.key added you do need to worry about that,that never come up you do need to be scared because never gon na come up.when chandler said he was scared that be a paper trail for the gift card,key responded,there is nothing on that either,t here no connection to you or anybody else,i not gon na expose you to anything.
chandler also recorded a conversation with singh.when chandler referred to the parisian gift card,singh said no.we never gave you nothing.you should even think about that you know.singh said that all i saying,sir,for your convenience kinda thing that never happened here.
additionally,in,key gave ellis an envelope containing cash,saying that the money was for ellis and another county employee to take a business trip for which the county would not pay ellis expenses.ellis took both the money and the trip.key also gave ellis at least one gift card for parisian department store,that ellis believed was worth,as an easter gift in.
key told the fbi that neither he nor usi had ever given a gift greater than to any government official.usi letter of compliance with the grand jury subpoena stated likewise.the subpoena requested records of a ny and all payments made directly or indirectly by usi by any of its officers for the benefit of any current or former elected or appointed public officials or employees usi letter of compliance,which key signed,purported to provide a listing of all payments made by usi and its officers,explained that key gave gifts to usi clients every christmas,and stated in all cases these gifts were valued at less than each.
appellants claim that the evidence established only that gifts were given to chandler and ellis and that there is no evidence that those gifts were given with the requisite corrupt intent to influence.the nature and size of the gifts belie their claim,however.key and singh expressed their intent to chandler to hide the fact that those gifts were given and carried out that intent in both fbi interviews and usi letter of compliance with the grand jury subpoena.the record was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that the payments to chandler and ellis were bribes.
obstruction of justice 
key expressly told the fbi that neither he nor usi had ever given a gift greater than,and usi letter of compliance,which key signed,stated likewise.key never revealed the he gave to ellis or the he gave to chandler.substantial evidence supports the jury verdict on the obstruction of justice conviction.
evidentiary rulings 
appellants challenge the admissibility of dawson testimony about mcnair statement that singh was helping mcnair pay his mortgage.the district court considered the admissibility of dawson testimony at both a pretrial hearing and again just before dawson testified.the court pretrial order held that dawson testimony would be admissible to show intent,knowledge,and a common plan or scheme under federal rule of evidence b.during the pretrial hearing,the district court asked several questions indicating that mcnair statement was admissible as that of a pursuant to.d.appellants arguments below and to this court assume that such was the basis on which this evidence was admitted.
the government does not argue on appeal that dawson testimony was admissible under rule d.during closing argument,defense counsel referred to dawson testimony as if it had been admitted for the truth of the matter asserted in mcnair statement that singh had been paying mcnair note accordingly,the government maintains that the statement was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under rule b.
a district court evidentiary rulings are reviewed only for a clear abuse of discretion,united states mclean,cir,and this court will not hold that the district court abused its discretion where it reached the correct result even if it did so for the wrong reason.united states samaniego,cir.see also united states maliszewski,cir holding that declarant statement to his wife that someone was trying to remove him from a loop was not admissible under rule d e but was admissible under rule b even though district court did not consider the applicability of rule b as to that statement.
a hearsay statement that inculpates the accused is admissible if the declarant is unavailable the statement so far tends to subject the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable person in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true and the statement is corroborated by circumstances clearly indicating its trustworthiness.united states costa,cir.
mcnair was unavailable within the meaning of rule a because he was a codefendant under the same indictment as appellants and,therefore,could not be called as a witness.united states georgia waste,cir accord united states robbins,cir.
rule b is founded on the commonsense notion that reasonable people,even reasonable people who are not especially honest,tend not to make statements unless they believe them to be true.williamson united states,d.whether the declarant statement is against the declarant penal interest can only be answered in light of all the surrounding circumstances.id.at.at.mcnair statement that singh had been paying mcnair note was against mcnair penal interest as it tended to show he had accepted bribes.see united states ford,cir united states centracchio,cir admission by former police chief to receipt of cash bribes during plea allocution was,abrogated on other grounds,crawford washington,d.
furthermore,mcnair statement was truly inculpatory to him only because it did not seek to lessen blame as to his crime by spreading blame to others.centracchio,at.see also williamson,at.at contrasting statements with those merely attempt ing to shift blame or curry favor.
the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing as to whether mcnair statement was against his interest,which appellants claim is reversible error.where a district court erroneously admits evidence under rule d e,an appellate court may review the evidence to determine whether the evidence was admissible pursuant to rule b even if the district court did not consider the applicability of rule b.
finally,mcnair statement is trustworthy because it is unlikely,judging from the circumstances,that the statement was fabricated.united states jernigan,cir quoting united states gomez,cir.given the context of mcnair relationship with dawson,mcnair had no reason to lie about singh payments.dawson had previously bribed mcnair and was a confidant of mcnair with regard to the bribery scheme.courts have found that statements are sufficiently corroborated where the evidence presented at trial supports the veracity of the statement and where the declarant makes the statement to someone with whom he shares a close relationship.see united states shukri,cir allowing hearsay statements pursuant to rule b because evidence at trial supported truthfulness of the statements and because declarant made the statements to his who was a confederate in the theft conspiracy at issue.see also robbins,at deeming declarant statement to his fiancé trustworthy under rule b united states barone,cir deeming trustworthy hearsay declarant statement pursuant to b because statement was made to declarant sister united states matthews,cir deeming statements trustworthy because declarant made them in private to his girlfriend.the statement at issue here was not a custodial statement made to law enforcement officials,thereby obviating any concern that mcnair was attempting to curry favor with the government by shifting blame to another individual.as discussed above,the evidence presented at trial was more than sufficient to demonstrate that mcnair and singh were operating a bribery conspiracy.
upholding the admission of dawson testimony comports with singh rights under the confrontation clause.the supreme court held in crawford that testimonial evidence from an absent witness is admissible only if the witness is both unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to subject the declarant to.at.at.given that mcnair statement to dawson was part of a private conversation,it is nontestimonial within the meaning of crawford,and crawford strict confrontation clause requirements do not apply.see united states brown,cir noting that the crawford rule applies only to testimonial evidence id.at private conversation was not made under examination,was not transcribed in a formal document,and was not made under circumstances leading an objective person to reasonably believe the statement would be available for use at a later trial.thus,it is not testimonial and its admission is not barred by crawford.
electrical engineer gus henson henson testified that he approached mcnair for a government contract after he worked for free for mcnair studio.in,henson designed the electrical,plumbing,and systems for the mcnair studio addition,using elevations sent to him by usi.had henson billed for the project,he would have charged.after henson prepared the mcnair studio designs,he met with mcnair to ask about getting work from the jcesd.
mcnair said there may be a possibility and said i needed to talk with swann.before henson left,mcnair placed a call to a secretary to see about getting henson an appointment with swann.mcnair then asked chandler to see if we could develop a project that henson engineering could perform,and chandler secretary set up a meeting between swann,chandler and henson.at that meeting,henson proposed a stream monitoring system and was awarded a contract to build that system.because henson was not able to do the work that jcesd typically required,chandler developed a project that primarily was electrical and controls in nature at mcnair request.
the district court allowed henson testimony on the grounds that it was inextricably intertwined with the charged offenses because the government had established the requisite linkage or nexus between appellants and henson testimony.this circuit has long held that evidence of criminal activity other than the crime charged is not extrinsic under rule b if the evidence is inextricably intertwined with evidence of the charged offense,wright,at cir gomez,at.rule b does not apply when the other act evidence is linked in time and circumstances with the charged crime and concerns the context,motive or setup of the crime or forms an integral part of the crime or is necessary to complete the story of the crime,wright,at.moreover,
rule b does not specifically apply to exclude this evidence because it involves an extraneous offense committed by someone other than the defendant.the evidence was not introduced to show that the defendant has a criminal disposition and that he can be expected to act in conformity therewith,so the policies underlying rule b are inapplicable.
united states morano,cir quotation omitted accord united states meester,cir.in gomez,gomez was charged with importing and conspiring to import cocaine.the court allowed evidence that zuluago entered into a drug transaction two months after gomez arrest because a book found in gomez car contained zuluago phone number,and another witness testified that he discussed zuluago drug activity with gomez.at.this court upheld the admission of that evidence as inextricably intertwined because of its relevan ce to the scheme and chain of events surrounding the charged importation conspiracy.id.similarly in meester,the court held that evidence that an unindicted had engaged in crimes similar to those charged against the defendants was admissible because it served to establish a background for the later substantive acts charged in the indictment and was therefore relevant to prove the existence and purpose of the ongoing conspiracies.at.and in united states smith,cir,this court found evidence of a third party bank robbery inextricably intertwined with the bank robbery with which defendant was charged because strong links and integral links between the two established similar modus operandi.
the trial court reasoned that henson testimony would tend to be evidence of a common plan,scheme and design of how business was being carried on in the environmental services department at that time.the link was not only that singh was with mcnair when henson approached mcnair for a jcesd contract,but also that usi had sent henson the mcnair studio elevations that henson needed to perform his design work for the studio.henson testimony was relevant to the chain of events surrounding the charged crimes,including context and setup specifically,that singh had knowledge of mcnair willingness to exchange his influence for things of value as well as the opportunity to take advantage of that willingness.indeed,usi,which itself performed free services for the mcnair studio renovation,assisted henson in also performing free services for mcnair by giving henson the elevations that he needed to construct the engineering designs.
appellants are wrong that henson testimony should have been excluded under rule on grounds of undue prejudice.rule is an extraordinary remedy that must be used sparingly because it results in the exclusion of concededly probative evidence,wright,at.thus,in cases where this court has found other acts evidence inextricably intertwined with the crimes charged,the court has refused to find that the evidence should nonetheless be excluded as unduly prejudicial,even when the other acts included evidence of violent crimes such as bank robbery,murder and arson.see smith,at united states fortenberry,cir united states morano,cir.even appellants own cited authority explains that the test under rule is whether the other acts evidence was dragged in by the heels solely for prejudicial impact.united states veltmann,cir.given the strong connection between henson testimony and the crimes charged,such was not the case here.in any event,henson did not implicate any of the appellants in a crime.thus,if his testimony was admitted in error,that error was harmless,united states jones,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.
appellants proffered experts 
various cash withdrawals from singh funds were taken to india to finance singh son wedding,which cost the singhs between and.singh wife,kusum singh singh admitted on that the cash taken to india for the wedding came from two cash withdrawals made by her husband from their private sun trust bank account in nashville.those cash withdrawals totaled.singh and several other witnesses explained that because american dollars command large discounts in india,and because the indian bureaucracy makes obtaining cash from checks or wire transfers very difficult,it is common practice to take american dollars into india whenever traveling there.appellants maintain that the cash withdrawals were solely for the purpose of financing the wedding.
several defense witnesses testified at length about indian culture generally and indian weddings specifically.the government never disputed that the singhs wedding costs were about,or that those costs were paid for in cash taken to india in increments.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded a wedding planner testimony regarding the customs,obligations and social pressures associated with the lavishness of an indian wedding,a jewelry expert testimony regarding the expense and value of jewelry purchased in association with the wedding in question,and an indian economist testimony about india and the importance of united states currency in that culture.
a district court has broad discretion in deciding whether to permit expert testimony.united states frazier,cir.exclusion of expert testimony will constitute reversible error only if it is manifestly erroneous,id.at quotation omitted,or had a substantial impact on the outcome of trial.united states paradies,cir quoting united states sellers,cir.
the excluded testimony was both cumulative and irrelevant.the jury would have learned nothing from expert witnesses that it did not already know and,in fact,was the wedding was very expensive and paid for by large amounts of cash sent to india for that purpose.see,frazier,at expert testimony can be excluded if it is cumulative.the issue was whether the cash for the wedding came from singh personal sun trust account in nashville or whether it came from the birmingham cash transactions the indictment alleged were used to bribe mcnair.none of the proffered defense testimony would have addressed that issue.thus,the court did not abuse its discretion by excluding that testimony.
jury instructions 
appellants maintain that the trial court instructions regarding the substantive charges failed to allow the jury the opportunity to consider their theory of the evidence.while a court should instruct a jury on the defendant defense theory if the theory has a foundation in evidence and legal support,united states schlei,cir quotation omitted,a theory of the defense instruction is not required when the charge given adequately covers the substance of the requested instruction.united states ndiaye,cir.refusing to give a proposed instruction is reversible error only when the proposed instruction is correct,the instruction was not addressed in the charge actually given,and the failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant ability to present an effective defense.united states,cir.
after the court provided the parties with a copy of its draft instructions,it asked if there was any request for revision by defense counsel appellants asked the court to include in its charge the final paragraph of its proposed instruction,stating that bribery requires a specific quid pro quo.the court refused that instruction.appellants then asked the court to give their proposed instruction,that holiday gifts to public officials are not illegal so long as such items are not given with the intent to corrupt.the court refused appellants specific language explaining i think i cover this adequately in my instructions appellants raised no further objections.after the court charged the jury,it specifically inquired if there were a ny exceptions to the oral charge of the court by any attorneys for the defendants.appellants replied 
your honor,we just reiterate the previous requests to include the instructions regarding quid pro quo that we had previously asked the court for.but other than that,there are no further exceptions.
emphasis added.
appellants now claim that the district court erred by refusing its proposed instructions thru yet they never objected to the court decision not to include their instructions.while they originally objected to the court decision not to include their instruction,after the court explained that its draft instructions cover this adequately,they did not object to the charge as given.thus,appellants claims of error with respect to their instructions have been waived,and can be reviewed only for plain error.paradies,at.
similarly,the specific claim of error appellants raise concerning their instructions were never raised in the district court.appellants asked the court to include in its charge the final paragraph of their proposed instruction,that bribery requires a specific quid pro quo,but said nothing about the court decision not to give earlier language in that same instruction.appellants do not complain about the district court failure to use their proposed quid pro quo paragraph.instead,they complain that the court refused to include earlier language in the proposed instruction that states that only prohibits those gifts to government officials that are given with the intent to influence or reward.they further complain that the court should have included their proposed instruction definition of corruptly.because these claims were never raised below,they were waived.
in any event,the court did not err by refusing any of appellants proposed instructions because the charge given by the court adequately covered appellants theories of the defense.indeed,the words they claim the court should have used are virtually identical to the words the court actually used.specifically,the court charged the jury that to convict any defendant of bribery under section,it must find that the defendant knowingly gave things of value to a government employee,and in doing so acted corruptly in intend ing to influence or reward that government employee.the court defined acting corruptly as an act performed voluntarily,deliberately,and dishonestly for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful end or result,or for the purpose of accomplishing some otherwise lawful end or lawful result by an unlawful means or unlawful method.the court then expressly charged that not all gifts to government employees are unlawful 
section does not prohibit all gifts to a public official or governmental agent,but only those gifts that are given with the corrupt intent to influence or reward 
thus,the jury could not convict unless it found that the particular payment to mcnair was made with the corrupt intent to influence or reward.since a jury is presumed to follow the court instructions,it could not have convicted appellants because they made legitimate payments for services rendered.rather,the jury must have found that payments were made with the corrupt intent to influence or reward mcnair.because a defendant is not entitled to his specific wording so long as the charge given accurately states the requested proposition,united states duff,cir,the court refusal to give appellants instructions was not plain error.
the court refusal to give appellants instruction was not erroneous.the court expressly charged that section does not prohibit all gifts to public officials,only those given with the corrupt intent to influence.adding instruction additional language about holiday gifts would have added nothing because any gift given without the requisite corrupt intent would be lawful,while an alleged gift given during respective holiday seasons,but given with a corrupt intent,would be unlawful.
to the extent that appellants press their quid pro quo argument,the district court instructions adequately addressed that issue.this court has rejected the argument that the government must show a direct quid pro quo relationship between the defendants and an agent of the agency receiving federal funds.castro,at paradies,at accord united states jennings,cir a payment need not be correlated with a specific official act the intended exchange in bribery can be this for these or these for these,not just this for that.appellants quid pro quo instruction was,therefore,an incorrect statement of the law.the district court correctly explained to the jury that the government was required to prove that appellants acted corruptly in giving things of value to a county official with the intent to influence or reward that official in connection with any business transaction,or series of transactions.given these and other instructions charged to the jury,the court did not commit plain error by refusing appellants quid pro quo instruction.paradies,at.
grand jury issue 
appellants claim that after they were charged in the june superceding indictment,the government abused the grand jury process by subsequently using the grand jury for the primary purpose of preparing for trial on those charges.
a defendant claiming grand jury abuse has the burden of showing that the government use of the grand jury was improperly motivated,united states leung,cir.while the grand jury can not be used solely or even primarily to gather evidence against an indicted defendant it can be used to investigate whether a defendant committed crimes not covered in the indictment,united states brothers const.of ohio,cir united states alred,cir.t he law presumes,absent a strong showing to the contrary,that a grand jury acts within the legitimate scope of its authority.united states enterprises,d accord alred,at.
the grand jury did not charge appellants with any crime in its february,indictment.appellants were first charged with bribing chandler and ellis and obstructing justice in the june,superceding indictment.while the second superceding indictment expanded the charges against appellants,the new charges all concerned appellants bribery of mcnair.
magistrate judge putnam concluded that there was no grand jury abuse after holding a hearing that included reviewing the transcripts of the usi employees who testified in the grand jury after appellants were first indicted.although seven usi employees testified before the grand jury in august,judge putnam found that only two employees testimony addressed charges in the superceding indictment.judge putnam further found that m ost of the questioning of those two employees dealt with payments made or dealings with mcnair,not chandler or ellis.thus,judge putnam correctly concluded that,on this record,it can not be said that the sole or principal purpose of the grand jury process was for discovery relevant to the offenses.see,alred,at united states beasley,cir.
appellants incorrectly state that key was convicted of obstruction of justice in count,for allegedly failing to properly comply with the april grand jury subpoena,while he was under indictment.emphasis added.count charged appellants with providing a false letter of compliance with the grand jury subpoena.on may,prior to any usi defendant being indicted,key signed a letter on behalf of appellants claiming that the largest gift he had given to any government employee was valued at less than.this letter was false in light of key much larger gifts to chandler and ellis.key was convicted of obstruction for actions he took prior to his indictment.the november subpoena was issued to investigate possible tax evasion by key,but never generated any documents and,in fact,provided the government with no information.
because the government did not use the grand jury primarily to obtain evidence that appellants bribed chandler or ellis or obstructed justice,appellants grand jury abuse claim is rejected.
sixth amendment issue 
the june superceding indictment was sealed for one month to allow the government to continue investigating appellants bribery of mcnair.while the indictment was sealed,the fbi arranged,through usi counsel chriss doss doss,a july,interview with key at doss office.doss was present at the interview.the fbi agent believed that doss was key attorney.the magistrate judge and the district court concluded that the agent belief was reasonable.
the interview concerned almost exclusively the formation of usi,key role in the company,usi and key dealings with mcnair and mcn
