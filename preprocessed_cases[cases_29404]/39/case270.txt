monte mcfall mcfall,a former lobbyist and local elected official,stands convicted of nine counts of attempted extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion,six counts of honest services mail fraud,and two counts of attempted witness tampering,b.he was sentenced to months imprisonment and a fine.
on appeal,mcfall challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the attempted extortion counts and and conspiracy to commit extortion count convictions,the jury instructions relating to the government official right theory of attempted extortion count,and the district court exclusion of exculpatory grand jury testimony on count we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse these five convictions.
background 
the charges against mcfall concern corrupt profiteering among a group of state and local officials in san joaquin county,california.the principal players are neat allen sawyer sawyer,a former prosecutor in the san joaquin county district attorney office and,at the time of the events at issue,the chief deputy director of the governor office of criminal justice planning ocjp,baxter dunn dunn,former sheriff of san joaquin county,lynn bedford bedford,former san joaquin county supervisor,and mcfall,a lobbyist and former member of the board of trustees of water reclamation district the reclamation district responsible for maintenance of a portion of the levees along the san joaquin river 
dunn,sawyer,and mcfall worked in concert to support bedford candidacy for a county supervisor seat that had become vacant in.they raised money and solicited political support on his behalf.bedford was ultimately appointed to the open seat.although he had no official staff position,mcfall represented himself as bedford proxy,and the government introduced evidence that bedford told others that mcfall spoke for him.
shortly after bedford appointment,dunn,sawyer,and mcfall formed two entities,msd ventures,short for mcfall,sawyer,dunn and smtm partners,lp,short for show me the money.the partners sought to further their own private economic interests through the exercise of public powers,and specifically through their ties to bedford.the government filed a final superseding indictment the indictment against all four men on september.bedford,sawyer,and dunn all pleaded guilty between january,roughly two weeks before their joint trial was set to begin.sawyer and dunn each pleaded to one count of honest services mail fraud,and were sentenced to serve prison terms and of home confinement.bedford pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements in violation of,and received of home confinement and three years probation.
as a part of their plea agreements,sawyer and dunn both agree d to cooperate fully with the government with respect to its investigations and prosecutions of public corruption in the eastern district of california and elsewhere.prosecutors ultimately elected not to call either man as a witness at mcfall trial,despite their authority to do so pursuant to the plea agreements.when mcfall sought to call sawyer,bedford,and dunn as defense witnesses,each invoked his fifth amendment right not to testify.
on march,a jury returned a verdict convicting mcfall of attempted extortion,conspiracy to commit extortion,honest services mail fraud,and witness tampering.the jury convicted mcfall of seventeen of the twenty counts charged in the indictment and acquitted him on three counts of mail fraud.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment and a maximum sentence in the advisory guidelines range.with respect to the counts disposed of in this opinion,the relevant facts are as follows.
the calpine scheme counts,and 
in,calpine corporation calpine and sunlaw energy corporation sunlaw were competing to secure the right to build a power plant at a site in the port of stockton mcfall and his partners acting through their smtm partnership entered into a consulting contract with sunlaw under which the partners stood to reap substantial financial rewards if sunlaw obtained the right to build at the port of stockton site,and an even greater sum if the plant was actually built.according to the evidence,mcfall and his partners sought to undermine calpine chances of prevailing at the port of stockton by mounting political opposition to another pending calpine project in neighboring alameda county.
calpine was in the process of securing a permit from the california energy commission cec for its alameda county project.mcfall warned calpine representatives that if they did not drop their bid for the port of stockton site,he would use his political influence to create a public outcry over the project,thereby complicating the permitting process.after calpine declined to withdraw its bid,mcfall and his partners conspired to pass a resolution through the san joaquin county board of supervisors raising environmental,health,and safety concerns about calpine alameda county project.dunn appeared at the meeting and denounced calpine project as a threat to public safety.bedford sponsored the resolution,and it passed.the resolution was then transmitted to the cec.the indictment charged that this conduct amounted to attempted extortion counts and and conspiracy to commit extortion count under color of official right,in violation of the hobbs act.
the golden state developers scheme count 
in,mcfall contacted an attorney that represented golden state developers golden state and invited him to a fundraiser for bedford.a few weeks after attending the event,the attorney and another golden state representative met with bedford and mcfall at bedford county office.the participants discussed golden state pending development projects,and bedford indicated that mcfall could help them with the process of securing the necessary permits.prosecutors introduced evidence that mcfall later communicated to golden state representatives that he could deliver bedford vote in favor of their development proposals if they paid mcfall between and.the indictment charged that this conduct amounted to attempted extortion under color of official right in violation of the hobbs act.
the digital angel corporation scheme count 
in late,the state ocjp awarded a grant to the digital angel corporation digital angel to fund a pilot project whereby the california department of corrections would utilize the company electronic tracking devices.in january,sawyer then chief deputy director of ocjp and mcfall met with robert levy,a lobbyist for digital angel,in sacramento to discuss potential collaboration.digital angel was seeking additional funding from ocjp,and sawyer indicated that mcfall could be of assistance.
a few weeks after the meeting,levy received a draft memorandum of understanding mou from mcfall daughter proposing an agreement between digital angel parent company and the stagecoach corporation an entity mcfall created and controlled.under the proposed mou,digital angel would pay a fee to a consultant that stagecoach would later name.levy complained about the agreement to sawyer,who urged him to work with mcfall and,according to levy,stated that ocjp funding would not materialize without mcfall help.digital angel did not agree to the terms of the mou and had no further dealings with mcfall.the indictment charged that mcfall and sawyer conduct amounted to conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right in violation of the hobbs act.
proceedings 
mcfall dismissed his trial counsel after the defense rested its case,and delivered closing argument on his own behalf.after his conviction,mcfall retained new counsel,who promptly filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.the district court held a evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial,and denied the motion on july.mcfall timely appealed.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence on counts,and 
mcfall contends that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to support his conviction on counts,and in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.we review the district court interpretation of the applicable statute,in this case the hobbs act,de novo.see united states brannan,cir.
the hobbs act defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right.b.mcfall was charged under an official right theory of extortion.the government contended that he and his collaborators manufactured political opposition to a pending calpine project in order to coerce the company into withdrawing its bid to build a power plant at the port of stockton according to the government,mcfall sought to obtain a term the statute does not property interest in bidding for the right to built a power plant at the port of stockton for sunlaw,his client.
we have stated that hobbs act extortion is a offense,which does not occur when a victim is merely forced to part with property.united states panaro,cir.instead,there must be an obtaining the extortioner or a third receive the property of which the victim is deprived.id.in scheidler national organization for women,d,the supreme court reached the same conclusion,holding that who obstructed access to abortion clinics did not obtain the clinics property within the meaning of the hobbs act.the court explained that the hobbs act obtaining element requires a showing that a defendant received something of value from the victim of the alleged extortion,and that the thing of value can be exercised,transferred or sold.thus,conduct that merely interfere s with or depriv es someone of property is not sufficient,standing alone,to constitute hobbs act extortion.id 
mcfall argues that the government did not even he attempted to obtain calpine property within the meaning of the hobbs act.the indictment charged mcfall and his collaborators with attempt ing to obtain from calpine corporation a financial benefit not due any of them,that is,its right to solicit business in san joaquin county,to bid on the construction of a power plant and to construct a power plant at the port of stockton.in essence,mcfall argues,the government charged him with employing coercion to derail calpine bid to build a power plant at the port of stockton,thereby increasing the probability,at least theoretically,that sunlaw would secure the right to build the plant at the contested site.
we agree that decreasing a competitor chance of winning a contract,standing alone,does not amount to obtaining a transferable asset for oneself or one client.neither calpine nor sunlaw had a vested right to build at the contested site,and there was no guarantee that either company would secure such a right.the district court concluded that mcfall improper attempt to secure a business advantage satisfied the hobbs act obtaining element,but this formulation fails to account for scheidler principal point to violate the hobbs act,an alleged extortionist must actually appropriate or attempt to appropriate the victim property such that it can be exercised,transferred or sold.id.at.it is not enough to gain some speculative benefit by hindering a competitor.
moreover,scheidler made clear that the rule of lenity applies to ambiguous applications of the hobbs act.id.at.see also united states enmons,d.thus,even if a coherent argument could be made that attempting to thwart calpine bid to build a plant at the port of stockton amounted to an attempt to obtain an increased probability of winning a right to build for sunlaw,we must resolve the ambiguity in favor of mcfall.see mcnally united states,d w hen there are two rational readings of a criminal statute,one harsher than the other,we are to choose the harsher only when congress has spoken in clear and definite language.
the government stresses that scheidler expressly left intact a lower court decision assigning an expansive definition to the term property as used in the act.see at.explaining that the holding does not disturb the second circuit decision in united states tropiano,cir,where the court concluded that the intangible right to solicit refuse collection accounts constituted property within the hobbs act definition internal quotation marks omitted.tropiano,however,does not help the government to satisfy the hobbs act obtaining element.even assuming that the intangible right to bid on a power plant site constitutes property for hobbs act purposes,the government must establish that mcfall attempted to acquire that property right such that he alone could sell,transfer,or exercise it.united states gotti,cir holding that scheidler effected a general tightening of the hobbs act obtaining requirement,but did not undermine second circuit precedent holding that intangible property rights can qualify as extortable property even assuming that the right to submit a bid is property within the meaning of the hobbs act,mcfall did not,and indeed could not,attempt to exercise calpine right to submit a bid.instead,according to the evidence introduced at trial,he sought to increase sunlaw odds of prevailing on its own bid by restricting the activities of a that can not amount to obtaining under scheidler.
because the evidence did not establish,nor did the indictment allege,that mcfall obtained or attempted to obtain any property or intangible right from calpine,we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction under counts,and,and reverse the conviction on those counts.
ii.count jury instruction 
mcfall argues that the district court jury instruction on count omitted a necessary element of the offense.we review de novo whether jury instructions accurately state the elements of a statutory crime.united states hicks,cir.
mcfall contends that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that a finding of aiding and abetting supervisor bedford,or conspiring with him,was necessary to convict mcfall of attempted extortion under claim of official right.the district court gave the following instruction on count 
t he defendant is charged with attempting to extort golden state developers in connection with a project in san joaquin county in or about.in order for the defendant to be found guilty of that charge,the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt.first,that lynn bedford was a public official.second,that the defendant attempted to obtain property in return for the taking or withholding of some official action by lynn bedford.third,that the defendant attempted to obtain property to which he knew he was not entitled.fourth,commerce or the movement of an article or commodity in commerce from one state to another would have been affected in some way.and fifth,the defendant did something that was a substantial step toward committing the crime of attempted extortion,with all of you agreeing as to what constituted a substantial step.
as the seventh circuit has explained,as a general matter proceeding against private citizens on an official right theory is inappropriate under the literal and historical meaning of the hobbs act,irrespective of the actual control that citizen purports to maintain over governmental activity.united states mcclain,cir see also united states freeman,cir noting that the majority of hobbs act cases arising under an official right theory involve prosecutions of elected or appointed officials following the other circuits that have addressed the issue,the sixth circuit has held that a private citizen who is not in the process of becoming a public official may be convicted of hobbs act extortion under a color of official right theory only if that private citizen either conspires with,or aids and abets,a public official in the act of extortion.united states saadey,cir accord united states tomblin,cir noting that every decision upholding a private citizen hobbs act conviction under an official right theory involved a public official in some past,present,or future capacity receiving money united states margiotta,cir affirming a private citizen hobbs act conviction where the defendant aided and abetted a public official extortion,overruled on other grounds by mcnally united states,d.
mcfall himself made no claim of official right.he claimed to have outsized political influence,but did not represent himself to golden state representatives as a public official or as an employee or agent of a public official.mcfall criminal act was,according to the government theory,his claim that he had significant influence over bedford,and could affect his votes on matters of importance to golden state if the company representatives paid and.
the sixth circuit decision in saadey is closely on point.in saadey,the government charged a private citizen with hobbs act extortion under an official right theory,alleging that the defendant attempted to solicit money under the pretense that the money would be used to bribe an uncharged public official.saadey,at.the public official had been acquitted on all charges of conspiracy,and the government did not offer evidence indicating that he had knowledge of the defendant scheme.id.at.because the district court refused to charge the jury on the issue of aiding and abetting,the sixth circuit determined that the defendant hobbs act conviction could not stand.id.
the government relies on our decision in freeman,which upheld an extortion under claim of official right conviction against a legislative aide that represented himself as a proxy for his boss,a state assemblywoman.see freeman,at.freeman,however,can not bear the weight the government ascribes to it.the holding reaches only the conduct of government officials that actually exercise official powers,even if those powers correspond to an and unappointed position.id.
alternatively,the government argues that the district court articulation of the second element of the offense encompasses aiding and abetting.the instruction described that element as requiring a finding that mcfall attempted to obtain property in return for the taking or withholding of some official action by lynn bedford.that articulation,however,does not require a finding that bedford himself attempted to extort money from golden state which would necessarily include a finding that bedford himself possessed the requisite criminal intent see united states sayetsitty,cir the elements necessary to convict an individual under an aiding and abetting theory are that the accused had the specific intent to facilitate the commission of a crime by another,that the accused had the requisite intent of the underlying substantive offense,that the accused assisted or participated in the commission of the underlying substantive offense,and that someone committed the underlying substantive offense.in other words,the jury could have interpreted the instruction as requiring no more than a claim that bedford would act in a certain way if a bribe was paid to mcfall,regardless of whether bedford himself intended to extort funds from golden state,or was even aware of mcfall scheme.
the district court,in denying mcfall motion for a new trial,concluded that a private individual may be prosecuted under an official right theory of hobbs act liability if the individual parades his control or influence over a public official in alleged concert with such official.the court statement is supportable as far as it goes,but fails to acknowledge that the jury was not instructed on the issue of whether mcfall actually acted in concert with bedford to extort funds from golden state.
we hold that the district court erred in failing to give an aiding and abetting or conspiracy instruction to the jury on count.as instructed,the jury could have concluded that mcfall claims of influence over bedford were gross exaggerations,and still convicted him of attempted extortion under claim of official right.the hobbs act does not sweep so broadly.
because we conclude that the jury instruction on count omitted a necessary element of the offense,we must consider whether that error was harmless.see neder united states,d.the test for harmlessness is whether it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
we are unable to conclude that the instructional error was harmless.in their argument to the jury,the prosecutors stressed that a guilty verdict was necessary if the jury concluded that mcfall attempted to trade his influence over bedford for a cash payment.the government basic theory,as represented in the jury instructions and arguments before the jury,was based on an improper broadening of the hobbs act.the evidence in the record did not clearly establish that bedford aided and abetted or conspired with mcfall to extort money from golden state thus,we can not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the the jury would have reached the same conclusion had it been properly instructed.we therefore reverse the count conviction.
iii.suppression of exculpatory grand jury testimony 
mcfall contends that the district court erred in not admitting a transcript of sawyer grand jury testimony,and that the error was prejudicial because the testimony offered a account of the key events at issue in count that contradicts the testimony of the government primary witness.the court cited two alternative bases for excluding the grand jury testimony the transcript amounted to inadmissible hearsay and the transcript would unfairly prejudice the government because the jury would not be informed of sawyer indictment on perjury charges or his guilty plea to the crime of honest services mail fraud,a felony.we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.hoffman constr.prot,cir.
mcfall was initially indicted in october.sawyer,at that point uncharged,appeared before a grand jury on november.his testimony resulted in a transcript,a substantial portion of which is devoted to the events underlying the charges in count,the scheme to extort money from digital angel.sawyer was indicted more than a year later,in december.
an independent review of sawyer grand jury testimony makes clear that the transcript exclusion prejudiced mcfall at trial.levy,the digital angel lobbyist,testified that sawyer made extortionate threats on mcfall behalf during a telephone conversation to which levy and sawyer were the only parties.sawyer testified that the notion that he and mcfall conspired to deny state grant funds to digital angel unless the company paid a consulting fee to mcfall crux of the charge against ridiculous.according to one of the prosecutor notes,sawyer stuck to this version of events in his debriefing.as a result of the grand jury testimony exclusion and sawyer fifth amendment invocation at mcfall trial,the jury heard only two versions of the disputed and mcfall.sawyer excluded grand jury testimony would have largely corroborated mcfall account.
even so,sawyer grand jury testimony represents an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,and as such is hearsay.see.c.at trial,mcfall invoked the hearsay exception laid out in federal rule of evidence b,which allows admission of the former testimony of an unavailable witness.see.a.the exception provides 
testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding,or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding is admissible,if the party against whom the testimony is now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct,cross,or redirect examination.
it is clear that sawyer,having invoked his fifth amendment right not to testify after being subpoenaed by mcfall,was unavailable as a witness,at least to mcfall.see padilla terhune,cir.further,the rule b hearsay exception can,in some circumstances,encompass grand jury testimony.see,united states salerno,d united states lester,cir.the question is whether the government motive in examining sawyer before the grand jury was sufficiently similar to what its motive would be in challenging his testimony at mcfall trial.prosecutors need not have pursued every opportunity to question sawyer before the grand jury the exception requires only that
