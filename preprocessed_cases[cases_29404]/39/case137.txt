this cause arises under.marco outdoor advertising,marco contends that the regional transit authority rta deprived it of property without due process of law when,in violation of the louisiana public bid law,et.public bid law,rta arbitrarily awarded an advertising contract contract to an inferior bidder,clear channel outdoor,clear channel.the district court held that because the public bid law does not apply to this contract,the state had created no property right in favor of prospective bidders such as marco and consequently,marco,having no protected property interest,had failed to state a constitutional due process claim.the district court therefore dismissed the case for lack of federal question jurisdiction.
the issue presented and argued by the parties,both at trial and on appeal,is whether the public bid law applies to this contract thereby creating a property interest,a difficult and unclear claim under louisiana law.marco contends that it applies rta and clear channel contend that it does not.we find it unnecessary to decide this question because we hold that,even assuming the public bid law applies and creates a property interest in this contract,louisiana state courts provide an adequate procedural remedy for the alleged deprivation we therefore affirm the dismissal of marco complaint for failure to state a federal claim.
on august,rta initiated request for proposals,under which it sought sealed bids from advertising contractors for proposals that would generate revenue for rta by placing advertisements on rta vehicles,transit shelters,and transit benches.rta received bids from six contractors,including marco and clear channel.the parties dispute whose bid is financially superior,that is,which will generate more advertising revenue for rta.on may,in response to marco inquiries,rta informed marco that rta planned to award the contract to clear channel two days later on may.
marco took action,however,and on may,marco filed this suit against rta in federal district court.marco sought an injunction preventing rta from awarding the contract to clear channel and a writ of mandamus ordering rta to award the contract to marco.in the district court and on appeal,marco argues that its bid is financially superior to clear channel bid,and that under the public bid law,rta must award the contract to marco,which allegedly submitted the best bid.marco maintains that under the public bid law,it has a property right protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution.this constitutional question is the sole basis for federal question jurisdiction.although no injunction was issued,the bidding process apparently came to a halt.
on august,following a bench trial,the district court dismissed marco complaint for lack of jurisdiction.the district court concluded that the public bid law did not apply to the contract,and accordingly,that rta was not required to award the contract to the most favorable bidder.therefore,even if marco submitted the best bid,it had no right under state law to receive the contract and thus no property right in receiving the contract.consequently,marco could not claim a deprivation of a property right by the rta.because the federal question basis of its law suit was eliminated,the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.marco now appeals.
as we have earlier suggested,we will assume for the purposes of this appeal that marco has a property right in its bid.this is not enough,however.the fourteenth amendment also requires that the plaintiff,in order to establish a constitutional violation,prove that the deprivation of the property right occurred without due process of law.see baker mccollan,d thus,even if the public bid law applies to the disputed contract,and the state has thus created a protected property right in the bidding process for marco,marco must further show that the state has failed to provide marco some legal process to challenge rta action.the due process claim before us relates only to the adequacy of procedures that the state provides to a property owner before it takes away the property.
thus,for purposes of this appeal,the state may satisfy due process requirements by providing an adequate remedy an adequate remedy requires that,before it acts,the state must provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the property owner,see systems contractors orleans parish sch,cir applying mathews eldridge,d,for w hen protected interests are implicated,the right to some kind of prior hearing is paramount,bd.of regents roth,d.the root requirement of due process is that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest.mckesson div.of alcoholic beverages and tobacco,of bus.regulation of,d quoting cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.for example,a state court injunction available before the deprivation of any significant property interest constitutes an adequate remedy.see id.at.t he state may choose to provide a form of predeprivation process,for example,by authorizing taxpayers to bring suit to enjoin imposition of a tax prior to its payment see also private truck council.tax comm n,d explaining mckesson harper.of taxation,d applying mckesson to virginia tax laws rex realty city of cedar rapids,cir holding that notice of condemnation and availability of a state court injunction,writ of mandamus,and writ of certiorari in an eminent domain case satisfied due process mckenzie city of chicago,cir holding that a state court injunction was an adequate remedy in a condemnation case,where the property owner received notice days before the demolition and could file an injunction that automatically halted any demolition plans by the city 
here,the state provides unsuccessful bidders with adequate notice and hearing.specifically,the state provides adequate notice when rta announces a contract award,which puts losing bidders on notice that they will be deprived of any alleged property interest in the bid if they fail to take further action.there is no showing here that the notice in this case was inadequate.furthermore,the state guarantees unsuccessful bidders the right to a hearing through the public bid law,which authorizes any unsuccessful bidder to sue in louisiana state court to enjoin the public entity from awarding the contract.see.b.according to the louisiana supreme court,louisiana jurisprudence has long recognized that while a public body has some discretion in awarding public contracts,subject to judicial review,an unsuccessful bidder may sue to enjoin the public body from executing the contract or to set aside the award of the contract to another bidder when the public body acted arbitrarily in selecting the successful bidder.airline constr,ascension parish sch,so d,citation omitted.as the louisiana supreme court noted in airline construction,the louisiana legislature amended.in to recognize expressly the right to injunctive relief when a public entity violates the public bid law.id.at.under the statute 
the district attorney in whose district a violation of this part,the public bid law occurs,the attorney general,or any interested party may bring suit in the louisiana district court through summary proceeding to enjoin the award of a contract or to seek other appropriate injunctive relief to prevent the award of a contract which would be in violation of this part,or through ordinary proceeding to seek appropriate remedy to nullify a contract entered into in violation of this part.
b.there are no prerequisites that an aggrieved interested party must complete before bringing an injunction in louisiana district court 
because an unsuccessful bidder may seek an immediate injunction through a summary proceeding,and because the injunction may enjoin the execution of the contract,the injunction prevents the deprivation of any significant property interest and is therefore an adequate remedy.see mckesson,at.the summary proceeding,together with rta announcement of the contract award,satisfies the elements of the due process prong of the due process clause that are at issue in this case.
we thus conclude we assume for the purposes of deciding this appeal that the public bid law applies to marco bid and that marco has properly alleged a property interest in the right to receive the contract nevertheless,we conclude that marco procedural due process claim fails.the public bid law explicitly authorizes marco to seek state court injunctive relief to enjoin rta from awarding the contract to clear channel.for the reasons given,we hold that marco has failed to show that it has been denied due process of law provided in the fourteenth amendment.accordingly,the judgment of the district court dismissing the case for failure to state a federal claim is 
i respectfully dissent.i am convinced that the majority opinion misapprehends the nature of,or glosses over,marco substantive claim,grounded as it is in the rta knowing and deliberate disregard of louisiana public bid law and its own announced procedure,despite such law having been expressly incorporated by reference in the rta enabling act.
the state bid law has long been recognized as creating a constitutionally protected property interest in the entitlement of the,as in this case,the bidder hereafter,best bidder to be awarded the advertised contract one obvious purpose of the bid law is to protect the public fisc by ensuring that the people pay the lowest price available for qualified work or,as here,receive the most revenue for the privilege granted another is to protect the property right of the best bidder to be awarded the advertised contract.thus,for a bidder successfully to assert a claim,he must establish that the contract at issue is subject to the state public bid law,that he is the best bidder,and that he has been wronged by the agency awarding of the contract to another party.marco establishing of these elements would entitle it to pursue fourteenth amendment claims under,both substantive and procedural.even when,for today purposes,i accept without granting that the panel majority has gotten the procedural due process facet of marco claim right,that procedural placebo,marco pre or access to the state courts,falls far short of being a panacea for marco substantive ills,much less the only available cure.
instead of forthrightly deciding the sole legal issue addressed by the parties and by the district court,whether louisiana public bid law even applies to the rta letting of the instant contract i believe that the bid law applies and would so hold on appeal,the majority leaves that question unanswered and merely assumes arguendo that these laws do apply and that marco has established that it is the best bidder and thus entitled to due process protection having thus set up the procedural due process strawman through such assumptions,though,the panel majority proceeds to knock it down,in disregard of marco substantive due process claim,by conclusionally declaring,without any discussion of the facts or analysis of the law,that the rta decision to award the contract to clear channel instead of marco is not so arbitrary as to shock the conscience.according to the panel majority,then,solely because marco had the option of resorting to state court do we all,its entitlement to seek relief there after being arbitrarily and capriciously denied its right to be awarded the contract somehow satisfies the administrative procedure that due process expressly requires.for the majority,then,the rta refusal to follow the presumably applicable state bid its own announced is designed to protect,inter alia,a best bidder constitutional property right,is somehow not so unconstitutionally egregious as to warrant access to,and the attention of,the federal courts.in other words,just because we say so,the rta patent disregard of the substantive due process rights guaranteed to marco under the united states constitution can not be rectified in federal court in a action.
as i find the panel majority reasoning to be fatally flawed,i too shall proceed as does the panel majority on the assumption that marco is entitled to both procedural and substantive due process before it may be deprived of its conceded property right,and shall illustrate how marco constitutional right is violated.
adverting to substantive due process solely in footnote of its opinion,the panel majority conclusionally declares that marco does not have a viable substantive due process claim.yet,the majority never tells us why not.it simply stands mute as to the reasons for concluding that marco has no substantive claim.to me,that alone would justify a dissent.i shall do more,however,by explaining why i am convinced that marco does indeed have a viable substantive claim,which it is entitled to pursue in federal court.
as the majority explains,and i agree,s ubstantive due process bars certain arbitrary,wrongful government actions here,marco substantive due process claim is supported by a plethora of discrete allegations of how the rta arbitrarily and capriciously disregarded state accurately,how it affirmatively rejected the state bid law as totally knowingly thumbing its nose at louisiana bid requirements and,in an exercise of agency fiat,blatantly handing the contract to an inferior bidder after colluding with that bidder to make its bid the best.it is obvious to me that these shenanigans unquestionably resulted in the deprivation of marco and property right,as the putative best qualified bidder,to have the contract awarded to it.lest there be any doubt about the rta audacious euchring of marco out of the subject contract,i reiterate here the rta machinations as alleged by marco which must be credited at this stage of the proceedings 
the rta request for proposals rfp for the subject contract was not furnished to marco despite its previous requests for notice of the initiation of any solicitation for transit advertising.
similarly,marco was not informed of the rta conference on the contract.
of six proposals received by the rta,marco was patently the best from all standpoints guaranteed payments,percentage of revenues,contractor media,bartered print and broadcast media,and marketing analysis,and clear channel proposal was a distant third.
rta subjectively evaluated the proposals with a,arbitrarily weighted formula,baldly adding million to clear channel proposal for benefits over ten years which one of the other contractors had also agreed to do yet got no bonus for and adding another bonus million for benefits proposed by clear channel,which no other bidder was advised it could submit.even with this artificially enhanced figure,clear channel score remained short of the maximum points that only marco bid had achieved.
also,rta assigned to clear channel a bonus for compliance with disadvantaged business enterprises dbe despite having stated that no such goals had been established for the subject project and despite obvious by clear channel.
when all of the foregoing machinations failed to move clear channel ahead of marco,the rta allowed clear channel and only clear channel to revise its bid by increasing its guaranteed payment from to,increasing its estimated revenues by above its original proposal,and artificially inflating its bid above those of marco and the original bidders.
after accomplishing the foregoing legerdemain,the rta declared clear channel the best bidder even those unilateral channel proposal guaranteed only,still more than million less than marco guarantee.
assuming,as we must,for purposes of the test for granting a tro or preliminary injunction,that marco could prove these allegations,they are quintessentially arbitrary and capricious,and more than sufficient to satisfy the element of likelihood of success,entitling marco to such a restraint.
typically,the focus of substantive claims in the area of public bid laws is whether the awarding authority has arbitrarily or capriciously designated an inferior contender as the best responsible bidder.in almost every such case,the awarding authority acknowledges or is at least aware that it is subject to the bid law,least failed to follow the statutory or regulatory bid rules.here,in contrast,the rta has denied from the outset that,in awarding this contract,it is subject to the state bid law at all and,as such,has insi
