information handling services,brought suit alleging that the department of defense violated statutory and regulatory requirements by developing and maintaining an database for the dissemination of government documents,without first determining whether the private sector could do so at lower cost.the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing and,in the alternative,granted summary judgment.we reverse.
the defense automated printing services daps is the component of the department of defense dod that is responsible for managing,maintaining,and distributing over documents relating to unclassified military specifications and standards.daps lists the documents in the department of defense index of specifications and standards dodiss.the department uses those documents hereinafter dodiss documents to describe the products or services that it wishes to obtain,and private contractors and government agencies rely on them in responding to dod solicitations.
beginning in the late,the department sought to automate its management of dodiss documents.it eventually created an official electronic index of military standardization documents,known as the acquisition streamlining and standardization information system assist.assist,however,did not contain the text of the documents,which,until the late,were distributed to government agencies,defense contractors,and the general public only in hard copy.
information handling services,ihs is a commercial publisher of government and industrial standards and specifications.for many years,the company has obtained dodiss documents from the government and made them available to its customers on a subscription basis.in the late,ihs developed a searchable electronic database of dodiss documents,called the dodiss plus index,which the company provided on to subscribing customers.users of this database could search for particular specifications or standards by document number,title,subject,or keyword.like users of assist,however,ihs customers who identified their desired document still had to obtain the version from ihs or the department in hard copy.then,in the early,ihs produced a database of dodiss documents that it linked to its dodiss plus index,allowing a subscriber to search for and immediately print a particular military specification or standard.the company has continued to develop and market this product,and current subscribers can access ihs database on or through the internet,and can retrieve dodiss documents in various electronic formats,including portable document file pdf versions.
the present dispute concerns the defense department development of what the plaintiff describes as a document search and retrieval system similar to the enhanced dodiss plus index.the government database was developed in the.on october,an internet version called assist became fully operational,allowing users to search for and immediately retrieve current pdf versions of dodiss documents.
on november,ihs filed suit against various officials and components of the department of defense,including daps hereinafter daps or the department,in the united states district court for the district of columbia.ihs complaint,brought under the administrative procedure act,et,contained two causes of action.first,ihs asserted that daps had developed and was continuing to maintain assist without first determining through a bona fide cost comparison that it could do so at lower cost than the private sector,as required by and the relevant dod procurement regulation.in the complaint second count,ihs contended that,by allowing users to access assist free of charge,daps was violating the requirement of that,if required to release technical data under the freedom of information act,the agency must recoup from the person requesting the documents all reasonable costs attributable to search,duplication,and review.ihs sought a declaratory judgment as well as injunctive relief barring daps from developing,marketing,implementing,distributing,and selling assist without first undertaking an appropriate cost comparison and recovering the government costs.
on april,after denying ihs requests to take discovery,the district court dismissed plaintiff first count on the ground that ihs lacked standing to assert it.in the alternative,the court granted summary judgment against the plaintiff on that count,as well as on the second count.see information handling,defense automated printing.ihs filed a timely notice of appeal.
before turning to the legal analysis,we pause for a moment to clarify the scope of the issues on appeal.as just mentioned,ihs complaint was stated in two counts the first premised on alleged violations of and the department procurement regulation,and the second on an alleged violation of.the plaintiff appellate briefs directly addressed only the first count,and at oral argument ihs confirmed that it was not appealing the court grant of summary judgment on the second.we therefore restrict our review to the claimed violations of and the regulation.

b,d see also id.c d.
the first count of the plaintiff complaint alleged that daps violated these statutory and regulatory requirements by developing,and maintaining assist without undertaking a cost comparison study to determine whether daps could develop and maintain a digitized database for dodiss documents more economically than commercial sources.compl.at argument before this court,ihs abandoned its claim regarding the development of assist.plaintiff counsel made clear that,although ihs still believes that daps violated and by developing the product,it does not contend that the statute or regulation requires the government to discard a product that it has already developed even if it was developed in violation of the law.accordingly,because assist was developed during the and became operational in and hence was completed before the plaintiff filed suit ihs has withdrawn any claim to relief for the development of the website and associated database.
this leaves only one claim remaining for our consideration ihs charge that daps is currently violating and the department regulation by maintaining assist without considering whether the private sector can do so at lower cost.the district court dismissed that claim on the ground that ihs lacked standing to raise it.in the alternative,the court granted summary judgment against ihs on the merits.we consider the plaintiff standing in part iii,and,because we find that ihs does have standing to raise the claim,we consider the district court grant of summary judgment in part iv.
as the supreme court has explained,the question of standing involves both constitutional limitations on jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.bennett spear,d quoting warth seldin,d.to satisfy the requirements of article iii of the constitution,a plaintiff must,generally speaking,demonstrate that he has suffered injury in fact,that the injury is fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant,and that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.id.quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in addition,the federal judiciary has also adhered to a set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the prudential principle relevant here is that,for a plaintiff to have standing,its grievance must arguably fall within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the statutory provision or constitutional guarantee invoked in the suit.id.
we review the district court grant of daps motion to dismiss for lack of standing de novo.see american fed of gov t employees rumsfeld.in analyzing whether ihs has standing at the dismissal stage,we must assume that ihs states a valid legal claim,see warth,at.at louisiana energy power auth.ferc,american fed of gov t employees pierce,and must accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true,sturm,ruger chao,see sierra club epa,
the dispute over ihs standing principally centers on whether it is suffering injury in fact.ihs complaint avers that daps unlawful failure to solicit bids from the private sector to maintain assist harm s commercial vendors,including ihs,as it denies them the opportunity to demonstrate that they can provide the instant products and services more economically.compl.such a claim of lost contracting opportunities is ordinarily sufficient to establish injury in fact.see cc,united states.
the district court concluded that ihs nonetheless lacked standing because it does not now offer a service which is procured by dod.information handling,slip op.at.there are two concepts embedded in that conclusion.the first that ihs does not offer or is not capable of offering the same service provided by assist is a question of fact.the plaintiff avers that such products and services are now available more economically from ihs and other commercial sources,and that ihs dodiss plus index products and services are a commercially available source of essentially the same products and services as offered in assist.compl,for purposes of deciding a motion to dismiss,a court must take those allegations as true,and the district court erred in not doing so.
the second concept implicit in the district court conclusion is that ihs is not suffering injury in fact because daps is not procur ing the service of maintaining and operating the website,but rather is continuing to provide that service itself.in a related vein,the government argues that only compels daps to consider comparative costs when it takes a service,when daps decides to develop a product or perform a service that it had previously purchased from the private sector or when it develops a new product or service.section is inapplicable here,the government insists,because making dodiss documents available to the public is a service that dod has historically undertaken on its own.and because is inapplicable,the government concludes,the interest that ihs asserts is not legally protected.see daps br.at see also defenders of wildlife,at.at stating that the injury in fact element of standing requires the invasion of a legally protected interest.
the problem with this argument is that at the motion to dismiss stage,a plaintiff contention regarding the meaning of a statute must be taken as correct for purposes of standing.see louisiana energy power,at claybrook slater.were that not the case,we would effectively be deciding the merits under the guise of determining the plaintiff standing.here,ihs contention is that requires the government to consider procuring from the private sector services that it performs,even if the services neither are new nor were once contracted out.the fact that the government is not procur ing the maintenance service is thus the gravamen of ihs claim,not a ground for finding that ihs lacks standing to assert it.as we said in rejecting a similar argument in cc distributors,t o note that no procurement process was ever invoked begs the question of whether the relevant statutes and regulations require dod to undertake the cost comparison procedures of that procurement process,whether they create a conditional right to compete.at if we assume,as we must at this stage,that ihs has read the statute correctly,then daps conduct has indeed inva ded a legally protected interest,and the plaintiff has standing to raise its claim.defenders of wildlife,at.at.
the district court also determined that ihs had not established injury in fact because dod does not provide dodiss documents to the public less economically than plaintiff does.information handling,slip op.at.but as we have said,the complaint expressly alleges that such products and services are now available more economically from ihs and other commercial sources.compl.because we must take that allegation as true,this ground for finding a lack of standing must also fail.see sturm,ruger,at sierra club,at.
the government offers a potpourri of additional arguments in support of the district court determination that ihs lacked standing.first,it contends that the inability of ihs to bid on a maintenance contract causes the plaintiff no injury to a legally protected interest because no one has the right to a government contract.daps br.at.this contention is readily dismissed,because it is precisely the same argument that the government tendered and this court rejected in cc distributors a plaintiff suffers a constitutionally cognizable injury by the loss of an opportunity to pursue a benefit,we said,even though the plaintiff may not be able to show that it was certain to receive that benefit had it been accorded the lost opportunity.at.ihs claim that it has lost statutorily conferred opportunity to compete for a contract to maintain the website is sufficient to confer standing.id.
second,the government argues that ihs has no statutory right to force the government to buy its database of dodiss documents,rather than to operate a website.but if ihs ever claimed such a right in the district court,it does not do so here.instead,the plaintiff contends that if given the opportunity,it would bid to operate a website that would provide users with precisely the same services that the government now provides but at lower cost to the government.this is a factual dispute that can not be resolved on a motion to dismiss.
finally,the government contends that ihs lacks prudential standing because its claim does not come within the zone of interests protected by.according to the government,ihs is merely trying to protect the it used to enjoy.but that is not the nature of ihs claim here.the complaint alleges that ihs can provide the same service that the government does at lower cost to the taxpayers.compl.there can be no question that such a claim comes within the zone of interests of a statute that directs the secretary of defense to procure a service from a source if such a source can provide such service to the department at a cost that is lower than the cost at which the department can provide the same service.as the court said in cc distributors 
we can hardly say that the interest of a private firm in competing for a defense department contract is only marginally related to the goal of improving efficiency t he plaintiffs interest in obtaining the opportunity to compete for this contract is closely related to,even if not the same as,congress goal of efficiency and economy in defense matters.
in sum,we conclude that none of the arguments against the plaintiff standing is sufficient to justify the dismissal of the complaint.the district court,having concluded that ihs lacked standing,went on to consider the merits of ihs complaint and to grant summary judgment in favor of the defendants.although the district court would have been without jurisdiction to consider the merits had ihs truly lacked standing,see steel citizens for a better env t,d,because we have concluded that ihs does have standing,we now proceed to consider the court decision to grant summary judgment.

as we have noted above,ihs claim is based on and the relevant dod procurement regulation.section a declares that the department shall procure each supply or service from a source in the private sector if such a source can provide such supply or service to the department at a cost that is lower than the cost at which the department can provide the same supply or service,and b requires the department to make r ealistic and fair cost comparisons for the purpose of determining whether to contract with a source in the private sector for the performance of a dod function.ihs complaint alleges that the future maintenance of daps website require s the carrying on of activities designed to provide a commercial product or service,compl,that ihs can provide that service at lower cost to the government than daps can,id,and that daps has failed to prepare any cost comparison study that would justify retaining the work,id.daps does not deny that it continues to expend resources to maintain assist,nor does it argue that such maintenance falls within the statutory exception for functions which the secretary of defense has determine d must be performed by military or government personnel,a accordingly,on its face ihs complaint alleges conduct contrary to and the department regulation,which,if proven,would justify a judgment in its favor.see a.
the district court nonetheless held and the dod regulation inapplicable to ihs claims because daps is not procuring supplies or services in connection with assist,but is instead making its own forms and documents,which have long been available to the public,available through the internet.information handling,slip op.at.as we noted in our discussion of standing,this is a variant on the government argument that only applies when daps takes a service that it had previously contracted out to the private sector,or when it institutes a new service.according to the government,daps never had an agreement with any contractor to provide dod specifications and standards on the internet.daps br.at.rather,it was daps historic mission to provide such information to dod components and others.id.and because the operation of the website assertedly represents only a continuation of daps historical function,rather than a decision to bring an existing service or to create a new service,the government argues that daps was not obligated to consider outsourcing to the private sector.
this argument fails to justify a grant of summary judgment on either the law or the facts.first,nothing in the language of suggests that it applies only to functions that the department had previously contracted out to the private sector,or to entirely new functions.rather,the statute applies to each supply or service necessary for or beneficial to the accomplishment of the authorized functions of the department.a emphasis added.similarly,the department regulation states that conversion to production or the creation of a new service are only two of the events that can trigger the cost comparison requirement dod components shall not consider an inhouse new requirement,an expansion of an requirement,conversion to,or otherwise carry on any commercial activities to provide commercial products or services if the products or services can be procured more economically from commercial sources.d emphasis added.indeed,a daps position paper on dodiss states all dod activities annually review their core capabilities and identify functions for possible cost comparisons with private industry.when such studies are conducted and a determination is made that a particular service may be more appropriately performed by the private sector,a solicitation is advertised and a competitive selection is awarded.daps,dodiss documents,proposed questions and answers,at hereinafter daps,questions and answers.
second,even if does apply only to services that daps had previously procured from the private sector or that are entirely new,ihs has raised a genuine factual dispute as to daps claim that its services fall into neither category.with respect to previous procurement,ihs contends that f or many years prior to defendants rollout of its electronic military standards product on october,defendants had been purchasing a comparable product from ihs.reply br.at.specifically,ihs asserts that during the,dod components purchased and products from ihs that enabled them to conduct desktop computer searches and retrieve versions of dodiss documents.see compl.pace decl,at.
moreover,the government contention that daps is merely carrying out its function of disseminating dodiss documents,while arguably correct when stated at a high level of generality,obscures the fact that the way in which daps carries out that function has changed dramatically.daps can not dispute that it historically distributed only paper copies of dodiss documents,and that it was not until that selected documents were also made available in electronic format on diskettes or.daps,questions and answers at.dissemination of dodiss documents through the internet did not begin until daps website went active on october,see saunders decl,at,just weeks before ihs brought suit.we can not agree that providing for the retrieval of documents in electronic format over the internet is not a new service as compared to the manual retrieval of hard copy from government warehouses.
as an alternative ground in support of the district court grant of summary judgment,the government argues that application of to assist would conflict with a provision of the electronic freedom of information act amendments of,which requires the department to make records created on or after november,available,including by computer telecommunications.a.daps similarly cites the paperwork reduction act mandate that agencies provide timely and equitable access to the data underlying public information maintained in electronic format.d b.but there is no conflict between the requirement that daps make dodiss documents available over the internet,and the requirement that it do so by contracting the function out to the private sector if that would be more economical.
the government further argues that,even if and the department regulation apply,the agency has fully complied with their mandates.according to the government,daps has contracted out the great majority of the work of developing,operating,and maintaining assist to other pr
