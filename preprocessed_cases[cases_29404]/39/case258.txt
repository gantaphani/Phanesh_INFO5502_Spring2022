the california department of rehabilitation dor and the united states department of education appeal from the district court decision enforcing a arbitration award issued pursuant to a of the randolph sheppard vending stand act the act.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.
some familiarity with the structure of the randolph sheppard act and the manner in which it provides for resolution of disputes is necessary to understand the sequence of events in this case.we briefly provide the relevant background.
the randolph sheppard act establishes a cooperative program between the federal government and the states to assist blind persons who wish to operate vending facilities on federal property.see.the stated purposes of the act are providing blind persons with remunerative employment,enlarging the economic opportunities of the blind,and stimulating the blind to greater efforts in striving to make themselves.a.the rehabilitation services administration within the department of education administers the act with the help of state agencies designated by the secretary of education.b,a.in participating states,these state agencies referred to as state licensing agencies issue licenses to blind persons that make them eligible to operate vending facilities on federal properties within that state.b.in order to establish a vending site,a state licensing agency must seek authorization in the form of a permit from the federal agency in control of the property on which the site is to be located.c.
state participation in the randolph sheppard program is voluntary.see.a state agency that wishes to participate must apply to the secretary for designation as a state licensing agency and agree to cooperate with the secretary in carrying out the purpose of the act,as well as comply with a number of more specific requirements,see.for example,a state licensing agency must give preference to blind persons who are in need of employment when issuing licenses,b provide each licensed blind vendor with such vending facility equipment,and adequate initial stock of suitable articles to be vended therefrom,as may be necessary,make periodic reports to the secretary of education,provide licensed blind vendors with relevant financial data,conduct a biennial election of a committee of blind vendors to represent all blind licensees in the state program,cooperate with the committee in the training of blind licensees,disburse vending machine income to licensed blind vendors according to a particular formula,a b and use any remaining vending machine income to establish retirement and other benefits plans for the blind and to purchase,maintain,and replace vending equipment,c c.
the act also provides for proceedings to resolve two types of disputes disputes between the licensed blind vendor and the state licensing agency,on the one hand,and disputes between the state licensing agency and the federal agency in control of the property on which the vending site is located,on the other.
the first type of dispute,between the blind licensee and the state licensing agency,is governed by the procedures set forth in,a,a,and b of the act.at the request of any blind licensee who is dissatisfied with the operation of the program,the state licensing agency must give the blind licensee a full evidentiary hearing.a.if the blind licensee grievances are not resolved by such a hearing,the blind licensee may file a complaint with the secretary who shall convene a panel to arbitrate the dispute.a 
the second type of dispute,between a state licensing agency and the federal entity in control of the property on which a vending site is located,is governed by b,a,and b of the act.if a state licensing agency determines that the federal entity in control of the property on which a vending site is located is failing to comply with the act,the state agency may file a complaint with the secretary who shall convene a panel to arbitrate the dispute.b 
if a blind licensee triggers an arbitration proceeding,it is governed by b of the act in these circumstances,the arbitration panel is composed of one member chosen by the blind licensee,one member chosen by the state licensing agency,and one member jointly designated by the other two members.b.if a state licensing agency triggers an arbitration proceeding,it is governed by b of the act in this case,the panel is composed of one member chosen by the agency,one member chosen by the federal agency,and one member jointly designated by the other two members.b.decisions by both types of panels are final and binding on the parties,a,b,except that each is subject to appeal and review as a final agency action for purposes of chapter of the administrative procedure act,a.
the act treats arbitrations differently than arbitrations in one significant respect.whereas b is silent as to the type of relief that a arbitration panel may grant,the act provides that if a state licensing agency triggers arbitration,and the arbitration panel determines that the federal agency is in violation of the act,the head of the federal agency shall cause such acts or practices to be terminated promptly and shall take such other action as may be necessary to carry out the decision of the panel.b.
we now turn to the facts of this case.the california dor is the state licensing agency designated by the secretary to administer the act in california.in,the federal general services administration gsa,which manages the roybal federal building in downtown los angeles,granted dor a permit to establish a vending facility in the building the dor contracted with david zelickson,a blind vendor licensed under the act,to operate a snack shop in the building.
in,gsa notified dor that it intended to terminate zelickson employment at the roybal building because of allegedly unprofessional behavior.the dor opposed zelickson termination,arguing that gsa had not established good cause for zelickson removal as required by state laws governing the operation of the randolph sheppard act program,and that dor,and not gsa,was in charge of vendor licensing and selection under the act.despite dor efforts,gsa suspended dor permit to operate a vending facility at the roybal building and issued a revocable license to another party.
in october,dor filed an administrative complaint against gsa with the secretary and requested arbitration pursuant to b of the act.on december,the arbitration panel ruled that gsa had violated the act by expelling zelickson without going through california hearing process,and concluded that gsa had to reinstate zelickson.nonetheless,the panel determined that gsa should have an opportunity to litigate zelickson qualifications,and therefore directed dor to provide gsa with a forum in which to do so.the arbitration panel held that i f gsa does not exercise its options to litigate the question of zelickson qualifications within days from the date of decision,then it must pay zelickson the damages to which he is entitled,namely the difference between what he has been able to earn and what the interim vendor earned plus interest on those amounts of money.
when gsa failed to reinstate zelickson or take any steps to litigate zelickson qualifications within the day period,dor made numerous unsuccessful attempts to secure gsa compliance with the arbitration award.in march,dor sent a letter to gsa insisting that gsa terminate its contract with the new vendor and reinstate zelickson.the following month,dor sent gsa a letter demanding gsa compliance with the panel decision.dor and gsa then met with a department of education official who attempted to mediate their dispute.the department of education mediator informed dor that his only role was to facilitate dialogue between the two agencies and that despite the fact that the department of education is dor federal oversight agency,the department of education is not in a position to exert pressure on gsa to comply with the award.mediation was ultimately unsuccessful because gsa maintained its position that the arbitration panel lacked the authority to award either the vendor or dor damages from the federal government,and in any event,the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity with regard to randolph sheppard damages.dor later sought help from the california attorney general office,which sent a letter to gsa in december suggesting that the state might file suit if gsa did not comply with the award or reach some other resolution with dor.this threat,too,was to no avail.
in addition to attempting to bring gsa into compliance with the arbitration award,dor repeatedly encouraged zelickson to consider competing for other vending locations,and advised him he was unlikely to recover damages from gsa.although dor assured zelickson that taking a job at another vending facility would not jeopardize his chances of returning to the roybal building,zelickson did not apply elsewhere.dor allowed zelickson to operate a facility at a los angeles traffic court location under an interim permit until at least,much longer than the usual six months duration for such a permit.
in,zelickson notified dor that he was requesting an evidentiary hearing under a regarding dor failure to compel gsa to reinstate him at the roybal building.dor refused this request as untimely.zelickson then filed a complaint with the department of education under a requesting arbitration of his dispute with dor.the department of education convened a second arbitration panel pursuant to b in order to determine whether dor had breached an obligation to enforce the arbitration award between dor and gsa.
the second arbitration panel determined that dor had breached its obligation to zelickson.according to the panel,because gsa did not comply with the arbitration award despite the best efforts of dor to secure compliance short of a lawsuit,dor had a duty to seek enforcement of the arbitration award in federal court.the panel reasoned that t here is no statutory or judicial prohibition against the enforcement of an arbitration decision,and a lawsuit is the only way a state licensing agency can protect its interest in a facility it establishes,as well as protecting the blind vendor interest,because t he blind vendor has no right to enforce a favorable arbitration award on his own.even assuming that dor has discretion whether or not to bring lawsuits against violating federal agencies,the panel held that in this case the dor abused its discretion by failing to sue gsa given that t here was no other way to enforce zelickson rights.
having concluded that dor breached its obligation to zelickson by failing to file a lawsuit against gsa,the panel ruled that because of this failure,dor became liable for the damages that were afforded to zelickson under the arbitration award.accordingly,the panel ordered dor to pay zelickson in damages,which amounted to per month of lost earnings for the months between zelickson improper removal on december,and the date on which dor advised zelickson to make application for another permanent facility without waiving his rights to return to roybal.the panel also ordered dor to pay zelickson per month until it succeeded in reinstating him at either the roybal federal building or a comparable facility.
dor protested this ruling,and in november,dor filed suit against the department of education in federal district court,seeking review of the arbitration award.zelickson later intervened to defend the panel decision.the district court affirmed the award,and both dor and the department of education appeal 
this appeal raises a single question whether the arbitration panel exceeded its authority under the act when it ruled that dor had a statutory obligation to sue gsa for its failure to comply with the arbitration award,and therefore was liable for damages in favor of zelickson when it failed to do so.
an arbitration decision under the act is subject to appeal and review as a final agency action under the standards set forth in the administrative procedure act apa.see a.the apa requires a reviewing court to decide all relevant questions of law and interpret constitutional and statutory provisions.in addition,the reviewing court must hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions that are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,or are in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or short of statutory right,id.c.
we review de novo the questions of law at issue in this case,and must set aside the arbitration award if it is not in accordance with law.a see also.dep t of health soc.servs.dep t of,cir u nder a and a our decision on legal questions is plenary.in deciding the legal question whether the act requires a state licensing agency to sue a noncomplying federal agency,we do not give any special deference to the arbitration panel interpretation of the act.chevron,natural res.def.council,holding that courts should give considerable weight to an executive agency construction of a statutory scheme that it is entrusted to administer.chevron deference is warranted only when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.gonzales oregon,quoting united states mead.deference is inapplicable here because the act does not delegate interpretive authority to the arbitration panel instead,it gives the secretary of education the responsibility of administering the act and issuing interpretive regulations.see b.although an arbitration panel decision is considered a final action of the secretary for purposes of appeal,see a,this is a legal fiction an arbitration panel is composed of members appointed by the parties to the arbitration,not of department of education officials whose expertise merits our deference.mead,at.indeed,in this case,doe opposes the arbitration panel interpretation of the act.
in addressing the legal question at issue,we begin with the plain language of the act.statutory interpretation focuses on the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.united states havelock,wl cir,quoting robinson shell oil.if the text of the statute is clear,this court looks no further in determining the statute meaning.k n eng g,bulat,cir quoting united states mendoza,cir internal quotation marks omitted.by its terms,the act does not require a state licensing agency to sue a federal agency that refuses to comply with a b arbitration award.while a state agency that elects to participate in the randolph sheppard program agrees to a number of detailed requirements and duties,see supra at,there is no provision in the act even mentioning judicial enforcement of arbitration awards,let alone requiring a state licensing agency to bring a judicial enforcement action against a federal agency that refuses to comply with the act.
nor is there any such implicit requirement in the act.to the contrary,the text of the statute weighs against an inference that congress intended to require a state licensing agency to bring an enforcement action against a federal agency.first,the act provides that when a state licensing agency determines that a federal entity is violating the act,the state licensing agency may file a complaint with the secretary who shall convene a panel to arbitrate the dispute.b emphasis added.as the supreme court has explained,t he word may,when used in a statute,usually implies some degree of discretion,united states rodgers,especially when the same provision uses both may and shall,in which case,the normal inference is that each is used in its usual sense the one act being permissive,the other mandatory,anderson yungkau.here,congress use of may and shall makes clear that it has given the state licensing agency the discretion not the obligation to trigger an arbitration proceeding with a noncompliant federal agency while imposing a mandatory obligation on the secretary to convene an arbitration panel upon the state request.because congress gave the state licensing agency the option whether or not to pursue arbitration with a noncompliant federal agency,we can infer that congress did not intend to impose a statutory d
