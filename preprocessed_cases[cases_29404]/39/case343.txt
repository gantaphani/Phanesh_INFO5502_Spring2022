this appeal concerns four challenges by a government contractor to the withholding of contract payment for violation of the act,et.although the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review challenges to the correctness of the secretary of labor wage determinations under the act,see united states binghamton constr,we are aligned with our sister circuits in holding that we have jurisdiction to review procedural challenges.we hold,upon de novo review,that the district court correctly dismissed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b the contractor claims of estoppel,failure to follow department regulations,and denial of due process by failing to give fair consideration to the contractor challenges to the job classification determination.however,because the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the contractor claim that a limited area practice survey was not supported by substantial evidence,we dismiss that claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the secretary on the contractor claim that the department violated due process by failing to give fair notice of the requirement to abide by local practices regarding job classifications.although the secretary wage determination did not expressly so state,administrative and judicial decisions and the act itself provided adequate notice to the company,particularly in light of department regulations affording a means of obtaining clarification of wage determinations and the job classifications that they require.

abhe svoboda,is a construction company primarily engaged in the repair of large infrastructure,like bridges and dams.in and,the company was the winning bidder on three bridge repainting projects sponsored by the state of connecticut department of transportation ctdot.because the projects involved federal funding,ctdot provided the company with a copy of general wage determinations that listed applicable wages for all classifications of workers for building construction projects and heavy and highway construction projects in the relevant counties.under these general wage determinations,the wages for painters,laborers,and carpenters were each based on union collective bargaining agreements the relevant unions were noted in the wage determinations by their initials at least three of the wage determinations provided to the company expressly noted that an su designation not used for carpenters,laborers,or painters classifications means that rates listed under that identifier do not reflect collectively bargained wage and fringe benefit rates.other designations indicate unions whose rates have been determined to be prevailing.further,the company does not contest that the wage determinations indicated that they were based on collective bargaining agreements.upon winning the bid,the company made inquiries of several other contractors about the job classifications they had used on similar projects but made no effort to contact the relevant unions noted in the wage determinations.based on these inquiries,its nationwide experience,and its own tools of the trade analysis,the company determined that its employees functioned as painters,laborers,and carpenters depending on the duties they performed and paid them accordingly at different wage rates.
in,the wage and hour division began an investigation of the company classification practices,conducting a limited area practice survey in accordance with the field operations handbook to determine the practice of the union signatories to the collective bargaining agreements that were the source of the wages included in the general wage determinations.see wage hour division,field operations handbook,ch,available at www.dol.gov esa whd foh.the division contacted the unions that represented the painters,laborers,and carpenters,as well as the president of the connecticut construction industries association.all agreed that the painters union claimed all work performed on bridge painting projects.the administrator found that this was the area practice and,therefore,that the company had misclassified its employees when it had paid some of them as laborers and carpenters.as the prime contractor,the company was subject to the withholding of contractual payments of million.see c.
the company requested review of the administrator findings,see,and,after a day hearing,an administrative law judge alj agreed that the company had misclassified its employees and rejected the company argument that the department was equitably estopped from seeking back wages.the company appealed to the administrative review board arb,which upon de novo review,see b,affirmed the alj decision.in the course of a discussion,the arb rejected the company arguments that the alj decision should be set aside because he had adopted the findings and conclusions of the administrator brief virtually verbatim,and that the department had failed to provide adequate notice that all employees on the bridge painting projects should be paid as painters.the company then sued the secretary in federal district court,alleging that the department was estopped from applying its wage determination regarding the scope of the painters classification because ctdot had approved of the company practice had violated the company due process right to fair consideration by affirming alj findings that adopted the findings in the administrator brief had failed to provide fair notice of the requirement that the company classify its employees according to union practice and had conducted the limited area practice survey in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to include contractors and by making findings that were not supported by substantial evidence.the district court dismissed the claims pursuant to rule b for failure to state a claim except for the claim,on which it granted summary judgment for the secretary.the company appeals.
as a threshold matter,the secretary contends that under binghamton,the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the three claims that were dismissed by the district court.while not analyzing the issue as one of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court ruled that binghamton disallows three of the company claims because the complaint made a substantive demand for relief,seeking to have the court order the secretary to release million in withheld payments.we agree with the secretary that the binghamton bar should be analyzed through the lens of subject matter jurisdiction,see mistick pbt chao,and hold that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the company procedural claims,notwithstanding the type of relief sought.
consistent with the grant of jurisdiction to federal courts over claims arising under federal law,only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review,abbott labs.gardner,d quoting rusk cort,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d.the act provides that the minimum wages federal contractors pay their employees shall be based on the wages the secretary of labor determines to be prevailing b.in binghamton,the supreme court held that congress intended the act to preclude judicial review of wage determinations,stating that the act direct s the secretary of labor to determine,on the basis of prevailing rates in the locality,the appropriate minimum wages for each project.the correctness of the secretary determination is not open to attack on judicial review.at.
in light of the clear and convincing evidence requirement of abbott laboratories,the binghamton bar should be narrowly drawn to shield only the substance of wage determinations from judicial review,the contents of which the act entrusts to the secretary alone.this court has held that under binghamton the court retains subject matter jurisdiction over department regulations interpreting the scope of the act,see ball,ball brosamer,reich,and the department application of its conformance procedures,see mistick.we now join our sister circuits in holding that binghamton does not limit the court jurisdiction over procedural challenges to wage determinations themselves.see.constr.trades council goldschmidt,cir fry brothers hud,cir per curiam virginia ex rel.comm.r,dep t of transp.marshall,cir.we hold that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the company estoppel claim because it does not challenge the correctness of the department determination of the local practice of classifying the duties of painters but rather whether that determination can be applied in light of the company asserted reliance on ctdot approval of its practice.likewise,the court has jurisdiction over the company administrative procedure act apa claim that the wage and hour division failed to follow department regulations in conducting the limited area practice survey and its two due process claims that the department failed to provide fair consideration of the company arguments or fair notice of the job classifications.the fact that the company seeks release of the million withheld from its contract payment does not convert these procedural claims into a substantive attack on the wage determinations not only does the complaint seek any such other and further relief as the court deems proper,but a prayer for substantive relief does not automatically transform a claim challenging procedure into one challenging substance.epa.
however,we hold that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the company claim that the findings in the limited area practice survey that determined the locally prevailing practice of classifying jobs are not supported by substantial evidence because this represents a challenge to the substantive correctness of the secretary wage determinations.wage determinations implicitly include the locally prevailing practice of classifying jobs.see fry brothers,at framlau dembling,united states ex rel.plumbers steamfitters local union roen constr,cir.where collective bargaining agreements form the basis of wage determinations,the practice of local signatory unions is conclusive under department precedent.see fry brothers,wab case,wl at see also field operations handbook,ch.thus,the challenge to the substance of the secretary determination of the proper job classifications of the company employees runs afoul of the binghamton bar and must be dismissed pursuant to rule b.
turning to the merits of the company claims over which the court has jurisdiction,this court reviews de novo both the dismissal of a claim pursuant to rule b and the grant of summary judgment.see wilson pena.in determining whether a complaint states a claim,the court may consider the facts alleged in the complaint,documents attached thereto or incorporated therein,and matters of which it may take judicial notice.stewart educ.ass n.three of the company claims can be readily rejected for failure to state a claim only its claim involving fair notice requires extended discussion.
the company estoppel claim is that ctdot officials followed a deliberate course of conduct,on which the company relied,by affirmatively stating that various workers on the projects were properly classified as laborers carpenters.compl.even assuming principles of equitable estoppel could be applied against the federal government as an affirmative claim,see heckler cmty.health,d atc petroleum,sanders,the alleged independent actions of a state government agency fail to demonstrate affirmative misconduct by the federal government,heckler,at.rehnquist,concurring quoting ins hibi,d.therefore,this claim was properly dismissed pursuant to rule b.the company claim that the arb violated its due process rights by affirming an alj decision that adopted the findings and conclusions of the administrator brief is contrary to relevant precedent,see,united states el paso gas,d,and ignores the fact that it is the arb decision,which reviewed the alj decision de novo and discussed each of the company arguments,that is before the court.a rule b dismissal of this claim was therefore also appropriate.and in claiming that it was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to department regulations to rely on an area practice survey limited to one segment of the industry,the company can not deny that,under department precedent,where a wage determination is based on a collective bargaining agreement,the proper classification of employees is determined exclusively by the practices of the signatory unions.see fry brothers,wab case field operations handbook,ch,c.the company neither identifies a regulation to the contrary nor disputes that the relevant wage determinations indicate that the wages for carpenters,laborers,and painters were based on collective bargaining agreements.the wage determinations are public records subject to judicial notice on a motion to dismiss.kaempe myers.because they rely on collective bargaining agreements,only the practice of the signatory unions was relevant to the department investigation,and therefore this claim was properly dismissed pursuant to rule b.
the company fair notice claim is not so readily disposed of.because the general wage determinations did not indicate the proper method of classifying employees,the company contends that the department failed to provide fair notice that it had to pay its employees at the painter wage,rather than the carpenter or laborer wage,or that it had a legal obligation to base its job classifications on locally prevailing union practice.
the company maintains that the department application of an unstated requirement violates the due process clause under which a regulation must provide fair warning of the conduct it prohibits or requires before penal sanctions can be applied.gates fox osha,see satellite broad.fcc.as the court observed in general electric,i n the absence of example,where the regulation is not sufficiently clear to warn a party about what is expected of agency may not deprive a party of property by imposing civil or criminal liability.at.however,the fact that the wage determination did not itself explain that the company had to base its job classification on the practice of the relevant unions does not end the inquiry.p arties dealing with the government are expected to know the law,atc petroleum,at
