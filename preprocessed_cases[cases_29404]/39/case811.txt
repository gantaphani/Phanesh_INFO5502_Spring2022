introduction 
coral construction,coral filed this action against the city and county of san francisco and other individual defendants collectively,city challenging the constitutionality of city business utilization ordinance the ordinance.in essence,coral alleges that the ordinance provisions granting preferential treatment to women and businesses in bids for city contracts violates article i,section of the california constitution proposition.on summary judgment,city successfully challenged coral standing to sue for injunctive and declaratory relief,on the ground that coral had failed to prove it would be bidding on an identifiable city contract subject to the ordinance in the reasonably near future.we conclude that coral standing to challenge the ordinance does not depend upon the identification of a specific contract on which it will bid in the near future,and accordingly,we reverse.
ii.background facts and procedural history 
the ordinance is codified in chapter.of the san francisco administrative code.its relevant provisions are summarized by the director of san francisco human rights commission hrc 
under section.a bid discount program,city departments must give specified percentage discounts to bids submitted by businesses certified by the hrc as minority business enterprises mbes,woman business enterprises wbes,local business enterprises lbes,as well as joint ventures with appropriate level of mbe,wbe or lbe participation.under section.subcontracting program,bidders for certain types of prime city contracts must demonstrate their good faith efforts to provide certified mbes and wbes an equal opportunity to compete for subcontracts.a bidder may comply with the subcontracting program by documenting its good faith efforts to inform mbes and wbes of subcontracting opportunities.bidders who show that they plan to use mbe and wbe subcontractors at a level one would expect absent discrimination need not document their good faith efforts.any prime contract bid that fails to comply with the subcontracting program is declared nonresponsive.
coral work and bidding history 
coral is a specialty highway contractor whose primary work involves the installation of road and freeway signage as well as guardrails and other safety appurtenances virtually all of coral work is in the public sector.although headquartered in oregon,coral performs a large percentage of its work in california,including in the bay area.during the five years prior to the filing of this action to an average of percent to percent of coral total revenues came from its work in california.for the same five years,the gross revenues from coral work for city have comprised approximately percent of coral total revenue.
in coral acquired a controlling interest in hubbs construction,a california public works contractor.as a result,coral now has the capability to do additional types of work,in particular,airport construction work.according to jay minor,coral chief operating officer,t his acquisition increases coral opportunities for bidding on and for performing public works projects in california including city public construction projects and does so with less subcontracting of work out to other firms.
coral has been bidding on city projects since.in marinship construction services was awarded a bid for work at the new international terminal at the san francisco international airport coral was the subcontractor for signs and sign structures.in coral bid as a subcontractor for work on the relocation of mcdonald road,but the prime contract bid was unsuccessful.in coral was also the subcontractor on a successful bid by kulchin condon associates for work on the terminal ramps at the airport.in coral was invited to negotiate a supplemental contract for additional work in the terminal areas.the negotiations were successful,and coral completed the additional work on a schedule in time for the opening of the new terminal in the summer of.
in the airport put out to bid a project for additional signage at the airport contract.a.two companies submitted bids coral and agnotti reilly.coral bid did not include any subcontractors because coral intended to do all of the work with its own crew coral was the low bidder however,its bid was rejected as nonresponsive.the project manager wrote specifically,coral bid failed to demonstrate compliance with subcontracting goals in that it failed to list its subcontractors in its bid coral also failed to demonstrate that it made sufficient good faith efforts to utilize subcontractors by its failure to submit adequate good faith efforts documentation the mbe wbe goals for this contract are and respectively.the bid was awarded to agnotti reilly,whose bid exceeded coral by percent 
after filing this action in september,coral continued to consider and to bid on projects in san francisco in coral submitted a subcontract bid to jmb construction for additional work at the san francisco international airport.coral was accepted as the subcontractor and jmb was awarded the contract.although coral purchased the materials necessary to complete the work,in march this portion of the project was cancelled.the project manager stated that the cancellation occurred solely due to the declining economy and the resultant decline in airport revenues.
in january coral purchased the plans and specifications for another airport project taxiway z bypass,but chose not to submit a bid for various reasons,including the relatively short workday count,coral work commitments on other projects,and the high percent disadvantaged business enterprise dbe goal applying a federal regulation,not city ordinance set forth in the bid documents.in june coral bought the plans and specifications for two projects the lake muir drive fishing pier and parking lot and the light rail transit project on third street.coral declined to bid on the smaller lake merced project,but was solicited to submit bids as a subcontractor for the light rail project also governed by federal regulations rather than the ordinance.coral submitted bids to potential prime bidders and was the subcontractor on two of the three apparent low bids 
additional facts 
in his declaration opposing summary judgment jay minor states coral is ready,willing,and able and is continuing to bid on all appropriate and available opportunities that arise within its specialty areas of work in the san francisco bay area.specifically,coral is awaiting further opportunities to bid on city projects at the airport and within the city.when such opportunities arise,coral is ready,willing,and able and intends to bid again and work on such projects coral work meets all professional standards and city ha s never rejected any of coral work on its projects for failure to perform in a professional and manner,for failure to perform to contract specifications,for inadequate bonding or insurance,for lack of appropriate licensing,or for inability to perform.
minor further avers that coral is placed at a severe competitive disadvantage when it bids on city contracts because,inter alia,its contract bids are not entitled to the discounts that apply to wbe and mbe contractors and subcontractors,and if it complies with the ordinance,its expenses are increased by the cost of outreach to mbe and wbe.further,the ordinance requires coral to use mbe and wbe subcontractors rather than its own employees or other subcontractors of its own choosing,and to discriminate against enterprises not owned by women or minorities who may want to participate as subcontractors.minor states coral is placed at risk of liability for such discrimination.
city evidence 
city presented voluminous declarations and exhibits demonstrating the following facts 
all of coral contracts or bids have been for erecting and installing large,overhead roadway signs.as of the date coral filed its complaint,city only rarely let contracts that involved the kind of signage work performed by coral,and no mbe or wbe were certified to do this kind of work.coral never competed directly with a wbe or mbe either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor.coral has bid on only one prime contract let by city.
before filing its complaint coral had bid as a subcontractor on three city projects,but these bids were under the ordinance.coral did not submit bids for signage work included in three department of public works dpw projects let for bids in the period from to.hubbs has never submitted a bid on any city contracts.certain city contracts are not subject to the ordinance,contracts funded by state or federal funds,contracts for emergency services or construction,and contracts for over million.
city also presented evidence that the next three to five years,would produce few,if any,bidding opportunities for coral.city did identify the aforementioned third street light rail transit project on which coral has participated as a subcontract bidder.city also identified a dpw project that entails the installation of overhead signage but noted it would be subject to the california department of transportation dbe requirements and not city ordinance.finally,city presented a declaration from the airport manager of the bureau of design and construction.he stated the airport has no current plans to put out to bid any further city contracts involving the installation of overhead traffic signage or the erection of overhead sign structures.however,he was hopeful that by the airport would have sufficient resources to complete the airtrain expansion project,which would include construction of an overhead sign bridge.although the declarant did not so state,the implication is that coral would be expected to bid on this project and,like the other airport projects,it would be subject to the ordinance.
e.the motions and the trial court ruling 
coral filed motions for summary judgment,summary adjudication,judgment on the pleadings,peremptory writ of mandate and preliminary injunction.city filed a for summary judgment.in its motion,city argued that coral facial challenge to the ordinance was not ripe for adjudication and was barred by the statute of limitations.the motion primary ground,however,was that coral lacked standing to challenge future enforcement of the ordinance because coral can not identify specific facts supporting its claim that the ordinance will cause coral to suffer a future injury that is both concrete and particularized,and imminent.city motion for summary judgment was granted in a nutshell,the court ruled the undisputed evidence establishes that,at the time coral filed its complaint,coral did not face an invasion of a legally protected interest from the ordinance that is both a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent.citations.judgment in favor of city was entered on the order,and coral filed this timely appeal 
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review of a summary judgment in favor of a defendant is well settled.we independently assess the correctness of the trial court ruling by applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether any triable issues of material fact exist,and whether the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.rubin united air lines,th,d.in doing so,we construe the moving party affidavits strictly,construe the opponent affidavits liberally,and resolve doubts about the propriety of granting the motion in favor of the opposing party.ibid.
applicable legal standards for standing 
an action challenging a legislative act can not be brought by any individual or entity that disagrees with it.in order to invoke the aid of the courts,a plaintiff must be beneficially interested in the controversy that is,he or she must have some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.citation.holmes california nat.guard th,d.our supreme court has held that t his standard is equivalent to the federal injury in fact test,which requires a party to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it has suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.northeastern.chapter,associated contractors of america jacksonville,d associated builders contractors,san francisco airports com.cal th,d,associated builders.
concrete and particularized injury 
in northeastern.chapter,associated contractors of america jacksonville,supra,at page.northeastern,a trade association challenged an ordinance adopted by the city of jacksonville requiring that percent of the amount spent on city contracts be set aside each year for mbe.the petitioner,most of whose members did not qualify as mbe,alleged that many of its members regularly bid on and perform construction work for the city of jacksonville,and would have bid on designated set aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed.id.at.the court of appeals concluded that the petitioner lacked standing because it has not demonstrated that,but for the program,any agc member would have bid successfully for any of these contracts,citation.id.at.
the supreme court reversed,stating that such proof was not necessary to establish standing.northeastern,supra,at.when the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group,a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.the injury in fact in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier,not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.id.at.to establish standing,therefore,a party challenging a program like jacksonville need only demonstrate that it is able and ready to bid on contracts and that a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an equal basis,fn.omitted.
similarly,in monterey mechanical wilson cir,monterey mechanical,a contractor bid was rejected for failure to comply with a state statute requiring a prime contractor to subcontract percent of its work to,and businesses or to demonstrate a good faith effort to meet those goals.the other bidder on the project submitted documentation demonstrating compliance with the good faith requirement of the statute,and was awarded the contract.ibid.the trial court found monterey mechanical had no standing to sue because all general contractors,not just contractors,were bound by the same requirements and,therefore,the application of the statute did not cause monterey mechanical to lose the contract.id.at.
the ninth circuit reversed.monterey mechanical,supra,at.following northeastern,it held a bidder need not establish that the discriminatory policy caused it to lose the contract.to establish standing bidders need only show that they are forced to compete on an unequal basis.citation.being forced to compete on an unequal basis because of race or sex is an injury under the equal protection clause.monterey mechanical,at.
injury that is actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical 
the second half of the injury in fact test requires that the party seeking future relief from the provisions of an allegedly unconstitutional ordinance show actual or imminent as opposed to conjectural or hypothetical harm from its application.lujan defenders of wildlife,d lujan.where a petitioner seeks declaratory or injunctive relief,it is insufficient that he has been injured in the past he must instead show a very significant possibility of future harm in order to have standing.citation.bras california public utilities com cir,bras.as we have described,this does not mean the petitioner must demonstrate it will lose a contract bid under the allegedly illegal ordinance.rather,in this context,it means the must show that sometime in the relatively near future it will bid on another government contract that offers financial incentives to a prime contractor for hiring disadvantaged subcontractors.adarand constructors,pena,d adarand see also coral const.king county cir,coral const.allegation that it will continue to bid on contracts on an unequal basis is sufficient to confer standing.
that the bidder ability and readiness to bid is subject to some delay outside the control of the bidder does not preclude a finding of imminence.in bras,pacific bell required service providers to prequalif y in order to bid on contracts.the prequalification form awarded points to certified minority and business enterprises,which bras was not.bras failed to prequalify,despite a history of satisfactory service provided to pacific bell.bras was informed that he would have prequalified if the points for minority and businesses had not been considered.bras,supra,at.bras sued for damages and sought injunctive and declaratory relief.the damage claim was settled.the remaining claims were dismissed for lack of standing.id.at.the ninth circuit reversed.id.at.
in his complaint,bras did not allege any present intention to bid on contracts for pacific bell.indeed,bras was precluded from submitting bids for a period because the utility ha d entered into business relationships with three architects that were then used for all of its architectural service needs.bras,supra,at.but at the end of the hiatus bras was free to fill out a new prequalification form.that bras can only compete for contracts every several years rather than on a basis does not change the analysis.ibid.bras presented evidence of his willingness and desire to continue to contract with pacific bell for his services,and of pacific bell satisfaction with his services in the past.the court concluded,t his evidence is sufficient to establish,for purposes of summary judgment,that bras will suffer future injury if the program is not enjoined.id.at.
in contrast,the plaintiff in cornelius los angeles county.authority th,d cornelius failed to meet minimal standing requirements.in cornelius,the plaintiff,a licensed engineer,brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the dbe program of the metropolitan transit authority mta.the program,adopted to comply with federal regulations,required that percent of the mta projects be awarded to dbe and set participation goals for dbe as subcontractors on prime contracts.id.at,d.
cornelius had worked for a company that had participated as a subcontractor in a bid to build a metro station.the prime contractor bid had been rejected,even though it was the lowest bid,because it failed to satisfy the requirements of the dbe program.the contractor sued the mta,but subsequently dismissed its action.cornelius then filed suit.cornelius,supra,th at,d.he claimed standing based on his status as an employee agent for businesses that had bid and would bid in the future on mta projects.id.at,d.it was undisputed,however,that cornelius was not a licensed contractor,and he asserted no ownership interest in any business that was a licensed contractor therefore he was not qualified to bid on construction projects.thus,cornelius has been and remains incapable as a matter of law of submitting a bid to the mta as a general contractor.id.at,d.cornelius further argument,that as a civil engineer he may bid on work for mta contracts and provide professional engineering services under contract with mta general contractors,was also insufficient to satisfy standing requirements.id.at,d.t he inchoate possibility based upon his possession of an engineer license that cornelius could have or may want to bid and,if so,the dbe criteria would deny him the ability to compete on equal footing,is insufficient to make the showing,as required by case law,of an imminent injury.id.at,d.
the case of associated builders provides additional guidance.there,petitioner trade association members had refused to bid on certain airport construction contracts because they contained a specification called a project stabilization agreement psa.associated builders,supra,cal th at,d.the association abc filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking an order to strike the psa as violative of the state constitution and statutes.the petition was denied on the merits.id.at,d.on appeal the airports commission argued the abc lacked standing because it had failed to show any history of past bids by its members,failed to show the members had the necessary qualifications to bid in the future,and failed to allege its members would bid on contracts of the requisite size,those exceeding.id.at,d.the supreme court rejected these arguments,concluding,i f abc could demonstrate that the psa specification has the effect of infringing its members rights of association or expression,or that it has an anticompetitive impact on them,then abc might legitimately claim a beneficial interest within the meaning of code of civil procedure section and cases interpreting that statute.thus,although abc allegations on the issue of standing are rather scanty,we conclude they suffice to confer standing to challenge the psa on behalf of its members,at,d,italics added,citing adarand,supra,at.
standing to sue 
city concedes that coral has demonstrated a potential future injury that is concrete and particularized,that coral could be harmed in the future as a potential prime contractor by not receiving the benefit of a discount under the bid discount program,or by having its bid rejected for failure to comply with the subcontracting program.city argues,however,that coral has not offered any evidence that it was likely to bid as a prime contractor on a city contract to which the city programs applied in the foreseeable future.therefore,city argues,coral fail s the imminence test.in support of this contention city has marshaled the following evidence coral does not regularly bid on city contracts and has bid on only one prime contract subject to the ordinance city only rarely puts out to bid the type of specialized sign work coral has done in the past many of city construction contracts are not subject to the ordinance and city has no current plans to put out to bid any contracts subject to the ordinance that include specialized sign work coral has done in the past,except for an airport project that is not expected to be funded,if at all,until.
in essence,city tenders this novel theory once a defendant has presented proof that there are no current plans to put out to bid any contracts subject to the challenged ordinance for the kind of work the plaintiff has done,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to identify a specific contract it will bid upon in the near future in order to demonstrate an injury that is actual or imminent and not conjectural or hypothetical.we do not think this theory accurately reflects the law.city contention is predicated primarily on the view that coral had to present evidence showing that the city is likely to let a prime contract for a specific service overhead signage in the reasonably near future and coral is very likely to bid on that contract.adarand,supra,at.cornelius,supra,th at,d.italics added.following city lead,the court below reached the conclusion that because coral had submitted only one bid to city as a prime contractor,and because the city only rarely puts out to bid the type of sign work coral has on occasion sought to perform for the city,the court can not conclude that coral could suffer harm as a potential prime contractor in the reasonably near future.citations.therefore,the court can not reasonably infer that at the time coral filed its complaint,coral faced an imminent injury from the bid discount program or at some time in the reasonably near future,the city would reject a bid by coral on a prime contract for failing to comply with the subcontracting program.italics added.
contrary to city contention,we are aware of no requirement that a plaintiff must prove the agency is likely to let a contract the plaintiff will bid on in the reasonably near future in order to establish imminent injury.in adarand it happened that the plaintiff satisfied the standing requirement by demonstrating the state put certain contracts out to bid on a annual basis,this frequency was not likely to change,and the plaintiff regularly bid on those contracts.adarand,supra,at.however,the court in adarand did not hold that something less than annual bidding would not satisfy the standing requirement.rather,the question was whether sometime in the relatively near future plaintiff will bid on another government contract that offers financial incentives to a prime contractor for hiring disadvantaged subcontractors.id.at,italics added.
the term relatively is not synonymous with reasonably.in this setting,a meaning of the term relatively would refer to bidding relative to the frequency of contracts becoming available for bidding.see,bras,supra,at t hat bras can only compete for contracts every several years rather than on a basis does not change the analysis.city contends,however,that bras was incorrectly decided and,instead,this court should follow more recent decisions on the subject of imminent injury.none of the four cited decisions are applicable here.
in thomas anchorage equal rights com cir thomas and san diego county gun rights reno cir san diego,the plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of certain proscriptive statutes.in such cases,a plaintiff has standing to sue only if he or she faces a genuine threat of imminent prosecution under the challenged statute.thomas,supra,at san diego,supra,at.the plaintiffs could not satisfy this standard because they alleged no concrete plan to violate the challenged statutes.in san diego the plaintiffs alleged only that they wish and intend to engage in activities prohibited by the statute.san diego,supra,at.in thomas the plaintiffs claimed injury was only a fear of enforcement or prosecution if they did violate the statute.thomas,supra,at.thus,none of the plaintiffs could demonstrate any real danger that they would suffer a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement.compare babbitt farm workers,d the plaintiffs had standing because they alleged they previously engaged in and would continue to engage in acts regulated by the challenged statute.
city also cites scott pasadena unified school dist.cir scott.but there,the plaintiffs filed suit prior to any application of a school district allegedly unconstitutional school integration policy.id.at.moreover,because the policy was only a conditional one,it would be applied only school population was found not to be sufficiently diverse without application of the policy id.at,the plaintiffs could not show a genuine threat of adverse treatment due to the policy imminent enforcement id.at.
in the fourth cited case,schurr resorts intern.hotel,cir,schurr,although the plaintiff alleged an incident of unlawful employment discrimination in pursuant to the defendant affirmative action regulations,there was no evidence he was in danger of suffering imminent injury from application of the regulations in the future.indeed,the evidence showed it was unlikely he would suffer any future harm because,since the incident,the regulations had not adversely affected his ability to secure both a position and numerous,additional positions.id.at.
city also relies on language found in lujan and in los angeles lyons,d lyons to support its claim that coral has failed to prove an imminent injury.but the language is of little use here,in a fundamentally different factual setting.
in lyons,the plaintiff was injured when a police officer used a chokehold without provocation or justification.the plaintiff claimed this practice was the result of a city policy.lyons,supra,at.the court held the plaintiff had no standing to seek prospective relief from that policy because the plaintiff did not allege any reasonable only a fear that a future encounter with police officers would result in his being subjected to the chokehold again.id.at fn.
lujan is even less useful as precedent.there,the court explained that the quantum of proof to establish standing depends in large measure on whether the plaintiff is among those governed by the regulation at issue.when the suit is one challenging the legality of governmental action,the nature and extent of facts that must be averred or proved in order to establish standing depends considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an object of the action at issue.if he is,there is ordinarily little question that the action has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing the action will redress it.when,however,as in this case,a plaintiff asserted injury arises from the government allegedly unlawful regulation of someone else,much more is needed.lujan,supra,at.in lujan the challenged regulation did not apply to the plaintiffs and they claimed only that it might,indirectly,affect their activities at some indefinite future time.the court noted that,in a case where no actual injury is claimed,the some day intentions of plaintiffs without any description of concrete plans id.at.stretch the concept of imminence beyond the breaking point id.at,fn.in such circumstances we have insisted that the injury proceed with a high degree of immediacy,so as to reduce the possibility of deciding a case in which no injury would have occurred at all.citations,italics added.
as can be seen,lyons and lujan have little bearing on this case.here,coral indisputably is an object of the challenged regulation,has suffered actual injury from its application,and has stated an unequivocal intention and ability to take action affected by the regulation,to its injury,in the future.
as further support for its contention that coral can not demonstrate imminent injury,city points to the additional facts that a coral has bid on only one prime contract,and b many city contracts are not governed by the ordinance.but the fact that some,or even many,of city and not covered by the ordinance does not negate the fact that some contracts were,and will be,governed by the ordinance,or the fact that coral has bid in the past and stands ready,willing and able to bid in the future on contracts governed by the ordinance.the issue,simply put,is whether a plaintiff can show it will bid on a contract sometime in the relatively near future under an ordinance that offers financial incentives for hiring disadvantaged subcontractors.adarand,supra,at.
similarly,the fact that coral has,in the past,bid on only one prime contract is not proof that future injury is only conjectural in associated builders the plaintiff members refused to bid on any contracts containing an allegedly illegal specification.associated builders,supra,cal th at,d.there,standing was challenged on the ground,among others,that the plaintiff had not shown a history of bidding nor proven its members would bid in the future on contracts containing the specification.ibid.as we have noted,the high court rejected this contention,and held the plaintiff need only allege its members are potential bidders on whom the specification would have an anticompetitive impact,in order to show the necessary beneficial interest.id.at,d.
we are aware of no cases,and city has cited none,holding that the imminent injury component of standing,in a case challenging an allegedly illegal bidding ordinance,is negated if a plaintiff has bid only once in the past.rather,the various formulations of the rule emphasize likelihood,ability and willingness of the plaintiff to bid in the future.while multiple past bids would certainly be relevant in determining the likelihood of future bids see,adarand,supra,at.bras,supra,at,they are not a sine qua non of standing 
we would agree that standing can not be conferred if it hinges upon a single event.but these are not the facts of this case.here it has been shown city occasionally puts out contracts for the specialized sign work done by coral at least some of those contracts are covered by the ordinance coral has bid on at least one such contract as a prime contractor coral suffered an actual injury as a result of the application of the ordinance coral stands ready,willing and able to bid on future contracts and under the ordinance,when coral does bid it will be forced to compete on an unequal basis.these facts more than satisfy the standing test articulated in cornelius from the adarand,bras and northeastern cases we distill the principle that in order for a party to show that the future use of the dbe criteria will cause an actual or imminent injury,the party must minimally show it has bid in the past and would continue to bid in the future.cornelius,supra,th at,d.
