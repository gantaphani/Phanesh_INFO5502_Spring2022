innerchange offers a residential inmate program within the newton,iowa,facility.innerchange,and its affiliate prison fellowship,are nonprofit c corporations.from september,to june,the innerchange program was funded in part by iowa.
the purposes of innerchange are reduce the rate of and the resulting societal costs and provide a positive influence in prison.innerchange ultimate goal is to see become contributing members of society,by becoming responsible leaders in their family,church and community.innerchange,a christian program,describes itself as an intensive,voluntary,program of work and study within a loving community that promotes transformation from the inside out through the miraculous power of god love.innerchange is committed to christ and the bible.we try to base everything we do on biblical truth.further,biblical principles are integrated into the entire course curriculum of innerchange,rather than compartmentalized in specific classes.in other words,the application of biblical principles is not an agenda is the agenda.the doc has no control over the selection or teaching of the innerchange curriculum or personnel 
the program is quartered in newton unit e.this unit,due to construction budget constraints,has wooden cell doors to which inmates have keys,and community bathrooms with privacy dividers thus,dry cells.before innerchange use,unit e housed honor inmates.building m at newton also is used only by innerchange.building m has offices,classrooms,a computer room,a library,and a room,but no security cameras.
inmates are not required to join innerchange.no one from the doc or innerchange threatens punishment,reduction in privileges,or otherwise pressures inmates to participate.if inmates join,no one from the doc or innerchange promises a reduced sentence or earlier parole.when joining,an inmate confirms in writing that participation is voluntary and will not affect eligibility for parole.the mandatory statement adds that the program is based on christian values and contains religious content,but an inmate need not be a christian to participate.also,discontinuation may be voluntary or involuntary,and the inmate will not be penalized for voluntary withdrawal.
iowa inmates are introduced to the program through presentations by innerchange personnel at the various doc institutions.the introduction workbook uses the christian bible to illustrate civic values.for example,the workbook includes saul conversion on the road to damascus,jesus choosing of the apostles,and the parable of the good samaritan.it also contains bible studies,such as do you know jesus personally salvation and answered prayer.an inmate may be eligible for innerchange after completion of the introductory program.there is a substantial inmate waiting list eligible to join innerchange inmates as of october.
innerchange begins with a orientation,followed by phases i through iv.according to the orientation materials,innerchange is a christian program,with a heavy emphasis on christ and the bible.all the components of the program are based on a biblical worldview.you will be expected to attend all innerchange programming,including religious services.further 
we believe that the root of our transformation is a spiritual change.innerchange is designed intentionally to help produce and nurture spiritual change in you.we focus on relationship with god and how that spreads to other relationships.we study the bible a lot.the bible is god revealed truth to us.jesus said,if you hold to my teachings,you are my disciples.then you will know the truth,and the truth will set you free john that is the kind of transformation we are talking about.
orientation materials contain introductory bible studies and state that each innerchange class is led by a biblical counselor who coaches the inmate in biblical living.
after orientation,to continue to phase i,an inmate must sign the innerchange accountability covenant,which states 
i understand that the principles in matthew will be applied to my life within the innerchange community.
those principles are 
error leads us to danger 
the heart of correction is to restore,
it is the responsibility for those involved to reconcile on an interpersonal level 
peer mediation is to be utilized if necessary 
removal from the community is a last resort 
conflict resolution builds a stronger community 
interpersonal forgiveness of others is a condition of personal forgiveness from god.
i have read,understand,and will adhere to the above principles as a condition of my participation in the innerchange program.
each day in phase i,which lasts months,opens with a devotional where inmates pray and read aloud from christian scripture.required classes fill the day,with homework,including memorization of bible verses.classes are followed by an afternoon community meeting.there,inmates pray,make prayer requests,sing religious songs,read from the bible,and hear a daily devotional message by an innerchange inmate.evening classes begin after dinner.friday evenings,a revival service is held all inmate participants are required to attend and take their bibles.sunday mornings,innerchange holds church services,which all program inmates must attend.
during the typical day in phase i,an inmate has five or six periods of free time,each lasting between minutes and an hour.the doc admits that during free time,innerchange inmates are allowed to use computers,but other newton inmates are not.
after completing phase i,the inmate may enter phase ii,which lasts six months.the inmate signs a continued stay agreement,to continue participation in the same basic schedule of morning devotionals,community meetings,afternoon and evening classes,friday evening revivals,and sunday morning services.by signing this agreement,the inmate understands that if i fail to maintain these expectations i will be subject to disciplinary actions.in phase ii,the inmate also is assigned an innerchange volunteer mentor,who assists the inmate in living the christian life.
innerchange curriculum in phases i and ii include several mandatory religious classes,such as experiencing god,old and new testament survey,and spiritual freedom.innerchange also has treatment classes,such as substance abuse,anger management,victim impact,criminal thinking,financial management,family series and.innerchange treatment classes have religious content.for example,innerchange affirms that its licensed substance abuse curriculum contains a high level of religious content,based on the premise that only jesus christ is the cure for addiction.anger management goals include learning how biblical power works and how to apply it.the criminal thinking course has four goals,each comparing and contrasting secular concepts to superior biblical truth and christian ethics.the only thoroughly secular course is computer training,which meets two hours each week.
to measure progress in phases i and ii,innerchange used a fruit of the spirit evaluation.in,this form was changed to a quarterly goals review based upon civic virtues.this evaluation rated the inmate progress based on characteristics in galatians.an inmate failure to meet expectations,or low fruit of the spirit score,could result in dismissal from innerchange.for example,in dismissing one inmate,the entire treatment team met and discussed his progress,concluding 
your conduct has been excellent according to security standards,and you are a hard worker.with you as a member you have always completed your work and assignments,however,you are not displaying the growth needed to remain in the program.your focus is not on god and his son to change you.
no discipline was imposed on this inmate upon dismissal from innerchange.most dismissals,however,were the result of minor infractions and attitudinal deficiencies.
additionally,innerchange staff,without doc personnel,supervise inmates in classes,activities,and recreation.the doc has authorized innerchange staff to write and issue a disciplinary behavior report on a participating inmate.after seven reports,the inmate receives,from a doc officer,a major report,indicating a serious rule violation.the inmates who testified at trial stated that innerchange staff possess many of the same duties as corrections personnel.
after phase ii,if the doc places a participating inmate in a work release center,he may enter phase iii.phase iv begins if an innerchange inmate is released from confinement.during these phases,the inmate is required to stay employed and attend church each sunday and at at the church agreed to by innerchange,for the first three months after release.
the contractual and monetary relationship between prison fellowship,innerchange,and the doc developed over a number of years.in,the new newton facility faced budgetary restraints,overcrowding,and lack of appropriate programs.prison administrators rank effective programs a close second to overcrowding in addressing prisoner security and safety concerns.corrections officials searched for innovative ways to meet programing needs.an innerchange program in texas was examined to determine if it would work at newton.a search also was conducted for other organizations with similar services.although there were several providers of programing,innerchange was the only organization officials found that offered a,residential program with excellent services.
officials were concerned with the constitutionality of innerchange religious model but concluded,due to budgetary constraints,that it was the only way to provide necessary programing.if the budget allowed,corrections officials gladly would offer a broader spectrum of programing.innerchange volunteers and donors enable it to provide and programing at a greatly reduced cost to the state.
in,iowa general services department publicly issued a request for proposals to establish a,program at newton.prison fellowship and innerchange,jointly,submitted the only proposal.their submission,however,sought partial state funding.the doc accepted the proposal.
in march,prison fellowship,innerchange and the doc contracted for program services,with reimbursement for costs and expenses.under an extension clause,the contract covered september to june.in the first year of the contract,the doc paid innerchange,with all the money coming from the inmate telephone rebate fund.in,the law was amended to delete the term rebate.by statute and regulation,expenditures from this fund are at the discretion of the doc for the benefit of inmates.iowa code a iowa admin.code.in the contract second year,the doc paid innerchange from the same fund.innerchange operating costs at newton were the second year.in the third year,innerchange was paid from the fund toward its operating cost of.
nearing the expiration of the contract in,the general services department issued a request for proposals to the general public to continue a,program at newton.innerchange submitted the only proposal,again accepted by the doc with prison fellowship no longer a party to the contract.
a contract was entered,renewable for terms from july to june.it provided state funding for the parts of the program.in the contract first year,to,innerchange operating expense was.the doc paid innerchange from the telephone rebate fund.this was the last year that rebate funds were paid to innerchange.additionally that year,the iowa legislature appropriated to the doc for a treatment program at the newton correctional facility.this appropriation was used to expand the innerchange program to the release center at newton a facility one mile from the main facility.the appropriation came from the healthy iowans tobacco trust proceeds from the master tobacco settlement between the state and tobacco manufacturers.during the contract second year,to,the legislature appropriated from the tobacco trust.actual payment from the trust to the doc for innerchange was.the program operating cost was.in the third year,to,the contract was changed to a per diem payment of for each inmate participating in the program.the legislature again appropriated,with actual payment to innerchange of.innerchange operating costs were.
in april,the doc issued the last request for proposals to continue the,program at newton.two organizations responded,innerchange and emerald correctional service provider.innerchange proposal of for a full array of services,including a licensed substance abuse program,was lower than emerald bid of.the doc accepted innerchange proposal.in the contract first and second years,july to june,the legislature appropriated each year.in june,the legislature refused to make a further appropriation.in accordance with the contract extension for,the innerchange program is operating without state funds.
until july,the doc funding accounted for to percent of innerchange operating costs.the contracts at issue mandated that government funds cover only the aspects,or the portion.the district court found that no clear understanding or definition of costs was developed.from the first billing september to april,the doc expressed concern about innerchange designation of religious and costs,but paid the billed amount.after reviewing the contract,the doc director for offender services concluded that the contract does get very specific about what kinds of expenses are billable.in,the doc services director called for a clear definition of religious versus expenses.at trial,the director testified that the definition was not ever resolved.the services director informed doc officials and innerchange that billing was generalized and did not detail why expenses were characterized as.despite this ambiguity,the newton warden testified that innerchange gave iowa far more value in programs than it paid for.
salaries and benefits for innerchange personnel were paid by the doc on a percentage basis.the state paid of the local director salary for the program manager for the aftercare manager for the office administrator and for each of four biblical counselors also called case workers.innerchange staff did not actually divide their work time into religious or nonreligious activities or make any allocation for payroll purposes.the percentages billed by innerchange were identical for every period until payment changed to per diem.
as for other expenses,the innerchange office administrator recorded items as religious or.items designated as were billed to and paid for by the doc.for example,innerchange brochure,a prison like no other,was printed completely at state expense.the brochure describes innerchange as a,biblically based,program that promotes personal transformation of prisoners through the power of the gospel.it represents the program as immersing in,programming and advancing the state objectives of rehabilitation and recidivism reduction with everything grounded in the word of god.the brochure states 
the innerchange freedom initiative is our chance to demonstrate,in a way secular people will never be able to doubt,that christ changes lives,and that changing prisoners from the inside out is the only program that really works.
at various times,the doc paid for small religious rings and volunteers and graduating inmates a subscription to a monthly christian devotional booklet and a church copyright license to use religious music in worship.additionally,all land and cell phone costs were billed to the doc.innerchange postal meter and thermal tape were billed to the state without detailed accounting.the doc paid for innerchange computer hardware,software,repair,and internet account.the doc also paid for innerchange letterhead,envelopes,printer and copier toner,paper,blank videotapes,and standard office supplies.each month,every photocopy up to was charged to the doc.copies over were designated as religious although the record does not reflect how many total copies were made each month.
building modular building housing innerchange offices and constructed in.by the contract,the telephone fund paid for building m,with ownership in the doc since.
when the doc reimbursed innerchange for costs or paid the per diem amount,the money was deposited in innerchange bank account.from that account,innerchange periodically transferred funds to prison fellowship general accounts,to cover program operating expenses.these general accounts also contain funds from private sources.
issues of standing arise throughout this case.there are two strands in standing jurisprudence article iii standing,which enforces the constitution requirement and prudential standing,which embodies judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.article iii of the constitution limits the judicial power of the united states to the resolution of cases and controversies,and article iii standing enforces the constitution requirement.hein freedom from religion,d,quoting daimlerchrysler cuno,d internal quotation marks omitted.the requisite elements of article iii standing are well established a plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief,quoting allen wright,d.
in the present case,there are four categories of plaintiffs inmates,americans united,an iowa taxpayer,and contributors to inmates telephone accounts who are also former cigarette smokers.first,the inmates allege they altered their behavior and had direct,offensive,and alienating contact with the innerchange program.see aclu.found.city of plattsmouth,cir,adopted by court en banc,aclu.found.city of plattsmouth,cir.an injunction can remedy this injury.the inmates have standing.
next,americans united has standing if a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.the second and third factors are not disputed.
regarding the first factor,americans united bases its members standing on iowa taxpayer status,as does the individual taxpayer plaintiff.generally,the interest of a taxpayer in seeing that treasury funds are spent in accordance with the constitution does not give rise to the kind of redressable personal injury required for article iii standing.hein,at.at.
because the interests of the taxpayer are,in essence,the interests of the,deciding a constitutional claim based solely on taxpayer standing would be,not to decide a judicial controversy,but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and department,an authority which plainly we do not possess.
quoting frothingham mellon.alteration in original.there is,however,a narrow exception to the general constitutional prohibition against taxpayer standing.id.at,citing flast cohen,d.the exception provides that a taxpayer will have standing consistent with article iii to invoke federal judicial power when he alleges that congressional action under the taxing and spending clause is in derogation of the establishment clause.daimlerchrysler,at.at,quoting flast,at.this exception also applies to state taxpayer challenges of state expenditures contrary to the establishment clause.see doremus bd.of.fed of teachers randall,cir.
in this case,the iowa legislature made specific appropriations from public funds for a treatment program at the newton correctional facility when innerchange solely provided the program.see hein,at.at in flast,the acts and expenditures warranting taxpayer standing were by express legislative mandate and appropriation.therefore,americans united and the individual taxpayer satisfy the narrow exception for taxpayer standing.
finally,as for the contributors to inmates telephone accounts,each paid money to a telephone account to permit an inmate to make calls.the profit or commission generated from the telephone vendor was deposited in the inmate telephone fund,specifically authorized by iowa statute.the payment was a charge correlated to a particular benefit exacted in exchange for a benefit of which the payor has voluntarily availed itself based on the cost of providing a benefit to the recipient.coal.for fair equitable regulations,cir.the payments to the telephone fund were thus voluntary fees,not taxes.id.the payments were not a tax,or a mandatory fee,as involved in the cases cited by the plaintiffs.see freedom from religion,bugher,cir.see also united states united foods,d bd.of regents southworth,d keller state bar,d lemon kurtzman,d.therefore,the to the telephone fund do not have taxpayer standing.prison fellowship,innerchange,and the doc motion for partial dismissal,as to standing,is denied,except as to the contributors to the telephone fund.
closely related to standing is mootness.under article iii of the constitution,federal court jurisdiction is limited to cases and controversies.haden pelofsky,cir.the controversy must exist throughout the litigation otherwise,the case is moot.id.federal courts lack power to decide the merits of a moot case.missouri ex rel.nixon craig,cir.
prison fellowship,innerchange,and the doc contend that any challenge to the fully performed contracts is moot.they cite several cases holding that if a litigant seeks an injunction against performance of a before the injunction is entered,the contract is fully request for injunctive relief is moot,as the court can not enjoin completed performance.see,agrigenetics,rose,cir curtis,livingston,cir fauconniere sec y of,cir.this reasoning does not apply here.the district court did not enjoin already concluded contracts.instead,it only addressed further operation of innerchange program at newton.additionally,the dispute as to restitution,premised on the unconstitutionality of the performed contracts,is a live controversy.
prison fellowship,innerchange,and the doc next move to dismiss all establishment challenges to the per diem payment structure,arguing such challenges are moot because the program has not been funded since july.to the contrary,the voluntary cessation exception to mootness applies.a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.city of mesquite aladdin castle,d.prison fellowship,innerchange,and the doc object,asserting that the relevant action was by the iowa legislature,not the defendants,and the funding expired by its own terms.however,innerchange and the doc did act by agreeing to the contract extension that deleted funding from iowa.
prison fellowship,innerchange,and the doc contend that americans united has not successfully demonstrated potential recurrence of the unlawful action.this argument misplaces the burden of showing the likelihood of recurrence.the defendant faces a heavy burden of showing that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again.lankford sherman,cir,quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.prison fellowship,innerchange,and the doc have not met this burden.they effectively ask this court to vacate the injunction without any assurance that they will not resume the prohibited conduct.therefore,under the voluntary cessation exception,the district court injunctive relief is not moot.
finally,the cessation of government funding does not render moot the live controversy about recoupment of previous payments discussed below in section.prison fellowship,innerchange,and the doc motion for partial dismissal,as it concerns mootness,is denied.
prison fellowship and innerchange assert they are not actors under color of state law for purposes of.t he element of excludes from its reach merely private conduct,no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.am.mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d,quoting blum yaretsky,d.however,i n certain circumstances the government may become so entangled in private conduct that the deed of an ostensibly private organization or individual is to be treated as if a state had caused it to be performed.wickersham city of columbia,cir,quoting brentwood acad.secondary sch.athletic ass n,d.
the issue is whether the alleged infringement of federal rights is fairly attributable to the state.kohn,d,quoting lugar edmondson oil,d.see also west atkins,d contract physician medical care of a state inmate is conduct fairly attributable to the state.thus,state action may be found if,though only if,there is such a close nexus between the state and the challenged action that seemingly private behavior may be fairly treated as that of the state itself.brentwood,at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.a approach determines whether there is state action 
first,the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the state is responsible second,the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.this may be because he is a state official,because he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials,or because his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the state.
regarding the first part,the alleged deprivation is a violation of the establishment clause.this violation is possible because of privileges created by the doc in its contracts with prison fellowship and innerchange.the doc gave prison fellowship and innerchange access to facilities,control of prisoners,and substantial aid to effectuate the program.thus,the privilege to prison fellowship and innerchange was created by the state.but montano hedgepeth,cir in challenge,prison chaplain religious acts were beyond governmental authority and could not fairly be attributed to the state.
the second,critical inquiry is whether prison fellowship and innerchange can properly be classified as state actors.the supreme court has recognized a number of circumstances under which this requirement can be met,but t he one unyielding requirement is that there be a close nexus not merely between the state and the private party,but between the state and the alleged deprivation itself.wickersham,at,citing brentwood,at.one way a private party can appropriately be characterized as a state actor is when it is a willful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents.adickes kress,d internal quotation marks omitted.however,the state mere acquiescence in a private party actions is not sufficient.wickersham,at,citing blum,at.
in this case,the state effectively gave innerchange its power to incarcerate,treat,and discipline inmates.innerchange teachers and counselors are authorized to issue inmate disciplinary reports,and progressive discipline is effectuated in concert with the doc.prison fellowship and innerchange acted jointly with the doc and can be classified as state actors under.seecorr.servs.malesko,d the private facility in question housed state who already enjoy a right of action against private correctional providers under smith cochran,cir persons to whom the state delegates its penological functions,which include the custody and supervision of prisoners,can be held liable for violations of the eighth amendment in a action street corr.of,cir a private prisoner operator acted under color of state law.
in this case,prison fellowship and innerchange are appropriate parties under.
on the merits,the plaintiffs invoke the establishment clause of the first amendment,as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment.see santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d.also involved is the establishment clause of the iowa constitution,which is analyzed simultaneously.see kliebenstein iowa conference of the united methodist church,iowa.the establishment clause erects a barrier between government and religious entities depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship.lynch donnelly,d,quoting lemon kurtzman,d see mccreary county am.civ.liberties union,d under the establishment clause detail is key.for those who wrote the religion clauses of the first amendment the establishment of a religion connoted sponsorship,financial support,and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.walz tax comm n,d.in each case,the inquiry calls for line drawing no fixed,per se rule can be framed.lynch,at.in our modern,complex society,whose traditions and constitutional underpinnings rest on and encourage diversity and pluralism in all areas,an absolutist approach in applying the establishment clause is simplistic and has been uniformly rejected by the supreme court.id.instead,a court should scrutinize challenged legislation or official conduct to determine whether,in reality,it establishes a religion or religious faith,or tends to do so.id.emphasis added.
for the contract years to,iowa made payments directly to innerchange.in determining whether this direct aid violates the establishment clause,this court must ask whether the government acted with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion,and whether the aid has the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.agostini felton,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
in the present case,the district court concluded that the doc purpose in contracting with and funding innerchange was secular offering comprehensive programing to inmates and reducing recidivism.this conclusion is.the doc officials were confronted with the secular,pragmatic needs of running a state prison facility with sufficient programming in a tight budgetary environment.the doc officials considered the long term nature of the innerchange program,its supportive communal environment,and its extensive care program,as the best indicators that the innerchange program could reduce recidivism in this case,the government did not act with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion.
to analyze whether aid has the effect of advancing or endorsing religion,three criteria are decisive whether government aid results in governmental indoctrination defines recipients by reference to religion or creates excessive entanglement.id.at.
first,government inculcation of religious beliefs has the impermissible effect of advancing religion.agostini,at.whether funding results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a question whether any religious indoctrination that occurs could reasonably be attributed to governmental action.mitchell helms,d plurality opinion,citing agostini,at.further,plaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is,or has been,used for religious purposes.id.at,concurring in judgment.this court does not presume inculcation of religion rather,plaintiffs raising an establishment clause challenge must present evidence that the government aid in question has resulted in religious indoctrination.id.at.see agostini,at.in the absence of evidence showing use of aid to inculcate religion,there is a presumption of compliance with secular restrictions.
in the present case,plaintiffs demonstrated and defendants do not seriously contest that the innerchange program resulted in inmate enrollment in a program dominated by bible study,christian classes,religious revivals,and church services.the doc also provided less tangible aid to the innerchange program.participants were housed in living quarters that had,in previous years,been used as an honor unit,and which afforded residents greater privacy than the typical cell.among other benefits,participants were allowed more visits from family members and had greater acces
