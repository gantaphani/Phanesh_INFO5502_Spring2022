berzon,circuit judge 
john prather sought to intervene as of right in a false claims act fca suit brought by the united states government against sprint communications,sprint.whether prather had the significantly protectable interest required to support his motion to intervene depends on whether he would have been entitled to any recovery if the government had intervened in his qui tam fca action.see fed.civ.a prather,cir.prather i.we conclude that government intervention in prather qui tam action could not have secured him any right to a share of the proceeds from that action and therefore affirm the district court order.
background 
in,prather filed a qui tam fca action against sprint and four other telecommunications companies,alleging that the companies were defrauding federal and state governments by overcharging them for electronic surveillance services.the government elected not to intervene in prather qui tam action.in november,the district court concluded that prather could not show he was an original source of publicly disclosed information regarding the telecommunications companies allegedly fraudulent activities and dismissed prather qui tam suit for lack of jurisdiction.we recently affirmed the district court dismissal of prather qui tam action.prather i,at.
while prather appeal of prather i was pending,the government filed its own fca suit against sprint.that action was transferred to the same district judge who had dismissed prather case.prather moved to intervene in the government fca action,maintaining that the government was pursuing an alternate remedy to prather qui tam action by filing its own fca action instead of intervening in his earlier fca suit under the fca,he had the same rights in the government alternate remedy proceeding as he would have had in his qui tam action and he therefore had a right to a share of the proceeds from any award or settlement in this litigation.see c 
the district court denied prather motion to intervene on the basis of its dismissal of prather qui tam action.because prather could not bring a successful qui tam action on related claims,the district court concluded,he had no standing to intervene in the government action.prather timely appealed the district court order.
discussion 
under the fca,private individuals with information about fraud against the government may bring qui tam actions on behalf of the united states.the government may elect to intervene in such an action and take over its prosecution,b pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the government,instead,id.c or decide not to take any action,allowing the private individual,known as the relator,to pursue the claim to completion,id.c.in any of those scenarios,the relator who brought the qui tam action generally has a right to a share of any proceeds from the action.id.d.if the government pursues an alternate remedy,the relator shall have the same rights in such proceeding as he would have had if the government had intervened in the qui tam action.id.c.
prather asserts that the government own action against sprint is an alternate remedy pursued in lieu of intervention in his earlier qui tam action.he maintains that he is therefore entitled to the same share of the government proceeds resulting from this action against sprint as he would have obtained if his qui tam action had gone forward.see id.on that basis,he contends,he was entitled to intervene as of right.see sw.ctr.for biological diversity berg,cir.southwest center setting out the test for federal rule of civil procedure rule a intervention as of right.
after the district court denial of prather motion to intervene,the government and sprint reached a settlement,and the district court accordingly dismissed the case.before turning to the merits of prather appeal,we consider whether this appeal is now moot.
the parties have not raised the mootness issue.nonetheless we address the issue sua sponte,because,if events change such that the appellate court can no longer grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party,any resulting opinion would be merely advisory,and the court would lack subject matter jurisdiction.shell offshore greenpeace,cir.quoting city of erie pap.here,we consider the effect of the settlement and voluntary dismissal of the case in which prather sought to intervene.
in some situations,the entry of final judgment in a case moots a appeal from the denial of his motion to intervene.west coast seafood processors ass nrdc,cir,for example,held that this court could not grant the appellant any effective relief by allowing it to intervene in a case that the district court ha d since decided,through an order on remedy and the subsequent final judgment,from which neither party ha d appealed.id.at.in other circumstances,however,an intervention controversy can remain live even after final judgment is entered in the underlying case.iv.partnership united states,cir,for instance,concluded that the appeal in that case was not moot,because,if it were concluded on appeal that the district court had erred in denying the intervention motion,and that the applicant was indeed entitled to intervene in the litigation,then the applicant would have standing to appeal the district court judgment.id.at quoting canatella california,cir.
outside of the special putative class action context,we have not specifically addressed whether the original parties settlement after the denial of an intervention motion invariably moots the appeal of that denial.alaska suburban propane gas,cir.discussing the special intervention standard for motions to intervene to appeal denial of class certification.but at least three other circuits have considered the question,and all have held that the dismissal of an underlying case following settlement does not necessarily render moot a appeal.see cvlr performance horses,wynne,cir.settlement in civil rico action purcell bank atl.fin,cir.class action settlement fdic jennings,cir.settlement between agency and private persons.most recently,after considering dbsi and west coast seafood along with more directly relevant cases from several other circuits,the fourth circuit concluded 
we find more persuasive the reasoning of those courts holding that dismissal of the underlying action does not automatically moot a preexisting appeal of the denial of a motion to intervene.this is so because in many cases,the resolution of an action between the original parties is not determinative of the defendant liability with respect to other potential plaintiffs.in these circumstances,when the motion to intervene is made while the controversy is live and the subsequent disposition of the case does not provide the relief sought by the intervenors for example,money damages,as appellants seek here,we can provide an effective remedy on appeal and therefore have jurisdiction.

we agree with the fourth circuit,for the reasons it gave,that the parties settlement and dismissal of a case after the denial of a motion to intervene does not as a rule moot a appeal.we note that to hold otherwise might well provide incentives for settlement that would run contrary to the interests of justice.id.at quoting fdic,at.
our question,then,is whether in the particular circumstances here,the settlement and dismissal of the underlying action make it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the putative intervenor even if we were to determine that the district court erred in denying his intervention.church of scientology of cal.united states,quoting mills green.our conclusion is that reversing the district court order could afford prather a possible avenue to some remedy,so the case is not moot.
although we do not yet consider the merits,the fca guides our preliminary consideration of whether prather might have anything left to gain from this court deciding his intervention appeal.prather moved to intervene in the government action against sprint so he could be afforded the same rights he would have received had the government instead intervened in his qui tam fca action.see c.the same rights afforded under the statute would include a right to the same share of the proceeds as in the disposition of a qui tam fca action.see id.d.the settlement agreement between the government and sprint did not provide prather with any such relief.additionally,the same rights afforded in an alternate remedy proceeding would include the relator right to object to the government direct settlement of an action with a defendant.see id.c b.upon a relator objection,the district court would need to determine,after a hearing,that the proposed settlement is fair,adequate,and reasonable under all the circumstances.id.
if we were to conclude prather had a right to intervene in the government fca action,he might be able to object to the settlement or otherwise seek his share of the proceeds from the government.as it thus does not appear impossible for prather to receive any effectual relief whatever if we determine that the district court erred in denying his motion to intervene as of right,church of scientology of,at,we conclude that the government settlement agreement with sprint and the dismissal of the underlying action do not moot this appeal.we therefore turn to the merits.
to intervene as of right under federal rule of civil procedure a,an applicant must satisfy a test 
the application for intervention must be timely the applicant must have a significantly protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the applicant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest and the applicant interest must not be adequately represented by the existing parties in the lawsuit.
southwest center,at quoting nw.forest res.council glickman,cir.in denying prather motion to intervene,the district court held that prather did not have standing to intervene,because he can not bring a successful qui tam action.on appeal,the parties contest only whether prather met the second prong of the intervention standard,an issue we review de novo.see united states ex rel.mcgough covington techs,cir.
an applicant seeking intervention is held to have a significant protectable interest in an action if the applicant asserts an interest that is protected under some law,and there is a relationship between the applicant legally protected interest and the plaintiff claims.donnelly glickman,cir.quoting nw.forest res.council,at.the district court based its denial of prather motion to intervene here on its earlier dismissal of prather qui tam action.as prather was not able to bring a qui tam action,the district court concluded,he had no rights to protect by intervening here.see prather v.at t,supp,cal,aff,at.
prather contends,however,that the district court failed to consider the import of the government decision not to intervene in his qui tam case.according to prather,he had a significant protectable interest,and his motion to intervene as of right therefore should have been granted,because his interest in this case is the same as his interest would have been if the government had intervened in his qui tam action protected under fca c and d and related to the government claims for recovery in this action.we can not agree.
section c protects prather rights only to the extent his rights would have been protected had the government intervened in his qui tam action.as it turns out,if the government had intervened in that action,prather would not have been entitled to any recovery.he therefore lacks a significantly protectable interest in this case,the government separate action against sprint.
prather contention that he would have been entitled to a relator share had the government intervened in his qui tam action is foreclosed by a key supreme court case interpreting the fca,rockwell international united states.where a qui tam action is brought on the basis of publicly disclosed information,the fca mandated a clear and explicit withdrawal of jurisdiction if the action is not brought by the government or an original source.id.at emphasis omitted.rockwell held that a relator jurisdictional defect is not cured by the government intervention.id.at.
in rockwell,the government intervened in the relator qui tam action the court entered judgment for the government and the relator.id.at.the defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the relator claims on the grounds that the relator was not an original source of the publicly disclosed information on which liability was based,and the court therefore lacked jurisdiction to enter judgment in favor of the relator.id.at.the relator and the government maintained that the government intervention provided an independent basis of jurisdiction,and any inquiry into the relator status was unnecessary because the government had intervened,making this an action brought by the attorney general.id.at.the court squarely rejected the argument,holding that a n action brought by a private person does not become one brought by the government just because the government intervenes and elects to proceed with the action.id.
prather argument that he is entitled to some fca recovery and thus to intervene here largely repeats the rejected argument in rockwell.under rockwell,had the government intervened in prather qui tam action,prather case still would have been dismissed under the former public disclosure bar.at that point,once prather ha d been determined to lack the jurisdictional prerequisites for suit,the fca action would have become an action brought by the attorney general.see id.at.prather,that is,could not have continued to pursue his qui tam action against sprint even if the government had intervened,although the government could have gone forward on its own behalf.
but the precise issue here is not whether prather could have continued as a relator in the suit.instead,it is whether he would have been entitled to any recovery if the government had intervened and,after his relator claim was dismissed,continued the suit on its own behalf.as the third circuit noted in ex rel.merena smithkline beecham,cir,i t would not necessarily follow that dismissed relators could not be awarded a share of the proceeds from a successful fca action,because congress may enact a statute providing for the payment of a reward or bounty to a who assists the government enforcement efforts.id.at.merena is correct,of course,that congress could have provided for a reward in these circumstances.but it did not,as several considerations confirm.
