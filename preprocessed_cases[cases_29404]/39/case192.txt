plaintiffs alan demos and ronald graham brought suit against the city of indianapolis and mayor bart peterson collectively the city,seeking unpaid overtime pay and vacation time credits allegedly due them under the fair labor standards act,the flsa or the act.the plaintiffs claim that because the city policies required that their pay be docked if they failed to work an day,they were not salaried employees under the act.rejecting these arguments,the district court granted summary judgment to the city,holding that plaintiffs were salaried executive or administrative employees exempt from the flsa and as government employees were subject to the department of labor public accountability exception to its rule.we agree with the district court and affirm the judgment below.
background 
this dispute began almost a decade ago,when the city of indianapolis elected mayor stephen goldsmith goldsmith made aggressive changes to staffing and managing city government by eliminating employee positions in several of the city major agencies and departments.in conjunction with these changes,employees classified as exempt from the act were instructed to record no more than eight hours per day and forty hours per week in their time matter the hours actually worked beyond that amount.select salaried supervisors received additional pay for working extra hours however,other salaried supervisors,including the plaintiffs,did not receive that additional pay.the city also implemented a policy of docking salaried employees if they worked less than a week or less than eight hours per day.under the city policy,if an employee had a partial day absence,accrued benefit leave would have to cover that absence,or pay would be docked from the weekly salary.
as a result of reduced staffing by the city,demos and graham claim that they were required to routinely work more than forty hours per week and their supervisory duties gradually diminished.plaintiffs filed this action claiming that they were no longer exempt employees,and the city failure to pay them overtime violated the act.after significant discovery and motion practice,the city moved for summary judgment.
initially,the district court granted summary judgment in part to the city,but found that it failed to provide sufficient undisputed facts regarding whether its employees were paid pursuant to principles of public therefore whether it was permitted to dock a salaried employee pay for time not worked.demos city of indianapolis,d.the district court later reconsidered and found that although the city initially failed to prove that it was entitled to the public accountability exception,the court could take judicial notice of various indiana laws that,coupled with the previously admitted and undisputed evidence,demonstrated that the city proved that it was publicly accountable demos and graham appeal.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see albiero city of kankakee,cir.when reviewing cases decided on summary judgment,we construe all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving this case the plaintiffs.see id.applying these principles,we must decide whether the district court properly determined that notwithstanding its policy of docking employees for absences,the city meets the salary basis test because it pays its employees pursuant to principles of public accountability and plaintiffs performed executive or administrative duties as defined by the regulations.
pursuant to the flsa,employees must be paid at least one and the amount of their regular wages for work beyond forty hours per week or eight hours per day.persons who are employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity,however,are exempt from the act overtime provisions.a see also a.the city claims that demos and graham are exempt under the act,pursuant to a analysis commonly referred to as the short test.see.
the short test has three elements a the salary basis test,b the employee classification as professional,administrative,or executive,and c the employee duties test.see,see also.the plaintiffs claim that the city failed to prove each prong of the short test.
a.the salary basis test 
under the short test first prong,the city is required to prove that demos and graham were paid on a salary basis.because demos and graham were paid more than per week,the city must show that each plaintiff salary was also a a amount constituting all or part of his compensation and b not subject to reduction because of variations or quantity of the work performed.see a.the city bears the burden of proof here because the flsa is a remedial act and exemptions from its coverage are to be narrowly construed against employers.klein.luke medical center,cir see also bankston illinois,cir.
if an employee salary is docked for absences,the regulations presume that the employee is not paid on a salary basis.see bankston,at at its inception in,the act and therefore the salary basis test applied only to private sector employers.see d ed,salary basis test.however,in,congress amended the act to extend its coverage to virtually all employees of state and local governments,except those employees that perform public safety functions.see,stat.although the supreme court initially found that this extension of the act violated the tenth amendment,see national league of cities usery,d,it later held that the act provisions were valid as extended to state and local employees.see garcia san antonio metropolitan transit authority,d.
in contrast to private sector employers,some government employers dock the pay of salaried workers for absences of even one hour during a forty hour work week,either because they are required by law to keep track of individual employees hours or because the public expects government workers to be available during normal business operating hours.see hilbert district of columbia.under this arrangement,many state and local governments do not pay their salaried employees in a fashion consistent with the salary basis test.see.in other words,whether a government employee wages are docked is not a good indicator of whether the employee is a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional employee.
in response to this problem,the department of labor developed a regulation which allows government employers to dock employees pay if the docking is pursuant to a system of public accountability 
an employee of a public agency shall not be disqualified from exemption on the basis that such employee is paid according to a pay system established by statute,ordinance,or regulation,or by a policy or practice established pursuant to principles of public accountability,under which the employee accrues personal leave and sick leave and which requires the public agency employee pay to be reduced or such employee to be placed on leave without pay for absences for personal reasons or because of illness for not less than one workday when accrued leave is not used by an employee because 
permission for its use has not been sought or has been sought and denied 
accrued leave has been exhausted or 
the employee chooses to use leave without pay.
see letter ruling,of labor,wage and hour division jan.this regulation is commonly known as the public accountability exception to the rule contained within the salary basis test.
there is no precise definition of public accountability,and neither our previous cases nor the text of the regulation attempt to create one however,under the regulation plain language,a government employer can meet the requirements of the salary basis test,notwithstanding its docking policy,if the docking policy was established pursuant to principles of public accountability.this suggests that providing proof of the government purpose for creating or maintaining the pay system is relevant to determining whether the exception applies.but,at a minimum,the city must prove that its policy is consistent with the government efforts to maintain a precise accounting of its employees hours for reasons that extend beyond calculating an appropriate salary,such as avoiding problems.
applying these
