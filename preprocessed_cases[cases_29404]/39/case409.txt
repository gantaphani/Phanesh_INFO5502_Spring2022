this appeal concerns raytheon company raytheon calculation and payment of pension fund adjustments pursuant to cost accounting standard,following the sale of three business segments.the united states government appeals the judgment of the court of federal claims trial court awarding raytheon as the government share of pension cost deficits related to two of the business segments.raytheon the trial court rejection of its request for recovery with respect to the third business segment on the basis that raytheon applied the wrong asset allocation method in its adjustment calculation.we affirm the decision of the trial court.
segment closings 
in this appeal,we address whether segment closing adjustments are ordinary pension costs subject to the federal acquisition regulation far timely funding requirement.see far j i in the early,raytheon underwent a major reorganization that involved the sale of at least eight business segments,including the three segments at issue in this appeal aircraft integrated systems ais,optical systems optical,and aerospace division aerospace.as part of each sale,raytheon retained the assets and liabilities of the pension plans associated with those segments.raytheon also calculated segment closing adjustments as required by the cost accounting standards cas.raytheon determined that,while some of its business segments had pension surpluses,the three segments at issue in this case had pension deficits.although raytheon paid the government its share of the surpluses,the government refused to pay its share of the deficits which raytheon calculated to be around million.
on november,and january,raytheon submitted certified claims for recovery of the deficits pursuant to the contract disputes act.see the contracting officer issued final decisions denying these claims on february,and march.the contracting officer concluded that the segment closing adjustments were subject to the far timely funding requirement,and the pension deficits were therefore unallowable because raytheon failed to fund the full amount of the pension deficits in the same year as the segment closings.see far j i.the contracting officer further concluded that raytheon segment closing calculations do not comply with cas.
applicable regulations 
in general,whether a contractor is required to comply with the cas depends on the dollar value and type of contracts it has received from the government.see to.a standard contract clause at far,cost accounting standards hereinafter the cas clause,is incorporated into all contracts.the cas clause requires the contractor to c omply with all cas,including any modifications and interpretations indicated thereto far a.the cas clause also allows the contractor or the government to seek an equitable adjustment for any increased costs incurred due to a required change in the contractor established accounting practices that were made to comply with future modifications to the cas.see id.a i.
two cas provisions generally govern the accounting treatment of pension costs cas and cas.cas requires contractors to fund pension costs within the cost accounting period in which those costs are assigned.d.cas defines the components of a pension cost as the following 
for pension plans,except for plans accounted for under the cost method,the components of pension cost for a cost accounting period are i the normal cost of the period,ii a part of any unfunded actuarial liability,iii an interest equivalent on the unamortized portion of any unfunded actuarial liability,and iv an adjustment for any actuarial gains and losses.
id.a.cas also defines a pension plan as a type of pension plan in which the benefits to be paid or the basis for determining such benefits are established in advance and the contributions are intended to provide the stated benefits.id.a.because a pension plan guarantees the payment of future benefits,the contractor must deposit enough money into the fund to cover all benefit payments to participants.determining the proper amount to deposit into the fund first requires making estimates on a wide range of variables,such as the expected growth of the pension fund assets and the length of time before participants retire.these estimates are known as actuarial assumptions.the standards that guide actuarial assumptions are set forth in the cas,which define an actuarial assumption as an estimate of future conditions affecting pension cost for example,mortality rate,employee turnover,compensation levels,earnings on pension plan assets,changes in values of pension plan assets.id.a.
cas requires a contractor to determine its pension costs for each cost accounting period using an actuarial cost method that takes into account the contractor best actuarial estimates in light of past experience and reasonable expectations.see id.b.to the extent this pension cost calculation results in an unfunded actuarial liability,cas requires the contractor to amortize this liability in equal annual installments for a period of to years.see id.a.cas defines an unfunded actuarial liability as t he excess of the actuarial accrued liability over the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan.id.a.in other words,a pension fund has an unfunded actuarial liability when the value of benefits already earned in prior years exceeds the estimated future value of the fund.
cas governs the adjustment and allocation of pension costs.in particular,cas provides for two types of pension cost adjustments i adjustments based on actuarial gains and losses,differences between estimates and actual experience and ii adjustments based on a closed segment pension surplus or deficit.normally,cas requires actuarial gains and losses to be amortized in equal annual installments over a year period.see a.when a business segment closes,however,there are no future periods within which to adjust the pension costs applicable to that segment.accordingly,the cost accounting standards board cas board,which has exclusive authority to prescribe,amend,and rescind cost accounting standards,a recognized that a means must be developed to provide a basis for adjusting such costs,preamble to cas,july.such a means was developed and is set forth in cas.
cas requires the contractor,following a segment closing,to determine the difference between the actuarial accrued liability for the segment and the market value of the assets allocated to the segment.c.the difference between the market value of the assets and the actuarial accrued liability for the closed segment represents an adjustment of pension costs.hence,the goal of a segment closing adjustment is to determine the present value of the pension plan at the time of the segment closing and to adjust the plan value to ensure it is to meet the promises made to the plan participants.the government and the contractor then allocate the resulting surplus or deficit between them.in,the cas board amended cas to require,among other things,the use of a specific formula to determine the resulting allocation between the government and the contractor.see.if the adjustment results in a surplus,the government may be entitled to recover its share from the contractor.see c vi.if the adjustment results in a deficit,the contractor may be entitled to recover its share from the government.see id.the government share of any adjustment surplus or deficit is allocable to contracts within the same year as the segment closing.id.c vii.
while cas and govern the accounting treatment of pension costs,far j governs their allowability.in particular,this far provision requires all pension costs assigned to the current year to be funded by the time set for filing of the federal income tax return or any extension thereof.far j i.this timely funding requirement is repeated under subparagraph j,which addresses pension plans,and provides that pension costs see cfr a assigned to the current accounting period,but not funded during it,shall not be allowable in subsequent years.id.j i a.but subparagraph j,which addresses segment closings and requires that any adjustment amount shall be the amount measured,assigned,and allocated in accordance with cfr c,does not directly impose the timely funding provision.id.j i.
trial court decision 
on april,raytheon filed suit in the trial court,challenging the contracting officer denial of its claims.raytheon argued that the government was required to pay its share of the deficits because the segment closing adjustments complied with the requirements of cas.in response,the government moved for summary judgment on the grounds that raytheon segment closing adjustments did not comply with the far timely funding requirement.the government also argued in the alternative that it was entitled to a downward adjustment on any recovery by raytheon to account for certain pension contributions made on contracts entered into before cas was amended in.
on january,the trial court and the government motion for summary judgment.the trial court relied on two previous decisions to conclude that segment closing adjustments are not the type of pension costs subject to the far annual timely funding requirement.see,viacom,united states,fed.cl.motors united states,fed.cl.the trial court noted that the government has repeated the same arguments that this court has previously rejected in the other cas cases involving a deficit following a segment closing adjustment and has not provided the court with any reason to revisit its previous rulings.raytheon united states,fed.cl,cofc decision i.
the case proceeded to trial,and on june,the trial court issued its decision in the case and determined that raytheon was entitled to for the government share of the deficit adjustments for the ais and aerospace segments.see raytheon united states,fed.cl,cofc decision ii.the trial court found that the government did not meet its burden of proving that raytheon adjustment calculations for these two segments violated cas.
the trial court also held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the government request for a downward adjustment of raytheon recovery.the trial court concluded that the government equitable adjustment must take the form of a claim under the contract disputes act because it is distinct from the segment closing adjustment required under cas c and is instead based on the equitable adjustment provisions of the cas clause,far.cofc decision ii,fed.cl.at.the government was thus required to submit its claim to the contracting officer for a final decision before it could be addressed by the trial court,which it failed to do.see a.
finally,the trial court found that raytheon adjustment calculation for the optical segment was improper.because raytheon pension plan covered multiple segments,cas c required raytheon to use one of two methods to initially allocate a share of the pension assets to the optical segment.raytheon final adjustment calculation varied depending on which allocation method it used.under the allocation method found at subparagraph c i,raytheon calculated a pension deficit of for the optical segment.during trial,raytheon actuarial expert revised these calculations and came to the slightly lower deficit of.under the alternative allocation method found at subparagraph c ii,raytheon calculated a pension surplus of.the trial court determined that raytheon could not use the c i method to allocate pension assets to the optical segment because the necessary data on the optical segment contributions to the pension fund were not readily determinable for the entire segment.because raytheon alternative calculations under the c ii allocation method resulted in an adjustment surplus,the trial court held that raytheon was not entitled to any recovery for the optical segment.
on appeal,the government asks us to reverse the trial court decision for three reasons.first,the government asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that segment closing adjustments are not pension costs subject to the far timely funding requirement.second,the government argues that the trial court erred in placing the burden of proof on the government to show that raytheon segment closing calculations violated cas.finally,the government argues that the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the government request for a downward equitable adjustment.raytheon the trial court rejection of its adjustment calculation for the optical segment.

timely funding requirement 
the government primary argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in concluding that segment closing adjustments are not pension costs subject to the timely funding requirement of far j.we disagree.
we have previously interpreted cas and the provisions governing segment closing adjustments,albeit in the context of adjustment surpluses.see,directv group,united states,gates raytheon,allegheny teledyne united states.in gates,we recognized the unusual nature of segment closing adjustments and concluded that cas effectively looks to whether the government has over or,in the past,its share of pension costs for the segment.at.in allegheny teledyne,we similarly recognized,in the context of the pre version of cas,that segment closing adjustments are treated differently than annual pension costs.at.but we have not yet had occasion to address the applicability of the far annual timely funding requirement to segment closing adjustments resulting in pension deficits.
the government assertion that far j clearly defines a segment closing adjustment as a pension cost subject to the provision timely funding requirement is incorrect.first,the government ignores that neither cas nor cas treat a segment closing adjustment as a pension cost for purposes of the annual timely funding provision.cas specifically defines the four components of a pension cost,none of which include segment closing adjustments 
for pension plans,except for plans accounted for under the cost method,the components of pension cost for a cost accounting period are i the normal cost of the period,ii a part of any unfunded actuarial liability,iii an interest equivalent on the unamortized portion of any unfunded actuarial liability,and iv an adjustment for any actuarial gains and losses.
cas refers to segment closing adjustments as adjustment s of pension costs,which suggests that the segment closing adjustment is not itself a pension cost.the preamble to cas further states that a segment closing adjustment is not an actuarial gain or loss as defined in the standard and that the the purpose of this provision is to serve as a basis for recognizing and adjusting costs previously allocated to the segment being terminated,july,emphasis added the cas board thus intended to treat segment closing adjustments as something different from ordinary pension costs for purposes of cas and.see allegheny teledyne,at acknowledging that the board intentionally elected to treat a segment closing adjustment differently.
second,the government argues that the dispositive issue is not whether the cas segment closing adjustment is a pension cost for purposes of the cas but whether it is a pension cost for purposes of the binding far regulation that governs the allowability of pension cost.this argument confuses the relationship between the cas and the far cost principles.although the government is correct that the far governs all matters of cost allowability,the cas has exclusive authority over the measurement,assignment,and allocation of costs.see a.
in,congress empowered the cas board to promulgate standards designed to achieve uniformity and constancy in the principles followed by defense contractors and subcontractors under federal contracts,stat.codified at repealed.in,congress established a new cas board under the auspices of the office of federal procurement policy.see,stat.codified at.by statute,the cas board has the exclusive authority to prescribe,amend,and rescind cost accounting standards,and interpretations of the standards,governing measurement,assignment,and allocation of costs to contracts with the federal government.a.we have thus recognized that the cas is the exclusive authority on issues regarding the allocation of costs to cost objectives.see,aerospace grp.united states,united states boeing.of relevance to this appeal,the cas board has stated that a llocability is an accounting concept involving the ascertainment of contract cost.it results from a relationship between a cost and cost objective such that the cost objective appropriately bears all or a portion of the cost.cost accounting standards board statement of objectives,policies and concepts,july.
while the cas governs issues of measurement,assignment,and allocability,it does not determine the allowability of categories or individual items of cost.id.at.allowability is instead governed by the cost principles set forth in the far.see far pt.allowability reflects a policy judgment that a particular cost incurred by the contractor should be paid by the government.a contracting agency may include in contract terms,or in its procurement regulations,a provision that will refuse to allow certain costs incurred by contractors that are unreasonable in amount or contrary to public policy.at.these same costs may nevertheless be allocable to the contract.
we have specifically held that,if there is any conflict between the cas and the far as to an issue of allocability,the cas governs.boeing,roche.the cas authority over measurement of a cost includes defining the components of costs,determining the basis for cost measurement,and establishing the criteria for use of alternative cost measurement techniques.a emphasis added.the cas therefore has the exclusive authority to define the components of a pension cost,while the far determines whether that cost as defined by the cas is allowable and will be reimbursed by the government.
finally,the text of far j itself confirms our conclusion that segment closing adjustments are not ordinary pension costs subject to the timely funding requirement.the far explicitly recognizes the cas authority and requires t he cost of all pension plans to be measured,allocated,and accounted for in compliance with the provisions of cas and.far j.the timely funding requirement under subparagraph j,which addresses pension plans,further directs the reader to cas when it uses the term pension costs.see id.j i a.on the other hand,subparagraph j,which addresses segment closing adjustments,directs the reader to cas and provides that the adjustment amount shall be the amount measured,assigned,and allocated in accordance with cfr c id.j i.
as discussed above,cas treats segment closing adjustments differently than ordinary pension costs.the apparent purpose of the far timely funding requirement,which is to ensure that contractors contribute to their pension funds on an annual basis,see motors,fed.cl.at,supports the distinction between pension costs and segment closing adjustments,which do not necessarily invoke the same accounting treatment under cas.indeed,cas allows contractors to allocate ordinary pension costs above the amount to future periods.see c.as noted by the cas board in promulgating this provision 
for qualified pension plans,t he cost assigned to a period is limited to the accrued cost that can be funded without penalizing a contractor portions of pension costs computed for a period that fall outside of the assignable cost corridor floor and a ceiling based on are reassigned to future periods.
emphasis added.at the same time,cas requires segment closing adjustments to be allocated to the same year as the segment closing,regardless of whether the adjustment in the event of a deficit is above the amount.see c vii.
nothing in the text of far j suggests that segment closing adjustments are subject to the provision timely funding requirement.accordingly,we hold that segment closing adjustments pursuant to cas are not subject to the timely funding provisions of far j,and raytheon was not required to fund its pension deficits within the same year as the segment closings 
burden of proof 
the government also asserts that the trial court erred by placing the burden of proof on the government to show that raytheon segment closing calculations did not comply with cas.the government argues that raytheon should have the burden of proving its compliance with cas because it is affirmatively seeking reimbursement from the government for these adjustment deficits.we do not agree.
although we have not previously addressed this issue,both the trial court and the armed services board of contract appeals asbca have for years determined that the government bears the burden of proving that a contractor accounting practices do not comply with the cas.see,sikorsky aircraft united states,fed.cl,the government bears the burden of proof to establish that the accounting method sikorsky used from to did not comply with the cas.dynamics,asbca,june,bca the burden of proof is on the government to establish noncompliance with the cas.unisys,asbca,bca in any appeal that involves alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards,the burden is on the government to establish the noncompliance.as the asbca recognized,allegations of noncompliance with cost accounting standards normally raise questions of fact concerning the acts or omissions which allegedly constitute a violation of an applicable standard,upon which the government bears the burden of proof.ni,asbca,bca.although decisions of the asbca are not binding on this court,we nevertheless give careful consideration and great respect to the board legal interpretations in light of the board considerable experience in the field of government contracts.donley lockheed martin,internal quotations omitted.
the government concedes that when it alleges contractor cas noncompliance,the government has the burden of proof.it nevertheless makes the dubious argument that raytheon is instead alleging cas noncompliance by the government.to the contrary,raytheon challenges the contracting officer final decisions concluding that raytheon segment closing calculations do not comply with cas.indeed,the relevant provisions appear to be primarily focused on ensuring that the contractor complies with the cas and follows uniform and consistent cost accounting practices.see public law requires certain contractors and subcontractors to comply with cost accounting standards cas and to disclose in writing and follow consistently their cost accounting practices.far discussing procedures for determining noncompliance with cas requirements far noting that the contractor,in connection with this contract,shall c omply with all cas,including any modifications and interpretations indicated thereto.
the government further argues that raytheon should bear the burden of proof because raytheon is asserting affirmative claims against the government.we do not dispute the rule that a contractor seeking an equitable adjustment for increased costs has the burden of proving entitlement and quantum to its claim.see servidone constr.united states.but raytheon is not seeking an equitable adjustment for a change in contract terms.raytheon had an existing contractual obligation to calculate segment closing adjustments pursuant to cas c.raytheon obligation to perform an adjustment on the segment closing pursuant to cas was a preexisting contract requirement that arises whenever a segment closes.allegheny teledyne,at emphasis added.here,the government bears the burden of showing that raytheon did,in fact,fail to follow the terms of its contracts,that raytheon segment closing calculations do not comply with cas.we therefore hold that the government bears the burden to prove that a contractor segment closing adjustment does not comply with the cas,even if the adjustment is asserted in a claim brought by the contractor.
