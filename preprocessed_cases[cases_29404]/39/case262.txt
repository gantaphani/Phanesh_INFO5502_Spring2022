in this appeal,we address whether the renewal of water supply contracts by the united states bureau of reclamation violates a of the endangered species act,a and illegally threatens the existence of the delta smelt.we conclude that it does not,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the delta smelt is a small fish endemic to the san joaquin and sacramento rivers delta estuary which was declared endangered by the united states fish and wildlife service under the endangered species act in.though previously abundant,the population of the delta smelt has diminished markedly in the last several decades.the delta smelt presently has no commercial value,but it was commercially harvested as bait in the past.san luis delta mendota water auth.salazar,cir.plaintiffs,several conservation groups,argue that in the united states bureau of reclamation bureau renewed water service contracts with various water users without conducting an adequate consultation under a of the endangered species act and that the contracts jeopardize the existence of the delta smelt.the contracts at issue fall into two groups users who obtain water from the deltamendota canal dmc contractors and parties who claim to hold water rights senior to those held by the bureau with regard to the central valley project and who previously entered into settlement contracts with the bureau settlement contractors.
generally,the bureau is a federal water management agency which operates the central valley project cvp.the cvp is a network of dams,reservoirs,and pumping facilities which regulates the flow of water in the san joaquin and sacramento rivers.california state water project swp operates the same watershed as the cvp and both offices convey water by pumping water from the two rivers.the swp consists of dams,canals,and pumping plants and is the state analogue to the central valley project.sierra club andrus,cir,rev on other grounds,california sierra club,d.
the bureau and swp have coordinated management of cvp.the joint effort began in the when the bureau assumed control of it because california could not finance the project.the bureau had to obtain water rights under state law to operate cvp and a dispute arose regarding the priority of water rights.under california law,a senior holder of water rights has the right to fulfill his needs before a junior appropriator is entitled to use any water.united states state water resources control,d.the california water rights board held hearings on the matter and issued a decision allowing the bureau to use cvp water if it first addressed the issue of the holders asserting senior water rights.the board recognized that senior water rights existed,though undefined,and required a settlement.
in,the bureau and those asserting senior water rights entered into settlement contracts for year terms.the contracts did not resolve the seniority claims,but guaranteed settlement contractors a certain amount of base water annually without any fee and other project water for which they would pay a fee to receive.the base water could only be reduced by in very dry years.
the bureau also contracted with a coalition of water service contractors who obtained water from the delta mendota canal,the dmc contractors.these contracts provided for water delivery to the dmc contractors annually which the contractors paid the bureau to receive.like the settlement contracts,these contracts were also water supply contracts.
statutory framework 
the endangered species act esa has both substantive and procedural provisions designed to protect endangered species and their habitat.american rivers marine fisheries,cir.under a of the esa,federal agencies are required to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species.a.an agency which proposes the action must determine whether its action may affect the listed species or critical habitat and present its conclusions in a biological assessment.c.if the agency determines that its action will have no effect,consultation is not required.if it finds its proposed action may affect a listed species or critical habitat,it must formally or informally consult with,in this case,the united states fish and wildlife service service.american rivers,at.
if the acting agency or consulting agency determines that the proposed action is likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat,it must engage in a formal consultation.in a formal consultation,the consulting agency the service issues a biological opinion stating whether the action is likely to jeopardize such species or habitat.b.if it finds jeopardy is likely,then the acting agency the bureau may suggest reasonable and prudent alternatives to be employed in order to ensure that the listed species or critical habitat is not put in jeopardy.b.the requirements to engage in consultation only apply to agency actions in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control.
procedural history 
in,the bureau prepared a biological assessment regarding the affect that the contract renewals would impose on the delta smelt and also requested a consultation with the service.the service prepared a biological opinion opinion addressing whether the contract renewals would likely adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat.the service stated in its opinion that the bureau proposed action was not likely to threaten the delta smelt.shortly thereafter,because of an intervening court decision,the service issued a new biological opinion in opinion which reached the same conclusion.
as the service opinions were issued,the contracts at issue in this case had expired or were nearing expiration.because the bureau and the service determined that the contract renewals would not adversely affect the delta smelt,in and the bureau renewed contracts with the settlement contractors not to exceed years and contracts with the dmc contractors for year terms.
in,plaintiffs in the instant case filed suit against the government alleging that it violated of the esa based on the service opinion.the service then issued its new opinion and plaintiffs filed another complaint referring to the opinion.in reviewing the opinion,the district court held that it was unlawful because it failed to adequately consider the impacts to the delta smelt critical habitat,did not rely on the best available scientific information,and did not include mandatory mitigation measures to protect the delta smelt.the district court remanded the opinion without vacatur and ordered the bureau and the service to reconsult on the effects of the cvp and swp operation on the delta smelt.on december,interim measures were imposed by the court and were set to expire automatically on the issuance of a new biological opinion by the service.a new opinion was filed by the service in december.
plaintiffs filed another complaint against the government arguing that the bureau had violated its legal obligations under a of the esa by renewing the dmc contracts and settlement contracts.each party then moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment for defendants,finding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the dmc contracts and that the plaintiffs claims against the settlement contractors failed because the contracts were not discretionary and were thus exempted from a compliance.
in,the bureau completed a new biological assessment and the service issued a new biological opinion opinion.in that opinion,the service found that the cvp and swp operations were likely to threaten the delta smelt and identified reasonable and prudent alternatives to avoid such jeopardy.

federal defendants and dmc contractors argue that the issuance of the opinion by the service eliminates the case or controversy requirement for federal jurisdiction and makes this appeal moot.a federal court jurisdiction is limited to cases or controversies,art.iii,powell mccormack,d.federal courts do not have jurisdiction to review a case when no case or controversy exists.foster carson,cir.issuance of a superceding biological opinion moots a legal challenge to a prior biological opinion.forest guardians forest,cir american rivers,at idaho dep t of fish game marine fisheries serv,cir.
in this case,the issues before the court are not moot because although a new opinion was issued,parts of that opinion have been held unlawful by the district court in san luis delta mendota water authority salazar,d holding that the service reliance on raw salvage numbers to set river flow limits violated esa and that its conclusion that projects contributed to impacts on predation and microcystis on delta smelt was arbitrary and capricious.unlike previous cases that this court has addressed where a new superceding opinion clearly replaced the old opinion,in this case we have ongoing litigation regarding the validity of the opinion and a federal court which has held that parts of the opinion violate the esa.moreover,it is unclear whether the opinion specifically considered the impact of the contracts on cvp operation.because the opinion has been held,in part,unlawful,and it is unclear if the contracts at issue were considered in that opinion,this case is not moot on appeal.
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in holding that they did not have standing to challenge the dmc contracts.to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts,a plaintiff must have article iii standing.salmon spawning recovery alliance,at.to establish article iii standing,a plaintiff must show that he or she has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.id.at.if a plaintiff asserts a procedural injury,he must show that the procedures are designed to protect a concrete threatened interest and,once shown,his burden for showing causation and redressability is lessened.id.at.in that case,plaintiffs must show only that they have a procedural right that,if exercised,could protect their concrete interests.id.quoting defenders of wildlife,cir,overruled on other grounds by ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d.
in this case,the district court properly held that plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the dmc contracts.plaintiffs assertion that the dmc contracts are based on an improper biological opinion is an assertion of a procedural violation.see defenders of wildlife,at claim asserting an inadequate consultation between the environmental protection agency and fish and wildlife service asserts a procedural violation.plaintiffs satisfy the requirement by their assertion that they believe that the bureau has overcommitted water under the contracts which will harm the delta smelt.see salmon spawning recovery alliance,at.however,plaintiffs fail to establish a causal connection between the threatened injury and the bureau action because the dmc contracts include a shortage provision.the shortage provision expressly allows the bureau to take any action to meet its legal obligations,which includes not delivering water to dmc contractors if it is necessary in order to comply with a of the esa.the dmc contract terms,therefore,expressly require that water delivery be subject to the requirements of federal law and that the bureau may discontinue or reduce the quantity of water delivered to the dmc contractors.the threatened injury,jeopardy to the delta smelt,would not be traceable to the contract renewals because such contracts expressly allow for a compliance.with no threatened injury there is nothing to redress.even under a substantive claim analysis for standing,which imposes a higher burden than a procedural analysis,plaintiffs claim fails because they can not show causation.see warth seldin,d facts asserted failed to show causation for article iii standing.thus,the district court properly determined that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the dmc contracts under both a procedural and a substantive claim analysis.
non discretionary contracts 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in holding that their claims as to the settlement contracts fail because those contracts do not require compliance with a of the esa.section a of the esa only applies to federal agency action in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d home builders quoting.in home builders,the supreme court held did not apply to the environmental protection agency epa approval of an application for arizona to administer a program under the clean water act because this was not a discretionary act of the agency.id.at.the salient provisions of the clean water act mandated that the epa approve the application once nine statutory criteria under b were met.id.if the nine criteria were met,the epa lacked discretion to deny the application,regardless of a requirements.id.because the epa discretion was so limited in determining whether to approve the applications,it did not trigger the requirements under a of the esa.id.at.the court stated that a s the mandatory language of b itself illustrates,not every action authorized,funded,or carried out by a federal agency is a product of that agency exercise of discretion.id.at.
in this case,the district court properly held that the bureau renewal of the settlement contracts is not subject to a of the esa because its action is not a discretionary action.under of the reclamation act of,the bureau must operate the cvp in conformity with california water law on the control,appropriation,use,or distribution of water used in irrigation,or any vested right acquired thereunder.california united states,d holding that california may impose conditions on permits granted to the united states for cvp operation.section includes the full recognition of any vested right acquired under california water law.united states gerlach live stock.under california law,senior appropriative water rights must be satisfied before junior water rights.pasadena alhambra,cal d.the central valley project improvement act cvpia,stat,requires the bureau to operate the cvp in compliance with all decisions of the california water resources control board.cvpia a.the california water resources control board issued decision in which it agreed to grant the bureau rights to operate the cvp only if it addressed the issue of those claiming to hold senior water rights.under the settlement contracts,negotiated at the behest of the california water resources control board,the bureau is required to deliver base supply water for free and that the supply may only be reduced by in critically dry years.the duty to deliver the base supply water is mandatory.under the contracts,the contractors are entitled to of their base water,which can only be reduced by in very dry years.under the cvpia,the bureau is required to renew these contracts upon request.see cvpia c.
here,the bureau discretion is limited with regard to the settlement contracts so that a of the esa is not triggered.the bureau hands are tied historically by those asserting senior water rights in the cvp.the bureau was required to acknowledge such rights in order to operate the cvp,which it did by entering the settlement contracts.we agree with the district court,which held 
plaintiffs claims fail as to the settlement contracts because the bureau discretion is substantially constrained by prior contract.therefore,following the supreme court decision in home builders,section a of the esa does not apply to the settlement contract renewal process.specifically,article a of the settlement contracts requires the bureau to renew these contr
