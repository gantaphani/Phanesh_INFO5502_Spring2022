omni pinnacle,llc omni,contracted with tammany parish to perform repairs.omni subcontracted with united disaster response,llc united.alleging that additional payment was due,united sued omni and the parish,and omni counterclaimed against united and against the parish.citing the eleventh amendment,louisiana state law,and a clause in the contract,the parish moved to dismiss.the district court rejected the parish arguments.we affirm in part and dismiss in part.
the parish entered into a contract with omni to help with repairs after a storm or other disaster.omni then subcontracted with united.after hurricanes katrina and rita,the parish called,by extension,action.
because of a disagreement about the work provided,the parish made only partial payment to omni,which in turn only partially paid united.invoking diversity jurisdiction under,united sued omni and the parish for full payment omni counterclaimed against united and against the parish.
in response to united and omni claims,the parish filed a federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss.the parish argued that it had immunity under the eleventh amendment and louisiana law and that the contract contains,by reference,a mandatory clause stating that t he judicial district court for the parish of tammany shall be the court of original jurisdiction of any litigation originated under this contract.
the district court denied the motion,ruling that the parish is not an arm of the state and that the clause is not exclusive.the court did not address the state law argument.the parish appeals,basing appellate jurisdiction on the collateral order doctrine.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.
we review questions of immunity de novo.united states texas tech,cir.we do the same for constructions of clauses.afram carriers,moeykens,cir.
we first confront whether the district court erred in failing expressly to apply the test of delahoussaye city of new iberia,cir the parish argues that under flores cameron county,cir,the court was required to apply delahoussaye because analogies between like entities can not replace consideration of the six relevant factors.the district court did not err.this is not a case with such extraordinary circumstances that we can find that the parish is an arm of the state notwithstanding the holding in county of lincoln luning,that the eleventh amendment limits jurisdiction only as to suits against a state and not against counties and parishes.
we addressed this issue at length in crane texas,cir,amended in part on denial of rehearing,cir,noting that the supreme court has repeatedly stated that the eleventh amendment does not apply to counties and similar municipal corporations.id.at internal citations and quotations omitted.we went so far as to characterize the court statements to be unambiguous and listed at length the abundance of authority holding the eleventh amendment inapplicable to counties id.at internal citations omitted.holding that these authorities establish without question that eleventh amendment immunity does not,as a general rule,extend to counties,we further stated that no exception should be made to this rule without convincing evidence distinguishing the county in question from counties generally.id.at.in deciding whether this convincing showing could be made,we noted that the most crucial factor is whether the funds to defray any award would be derived from the state treasury,id.internal citations and quotations omitted,but even then we took special care to emphasize the need for payment of the judgment to be made directly from the state treasury,id.internal citations and quotations omitted.this is a demanding standard 
though the district court should have more pellucidly explained why the parish was not entitled to immunity,the court was not mistaken in denying the motion to dismiss the parish can not show with convincing evidence that it is distinguishable from parishes or counties generally.
the parish properly concedes some of the delahoussaye factors.for instance,the parish can sue and be sued in its own name and can hold and use property.likewise,louisiana law does not characterize the parish as an arm of the state 
for delahoussaye factors three and four,the factors relating to the parish autonomy and scope of authority,the parish attempts to create a rule for hurricanes where a hurricane or another disaster is involved,the parish is entitled to eleventh amendment immunity because of the louisiana homeland security and emergency assistance and disaster act,et.the act states that e ach political subdivision shall be within the jurisdiction of and served by the governor office of homeland security and emergency preparedness and by a parish homeland security and emergency preparedness agency responsible for emergenc ies,id.a,and requires each parish office of homeland security and emergency preparedness to coordinate with federal and state agencies,id.b.the act also requires that parishes prepare emergency plans for various threats.id.
the parish argument is unconvincing.merely requiring the parish and the state to cooperate does not transform the parish into the state,and the parish offers no cases to support the contrary conclusion.the degree of state intrusion into the parish autonomy is not dramatic.the act explains that t he parish office of homeland security and emergency preparedness under the parish president,shall be responsible for homeland security and emergency preparedness in the parish,id.a e ach parish office of homeland security and emergency preparedness shall have a director who shall serve at the pleasure of the parish president,id.a and the director shall have direct responsibility for the organization,administration,and operation of such local organization for homeland security and emergency preparedness,with the governor merely having general direction and control,id.c.the act does not make the parish an arm of the state.
the parish argument that it is concerned with statewide problems under the fourth delahoussaye factor suffers from additional flaws.in vogt,at,a case concerning a levee district,we stated that l imited territorial boundaries suggest that an agency is not an arm of the state and most entities that are entitled to eleventh amendment immunity have statewide jurisdiction.the parish obviously has a limited territorial boundary.vogt forecloses another of the parish arguments,that somehow its efforts facilitate statewide recovery and thus render the it an arm of the state the levee board is that the levee district is concerned with a statewide that the nature of the problem outweighs the narrow geographic boundaries of the levee district.however,primary education and law enforcement are also statewide concerns,yet school boards and sheriffs are not arms of the state.id.
thus,the parish only real hope is the second delahoussaye factor the source of funds used.the parish argues that because all of its hurricane recovery funds come from the federal government,channeled through the state,it is an arm of the state.but this is incorrect.there is no formal requirement for louisiana to pay a judgment to omni or united,if such a judgment is rendered.the state may choose to reimburse the parish,but that is not enough.vogt,at.
as we explained in vogt,under louisiana statutory and constitutional law the state has no duty to indemnify any judgment against its political subdivisions,including parishes.id.although the legislature has the authority to appropriate funds to pay a judgment against a political subdivision,the legislature certainly has no legal obligation to do so.thus,no legal liability arises against the state in the event of a judgment against a political subdivision or its officers.id.such a request for state money to be appropriated to pay the judgment is too speculative for eleventh amendment analysis.id 
the parish contends that louisiana law protects it from suit in a federal court sitting in diversity a louisiana statute provides that n o suit against the state or a state agency or political subdivision shall be instituted in any court other than a louisiana state court.a.from this,the parish argues that it can n
