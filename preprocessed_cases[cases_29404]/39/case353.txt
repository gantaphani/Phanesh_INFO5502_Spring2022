plumbing,petitions for review of the national labor relation board decision that violated sections and a of the national labor relations act the act,a,by filing and maintaining a state court lawsuit concerning a union job targeting program that was preempted by the act.contrary to view,be k construction nlrb,d,did not extend the analytical framework of bill johnson restaurants,nlrb,d,to preempted lawsuits.the board determination that the job targeting program was protected by section,notwithstanding the fact that it was supported in part by dues unlawfully withheld on federal public works projects under the act,fares less well.the board conclusory findings that these moneys did not taint the job targeting program are inadequate to support its determination that the operation of the program as a whole was protected conduct under section.accordingly,we grant petition,deny the board for enforcement,and remand the case to the board.
in a complaint filed in the superior court of california on october,a nonunion construction contractor,alleged that kruse,a union competitor,had underbid on the ascend corporate campus project,a private project.claimed that kruse lower bid was the result of an unlawful arrangement between kruse and the united association of journeymen and apprentices in the plumbing and pipefitting industry of the united states and canada,local,the union.under the arrangement challenged by called a job targeting program jtp the union uses a portion of its members dues to subsidize kruse bids on construction projects in order to compete more effectively with nonunion contractors.the mechanics of the jtp are straightforward.on a particular construction project,a union employer such as kruse will submit a request to the union to use the jtp funds,which the union collects from its members in the form of dues on all of its projects.for a project to be eligible for the jtp,kruse must face competition from a nonunion contractor for the job.if the union approves the use of jtp funds,kruse takes the amount of the subsidy into account in submitting its bid.if kruse wins the project,it pays the union employees the wages specified in the collective bargaining agreement,and the union then uses jtp moneys to reimburse kruse for the difference between the wages under the collective bargaining agreement and those listed in the bid.complaint alleged that kruse acceptance of the union jtp moneys violates california laws regarding unfair trade practices,prevailing wage levels,and employer kickbacks from employees.
the union,which was not a party to the lawsuit,responded by filing a charge with the board that lawsuit violates section a of the act because it interferes with protected section rights.the board general counsel issued a complaint against,and an administrative law judge alj determined after a hearing that state court lawsuit was preempted under the board decision in manno electric,wl,enforced,cir,in which the board determined that the objectives of jtps to protect employees jobs and wage scales are protected by section.the alj concluded that by maintaining and prosecuting the preempted lawsuit against kruse for accepting jtp contributions from the union,had engaged in unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of section a 
the board affirmed,rejecting argument that kingston constructors,wl,required a different result.in kingston,the board reaffirmed its central holding in manno electric that jtps are clearly protected by section,but it further determined that a union may not lawfully support a jtp program with dues exacted from employees working on,or federal prevailing wage,projects.wl,at.the board found kingston to be inapplicable in this case for two reasons.first,the ascend project was not a project,and there was no record evidence that kruse ever worked on a project.second,the amount of dues unlawfully withheld by the union was de minimis,because at most only two to three percent of the moneys collected for the jtp came from federal or state prevailing wage jobs,and those moneys were not directly traceable to kruse.because lawsuit broadly attack ed the entire jtp and kruse participation in it as unlawful under state law,the board concluded that it was preempted by the act from the time it was filed.the board ordered to cease and desist from its unlawful conduct and affirmatively to seek dismissal of the state lawsuit,reimburse kruse with interest for its expenses,and post copies of a remedial notice.now petitions for review,and the board for enforcement of its order.
section a of the act makes it unlawful for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by section of the act.a.section,in turn,protects the rights of employees to engage in union organization and other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.in defining the scope of protected activity,the board must ensure that the concerted activity is linked in some identifiable way to legitimate employee concerns related to employment matters.eastex,nlrb,d.the act thus protects a wide variety of conduct by employees directed against employers other than their own.eastex,at.at.as determined by the board,protected employee conduct includes attempts to enhance employment opportunities for unionized employees through programs that lower labor costs for unionized employers.see manno,nlrb at.
principally contends that under the doctrine of bill johnson and be k construction,its state court lawsuit against kruse did not violate section a because the only motive was to stop a competitor from using illegal funding,whatever its source,to undercut bidding on a major construction project.it further contends that the union jtp is not entitled to section protection because it is contrary to public policy.the board responds that its findings and determinations were reasonable because the jtp falls within the other mutual aid or protection clause of section consequently,the lawsuit seeking to dismantle the jtp was not only preempted but also unlawful under section a because it directly interfered with protected conduct.defense that the union jtp is subject to the restrictions of the act and the california labor code fails,in the board view,because the ascend project,which involved no federal or state funding,was not subject to those prevailing wage laws,and because the amount of jtp funds originating from public works projects was de minimis.

the supreme court and the board have added a gloss to the category of arguably protected activity cases where arguably protected activity is involved,preemption does not occur in the absence of board involvement in the matter,and upon the board involvement,a lawsuit directed at arguably protected activity is preempted by federal labor law.loehmann plaza,wl citing sears,roebuck san diego county dist.council of carpenters,d,abrogated on other grounds,lechmere,nlrb,d.the board in loehmann plaza explained that the deter
