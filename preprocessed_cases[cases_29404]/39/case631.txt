this appeal from the armed services board of contract appeals involves a technical question as to the application of the version of a section of the federal acquisition regulation far to a government contract.the question is whether the contractor can base its claim for payment under the contract on a valuation of its assets that was premised on use of the purchase method of accounting to value the assets of the corporation that emerged from a business combination.the board held that the far provision in question prohibited the contractor from basing its claim for payment on the valuation of its assets.in so doing,the board rejected the contractor arguments that the government had impermissibly applied the far provision to a business combination that occurred prior to the effective date of the provision,and the far provision conflicted with two provisions of the cost accounting standards cas and therefore could not validly be applied as a ground for rejecting the payment claim.we agree with the board disposition of both issues,and we therefore affirm the board decision.
prior to,the singer company had various operating divisions,including the kearfott guidance navigation division kgn division.the kgn division was involved in the defense industry,and its assets included contracts with the department of defense.in december,singer converted the kgn division into a wholly owned subsidiary,which it named kearfott guidance navigation corporation kearfott.singer transferred to the new subsidiary all of the assets and liabilities of its kgn division,including its defense contracts.
in august,astronautics corporation of america aca purchased all the issued and outstanding shares of kearfott capital stock.aca then incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary,kgn sub,transferred all of its rights under the kearfott purchase agreement to the new subsidiary,and then merged kgn sub,into kearfott.aca retained an appraisal firm to determine the fair market value of kearfott assets the ensuing review resulted in an increase in the valuation of those assets.pursuant to the kearfott purchase agreement,singer and aca elected to treat the transaction for federal income tax purposes as a purchase and constructive liquidation of assets.
approximately months later,the government promulgated a new far provision,far,which was entitled asset valuations resulting from business combinations.the new provision,which took effect on july,provided 
when the purchase method of accounting for a business combination is used,allowable amortization,cost of money and depreciation shall be limited to the total of the amounts that would have been allowed had the combination not taken place.
in may,the navy awarded contract no.c to kearfott.pursuant to the contract,kearfott submitted a progress payment request of to the navy on september.of that amount,was attributable to the increase in valuation,or,of kearfott assets that occurred following kgn sub purchase of kearfott.the navy refused to pay kearfott the sum that was attributable to the asset.kearfott continued to include amounts associated with the asset in its progress payment requests,and the navy continued to exclude those amounts from payment as not allowable.
kearfott ultimately filed an appeal with the armed services board of contract appeals contesting the navy refusal to pay the portions of its claims that were attributable to the asset.the government moved for summary judgment on the ground that far barred kearfott from recovering costs based on the following the business combination.the board,by a divided vote,granted the government motion.
relying on its decision in an earlier case involving the same issue,appeal of bae systems information,electronic systems integration,asbca,wl june,the board ruled that the language of far precluded kearfott from using asset values resulting from the business combination to determine allowable amortization,cost of money,and depreciation.the board explained that under accounting principles board opinion apb,the purchase method of accounting is not limited to providing for the initial in value,but also covers the reporting of the acquiring corporation operations,and that the purchase method of accounting was therefore being used at the time the cost calculations were made as well as when the purchase occurred.
the board further held that the version of far was not impermissibly retroactive and that it was not invalid because of a conflict with cas and.on the latter issue,the board held that the far provision did not conflict with cas and because far addressed the issue of allowability,while the cas provisions addressed questions of allocability.one judge dissented from the board ruling on the ground that,in her view,far conflicted with cas and therefore could not be applied to bar kearfott claims.
the parties agree that the contract between kearfott and the navy incorporates far and that it was appropriate to use the purchase method of accounting in determining the value of the assets kearfott acquired in the business combination.the principal issue on appeal is therefore a narrow one whether the board of contract appeals erred when it construed far to apply to a claim for payment that is based on an asset from a business combination that took place prior to the far provision effective date.
kearfott first argues that the plain language of far bars its application when the business combination in question took place before july,the effective date of the regulation.kearfott plain meaning argument is based on the fact that the regulation provides that the limitations on the allowable amortization,cost of money,and depreciation will apply w hen the purchase method of accounting for a business combination is used according to kearfott,the use of the present tense is used,rather than the past tense was used or the present perfect tense has been used,indicates that in order for the asset that accompanies a business combination to be subject to the limitation set forth in the regulation,the business combination could not have occurred in the past,before the regulation took effect.
we disagree with kearfott interpretation of far.the language used in the regulation is temporally neutral,and there is no indication that it was meant to apply only to business combinations that occurred after july,a date not featured anywhere in the regulation.moreover,the language of the regulation refers to w hen the purchase method of accounting for a business combination is used,not when a business combination occurs.that language suggests that the term when was used to mean in the event that rather than at the time that.the regulation thus appears to treat the use of the purchase method of accounting as a circumstance or condition that must be satisfied in order to determine whether far applies to the cost claim in question.
significantly,the focus of the regulation is on the limitation imposed on the amount of allowable amortization,cost of money,and depreciation claimed at a particular time in connection with a particular government contract.the date that is critical for determining whether the regulation applies is the date on which the cost claim is submitted,not the date on which the circumstance or condition that triggers the application of the regulation arose.for that reason,the regulation is best understood as providing that if the amount claimed for any one of the three referenced cost elements is premised on a valuation of assets based on the purchase method of accounting for a business combination,the regulation bars the claim.that is,the term is used,in reference to the purchase method of accounting,means that the regulation governs any claims based in part on a valuation that is the product of the purchase method of accounting.
the regulatory history of far supports this interpretation.far did not come as a surprise to the contracting community,but instead was promulgated as a formal articulation of what the chairman of the commercial cost principles committee referred to as a tradition in government contracting that the government should be placed in no worse a position by a change in business own
