candelaria corporation candelaria,a prime contractor on a federal construction project,carolina casualty insurance company ccic,its surety,and otay group,otay,a subcontractor collectively,defendants,appeal the district court judgment in favor of ramona equipment rental,ramona,candelaria supplier of rental equipment,in ramona action under the miller act.the suit involves otay failure to pay for equipment rented from ramona on an open book account.as required by the miller act,ramona served candelaria with notice of demand for payment within ninety days of the last day on which it furnished the equipment.the critical issue in this appeal is whether ramona notice is timely as to rental equipment furnished more than ninety days before the notice.we hold that it is,and affirm the district court judgment.
this dispute arises from a federal construction project known as ice el centro spc perimeter fence devising fence replacement the project.candelaria was the prime contractor on the project and,in tandem with ccic,provided a payment bond as mandated by the miller act.see.in december,otay entered into a subcontract with candelaria agreeing to supply certain labor and equipment for the project.shortly thereafter,otay submitted,and ramona approved,a credit application which established an open account for otay to rent equipment from ramona for use on the project.under the terms of the credit application,rentals would be documented by a rental agreement and invoice.
between december and june,otay and ramona entered into rental agreements on credit,totaling.on june,candelaria terminated otay subcontract for cause.at that time,candelaria owed otay over for labor and equipment provided to the project,and otay had paid ramona only on the outstanding rental agreements.
on july,ramona served a notice of its claim for payment on candelaria payment bond pursuant to b following service of the notice,in september,ramona filed a complaint in district court under the miller act to recover in unpaid equipment rentals plus monthly service charges.at trial,defendants argued that ramona notice was untimely as to all rental equipment furnished to the project more than ninety days before service of the notice on july.defendants also argued that ramona failed to mitigate its damages and that ramona was not entitled to recover compound prejudgment interest,which the credit application called service charges.
the district court rejected defendants first argument and concluded that,in light of the open book account,the notice covered all rental equipment furnished to the project.the court,however,determined that ramona duty to mitigate damages arose as of june,four days after otay termination by candelaria and barred recovery for invoices after that date.finally,the court rejected ramona claim for compound prejudgment interest and awarded simple interest at the contractual rate of.accordingly,on august,the district court entered judgment awarding ramona plus in service charges and in attorneys fees.defendants timely appealed 
the miller act represents a congressional effort to protect persons supplying labor and material for the construction of federal public buildings in lieu of the protections they might receive under state statutes with respect to the construction of nonfederal buildings.mai steel serv.blake constr,cir internal citation omitted.to accomplish this beneficial purpose,the miller act is entitled to a liberal interpretation.see united states ex rel.sherman carter,see also united states,cir.the miller act requires that laborers and materialmen with no direct relationship to the general contractor furnishing the payment bond,giv e written notice to the contractor within days from the date on which the person did or performed the last of the labor or furnished or supplied the last of the material for which the claim is made.b see united states ex rel.water works supply george hyman constr,st cir.this notice requirement serves an important purpose it establishes a firm date after which the general contractor may pay its subcontractors without fear of further liability to the materialmen or suppliers of those contractors.id.at.failure to comply with the notice requirement is fatal to a miller act claim.
we have not addressed the precise issue presented by this appeal in the absence of controlling ninth circuit authority,the district court turned to noland allied contractors,inc,cir,for guidance.in noland,the fourth circuit considered a claim for six unpaid shipments sent by noland,a supplier of electrical equipment,to a subcontractor on an open account.id.at.noland sent written notice under the miller act within ninety days of the last shipment.id.at.the notice included claims for several shipments that were delivered more than ninety days before the notice.id.the court held that the notice was timely as to all shipments,concluding that where there are multiple deliveries or contracts,the measuring date will be the date when the last material is furnished under the last contract.id.at.defendants acknowledge noland,but argue that it is outdated and that we should adopt the reasoning of several more recent district court decisions that protect the prime contractor and surety from the risk of double payment.several of our sister circuits,however,have agreed with noland holding,as do we.
in united states ex rel.a m petroleum,sante fe engineers,the fifth circuit concluded that notice within ninety days of the last delivery on a project involving multiple purchase orders including orders made more than ninety days before the notice was timely under the miller act,cir.noting that this seems to be the preferred interpretation among the circuit courts,the fifth circuit held that under the miller act,a materialman or laborer need only give notice to a general contractor within ninety days of the last delivery or rendition of services,rather than after each unpaid delivery or provision of labor.id.thus,when there is an open account,a notice is timely even when it includes material furnished more than ninety days before the notice.
similarly,in water works supply,the first circuit considered circumstances where the plaintiff extended a line of credit on an open book account for the purchase of pipe and piping materials.at.in march,the plaintiff served a miller act notice relating to two outstanding invoices from november and january.id.the general contractor asserted that,notwithstanding the open book account,each order represented a separate contract with a separate limit.id.at.the court rejected this argument,noting that the weight of the authority contradicts that position.id.rather,the first circuit reasoned that although a strict reading of the notice provision might offer more protection to the general contractor,the goal of a specific statutory provision must take a back seat to the purpose of the overall statute,which is to provide recovery for suppliers who have provided materials but not received compensation.id.citing noland,at.accordingly,the court held that w here claims are based on an open account theory,the notice period for all of the deliveries begins on the date of the last delivery to the project.id 
here,the relationship between otay and ramona was governed by an open book account that allowed otay to rent equipment from ramona on an ongoing credit basis.ramona continued to rent equipment to otay for use at the project until candelaria terminated its subcontract on june,and,within ninety days of the last rental,ramona served notice of its claim for payment on candelaria.these circumstances are clearly analogous to those addressed by the first,fourth and fifth circuits.accordingly,we join our sister circuits and hold that if all the goods in a series of deliveries by a supplier on an open book account are used on the same government project,the notice is timely as to all of the deliveries if it is given within ninety days from the last delivery.
relying on several recent district court cases,the dissent asserts that the notice requirement serves to protect the general contractor and its surety.dissent at see,united states ex rel.country boys feed far
