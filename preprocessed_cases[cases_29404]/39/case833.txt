joseph debro debro appeals from a judgment following the sustaining of respondent demurrer to his second amended complaint without leave to amend.debro contends the trial court erred because one of his causes of action,based on the california false claims act,was not.we disagree and affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
on august,the los angeles raiders raiders and entities known as the east bay entities the city of oakland,the county of alameda,the county coliseum authority,the county coliseum financing corporation,and the county coliseum,entered into certain agreements by which the raiders would play professional football in oakland through.under the terms of the master agreement,the raiders would receive revenue from ticket sales,as well as loans to finance a training facility and operation expenses.in addition,the county coliseum would be expanded and modernized.the east bay entities agreed to finance the stadium renovations and their other obligations through the sale of personal seat licenses,club seats,and luxury suites,as well as the issuance of bonds.
under the loan agreement,which was part of the master agreement,the east bay entities authorized the county coliseum financing corporation financing to loan up to million to the raiders to finance the renovation of the stadium,million to finance the construction and development of a training facility,and million for operations purposes.the loan agreement set forth the methods of disbursement of the loan proceeds,the raiders repayment obligations,and the events of default and remedies.the loan agreement also granted the financing a security interest to secure repayment of the loans.article v of the loan agreement,entitled nonrecourse obligations,stated that aside from certain limitations,any claim against raiders based upon this loan agreement shall be.
on august,debro filed a lawsuit in alameda county superior court against the city of oakland,county of alameda,and others,seeking to void and enjoin performance of the master agreement.the action was dismissed in april,without explanation in the record.
in august,debro filed a lawsuit against the administrator of the county coliseum authority oacca,a joint powers authority of the city of oakland and the county of alameda that was formed in connection with the raiders transaction.the complaint sought damages for professional misconduct relating to the loan agreement and the construction contracts by which the coliseum was renovated.the lawsuit was dismissed in june for debro failure to comply with local rules.
debro filed the lawsuit at issue here on october,against the raiders,the general partner of the raiders,the county coliseum,the corporation the contractor for the renovation of the coliseum,and two individuals.his complaint charged,among other things,that the defendants conspired to defraud the taxpayers of the city of oakland and the county of alameda by knowingly making using or causing to be made or using false statements to get false claims approved by the oakland city council and the alameda c ounty board of supervisors.his action purported to state causes of action under six statutes,including government code sections and of the california false claims act california act.
debro filed a first amended complaint in july.he dropped all of the defendants except for the raiders,and added the oacca as a defendant.the new pleading charged the raiders and the oacca with violating the six statutes on which the original complaint was based,including government code sections and of the california act.
the raiders demurred to debro first amended complaint.as to two statutes that debro conceded could not support a cause of action,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.as to the remaining four statutes,the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend,directing him to allege,if possible,facts that state cognizable causes of action under these statutes that are not barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.the court also granted debro leave to amend to join all necessary parties or to allege facts that demonstrate that such parties can not be joined.
the second amended complaint the one at issue here was filed in november.its first three causes of action alleged that the raiders and the oacca violated government code sections,and in entering into the loan agreement in august of.the second cause of action,based on government code section,charged that the raiders negotiated for and accepted million of public money as a payment for relocating of the raiders to oakland and fraudulently conspired to hide the relocation payment in a public document by calling said relocation payment a loan in violation of government code section.a fourth cause of action pled that the raiders and the oacca conspired to violate these three statutes.as to the statute of limitations,debro alleged that the limitations period did not begin running in august,when the loan agreement was signed,because he did not discover the fraud until december.despite the trial court admonishment to join all necessary parties,debro did not name any additional parties.
in their demurrer to the second amended complaint,the raiders and oacca contended that all of the causes of action were,fraud was not pled with particularity,no qui tam action could be brought under government code section the statute on which the third and fourth causes of action were based,necessary parties were not joined,and the second amended complaint was ambiguous and unclear.before the demurrers were heard,debro dismissed oacca as a defendant.
the court sustained the raiders demurrer without leave to amend as to the entire second amended complaint.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
according to his notice of appeal,debro challenges only the dismissal of the second cause of action,which he brought under government code section.in neither his notice of appeal nor his briefs does he challenge the dismissal of the first,third,and fourth causes of action.we therefore consider whether the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend,only as to debro cause of action under government code section.see tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d,fn.

statute of limitations 
a complaint fails to state a cause of action if the allegations disclose that the cause of action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.duggal capital communications services,th,d.to decide whether debro cause of action under the california act was,we begin with a brief overview of the california act,and then ascertain what false claim debro has alleged,interpret the statute of limitations in the california act,and examine the complaint allegations regarding the commencement of the limitations period.
the california false claims act 
the california act,set forth at government code sections through,is intended to supplement governmental efforts to identify and prosecute fraudulent claims made against state and local governmental entities.rothschild tyco internat.us,th,d.in general,the california act permits a governmental agency,or a qui tam plaintiff bringing an action on behalf of the government agency,to recover civil penalties and damages from any person who,for example,knowingly presents to the state or political subdivision a false claim for payment or approval,subd.a.the california act was patterned after the federal false claims act et.rothschild,supra,at,d citing legislative history.
section sets forth three ways in which a lawsuit under the california act can proceed.first,the attorney general shall diligently investigate false claims involving state funds and may bring an action against violators,subd.a.second,the prosecuting authority of a political subdivision shall diligently investigate false claims involving political subdivision funds and may bring an action against violators,subd.b.third,a private person may bring an action,on behalf of himself as well as the state or political subdivision,subd.c.the private party is referred to as the qui tam plaintiff.ibid.
where,as here,a qui tam plaintiff has initiated the lawsuit,the complaint is sealed until the attorney general or political subdivision decides whether to intervene and proceed with the case,subd.c.specifically,the qui tam plaintiff serves the attorney general with a copy of the complaint,along with a written disclosure of material evidence and information in support of his contentions,subd.c.if the matter involves only state funds,the attorney general decides whether to intervene and proceed with the action.if the matter involves political subdivision funds,the attorney general forwards a copy of the complaint and evidence to the political subdivision,which decides whether to intervene and proceed with the action,subd.c.if the attorney general and political subdivision,as applicable,decline to intervene,the complaint is unsealed and the qui tam plaintiff may conduct the action,subd.c d ii,d iii.the complaint is then served on the defendant,subd.c.regardless of who controls the qui tam action,the qui tam plaintiff is entitled to a percentage of any recovery obtained in the litigation,subd.g.
debro allegation of a false claim 
as we explained above,the california act generally imposes liability for making knowingly untrue claims to a public entity in order to obtain money,property,or services.in particular,the california act enumerates certain conduct for which liability may be imposed,subd.a.as potentially applicable here,the california act imposes liability on a person who knowingly presents a false claim to a political subdivision for approval,knowingly makes or uses a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the political subdivision,or conspires to defraud the political subdivision by getting a false claim allowed or paid,subd.a.
in his second amended complaint,debro alleged that the raiders negotiated for and accepted million of public money as a payment for relocating of sic the raiders to oakland and fraudulently conspired to hide the relocation payment in a public document by calling said relocation payment a loan in violation of government code section.according to the raiders,debro is asserting that the transaction or underlying agreements were fraudulent because the loan was actually a loan and was not backed by collateral.we think the raiders characterization is inaccurate.according to debro assertions in the trial court and in his reply brief here,the purported false claim was the raiders request and acceptance of million in a wire transfer as a purported loan,when in fact it was a payoff or gift it was not,debro maintains,the or collateral aspects of the loan that had been hidden by the raiders,but the fact that the raiders would not pay back the money 
viewing the allegations of the second amended complaint broadly,as we must,we conclude debro allegations are susceptible of this characterization.the alleged violation of the california act,therefore,was the raiders presentation or use of the loan agreement to obtain funds,where the loan agreement falsely characterized the transaction as a loan.see,subd.a.with this cause of action in mind,we proceed to determine whether the time for bringing it elapsed before debro filed his complaint.
the limitations period under the california act 
section,subdivision a,limits the period in which an action under the california act may be filed a civil action under section may not be filed more than three years after the date of discovery by the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances or,in any event,no more than years after the date on which the violation of section is committed,subd.a,italics added.
although there are no reported california state cases interpreting section,subdivision a,the standards we employ in interpreting statutes of limitation have been.our function,as with the construction of any statute,is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in the first instance,we look to the plain meaning of the statutory language.if further analysis is necessary,we apply a reasonable and common sense interpretation,avoiding absurdity.see deyoung city of san diego d,overruled on other grounds,yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.we also consider the legislative purpose and public policy particularly relevant to statutes of limitation.in general,the legislative purpose behind such statutes is to prevent plaintiffs from asserting stale claims.at the same time,public policy favors the resolution of claims on the merits.therefore,in ascertaining a limitations period,we must strike a balance between the public policy favoring extinction of stale claims and that favoring resolution of disputes on their merits.samuels mix cal th,d.
mindful of these standards,our task is to interpret the phrase date of discovery by the official of the political subdivision charged with responsibility to act,subd.a.taking the latter subpart first,it is clear from the plain language of the statute that the official of the political subdivision charged with responsibility to act pertains to the responsible persons with the city of oakland and alameda county.as to the date of discovery,the analysis is somewhat more complex.
the raiders refer us to the statute of limitations for causes of action under the federal false claims act,which they contend is analogous to section,subdivision a.under the federal false claims act,a civil action must be brought by the later of six years after the violation,or years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the united states charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances,but in no event more than years after the date on which the violation is committed.b,italics added see ex rel.hyatt northrop cir,northrop.the language of the federal statute,however,is noticeably different from the language in section,subdivision a.the federal statute dictates that the limitations period begins when material facts were known or reasonably should have been known section,subdivision a merely states that the limitations period under the california act commences upon discovery.because of this difference in language,we are not persuaded that the operation of the federal limitations period necessarily dictates how we should interpret section,subdivision a.
as the raiders also point out,however,the term discovery is not foreign to california statutes of limitation.long before the legislature used that term in section,it was interpreted by california connection with the limitations period for causes of action based on common law fraud and mistake.code civ,subd.d.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,includes common law fraud among the causes of action that must be asserted within three years.under that provision,the cause of action for fraud does not thus the limitations period does not start to run until the discovery,by the aggrieved party,of the facts constituting the fraud.code civ,subd.d.the purpose of this provision is to promote the resolution of claims on the merits.since fraud by its nature is often concealed from the victim,the provision protects fraud victims from having the limitations period run before they are even aware of the fraud.on the other hand,if the term discovery were viewed too literally,requiring awareness of every fact necessary for a fraud claim,a plaintiff could unduly delay the commencement of litigation by asserting ignorance of the ultimate fact of fraud.accordingly,we have long interpreted code of civil procedure section to commence upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the fraud or facts that would lead a reasonably prudent person to suspect fraud.miller bechtel cal d,miller.
we conclude it is appropriate to ascribe the same meaning to the term discovery in the context of section,subdivision a.as with fraud claims under code of civil procedure section,this interpretation balances the policy of avoiding stale lawsuits with the policy of providing a reasonable time for a plaintiff to discover a false claim.furthermore,our interpretation is consistent with the tenets of civil code section,which reads every person who has actual notice of circumstances sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry as to a particular fact,has constructive notice of the fact itself in all cases in which,by prosecuting such inquiry,he might have learned such fact.italics added.consequently,circumstances which put a reasonable person on inquiry of a false claim are constructive notice of the false claim itself.
our interpretation of the term discovery is also consistent with the construction of that term in the context of the limitations period for a criminal statute similar to the california act.penal code section makes it a crime to present for payment any false or fraudulent claim,bill,account,voucher,or writing to any state board or officer,or to any county,city,or district board or officer.prosecutions for violation of penal code section must be commenced within four years after discovery of the commission of the offense,or within four years after the completion of the offense,whichever is later,subd.c.the limitations period commences after one has knowledge of facts sufficient to make a reasonably prudent person suspicious of fraud,thus putting him on inquiry.people crossman d,quoting people zamora cal d.
debro offers no persuasive reason to adopt a different interpretation of the term discovery.he argues that code of civil procedure section does not apply here because it only applies to plaintiff if plaintiff has a duty to inquire even if it applied to plaintiff,plaintiff did not discover the false claim violation until october.debro argument has no merit,for several reasons.first,we are not applying code of civil procedure section to his cause of action for violation of the california act,but are merely referring to it as an analogous statute.second,whether debro had a duty to inquire is not essential to our analysis.section,subdivision a,refers to the discovery by the official of the state or political subdivision.we therefore examine the information known to the responsible persons at the city of oakland and alameda county,not debro third,any plaintiff has a duty to inquire once he becomes aware of facts that would make a reasonably prudent person suspect fraud.miller,supra,cal d at.as we discuss in the following section,the facts known to the governmental entities would have put a reasonable person on inquiry notice.fourth,debro assertion that he did not discover the violation until october contradicts the allegations of his second amended complaint,in which it is pled that he discovered the fraud in.
debro other arguments regarding the construction of the statute of limitations under the california act are also without merit.primarily,he contends that section a of the fca requires the statute to start to run on date sic of discovery after vigorous investigation,by responsible officials.italics added.he points out that section requires the attorney general and the prosecuting authority of the political subdivision to diligently investigate false claims,and then jumps to the conclusion that the discovery required to commence the limitations period under section,subdivision a,can only occur after the prosecuting authority has had the opportunity to investigate pursuant to section.as a result,he argues,the false claim could not have been discovered by the city of oakland and alameda county representatives until debro filed his qui tam complaint and sent it to the attorney general.
debro argument is not supported by the language of section,subdivision a.nowhere does the statute dictate that the responsible person at the political subdivision can not be charged with inquiry notice until the qui tam plaintiff has filed his complaint and sent it to the attorney general.moreover,debro construction of the statute would result in absurdity.according to debro view,the time period within which a qui tam plaintiff could file a lawsuit under the california act would start whenever he filed his lawsuit.this would permit the qui tam plaintiff to control the length of the limitations period,waiting as much as full years after learning of the fraud before bringing suit.this is plainly not what the legislature had in mind when drafting section,subdivision a.accord northrop,supra,at rejecting identical argument under federal false claims act.
debro strongest but ignored by the from a portion of the california act legislative history,attached to his opening brief as exhibit c.according to these documents,amendment to a draft of the california act added the following language,which we now find in section,subdivision a no more than three years after the date of discovery by the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.according to a summary of the amendment,amendment would provide for a shorter statute of limitations of years,instead of years,when the violation is known to the public agency defrauded by the false claim.floor,policy com.analysis of assem.bill,italics added.thus,debro argues,the use of the word discovery in section,subdivision a was intended to require actual knowledge of the violation before the limitations period would commence.
we find this legislative history to be entirely consistent with our interpretation of section,subdivision a.under our interpretation,actual knowledge of the false claim does commence the limitations period,just as the legislative history suggests.whether mere knowledge of facts which could give rise to a false claim starts the limitations period,however,is not specifically addressed by the legislative history in amendment.on the key issue before us,therefore,the legislative history is silent.given the legislature presumed understanding of the judicial interpretation of the term discovery in other statutes of limitation,it is reasonable to assume that it would have used a word other than discovery if it intended for the limitations period to commence only upon actual knowledge of a violation.see williams foster d.at bottom,in light of the strong public policy underpinning the judicial construction of that term in this context,the legislative history does not dissuade us from interpreting the term discovery as it has been defined in the context of code of civil procedure section 
thus,we hold,the limitations period under section,subdivision a,commences when the official charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances either knows of the false claim or knows of facts which would lead a reasonably prudent person to suspect it.we next apply that standard to the instant case,determining whether,based on the allegations of the second amended complaint,representatives of the city of oakland and alameda county either knew of the purported false claim or were aware of sufficient facts to put them on inquiry notice.
debro allegations with respect to the limitations period 
as we have explained,debro maintains the false claim was based on the loan agreement describing the transfer of funds to the raiders as a loan rather than a gift.whether the transaction was falsely described as a loan turns on the legal effect of the language of the loan agreement.as shown by allegations in the second amended complaint and the loan agreement attached thereto,the responsible governmental officials became aware of the language of the loan agreement by no later than august,when it was signed by the alameda county counsel approving the document as to form and others additionally,the second amended complaint contains the language,elected public officials voted to fund this fraud,and tried to hid sic and deny that this contract was a fraud.to the extent any of the governmental entit
