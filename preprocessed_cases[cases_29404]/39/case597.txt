background 
lease negotiations between gsa and golub 
gsa issued a solicitation for offers sfo in july of,seeking to lease square feet of building space in kansas city,missouri,for a period of years.pursuant to the sfo,all utilities were to be included in any offered rental rates except for overtime heating and cooling costs,which were to be billed separately at an hourly rate to be negotiated.paragraph e,which was included in the sfo as originally issued,is at the center of the parties disagreement and provides 
zone control individual thermostat control shall be provided for office space with control areas not to exceed occupiable square feet.areas which routinely have extended hours of operation shall be environmentally controlled through dedicated heating and air conditioning equipment.special purpose areas with internal cooling load in excess of tons shall be independently controlled.
this paragraph is standard in all gsa leases.
golub and company golub submitted its initial offer to gsa on october,golub proposed to construct a new building for the lease,with a flat hourly overtime heating and cooling rate of per hour.golub lease negotiator on the project was james wieger wieger.prior to entering private industry as a lease negotiator,wieger worked for gsa as a special assistant to the commissioner of gsa public building service.
during negotiations,wieger and cindy jackson kiley jackson kiley,gsa negotiator,discussed various requirements of the sfo,including the government goals regarding overtime heating and cooling.jackson kiley explained to wieger that the government required an efficient heating,ventilation,and air conditioning hvac system that could be operated during overtime hours to provide heating and cooling only to those areas where needed,rather than servicing the entire facility.based on a comparison of overtime heating and cooling costs for other leases in the kansas city area,gsa had a target rate for overtime services for the entire building of between and per hour.at,golub rate was within gsa target zone.
following her initial meeting with wieger,jackson kiley issued an amendment to the sfo sfo amendment.in the sfo amendment,jackson kiley requested offerors to provide an additional breakdown of overtime heating and cooling costs,based on the cost per zone.the amendment stated 
provide an hourly overtime rate for the following 
base or minimum hourly charge 
cost per zone 
hourly calculation number of zones needed by tenant,times hourly charge per zone,plus base or minimum hourly charge total hourly charge.
at the time jackson kiley issued the amendment,the hvac system had not yet been designed.consequently,she did not have a clear concept of the square footage covered by a zone,but associated the term with the central hvac equipment that would run to provide overtime services,cch at.wieger,however,recognized the amendment as an opportunity to increase golub profits on the lease without reducing the chances of winning the contract id.his response to the sfo amendment proposed a base rate and a hourly cost per zone for overtime heating and cooling.wieger did not explain to gsa that his quoted rates equated a zone with the square foot area described in paragraph e of the sfo.based on the square footage in the building,wieger estimated to himself that the final hvac design for the building would contain approximately zones.id.
during a second round of negotiations,jackson kiley repeated to wieger that the purpose and intent of the zone formula was to enable the government to pay for only the equipment required to be turned on during any overtime heating or cooling period.wieger informed her that such a system was possible,but again avoided clearly explaining his interpretation of zone under the formula contained in the sfo amendment.upon completing negotiations,golub submitted its final offer with an annual rental rate of and a revised overtime heating and cooling rate of per hour base cost and a cost per zone of.the government accepted golub offer on may.
the parties signed the final lease documents in april of.the signed documents included paragraph e of the original sfo and incorporated the formula for overtime heating and cooling services contained in the sfo amendment.since the building was not designed at the time the parties entered into the lease,the parties agreed to establish the actual lease dates by supplemental lease agreement upon delivery of the space,which was to be within days following the government approval of final construction drawings.
b.the final hvac design 
the final hvac design for the kansas city building utilizes three centrifugal chillers of tons each.each chiller is independently sufficient to service the building at the reduced levels of projected overtime loads.two units,each consisting of two supply fans,deliver cooled air from the chillers into the building.the hvac system delivers air into the individual areas of the building through the use of variable air volume vav boxes,which,as their name suggests,vary the volume of air delivered into a space through the use of dampers that open and close in response to a temperature signal.a building automated control bac system generates the control signal in response to inputs from a total of thermostats up from the thermostats originally estimated by wieger throughout the building,and also controls the operation of the chillers and the units.although the bac controls each vav box independently,if overtime heating or cooling is requested for any amount of space in the building,the bac system must operate the chillers and units at a level sufficient to cool at least of one floor approximately square feet.
c.the disputed lease term 
in june of,upon completion of the construction of the building,the united states department of agriculture usda the building actual tenant requested overtime cooling to accommodate its move into the building.following the,golub,through wieger,submitted an invoice for overtime usage to the government in the amount of.the invoice reflected wieger interpretation of the formula in the sfo amendment,equating one zone to each of the building thermostats.according to wieger,he probably determined the number of zones used by the usda by having an engineer count on the basis of the sensors,only some of which were activated during the usda move into the building.a subsequent invoice for overtime hvac use during the month of august for reflected the same method of calculation.
following receipt of the first invoice,the contracting officer overseeing administration of the lease,patty comstock comstock,rejected the amount of the charges.under golub interpretation,comstock noted,the cost of supplying overtime hvac to all thermostats of the building for a hour overtime period would be of the annual rental rate for the first year.since a single fan in one of the units was sufficient to supply the building with cooling at the reduced overtime levels,comstock concluded that each fan corresponded to a zone.under comstock interpretation,the zone charge was a cost per occurrence of overtime hvac.assuming that only one zone was used during the overtime period,comstock recalculated the total overtime charges at 
appellant hpi acquired golub in october of and inherited the dispute.hpi submitted a certified claim to gsa for overtime hvac,which gsa rejected over hpi interpretation of zone as used in the sfo amendment.gsa disagreed with hpi assertion that paragraph e of the sfo provided a definition of zone,explaining instead that the paragraph only specifie d the method for controlling temperature conditions by subdividing the building areas into smaller spaces,each having its own thermostat control.the rate for overtime hvac services that hpi was charging the government based on the submitted invoices,gsa noted,was per hour,which greatly exceeded the actual hourly cost of estimated by the local utility.gsa final decision defined a zone as an unit,yielding a maximum of two zones in the building hpi appealed the decision to the board.
d.the board proceeding 
the board concluded that the term zone was ambiguous as used in the lease,cch at.although paragraph e was entitled zone control and the sfo amendment included a formula referencing zones,the board explained,neither provision provided a definition of the term.the board further found that the term did not have an accepted definition in the hvac industry,citing an industry handbook and the testimony of technical witnesses presented during the proceeding.id.at.
the board next found hpi equating of zone to thermostat unreasonable,as it would result in an hourly cost to the government of of the daily rental rate for the building,assuming overtime hvac use in all of hpi zones.id.at.if the contracting officer had agreed to such a seemingly imprudent bargain,the board explained,we would have expected it to be absolutely clear in the lease negotiation records id.the board faulted wieger failure to clarify and his deliberate avoidance of the meaning of zone.the board rejected hpi argument that the doctrine of contra proferentem,which requires construing ambiguous terms against the drafter,required construing the ambiguity against the government in this case,both because hpi interpretation was unreasonable and the sfo amendment was negotiated.
the board found the government interpretation,on the other hand,reasonable as consistent with both the zone control provision in paragraph e and the government stated intent and purpose of efficiency underlying the sfo amendment.id.at.the government interpretation,the board explained,was also consistent with the construction of the hvac system,which required treatment of a minimum of square feet of space if any space was to receive overtime hvac.the board concluded 
g iven the flexibility of the system design,it makes little sense to define the term zone in terms of a set amount of space and makes much more sense to define zone as the government does,the amount of space served by the air handling units when delivering overtime hvac.
finally,the board rejected the government interpretation of the zone charge of as a single,rather than an hourly,charge.id.hpi timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review an agency board decision under the standard set out in the contract disputes act of,cda.under the cda,a board conclusions of law are reviewed without deference.b white edsall constr.the agency board,however,has considerable experience and expertise in interpreting government contracts,and its interpretation is given careful consideration and great respect.cmty.heating plumbing kelso.an agency board findings of fact shall not be set aside unless fraudulent,or arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.b.the sole issue here is one of contract interpretation,which is a question of law reviewed de novo.grumman data.dalton.
as an initial matter,neither party disputed the board determination that the zone charge in the formula contained in the sfo amendment was intended by the parties to be an hourly charge per zone rather than a charge per occurrence as stated by the,cch at.accordingly,this conclusion by the board remains undisturbed on remand.
hpi challenges the board finding of ambiguity and,in the alternative,the board determination that its interpretation was unreasonable.we reject hpi arguments and agree with the board that the term zone is ambiguous.although paragraph e discusses zone control and the formula in the sfo amendment depends in part on the number of zones in the building,neither provision defines the term nor is a meaning otherwise discernible from the lease documents.when a contract term is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,it is ambiguous.jowett,united states.in light of the ambiguity and the arguments made by the parties,the board properly received evidence of trade practice and custom in an attempt to resolve the ambiguity.see metric constructors,nasa,jowett,at.expert testimony presented by the parties and found credible by the board,however,revealed further uncertainty in the industry on the meaning of the term.varying interpretations of zone were also reflected in several industry handbooks reviewed by the board.the ambiguity in the language of the lease documents combined with the disagreement between the parties,the experts,and the industry handbooks confirms our conclusion that the board was correct in finding the term zone ambiguous.
our precedent provides us with several legal rules for choosing between competing interpretations of an ambiguous contract provision.the general rule is contra proferentem,which requires ambiguities in a document to be resolved against the drafter.hills materials rice.the patent ambiguity doctrine,however,is an exception to the general rule that requires construing ambiguities against the contractor where the ambiguities are so patent and glaring that it is unreasonable for a contractor not to discover and inquire about them.triax pac.west,quoting beacon constr.united states.as this court explained in triax,t he patent ambiguity doctrine is a rule that is designed to ensure,to the greatest extent possible,that all parties bidding on a contract share a common understanding of the scope of the project.id.at.where an ambiguity is not sufficiently glaring to trigger the patent ambiguity exception,it is deemed latent and the general rule of contra proferentem applies.id.
before a court may enforce the general rule of contra proferentem against the drafter of an ambiguity,the contractor interpretation of that ambiguity must be reasonable.hills materials,at.although the reasonableness requirement operates in the same manner as the patent ambiguity exception by defeating the operation of the general rule of contra proferentem,the requirement is not so much an exception to the rule as it is an inherent component of the rule itself.as explained by our predecessor,the court of claims 
the essential ingredients of the rule are that the contract specifications were drawn by the government that language was used therein which is susceptible of more than one interpretation that the intention of the parties does not otherwise appear and that the contractor actually and reasonably construed the specifications in accordance with one of the meanings of which the language was susceptible.
contracting united states,emphasis added.therefore,apart from the patent ambiguity exception,a contractor must satisfy the above conditions before the general rule of contra proferentem will apply 
despite the government argument to the contrary,the ambiguity in the lease documents between hpi and the government is not sufficiently glaring to trigger the patent ambiguity doctrine.the remaining question is whether the general rule of contra proferentem requires us to construe the ambiguity against gsa.although not specifically addressed,the board opinion establishes,and we agree,that the first three elements of the rule are satisfied.we are unable to discern from the board opinion,however,whether the fourth element has also been met.
the board found hpi interpretation of zone unreasonable,meaning that the fourth element of the rule was not satisfied and,which,if correct,precludes application of the general rule of contra proferentem,cch at.the board,however,does not explain why hpi interpretation of the term is unreasonable.several themes emerge in the board analysis of hpi proffered interpretation of the term zone that must be analyzed.the first theme apparent in the board opinion is that hpi interpretation of zone results in significant added costs to the government und
