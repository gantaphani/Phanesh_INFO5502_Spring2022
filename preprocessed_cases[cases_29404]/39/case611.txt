william musick petitions for review of the final decision of the merit systems protection board board that denied his petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement with the department of energy agency.musick dep t of energy.we vacate and remand.
background 
effective august,the agency removed musick from his position as a budget analyst,because he was unable to perform the duties of his position.on september,musick filed an appeal with the board challenging his removal.around the same time,he applied for disability retirement,which was approved by the office of personnel management opm on november.
eventually,on january,musick entered into a settlement agreement with the agency with respect to his board appeal.in the settlement agreement,musick agreed to the dismissal of his appeal with prejudice.he also agreed not to initiate any complaints,grievances,or civil lawsuits based upon,or relating to,his removal.in return,the agency agreed to pay musick his salary,plus benefits,from the date of his removal to the date of the agency last transmittal of the negotiated terms of the settlement agreement.the agency further agreed that 
in consideration of the aforementioned terms and the agreement not to pursue any other actions based upon the facts in the mspb appeal mentioned above,doe agrees to remove all documentation relating to and culminating in musick removal,dating back to january where the agency proposed to place musick on enforced sick leave,and including all documentation proposing to remove musick from his position from his official personnel file opf.doe also agrees to replace the august,removal action from his opf and replace it with a resignation action dated august.both parties acknowledge that musick application for disability retirement was approved by the office of personnel management in november.
on january,the administrative judge aj accepted the parties settlement agreement,entered it into the record for enforcement purposes,and dismissed musick appeal of his removal.musick dep t of energy,no.i.
a year and a half later,on july,musick filed a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement.in it,he alleged that the agency had breached the agreement by failing to remove all documents relating to his removal from its files,including his official personnel file opf,and by denying him access to agency facilities.the aj ordered the agency to submit evidence of compliance with the settlement agreement.in response,the agency,through the statement and submission of agency representative rochell talley,asserted that it had complied with the agreement by removing from musick opf all documentation relating to and culminating in his removal,dating back to january of.
ruling on musick petition,the aj interpreted the settlement agreement as requiring that the agency remove all documents relating to and culminating in musick removal from his opf only.musick dep t of energy,no.the aj based his interpretation on the language of the agreement and therefore did not allow parol evidence to be admitted regarding the intent or understanding of the parties in forming the agreement.id.as a result of his interpretation,and relying on the submission of talley,the aj concluded that the agency had complied with the settlement agreement by removing from musick opf all documents relating to his removal.id.the aj also concluded that the settlement agreement did not require the agency to grant musick access to its facilities.id.accordingly,the aj held that musick had not proven that the agency had breached the agreement.id.he therefore denied the petition for enforcement.id.
musick timely filed a petition for review of the aj initial decision.on september,the board issued a decision stating that the two board members could not agree on the disposition of the petition.musick,at.therefore,the aj initial decision became the final decision of the board.id.member slavet issued a separate opinion,interpreting the language of the settlement agreement as requiring removal of documentation relating to or culminating in musick removal from all of the agency files id.at.in light of that interpretation,she concluded that the agency had materially breached the agreement by failing to remove materials relating to musick removal from its files.id.at.
musick now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the board is limited.specifically,we must affirm the board decision unless we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c kewley dep t of health human.
on appeal,musick makes two arguments.first,he refers to the fact that,in february of,security personnel barred him from entering agency facilities.in that regard,he states that i nstead of removing the documentation the security department was placed on high alert to prevent me from any access to the department.see attached memo to all security officials.the memorandum to which musick refers is dated february.it reads as follows 
please notify all protective force members to be alert for the attempted access by william musick.musick has resigned and returned his doe badge to this office.if musick attempts to enter a doe headquarters facility he is to be denied access.should musick have any questions reference sic his access denial he is to contact labor relations at.the protective force is not required nor responsible for contacting labor relations.
musick appears to argue that the february,memorandum is a document that was maintained in his opf in violation of the settlement agreement.this contention is without merit.as can be seen,the memorandum makes no mention of musick removal or any of the events leading up to it.
second,musick argues that member slavet correctly interpreted the settlement agreement as requiring the agency to remove related documents from all agency files and that she correctly concluded that the agency materially breached the agreement.the agency responds that the settlement agreement only required it to remove and amend documentation in musick opf.the agency states that musick opf was purged of all documentation regarding his removal in accordance with the settlement agreement.
a settlement agreement is a contract,the interpretation of which is a question of law.see greco dep t of army.in entering into the settlement agreement,musick was represented by counsel,and he acknowledged that he was voluntarily agreeing to the agreement terms and conditions.paragraph of the settlement agreement,which we quote above,provided that all documentation relating to and culminating in musick removal would be removed from his official personnel file opf.while paragraph is poorly drafted,we believe the only reasonable reading of the paragraph is that the agency only obligated itself to remove pertinent material from musick opf.paragraph specifies the material to be removed all documentation relating to and culminating in musick removal,dating back to january where the agency proposed to place musick on enforced sick leave,and including all documentation proposing to remove musick from his position.at the same time,and most importantly,it identifies only one place from which the specified material is to be removed.that place is the opf from his official personnel file.in short,whatever deficiencies there may be in the wording of paragraph,as far as the issue before us is concerned,the paragraph is clear.the agency was only required to remove documentation from musick opf.
king dep t of navy,does not help musick.in king,laura king and the department of the navy entered into a settlement agreement relating to king appeal of her removal.the agreement stated that the navy agreed to cancel the removal action of the appellant and remove all reference to the removal action from king official personnel file.id.at.subsequently,through a freedom of information act inquiry,king learned that records of opm and the defense finance and accounting service dfas contained references to the remo
