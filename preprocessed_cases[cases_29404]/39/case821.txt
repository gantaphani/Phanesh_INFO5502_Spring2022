emma corporation,a licensed building contractor,submitted the low bid on a school construction project proposed by the inglewood unified school district.pub.contract code,et all further section references are to the public contract code.as required,emma included a bond issued by fidelity and deposit company of maryland for percent of the bid,which would be forfeited if emma won the contract but refused to perform.
emma discovered it had failed to include its plumbing subcontractor costs in its bid,which thus was nearly too low.emma timely sent the district a letter withdrawing its bid.the district,but not emma,realized the letter did not provide all the information required by,and thus did not satisfy,the bid withdrawal statutes.as part of a deliberate strategy,the district told emma it would contact emma if it needed more information.the district did not do so.when the bid withdrawal period lapsed,the district claimed emma failed to comply with the bid withdrawal requirements and awarded emma the contract at its original bid price.
emma refused to perform.the district gave the contract to the next lowest bidder.emma sued the district for rescission and exoneration of the bond.the district for contract breach,seeking the difference between emma and the next lowest bid,and payment of the bond.
the parties agreed to sever the trial of the complaint from trial of the,and to waive jury.on trial of the complaint,the trial court found emma failed to substantially comply with the bid withdrawal statutes.however,the court found the district conduct in response to emma attempted bid withdrawal estopped the district from enforcing the contract.the trial court entered judgment for emma and dismissed the with prejudice as moot.the district appeals.
the district contends that on the facts found by the trial court it can not be estopped as a matter of law because on these facts,it is immune from estoppel.we reject the contention and affirm the judgment.
the district does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.indeed,in the standard of review section of its brief,the district argues the standard of review is de novo w hen the facts are undisputed as will be established below,the facts are undisputed.as a result,we quote the facts and conclusions found by the trial court from its statement of decision 
on november,emma entered a sealed bid to the district for the new construction and modernization of the frank parent elementary school project emma bid was in a lump sum amount of and was the apparent lowest bid in price submitted on november,ftr international submitted the apparent next lowest bid,a bid of.execution of a contract pursuant to emma bid if tendered was guaranteed by an bid bond executed for ten percent of the amount bid and submitted with emma bid.
bids for the parent project had been previously taken on october,at which time the only bidder,dj amoroso,timely entered a bid in the sum of.the amount of the bid by dj amoroso exceeded the amount of money available to the district to pay for the new construction and modernization of the parent project.the district budget for the parent project was only.the district subsequently elected to reject the bid by dj amoroso and the bid on the parent project.after this first bid in october,the district was very concerned about its ability to obtain,on a of the parent project,a bid sufficiently close to the district budget to allow the new construction and modernization to take place.accordingly,the district undertook various actions to obtain lower bids on the of the parent project,including not answering emma inquiries as to the amount of the dj amoroso bid when it was requested prior to the second parent school bid date.
when emma entered its bid of on november,for the parent project,emma did so as a result of having committed a clerical error when adding up the within its total cost estimate,thereby causing emma to bid an amount less than emma would have bid if it had not made the mistake.specifically,the bid for the plumbing and site utilities work by subcontractor estep sons in the amount of,was included in emma estimated costs for the parent project at only rather than.this is reflected in emma cost estimate spreadsheet from which emma totaled its bid for the parent project the mistake occurred because emma estimator,nadine dumindin,erroneously entered a figure as if it were a bid amount on both the lines for site utilities work and plumbing work when she intended to enter a in only the line for site utilities work.
at the time of the second bid opening for the parent project on november,charles clements was an employee of cmts.cmts,was then the district construction management company for the modernization and new construction for projects which included the parent project.clements was then designated senior project manager for the parent project,and agent for receipt and evaluation of bids for the project and for management of subsequent performance of the work.also at that time,tom jeffries,another employee of cmts,was designated as the direct project manager for the parent project.immediately after the bids for the parent project were opened on november,clements recognized that the bid price entered by emma was so far below the prices of other bidders,including ftr international,dj amoroso and morillo whose bids were tightly bunched that emma bid likely contained a material mistake and that emma would likely seek to rescind its bid under section for such mistake.directly after the bid opening at the offices of the district where the bids were entered and opened,clements expressed his opinions to,among others,jerry norman,interim facilities director for the district,and david orbach,outside legal counsel to the district.
at that time just after the bid opening on november,the district agents,including orbach,clements,and norman,knew that the technical requirements for rescission under section were complex and that a bidding contractor might fail in complying with the technical requirements when withdrawing its bid for mistake.accordingly,the district agents set out a plan of action aimed at maximizing the likelihood that emma would,in fact,fail to meet the technical requirements of section.the district agents determined that no agent or employee of the district would assist emma in rescinding its mistaken bid the district agents and employees would decline to react to any withdrawal notification by emma,written or oral the district agents or employees would not answer or react to any question by emma about the bid withdrawal process and,instead,would refer all inquiries to the outside legal counsel for the district.orbach gave such directions to those agents and employees of the district who were present after the bid opening.on the following monday,november,norman gave such directions to agents and employees of the district who were not present at the prior meeting.
on november,emma sent by facsimile to the district a bid withdrawal letter which notified the district that emma had made a clerical error in totaling its bid price and that emma wanted to withdraw its bid for such mistake.the letter,however,failed to describe all the details about how emma mistake occurred.the district did not reply to emma letter at any time but,eventually,the district purportedly awarded the contract for the parent project to emma and delivered the same to emma without prior notice.also without notice to emma,the district met in executive session of its board of education and determined that the district would refuse to allow emma to withdraw its bid.the board of education based its decision on the opinion of the district legal counsel that emma letter,submitted on november,did not meet the technical requirements of section 
the district knowledge of emma error,its intent to stand mute and refusal to cooperate with emma,and its hope that the district could take advantage of emma mistaken bid by obtaining the forfeiture of emma bid bond,was reflected in an written by tom jeffries of cmts to the district jerry norman and delivered shortly after the district received the bid withdrawal letter from emma on friday afternoon.
in the morning of monday,november,and at the request of emma president,emanuel yashari,emma office manager,mary ann austria,telephoned jeffries whom the bid documents identified as the representative of the district who would take all inquiries about the bid process for the parent project.austria telephone call was answered by clements,jeffries supervisor,who identified himself and related to austria that he would handle the call in tom jeffries absence.austria asked clements if the district had received emma bid withdrawal letter and offered to supply any further information that the district might require concerning emma mistake and withdrawal of its bid.clements replied that the district had received emma letter,but that the district had instructed cmts not to discuss the matter with anyone.instead,clements stated that the letter had been sent to the district legal counsel and if the district should require additional information from emma,the district legal counsel would contact emma.
austria immediately related the contents of the telephone conversation to yashari.responding to the statements exchanged in this telephone conversation,yashari was reasonable in his actions in believing that if the district required additional information from emma about emma mistake and withdrawal of its bid,the district legal counsel would contact emma.further,yashari was reasonable in his actions by not taking any further steps to notify the district,within the statutory period,of additional details about emma mistaken bid.the district legal counsel never contacted emma about its mistake or withdrawal of its bid.
when emma learned of the district position that emma had failed to provide adequate detail about the mistake in emma bid withdrawal letter of november,emma promptly directed an attorney to send another letter to the district,therein detailing all aspects and details about how the mistake occurred in emma bid for the parent project 
as a result of the fact that emma sent its bid withdrawal letter to the district on november,in conjunction with the fact that the district representative,clements,told emma representative,austria,that the district legal counsel would contact emma if the district required additional information from emma,the district is now precluded from claiming that emma failed to substantially comply with section et.
the court responds to the specific requests for its statement of controverted issues as follows 
emma bid withdrawal letter,submitted to the district on november,informed the district that emma had made a clerical error in totaling emma overall cost estimate for the parent project.however,because emma bid withdrawal letter failed to include sufficient detail as to how the mistake occurred,emma bid withdrawal letter,in and of itself,failed to supply the detail required by section.further,in the telephone conversation between austria and clements on november,austria did not provide any detail as to how emma mistake occurred in its bid submitted for the parent project.therefore,emma has failed to substantially comply with section 
the district receipt of emma bid withdrawal letter of november,alone did not trigger a duty upon the district to inform emma of the requirements of section 
emma was legally entitled to withdraw its november,bid because emma had made a material clerical error in the bid process 
the district is equitably estopped to claim that emma failed to comply with section,et 
emma did prove all the elements required to invoke equitable estoppel against the district 
for equitable estoppel to apply,the relevant knowledge is not emma knowledge of the application of section,but rather emma knowledge of the requirements of the code.emma proved it was ignorant of the requirements of the code beyond those that it complied with in emma bid withdrawal letter of november,
emma proved that the district intended by its actions to induce emma into not complying with section 
emma proved that it reasonably relied on the district actions in not complying with all the provisions of section 
emma is relieved of its mistaken bid submitted for the parent project.accordingly,the district for breach of contract and declaratory relief is moot and,therefore,dismissed with prejudice.
although not discussed in the trial court statement of decision,it was undisputed that in advertising for the second set of bids,the district sent,and emma received,written notice that any attempted withdrawal of a submitted bid had to comply with sections emma did not send its november bid withdrawal letter until it learned it was the low bidder on a second district project and emma earlier successfully withdrew a mistaken bid on a project with another school district only after the other district advised emma how to modify its original insufficient withdrawal letter.
discussion 
the district contends the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding the district was estopped from enforcing the original bid because of its response to emma telephone call.we disagree.
section states the legislature finds and declares that placing all public contract law in one code will make that law clearer and easier to find.further,it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this code to achieve the following objectives 
a to clarify the law with respect to competitive bidding requirements.
b to ensure full compliance with competitive bidding statutes as a means of protecting the public from misuse of public funds.
c to provide all qualified bidders with a fair opportunity to enter the bidding process,thereby stimulating competition in a manner conducive to sound fiscal practices.
d to eliminate favoritism,fraud,and corruption in the awarding of public contracts.

section,subdivision a,reads in part a bidder shall not be relieved of the bid unless by consent of the awarding authority nor shall any change be made in the bid because of mistake,but the bidder may bring an action against the public entity in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the bids were opened for the recovery of the amount forfeited,without interest or costs 
section states the bidder shall establish to the satisfaction of the court that 
a a mistake was made.
b he or she gave the public entity written notice within five days after the opening of the bids of the mistake,specifying in the notice in detail how the mistake occurred.
c the mistake made the bid materially different than he or she intended it to be.
d the mistake was made in filling out the bid and not due to error in judgment or to carelessness in inspecting the site of the work,or in reading the plans or specifications.
in wilson los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,d,kajima,a public agency refused to award a construction contract to the low bidder as required under the public contracting statutes.the supreme court held that the rejected bidder could recover its bid preparation costs,but not lost profits,under a promissory estoppel theory.kajima held that the public contracting statutes,enacted primarily to protect the public,limited the applicability of estoppel or other equitable remedies available to even a wronged bidder 
i t is clear that neither the doctrine of estoppel nor any other equitable principle may be invoked against a governmental body where it would operate to defeat the effective operation of a policy adopted to protect the public.citation.we have stated that the competitive bidding statutes are enacted for the benefit of property holders and taxpayers,and not for the benefit or enrichment of bidders,and should be so construed and administered as to accomplish such purpose fairly and reasonably with sole reference to the p
