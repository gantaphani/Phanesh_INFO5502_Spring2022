plaintiff redondo construction corporation redondo appeals from the adverse judgment of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico in its suit against the puerto rico highway and transportation authority the highway authority,the puerto rico public buildings authority the buildings authority collectively,the authorities,and various officials of the puerto rican government.redondo alleges that the defendants unlawfully applied a puerto rico statute retroactively to breach settlement agreements entered into by redondo and the authorities before the statute was enacted.redondo claims that the defendants breach of the agreements impaired the obligation of those contracts in violation of the contracts clause of the federal constitution and constituted breaches of contract under puerto rico law.
the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment on the contracts clause claim,accepting their argument that the obligation of the agreements had not been impaired because redondo was not prevented from obtaining damages if it established breaches of the agreements.having dismissed the sole federal claim on the merits,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over redondo breach of contract claims under puerto rico law and dismissed them without prejudice.
we find that the district court correctly concluded that redondo can not establish its constitutional claim and therefore affirm that portion of the judgment.we agree with redondo,however,that the district court exceeded its discretion in declining to exercise jurisdiction over redondo remaining claims.accordingly,we vacate the judgment with respect to those claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on april,redondo entered into a plea agreement in united states redondo construction,a criminal prosecution arising out of its conduct during performance of a construction project funded by the federal highway administration fhwa.pursuant to the agreement,redondo admitted to aiding and abetting the making of false statements to the department of transportation and to banco santander de puerto rico,in violation of,and.the agreement barred redondo,for a period beginning july,from bidding on,or receiving any benefit from,any contract funded in whole or part by the fhwa.in addition,for the two years following the debarment,the agreement conditioned redondo eligibility to participate in projects on supervision by a monitor selected by the fhwa and paid for by redondo.
the day after redondo entered into the plea agreement,the highway authority notified redondo that it was revoking the bids it had awarded to the company before the guilty plea,that it was immediately suspending the company from participating in any bids it awarded for days,and that it intended to extend the suspension for an undetermined period.a few weeks later,on may,the buildings authority notified redondo that it was also barring the company from participating in any bids it awarded.redondo challenged both suspensions.
redondo challenged the buildings authority suspension in an administrative proceeding.on april,before redondo administrative action was resolved,redondo and the buildings authority entered into a settlement agreement that allowed redondo to begin bidding for buildings authority contracts on april.
redondo contested the highway authority suspension in a separate administrative proceeding.on may,redondo moved for reconsideration of the suspension before the puerto rico department of transportation and public works dtop.while redondo was challenging the highway authority suspension,redondo and the fhwa were negotiating an agreement the monitoring plan that would govern redondo obligations between july,and july,the period during which redondo eligibility to participate in projects was conditioned on supervision by an outside monitor.in late,the highway authority joined these talks.on november,while the dtop administrative proceeding was still pending,redondo,the fhwa,and the highway authority executed the monitoring plan.the same day,redondo and the highway authority entered into a settlement agreement and jointly requested the termination of the dtop administrative proceeding.the agreement allowed redondo to participate,beginning december,on bids awarded by the highway authority if it complied with the conditions set forth in the monitoring plan.
on december,puerto rico passed law.laws ann.tit.the statute prohibits a government official from awarding contracts to any natural or juridical person who has been convicted of a crime constituting fraud,embezzlement,or the misappropriation of public funds the statute also requires the rescission of any government contract entered into with a party convicted of a specified offense,and provides that all government contracts are deemed to include a term authorizing rescission if the counterparty is convicted of a specified offense.the statute expressly provides that it does not apply to contracts entered into before it took effect the provisions of this chapter shall not apply retroactively nor shall they interfere with contracts in effect.
redondo had successfully bid on fourteen buildings authority projects after the settlement agreement between it and the buildings authority became effective on april.but after law was passed,the buildings authority canceled ten of the bids,including one for which it had already executed a contract with redondo.the buildings authority cited lack of project funding as its reason for canceling the bids.
on february,the highway authority informed redondo that it was withdrawing its consent to the settlement agreement and the monitoring plan due to redondo failure to make timely compliance with a term requiring it to deposit into an escrow account to fund the services of the outside monitor.deposition testimony of a highway authority official,however,suggests that agency officials decided to terminate the settlement agreement in an attempt to further the policy of law,despite their knowledge that the statute could not lawfully be applied retroactively.after notifying redondo of its decision,the highway authority asked dtop to reopen the administrative proceeding and schedule a hearing to determine the length of redondo suspension.redondo deposited into the escrow account the same day,but dtop nonetheless granted the highway authority request.
dtop held the hearing requested by the highway authority in late.on june,the hearing examiner issued a report and recommendation concluding that redondo had not breached the monitoring plan,and that the highway authority termination of the settlement agreement and the monitoring plan should be deemed ineffective.the secretary of dtop initially adopted the examiner report,but later granted a motion for reconsideration by the highway authority and determined that the highway authority had validly withdrawn its consent to the settlement agreement and the monitoring plan.redondo appealed dtop determination to the puerto rico court of appeals.
on may,the court of appeals ruled that it was not clear that redondo had breached the monitoring plan,and that even if redondo had not timely deposited the into the escrow account,its breach was not sufficiently serious to justify the highway authority unilateral termination of the settlement agreement.the court of appeals ordered the highway authority to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement and the monitoring plan as soon as its judgment became final and enforceable.the highway authority petitioned for certiorari in the supreme court of puerto rico,but that court denied the petition and two motions for reconsideration.
in december,while redondo was litigating the highway authority actions in the puerto rico courts,it brought this federal action challenging the actions of both the highway authority and the buildings authority.redondo alleged that both authorities had unlawfully applied law to breach their settlement agreements with redondo the highway authority by withdrawing its consent to the settlement agreement and the monitoring plan,and the buildings authorit
