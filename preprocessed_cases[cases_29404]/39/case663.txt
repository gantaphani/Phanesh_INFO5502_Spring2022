plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of in damages for their breach of a contract to purchase a restaurant and surrounding land from the small business administration sba.they do not contest their liability,only the amount of damages awarded.the united states court of federal claims rejected the government damages request because of the government failure to mitigate.james robinson and florida businessmen ass n,united states.the government sought the difference between the contract price and the sale price,less the plaintiffs deposit.after a trial on damages only,the court found,however,that the proper measure was,the difference between the contract sale price of and the undisputed liquidation value of.
we conclude that,in holding that the government need not take affirmative steps or make reasonable efforts,but could instead mitigate by passively accepting the liquidation value,the trial court applied an erroneous legal standard.further,applying the correct legal standard to the undisputed facts,we hold as a matter of law that no damages are due.this is so because if reasonable efforts had been made,the quick sale value of would have been realized.we therefore reverse the judgment of damages.
plaintiffs purchased a former restaurant and surrounding land in florida at a auction in may.plaintiffs winning bid was,of which was conveyed to the sba as a down payment for the sale.because of a title challenge,the closing on the property did not occur as scheduled,and under a subsequent agreement with the sba plaintiffs took possession of the property in august.when the closing date had not occurred by april,plaintiffs notified the sba of their intention to vacate the premises and thereafter abandoned the property in may the sba then recovered the property but,before putting it up for,received a private offer for it.the sba ultimately accepted the offer of,which was below the contract price.
at trial plaintiffs presented evidence that property values in the relevant area at the time of the resale,while having initially declined,were in fact the same as they were at the time of the initial auction.thus,the property fair market value was its quick sale value the amount expected if the property market exposure is limited to six months to a year was and its liquidation value the amount expected if the property is sold without reasonable market exposure,usually within six months was.these facts are not disputed.indeed,the government called no witnesses after plaintiffs called the government own appraiser of the property as its main witness.
the trial court held that had the sba acted reasonably informed and with reasonable effort it could have received the appraised liquidation value of the property.the court then awarded the government the difference between the contract price and the liquidation value,less plaintiffs deposit which the government already had net damages of.plaintiffs appeal this damages judgment of.we have jurisdiction under a.
on appeal,the plaintiffs contend that the court applied the wrong legal standard in defining the duty of the government to mitigate when it held that achieving the liquidation value without taking any affirmative steps constituted sufficient mitigation,rather than taking such steps to obtain the higher quick sale value.alternatively,plaintiffs urge that assuming the court applied the correct legal standard,it clearly erred in applying the standard to the essentially undisputed facts.
although the trial court initially stated the correct legal standard,it actually applied a different and erroneous one.first,citing ketchikan pulp united states,the court stated the government need not seek out the optimum conditions for resale nor hold out for the property fair market value,but must only make those efforts that are fair and reasonable under the circumstances.robinson.at emphases added.the quoted statement,based on the ketchikan opinion,persuasive authority not binding on us,does indeed state the correct legal standard.see restatement second of contracts,comment b as a general rule,a party can not recover damages for loss that he could have avoided by reasonable efforts.emphasis added.despite its appropriate citation to the ketchikan standard,however,the trial court ultimately held that the government,as the injured party,is not required to seek anything more than the liquidation value.robinson.at.such an analysis eliminates the reasonable efforts requirement of the restatement and ketchikan.
the trial court acknowledged that while only reasonable efforts to achieve value were required,if the government had acted reasonably it could nonetheless have conducted a private sale more with the fair market value,or have conducted an auction to achieve no more than the property quick sale or liquidation values.id.emphasis added.it thus suggested that the quick sale value of,like the lesser liquidation value,was achievable with reasonable efforts.nevertheless,the court concluded the government was required to do no more than obtain the liquidation value and,if offered that price,making no efforts sufficed in lieu of making reasonable efforts to market.moreover,the court,like the government,analyzed the duty to mitigate in a complete vacuum,divorced from the actual real estate facts and considerations of time,cost,and gain shown on this record.like its sba resale agent,the government counsel merely assumes that reasonable efforts could require no steps,no calculations of costs versus gain and no delay,regardless of whether and to what degree marketing efforts during a given delay would increase the resale price.
achieving the quick sale value requires at least six months of marketing exposure by definition liquidation value corresponds to less than six months marketing.the original auction cost was less than.therefore,if the government followed its original plan to,it could expect to obtain an additional the difference between liquidation at and quick sale at at a cost of only.but the government made no analysis at all.it also failed to take any actions whatsoever,much less reasonable efforts under the circumstances.it did not obtain a new appraisal,advertise,call brokers,call any of the other bidders in the original auction,inspect the condition of the property or even make the most casual check of local real estate market trends.instead,it assumed that the property values continued to decline after the may auction as they had in the period.had the government simply asked,its own appraiser would have advised that land values actually stabilized and perhaps even went up since the may auction,as he testified at the damages trial further,rather than advertise and,the government did nothing except passively accept an unsolicited private offer of,roughly half the price.as justification for this surprisingly low offer,the government accepted the unverified and false assertion of the offeror that approximately in damage to the property had occurred since the may auction,a time period of approximately eighteen months.
we hold that in the circumstances of this case reasonable efforts in the form of affirmative steps are required to mitigate damages and that relative costs in time and money are primary factors to consider in assessing reasonableness.see restatement second of contracts,comment b the is expected to take such affirmative steps as are appropriate in the circumstances to avoid loss by making substitute arrangements or otherwise.emphasis added.the government resale agent admitted he took no affirmative steps at all merely accepting the unsolicited offer and that neither he nor his superiors even considered market developments or the ratio of costs to expected gains.the market conditions,which are undisputed,suggest that if the government spent to,it would thereby gain in sales price.as to time,the government had already waited six months since the breach to resell.during this time,it failed to advertise.if it had,in only a few more months a gain of over the liquidation value of was practically assured,for the quick sale value of requires only months market exposure while the liquidation value sale requires only up to six m
