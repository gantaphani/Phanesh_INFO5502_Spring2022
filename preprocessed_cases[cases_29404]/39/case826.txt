introduction 
these consolidated appeals arise from a taxpayer suit challenging the appointment of defendant carl schrader as district manager of the west bay sanitary district wbsd or district.the suit alleged that schrader appointment violated state law because schrader was a member of the district board of directors at the time of his appointment.after a bench trial,the trial court entered judgment declaring schrader employment contract void and compelling schrader to restore all compensation he had received under it.by posttrial order,the trial court also awarded plaintiff attorney fees against schrader under code of civil procedure section.schrader appeals from the judgment and from the award of fees.barbara finnegan,successor to the original plaintiff,appeals from the order awarding attorney fees,contesting both the sufficiency of the amount awarded and the trial court refusal to make the district jointly and severally liable for the fee award along with schrader.
we affirm the judgment and reverse the order awarding fees.we remand the case to the trial court to redetermine the apportionment and amount of the award.
factual and procedural background 
wbsd is a local sanitary district organized under state law.the district maintains sewer lines for all or portions of the cities of menlo park,portola valley,atherton,east palo alto,redwood city and woodside as well as for certain unincorporated areas of san mateo and santa clara counties,serving approximately residents in total.wbsd is governed by a,board of directors board.
schrader served as a director of the district from until january and from march to september.in january,schrader resigned from the board in order to be considered for the position of wbsd district manager.the district manager position is wbsd top employee position.after failing to obtain the position,schrader was appointed by vote of the board in march to fill the board vacancy created by his january resignation.
in february,the district manager of wbsd,charles thomas,resigned amidst accusations that he had taken kickbacks and embezzled funds from the district.thomas was later convicted of embezzlement charges arising from his tenure at wbsd.following thomas resignation,an interim district manager was appointed until a permanent district manager could be selected.at a regular board meeting in may,schrader confirmed that he was interested in being considered for the permanent district manager position.at a june board meeting,schrader referred to himself as an applicant for the district manager position and distributed a statement of his qualifications to the board.at its regular meeting on july,the board voted to limit the solicitation of candidates for the position to two schrader and the acting district manager,timothy clayton.
the board convened a special meeting on september.after opening the meeting,the board immediately adjourned to a closed session to consider the appointment to the position of district manager.prior to commencement of the closed session,schrader left the meeting because of his candidacy for the district manager position.later,schrader was invited to join the closed session so that he could be interviewed by the other board members regarding his qualifications.thereafter,the acting district manager,clayton,joined the meeting when the board returned to its open session.at that time,the board announced that a motion had been made and seconded in closed session to offer the district manager position to schrader on terms including a salary of per month.four board members,finn halbo,john inglis,david knight and donald van creveld,voted to offer the position to schrader on these terms schrader abstained.

shortly after schrader appointment as district manager,a candidate for board director,john carcione,began publicly criticizing schrader appointment,which was reported in local press articles.ronald shepherd,a san mateo county resident and wbsd ratepayer,began discussing the issue with carcione after carcione was elected to the board in november.
on march and march,shepherd served demands on the board asking it to declare schrader employment contract void and to institute action to recover all money and benefits paid to him under the contract.on april,shepherd filed the complaint that initiated this action.schrader was named as a defendant,and the district was named as the real party in interest and as a defendant.the complaint alleged that schrader employment contract was void on conflict of interest grounds because it was negotiated and entered into while schrader was still a member of the board.the complaint sought declaratory relief that the contract was void and restitution of all salary and benefits paid to schrader under the contract.the complaint also sought injunctive relief to prevent the district from paying any further compensation to schrader and to disqualify schrader from applying for the district manager position in the future.
on april,the board held a special meeting at which a majority of the directors voted to release schrader from his employment as district manager and to rehire him as acting district manager on the same terms and conditions,including salary,as his previous employment as district manager.on may,the district moved to strike prayers for relief in shepherd complaint seeking to enjoin the district from continuing to employ or compensate schrader.in connection with the motion,the district asked the court to take judicial notice of the fact that schrader had been terminated and reappointed on april.the district asserted,in part,that since schrader was no longer a board member when the board created a new employment relationship with him effective april,his continued employment and compensation by the board from that time forward could not violate the law.the district raised other issues concerning the injunctive relief sought by shepherd.schrader joined in the motion to strike and in the district arguments on these points.without stating its reasons,the trial court granted the district motion to strike.
