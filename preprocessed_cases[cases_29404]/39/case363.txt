executive order provides that,to the extent permitted by law,no federal agency,and no entity that receives federal assistance for a construction project,may either require bidders or contractors to enter,or prohibit them from entering,into a project labor agreement pla.the plaintiffs the building and construction trades department of the bctd,the contra costa building and construction trades council bctc,and the city of richmond,california brought this suit to challenge the validity of the executive order.the district court held the executive order invalid and enjoined its enforcement.
we hold that the president had authority under article ii of the constitution of the united states to issue executive order,and that the executive order is not preempted by the national labor relations act.therefore,we reverse the judgment of the district court and vacate the injunction.
background 
a pla is a,agreement designed to systemize labor relations at a construction site.it typically requires that all contractors and subcontractors who will work on a project subscribe to the agreement that all contractors and subcontractors agree in advance to abide by a master collective bargaining agreement for all work on the project and that wages,hours,and other terms of employment be coordinated or standardized pursuant to the pla across the many different unions and companies working on the project.the implementation of a pla on a project underwritten by the government almost always is accomplished by making agreement to the pla a bid specification,thereby allowing the contracting authority to ensure that firms at every level from the general contractor to the lowest level of subcontractor comply with the terms of the pla.
president george bush issued executive order on february,establishing the policy of the government with regard to the use of plas in federal and federally funded construction contracts.see preservation of open competition and government neutrality towards government contractors labor relations on federal and federally funded construction projects,fed.reg,executive order.the executive order provides that the government will neither require nor prohibit the use of a pla on any federal or federally funded construction project.section a provides that,t o the extent permitted by law,no federal agency or construction manager acting on its behalf shall in its bid specifications,project agreements,or other controlling documents for a construction project r equire or prohibit bidders,offerors,contractors,or subcontractors to enter into or adhere to agreements with one or more labor organizations,on the same or other related project s.section applies the same prohibition to any executive agency issuing grants,providing financial assistance,or entering into cooperative agreements for construction projects.the executive order makes clear that it does not prohibit a contractor or a subcontractor from entering into a pla,see id.c it merely prevents the contracting authority from either requiring or forbidding the use of a pla for a project.the result in practice is to leave to the contractors working on a project the choice whether to enter into,and to require their subcontractors to enter into,a pla,presumably depending upon whether it is likely to increase or to decrease their costs.see,united states general accounting office,project labor agreements,the extent of their use and related information,may describing instructions for bidders issued by department of labor allowing,but not requiring,a responsive bidder to have a project labor agreement pla with its contractors because a pla is one possible method of meeting th e goal of ensuring good labor relations.
the plaintiffs brought suit in the district court to enjoin enforcement of the executive order,naming as defendants the director of the federal emergency management agency,the secretary of housing and urban development,the secretary of transportation,and the members of the federal acquisition regulatory council.the bctd,which consists of national labor organizations representing workers in the construction industry,averred that it and its affiliates had entered into and intended to negotiate many plas,the future availability of which would be affected directly by the executive order.the city of richmond alleged that the executive order prevented it from requiring the use of plas on several federally funded construction contracts lest it lose its access to federal funds.the bctc,which consists of local labor unions representing construction workers in contra costa county,california,claimed in turn that but for the executive order it would negotiate plas with respect to work on federally funded projects put out for bid by the city of richmond.
one of the projects for which the bctd had negotiated a pla was the woodrow wilson bridge construction project,the purpose of which is to replace a drawbridge over the potomac river.the congress,after transferring ownership of the existing bridge to an interstate authority established by the district of columbia,the state of maryland,and the commonwealth of virginia,appropriated more than billion for the project.see woodrow wilson memorial bridge authority act of,pub,tit.iv,stat.maryland took responsibility for building the structures crossing the potomac river and the highways and interchanges on the maryland side,and virginia agreed to build the highways and interchanges on the virginia side of the river.before the president issued executive order affiliates of the bctd and the construction manager for the maryland state highway administration entered into an agreement to set terms for the construction of maryland share of the project.
the agreement provided that maryland would incorporate a pla into its bid specifications and that the successful bidder for the project would be bound by the pla regardless whether the contractor employees were members of a union.as required by federal regulations,see e,a,a,maryland submitted the bid specifications to the federal highway administration fhwa for approval,but the fhwa rejected them because the newly issued executive order prohibited the state from requiring adherence to a pla.maryland later awarded the contract without requiring that the awardee enter into a pla,which left the bctd no role in the project.
upon application of the bctd,the district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the executive order against the wilson bridge pla.constr.trades dep t allbaugh,d.the court held that the executive order conflicts with the national labor relations act,et,and that without an injunction the bctd would suffer irreparable harm because before the executive order was put in place the bctd had negotiated an agreement,binding on maryland,and maryland was using its best efforts to implement it,d at.
a few weeks later the district court issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the executive order.the court held first that,pursuant to the reasoning of the supreme court in youngstown sheet tube sawyer,the president could not impose the conditions in of the executive order upon the administration of federal funds without the express authorization of the congress,see constr.trades dep t allbaugh,d,and that neither the federal property and administrative services act,et procurement act,nor any other statute authorizes the president to do so,see id.at.the district court next concluded that the executive order was preempted in its entirety by the nlra because the executive order would abridge rights granted in of the act to employers in the construction industry and would alter the delicate balance of bargaining and economic power that the nlra establishes.see id.at,quoting chamber of commerce reich.
ii.analysis 
the government appeals,contending that under article ii of the constitution the president has authority to impose the conditions in of the executive order,and that the executive order is a proprietary rather than a regulatory act and therefore not subject to preemption by the nlra.we address these questions of law de novo.see time warner entm t united states.
