background 
the relevant facts are not in dispute.appellants are employees of the defense contract management district of the west dcmdw or the agency id.at,who seek compensation,liquidated damages,interest,attorney fees,and costs for overtime allegedly worked in violation of of the fair labor standards act flsa,et.appellants are represented exclusively by the american federation of government employees afge or the union,local bargaining unit local,and certain terms of their employment are therefore governed by a collective bargaining agreement cba executed between the agency and the dcmdw council of afge locals,including local.id.at.under a of the civil service reform act csra,et,all such cbas are required to include procedures for the settlement of grievances.id.a.with certain exceptions that do not apply here,the csra provides that these negotiated grievance procedures are to be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.id.emphasis added.the statute further states that any grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure shall be subject to binding arbitration.id.b c iii.the csra explicitly defines grievance to include complaints by any employee,labor organization,or agency concerning any claimed violation,misinterpretation,or misapplication of any law affecting conditions of employment.id.a c ii.although c of the statute excludes certain matters from the application of the grievance procedures,overtime claims under the flsa are not among them.see id.c.
as required by the csra,the cba at issue here contains grievance procedures for the prompt and equitable settlement of grievances between the parties to the agreement.consistent with the csra,the cba defines grievance broadly to include complaints based upon the interpretation or application of any law with respect to matters affecting conditions of employment.the cba further provides that unless a matter is explicitly excluded from the application of the negotiated grievance procedures,these procedures are to be the exclusive procedure available to bargaining unit employee s for the resolution of grievances.emphasis added.although the csra specifically permits a cba to exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures that the negotiating parties see fit,see id.a,appellants cba does not list flsa overtime claims in article,section,matters excluded.finally,appellants cba states that if the local bargaining unit representative is not satisfied with the results of the grievance procedures,it may request that the matter be taken to arbitration.as required by the csra,the arbitrator decision is to be binding upon the parties.
from through early,eleven afge locals,including local,filed substantively identical grievances against the agency alleging that it had violated the flsa by failing to pay overtime to all bargaining unit members occupying positions at the grade level and above.see.at.section a of the flsa states,in pertinent part 
except as otherwise provided in this section,no employer shall employ any of his employees for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.
a.the flsa further provides that an individual whose employer violates is entitled to the unpaid overtime wages,an additional equal amount as liquidated damages,attorney fees,and costs.id.b.an employee may bring suit for a violation in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.id.
on july,the parties entered into a global settlement agreement settlement agreement resolving the eleven locals overtime grievances against the agency.at.as part of the settlement agreement,the agency agreed to pay the union and other consideration to be disbursed to employees according to tabulations in three appendices to the agreement.id.this amount represented all backpay,interest,liquidated damages and attorneys fees and costs for the positions identified in appendices a,b,and c incurred in the union grievances up to the date that this agreement is signed.the agency also consented to pay an additional to each employee in the eleven union locals occupying a position designated in appendix c of the settlement agreement.id.in exchange for this payment,the parties agreed that no backpay,interest,or liquidated damages would accrue for the appendix c employees from the date of settlement to nine months thereafter.id.finally,the settlement agreement stated that,with the exception of the provisions governing the disputed appendix c positions,the union would not arbitrate the matters asserted in the flsa grievances for the time periods covered by the grievances nor would it pursue individual employee claims to arbitration other than as elsewhere provided in the settlement agreement.id.
almost a year later,appellants filed a complaint in the court of federal claims alleging that the agency had violated of the flsa.id.the court dismissed appellant complaint on the ground that a of the csra deprived the court of jurisdiction.id.at.as stated above,a provides that the negotiated grievance procedures contained in a cba shall be,with certain exceptions,the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances that fall within the cba coverage.a emphasis added.the word administrative was added to the statute by congress in,and it forms the heart of the jurisdictional debate in this case.prior to the amendment,a provides simply that a cba negotiated grievance procedures would be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fall within a cba coverage.a emphasis added.in carter gibbs,en banc,this court interpreted unamended a to foreclose judicial remedies for employee grievances covered by a cba.
in the instant case,the court of federal claims held that congress addition of the word administrative to a did not overrule carter and thus does not allow federal employees to bring an action in court when their grievances are subject to the negotiated procedures contained in a cba.see.at.because the court found no reported legislative history to illuminate congress intent in adding the term administrative,the court turned to the plain meaning of the word.id.at.although the court concluded that this plain meaning must govern,it declined to construe a accordingly,id.at.as the court stated,it could not agree that obeisance to the dictionary definition of the word administrative to the exclusion of other considerations justifies departure from a legislative scheme grounded on the premise that collectively bargained grievance procedures are the preferred method of dispute resolution for unionized federal employees.id.instead,the court undertook a broader approach to statutory interpretation,concluding that the appellants interpretation would be contrary to the csra overall purpose of limiting judicial remedies in favor of grievance procedures such as arbitration.see id.at stating that the appellants interpretation would turn the established statutory scheme on its head.
the court went on,assuming arguendo that it possessed jurisdiction,to determine that the settlement agreement constituted an accord and satisfaction of the appellants flsa claims.id.at.the court found that appellants had not raised a genuine issue of material fact that any of the elements of common law accord and satisfaction had not been satisfied.id.at.appellants argued that local was not a competent party to represent them in the agreement,citing brooklyn savings bank.holding that an employee can not waive his flsa rights and lynn food stores united states,cir holding that settlement of an flsa claim must be approved by either a court or the department of labor.the court rejected this argument,however,on the ground that those cases were not applicable to federal employees under the csra.see.at.
appellants appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
the court of federal claims decision to grant the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is a matter of law,which this court reviews de novo.see muniz united states.the underlying issue,a question of statutory interpretation,is also subject to de novo review on appeal.see strickland.
appellants submit that the court of federal claims erred when it held that a deprived it of jurisdiction of appellants claims.according to appellants,both the plain language and the legislative history of the statute indicate that congress intended to overrule carter by adding the word administrative to a and that the availability of administrative redress under their cba negotiated grievance procedures therefore does not restrict their right to pursue a judicial remedy in court.the government responds that the court of federal claims properly dismissed appellants claims for lack of jurisdiction because the addition of the word administrative did not affect the continuing applicability of carter to appellants case.the government argues that the structure of the statute,the remedial scheme established by,and the central purposes of the csra all counsel against reading the amendment to a as allowing federal employees to press their grievances in court when they could seek an administrative remedy under their cba negotiated procedures.
our holding in mudge united states,mudge,decided by this court concurrently with,is dispositive of this issue.in mudge,we hold that congress addition of the word administrative to the phrase exclusive procedures in a effectively overruled carter by allowing a federal employee to seek judicial relief for grievances subject to the negotiated procedures contained in a cba.see id.at.relying on the ordinarily understood meaning of administrative as distinct from judicial,mudge concluded that t he plain language of a as amended is therefore clear while a limits the administrative resolution of a federal employee grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in his or her cba,the text of the statute does not restrict an employee right to seek a judicial remedy for such grievances.id.at.in so holding,this court rejected the court of federal claims reasoning that the broader policies underlying the csra required it to construe the word administrative contrary to this plain meaning.see id.at.accordingly,mudge holds that the court of federal claims in that case erred when it dismissed appellant claim for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that that claim was subject to the negotiated grievance procedures contained in a cba between mudge federal employer and his union.in line with the reasoning set forth in mudge,we hold that the court of federal claims erred in the instant case when it found that it lacked jurisdiction of appellants claims.
we review de novo the court grant,in the alternative,of partial summary judgment in the government favor on the issue of accord and satisfaction.see glass united states.summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine question of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine question of material fact,celotex catrett,d,and the court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the,resolving all doubts in that party favor,liberty lobby,at.
a claim is discharged by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction when some performance different from that which was claimed as due is rendered and such substituted performance is accepted by the claimant as full satisfaction of his claim.case,united states,quoting cmty.heating plumbing kelso,citing brock blevins united states.a valid accord and satisfaction requires four elements proper subject matter competent parties a meeting of the minds of the parties and consideration.see brock blevins,at.in its most common form,an accord and satisfaction exists as a mutual agreement between the parties in which one pays or performs and the other accepts payment or performance in satisfaction of a claim or demand which is a bona fide dispute.half moon mining combined metals reduction,cir.
on appeal,appellants concede that the settlement agreement between the agency and the eleven afge locals,including local,satisfies the four requirements of an accord and satisfaction.relying on the supreme court decision in brooklyn savings bank,however,they argue that the doctrine of accord and satisfaction does not apply to claims brought under the flsa and that the court of federal claims therefore erred in holding that the doctrine barred appellants action.appellants also cite the eleventh circuit decision in lynn food stores for the proposition that employees can not settle back wage claims arising under the flsa without the supervision of either the department of labor dol or a court in the context of a stipulated judgment.because the instant settlement agreement lacked such oversight,appellants assert that the settlement can not compromise their flsa claims or their right to pursue those claims in court.finally,appellants argue that even if the settlement agreement constitutes a valid accord and satisfaction,it is binding only upon the union and not upon the individual employees whom the union represents.
the government responds that the settlement agreement satisfied the four elements required for a valid accord and satisfaction and that the court of claims grant of partial summary judgment was therefore correct.the government argues that appellants reliance on brooklyn savings and lynn food stores is misplaced because those were private sector cases that consequently did not address the compromise of a federal employee flsa rights under the csra.according to the government,the csra authorized the local bargaining unit representatives to release their members flsa claims by first defining the term grievance sufficiently broadly to encompass those claims and then providing for the settlement of such grievances by the locals.the government therefore asserts that the agreement not to arbitrate contained in the settlement agreement between local and the agency precludes appellants from pursuing their flsa claims in court.
we conclude that the parties settlement agreement constitutes a valid accord and satisfaction,and we therefore affirm the court decision granting partial summary judgment in the government favor on the issue.as a preliminary matter,appellants argument that any accord and satisfaction is binding only upon the union and not upon the individual employees lacks merit.appellants do not contest that local is their exclusive bargaining unit representative.see.at.under of the csra,local therefore represents and is entitled to act for appellants.a.section b c i of the csra further provides that local has the right in its own behalf or on behalf of any employee in the unit represented by the exclusive representative,to present and process grievances.id.b c i.appellants cba also asserts this right,stating that t he dla council or its local affiliates has the right to act in its behalf or on the behalf of any employee s to present and process grievances.pursuant to the grievance procedure set forth in the cba,the union acted on behalf of appellants to settle their flsa claims.appellants are therefore bound.
we are similarly unconvinced by appellants reliance on brooklyn savings.in brooklyn savings,the supreme court held that a private employee could not waive or release his flsa rights to liquidated damages.see brooklyn,at.the court therefore concluded that respondents,who had both signed agreements releasing their flsa claims against their employers,were not precluded from bringing suit to recover the remainder of the overtime wages and liquidated damages owed t
