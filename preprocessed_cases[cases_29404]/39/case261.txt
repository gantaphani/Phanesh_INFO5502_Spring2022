plaintiff appellant nyle hooper brings suit under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act fca,against lockheed martin corporation lockheed.the fca permits individuals,known as relators,to file suit on behalf of the united states seeking damages from persons who file false claims for government funds.b.hooper alleges that lockheed defrauded the united states air force under a contract for the range standardization and automation rsa iia program concerning software and hardware used to support space launch operations at vandenberg air force base and cape kennedy.hooper filed his qui tam suit in the district court for the district of maryland,which transferred the suit at lockheed request to the central district of california on forum non conveniens grounds.the california district court granted summary judgment in favor of lockheed on all grounds.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court grant of summary judgment.
relator hooper worked for six years for lockheed.he was hired on april,as a senior research operations engineer and later became a senior project engineer assigned to work on the rsa iia program.on july,hooper was involuntarily terminated after investigating the fraud alleged in his qui tam complaint and after threatening to report the fraud to the government.
on july,hooper filed his qui tam action in maryland against lockheed,asserting causes of action under the qui tam provisions of the fca and under h of the fca for retaliation in employment for activity.in addition,hooper alleges that lockheed violated the fca by knowingly underbidding the contract including undisclosed freeware in software deliverables that did not convey all intellectual property rights and failing to perform all required tests or improperly conducting those tests.
in,the united states air force awarded the rsa iia contract to a predecessor of lockheed the objective of the contract is to automate,standardize,and modernize software and hardware used to support our nation space launch operations at vandenberg air force base western range and cape kennedy eastern range,while also providing continued support for and transition from legacy systems.
the contract is a cost reimbursement plus award fee contract,under which the contractor is not paid a fixed price,but instead is reimbursed for its actual costs and receives periodic award fees based on its overall performance,including spending less money than estimated.the air force concluded that the contract would be a contract because uncertainties inherent in the requirements render attempts to establish a unrealistic.
at the original contract competition,the air force issued to potential bidders a request for proposal rfp.the rfp laid out six factors that the air force would consider in deciding which company would win the contract.the first four factors management,systems engineering,systems integration,and product development were first and equal in importance.the fifth factor cost was second in importance,but was a significant consideration in the decisional process.the air force informed the offerors that it may select an offer that is not the lowest priced technically acceptable offer,but may instead select a higher priced offer that represented the best value to the government.
three companies responded to the rfp.lockheed initial bid was million,but its best and final offer was million.to compare the three final offers,the air force hired independent consultants to create an independent government estimate.
after conferring with independent consultants,the air force drafted a memorandum summarizing the bid process.the memorandum concludes,in relevant part,as follows 
lockheed cost estimating and risk analysis practices were assessed for compatibility with the technical approach and for the probable accuracy of the methodologies employed the assessment found that lockheed employed realistic methods but was optimistic about some of the inputs to the methodology,resulting in an overstated potential for cost savings.lockheed risk analysis was found to be unrealistic the methodology employed is sound in theory,but the inputs severity of certain risks are understated,so the total risk is understated.also,technical risks are not explicitly quantified,as specified in the rfp.however,defects in the risk analysis were not considered a discriminator,since the risk analysis accounted for only a portion of one of the cost factors.overall,lockheed was found realistic for this factor.
in its summary,the air force stated that although lockheed did not submit the lowest bid,lockheed bid provided the best overall value,knowing that it was possible that there were risks that might lead to cost growth beyond target cost.the air force concluded that the risk potential is acceptable and determined that a fair and reasonable price was obtained without reliance on certified cost or pricing data.accordingly,the air force awarded lockheed the rsa iia contract.lockheed has been paid more than million for its work on the rsa iia contract.hooper did not work for lockheed when lockheed proposal was prepared or when the air force awarded lockheed the rsa iia contract.
lockheed employee mike allen,one of the individuals who prepared cost estimates for the rsa iia program,testified that lockheed employees were instructed to lower their estimates without regard to actual costs.although allen did not see the final bid,he saw some of the workups that they had done in the bidding process.he concluded that the inputs used to compute the final bid were based on bad,bad guesses but were not false.
after winning the contract,lockheed sent the air force a series of seven letters in which lockheed disclosed its use of software to be provided with less than unlimited rights disclosure letters.this software,also referred to as foss,is freely downloadable open source software from which the source code is available for use,study,reuse,modification,enhancement,and redistribution by the users of that software.foss can be downloaded at no charge,but comes with license restrictions which are generally aimed at preserving the free and open nature of the particular foss product.the disclosure letters listed a description of the software,the name of the manufacturer,the product in which it is used,the intended use,and the software license type.the letters also requested that the air force review the identified items,and provide its concurrence with lockheed use of them.
the air force contracting officer issued responses to these disclosure letters and approved each use of the disclosed foss.for example,in its june,response letter,the government stated that the government hereby acknowledges and approves the use of the subject software by lockheed and t he government believes this discretion to be within the current contractual requirements,estimated costs,and terms and conditions.
marilyn washington,the air force contracting officer for the rsa iia program from,testified that she interacted daily with lockheed personnel on the rsa iia program.as contracting officer,she was required to respond to lockheed disclosure letters.relying on air force deputy program manager cory pike,she responded to the lockheed disclosure letters approving the use of the foss items listed in the letter.at no point during her tenure as contracting officer on the rsa iia contract did washington recall anyone ever saying that foss was not permissible under the contract.nor was she aware of any violations by lockheed martin under the rsa iia contract.washington did not believe that there was any obligation under the rsa iia contract that required lockheed to disclose the use of freeware at any time.
pike stated that he interacted daily with lockheed regarding the rsa iia program.pike was the air force person in charge of coordinating the air force assessment of the use or incorporation of foss.he stated that the air force employed independent contractors to provide the air force with assessments of various technical issues under the rsa iia contract,including technical assessments about the use of foss.pike provided the independent assessments and his own recommendation to washington,who formally approved the use of the disclosed foss.he stated that he never had any reason to believe that lockheed martin should have made its foss disclosures at some earlier point in time.pike also said that the air force,at all times,had the opportunity and option to make changes to exclude the use of foss if it had deemed such changes necessary.the air force did not deem any such changes necessary or important.
at his deposition,hooper admitted that he does not know if there is any particular contract provision,air force mandate,standard,or any other requirement that dictates the timing of the disclosure of the use of foss in the rsa iia contract.he further admitted that his claim regarding the air force fraudulent use of foss was based on guesswork and google searches.
lockheed invited the air force and its consultants to observe its rsa iia program testing.the air force consultants had keys to lockheed facilities,and some air force consultants had offices in those facilities.the air force and its consultants reviewed and commented on test plans and procedures,discussed testing verification methods,reviewed test reports,and witnessed testing.
hooper was not involved with testing for the rsa iia program.he admitted that he has no personal knowledge to support his allegation that lockheed martin had a practice of not performing of testing.he also admitted that his allegations based on testing are predicated on information provided to him by two other lockheed employees.
proceedings 
on july,hooper filed his qui tam action under the fca against lockheed,asserting causes of action under the qui tam provisions of the fca and under h of the fca for retaliation in employment for activity.hooper originally filed his complaint in the district court for the district of maryland.while the case was pending in maryland district court,the united states declined to intervene in the case.on january,the maryland district court granted lockheed motion to transfer the case to the central district of california on forum non conveniens grounds.
on august,the california district court granted lockheed motion to dismiss with leave to amend hooper second amended complaint,except with regard to hooper retaliation claim.as to that claim,the district court dismissed with prejudice,holding that the claim was barred by california statute of limitations.
on september,hooper filed his third amended complaint.in his third amended complaint,hooper alleges that lockheed violated the fca by knowingly underbidding the contract including undisclosed foss in software deliverables that did not convey all intellectual property rights and failing to perform all required tests or improperly conducting those tests.
on november,lockheed moved for summary judgment.lockheed also filed evidentiary objections to hooper factual submissions in support of summary judgment.after hooper filed a response to the motion for summary judgment and the united states filed an amicus curiae brief,the district court granted lockheed motion for summary judgment,ruling that hooper had not presented sufficient evidence of fraudulent underbidding to allow his claim to survive summary judgment hooper claims regarding foss are completely unsupported and there is no evidence to support any fraud in the rsa iia testing.the district court declined to reach lockheed argument that a fraudulent underbid or false estimate can never create liability under the fca.
as noted,hooper brings a claim under h,alleging that he was wrongfully discharged in retaliation for activity.the fca protects whistle blowers from retaliation by their employers because h contains no express limitations period,the court borrows the most closely analogous state statute of limitations.see graham cnty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,d holding that in assessing timeliness of a fca retaliation claim,courts should borrow the most closely analogous state limitations period.hooper argues that the district court should have applied maryland statute of limitations,not california statute.we review de novo the district court determinations with respect to the statute of limitations.lukovsky city of san francisco,cir.
hooper properly filed his case in maryland,where lockheed corporate headquarters are located.the maryland district court granted lockheed motion to transfer the case to the central district of california,on forum non conveniens grounds,under a.
in van dusen barrack,the supreme court held that after a transfer pursuant to a,the transferee district court generally must apply the state law that the transferor district court would have applied had the case not been moved,d.hooper argues that,under van dusen,the california district court,as the transfee court,was required to apply the law that a maryland district court would have applied,including maryland statute of limitations.for the reasons set forth below,we agree that the district court erred in applying california statute of limitations,rather than maryland statute of limitations.
van dusen arose under diversity jurisdiction and the case presented to this court arose under federal question jurisdiction.see id.at.still,van dusen analysis is not wholly inapplicable here.van dusen concluded that a change of venue under a generally should be,with respect to state law,but a change of courtrooms.id.at.the supreme court reasoned that to hold otherwise,a defendant motion to transfer could be tantamount to a motion to dismiss.id.at.following van dusen,the supreme court rendered its decision in ferens john deere,another case that arose under diversity jurisdiction,d.in ferens,the supreme court held 
we reasoned in van dusen that,if the law changed following a transfer initiated by the defendant,a district court would at least be reluctant to grant transfers,despite considerations of convenience,if to do so might conceivably prejudice the claim of a plaintiff.the court,to determine the prejudice,might have to make an elaborate survey of the law,including statutes of limitations,burdens of proof,presumptions,and the like.this would turn what is supposed to be a statute for convenience of the courts into one expending extensive judicial time and resources.because this difficult task is contrary to the purpose of the statute,in van dusen we made it unnecessary by ruling that a transfer of venue by the defendant does not result in a change of law.
id.at citation omitted.
circuits have diverged on the issue of whether van dusen applies to cases arising under federal question jurisdiction with embedded state law issues.in menowitz brown,the second circuit concluded that van dusen was limited to diversity cases and that the choice of a limitations period for a federal cause of action is itself a question of federal law,cir per curiam quoting delcostello int l of teamsters,d see also lanfear home depot,cir howard roadway express,cir.
by contrast,in eckstein balcor film investors,the seventh circuit held that van dusen is not limited to diversity cases,cir.the court reasoned that,w hen the law of the united states is geographically,a transferee court should use the rule of the transferor forum,including when a federal statute leads federal courts to use state law as the basis of a federal period of limitations.id.the normal rule that each court of appeals considers the question independently and reaches its own decision,the court observed,is based on the idea that a single federal law implies a national interpretation.id.at.when federal law is necessarily,as when federal courts use state law as the basis of a federal period of limitations,this justification collapses.id.at.in such situations,requiring federal courts to borrow the limitations periods of the transferee forum runs afoul of van dusen command that a transfer under a accomplishes but a change of courtrooms.id.quoting van dusen,at.federal law is not supposed to be unitary,menowitz,at,when it is borrowing limitations periods from the states,and so applying the law of the transferee forum works a real injustice,because a motion to transfer a properly filed suit can become tantamount to a motion to dismiss.van dusen,at.
following eckstein,in olcott delaware flood,the tenth circuit applied the appropriate limitations period from the transferor court in its sister circuit to a federal statute,cir.the tenth circuit noted that this decision should not be read to imply van dusen and ferens have any broad applicability to federal question jurisdiction generally but,nevertheless,the tenth circuit followed the reasoning of van dusen and ferens in a federal question case to determine the appropriate borrowed statute of limitations.see also in re ford motor,cir noting that,a lthough there is disagreement among the courts on this point,the better view is the seventh circuit in eckstein.
we now join the fifth,seventh,and tenth circuits,in holding that in a case arising under federal question jurisdiction,when a federal statute directs federal courts to borrow the most closely analogous state statute of limitations,a transferee district court must apply the state statute of limitations that the transferor district court would have applied had the case not been transferred on forum non conveniens grounds pursuant to a.therefore,maryland statute of limitations applies.cts.jud.ann.accordingly,we remand hooper h retaliation claim to the district court so that that claim may proceed on the merits 
in his third amended complaint,hooper asserts that lockheed violated the fca by submitting a fraudulently low bid,based on knowing underestimates of its costs,to improve its chances of winning the air force rsa iia contract.lockheed asserts that allegedly false estimates can not be the basis for liability under the fca,because an estimate is a type of opinion or prediction,and thus can not be said to be a false statement within the meaning of the fca.specifically,lockheed argues that estimates of what costs might be in the future are based on inherently judgmental information,and a piece of purely judgmental information is not actionable as a false statement.on this issue alone,the united states filed an amicus brief,urging this court to hold that a false estimate fraudulently low bid may be actionable under the fca 
the fca was enacted during the civil war in response to overcharges and other abuses by defense contractors.united states ex rel.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir.the purpose of the fca was to combat widespread fraud by government contractors who were submitting inflated invoices and shipping faulty goods to the government.united states ex rel.hopper anton,cir.to this end,the fca creates liability for any person who,inter alia,a knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval or b knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.a.
thus,to establish a cause of action under a a,the united states or relator must prove the following elements a false or fraudulent claim that was material to the process which defendant presented,or caused to be presented,to the united states for payment or approval with knowledge that the claim was false or fraudulent.united states bourseau,cir see also united states ex rel.cafasso dyanmics,cir holding that to commit conduct actionable under the fca,one must,in some way,falsely assert entitlement to obtain or retain government money or property.likewise,to establish a cause of action under a b,the united states or a relator must show that defendants knowingly made,used,or caused to be made or used,a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.
although the issue whether fca liability may be premised on false estimates where those false estimates were knowingly made is a matter of first impression for this court,both the first and fourth circuits have held that fca liability may attach in such a situation.their decisions rest heavily on united states ex rel.marcus hess.
in hess,the supreme court found contractors liable under the fca for claims submitted by government contractors that the contractors obtained by collusive bidding.id.at.most courts have interpreted hess to stand for the theory of fca liability.accordingly,many courts,including this court,have applied the fca to bidrigging situations.see united states ex rel hagood sonoma cnty.water agency,cir see also united states dynamics,cir the defendant liable for submitting inflated cost estimates in subcontract submitted for approval by the government.
the fourth circuit has concluded that,under a theory,construing the phrase false or fraudulent claim broadly,fca liability may attach where there is fraud surrounding the efforts to obtain the contract or benefit status,or the payments thereunder.harrison,at.in harrison,the relator alleged that the defendant was liable under the fca because the defendant made several false statements in seeking government approval for a subcontract,pursuant to which the defendant subsequently made claims for payment from the government.id.at.the district court expressly rejected the possibility that fca liability could rest on false statements submitted to the government to gain approval for a subcontract.id.at.but the fourth circuit reversed,holding the district court narrow interpretation of a false or fraudulent claim to be incorrect.id.at.
the fourth circuit held that,after the amendments to the fca,according to congress the fca should be broadly construed.see id.at quoting,at,reprinted in,each and every claim submitted under a contract,loan guarantee,or other agreement which was originally obtained by means of false statements or other corrupt or fraudulent conduct,or in violation of any statute or applicable regulation,constitutes a false claim emphasis added in case.accordingly,the court explicitly rejected the defendant argument that the alleged false statements could not subject it to liability under the fca because they were only estimates.id.at.the fourth circuit reasoned that an opinion or estimate carries with it an implied assertion,not only that the speaker knows no facts which would preclude such an opinion,but that he does know facts which justify it.id.quoting page keeton et,prosser keeton on the law of torts,at ed.
similarly,the first circuit ruled that false statements made by applicants for social security benefits were false statements within the meaning of the fca,even if they were just an expression of the applicants opinions,so long as the applicants knew of facts that would reasonably preclude such an opinion.see united states ex rel.loughren unum group,cir holding that,even if the fact that an allegedly false statement constitutes the speaker opinion,it still may qualify as a false statement for purposes of the fca where the speaker knows facts which would preclude such an opinion.
as a matter of first impression,we conclude that false estimates,defined to include fraudulent underbidding in which the bid is not what the defendant actually intends to charge,can be a source of liability under the fca,assuming that the other elements of an fca claim see are met.
having determined that fca liability may be premised on false estimates,we must now determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether lockheed engaged in fraudulent underbidding.the district court concluded that hooper failed to present sufficient evidence of fraudulent underbidding.the district court noted that hooper relied on extremely limited evidence and that,even interpreting this limited evidence in the light most favorable to hooper,none of it demonstrated that lockheed knowingly submitted a false bid to the air force.
on appeal,hooper argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard and hooper supplied sufficient information for a jury to determine that lockheed acted knowingly in submitting a false bid.because the district court applied the wrong legal standard and that under the correct standard,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to hooper as the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of hooper,genuine issues of material fact exist,lockheed is not entitled to judgment as a matter of la
