the five plaintiffs operate family farm businesses which receive contractual payments from farm programs administered by the united states department of agriculture usda commodity credit corporation ccc.each plaintiff has at least one shareholder,member,or beneficiary who is a delinquent debtor on an agricultural loan administered by the usda.none of the plaintiffs is a delinquent debtor.through administrative offset,the secretary of agriculture took shares of contractual payments owed to the plaintiffs to satisfy delinquent debts owed by the respective individual debtors.in effecting these offsets,the secretary gave notice to the individual debtors of the intent to offset and of available administrative remedies.as a matter of policy,however,the secretary has interpreted the regulations as not requiring such notice to be given to the entities.the plaintiffs contend the secretary no notice policy violates their constitutional rights to due process.the district court did not decide the plaintiffs due process claims nor determine any underlying factual issue,such as whether notice to the individuals could be imputed to the entities.instead,the district court dismissed the entities complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,because of their failure to exhaust administrative remedies under e.
we hold that the exhaustion requirement of e is not jurisdictional.we further hold that exhaustion is excused because the plaintiffs complaint alleges collateral,colorable constitutional claims and attempting to exhaust those claims would be futile.accordingly,we reverse and remand to allow the district court the opportunity to consider the merits of the plaintiffs claims.
because it is relevant to our discussion of the jurisdictional issue,we briefly summarize the undisputed facts regarding the nature of each plaintiff entity,the relationship of the various delinquent debtors to their entities,the notices given,and any administrative appeal efforts.

the district court dismissed this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by e.thus,the first issue we consider is whether the exhaustion requirement of e is a limitation on federal court jurisdiction.this statute provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,a person shall exhaust all administrative appeal procedures established by the secretary of agriculture or required by law before the person may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against 
the secretary 
the department or 
an agency,office,officer,or employee of the department.
a statute that requires exhaustion of administrative remedies may limit the district court subject matter jurisdiction if the exhaustion statute is more than a codified requirement of administrative exhaustion and contains sweeping and direct language that goes beyond a requirement that only exhausted claims be brought.weinberger salfi,d anderson babbitt,cir.however,failure to exhaust does not deprive a federal court of jurisdiction when the exhaustion statute is merely a codification of the exhaustion requirement.rumbles hill,cir.
consistent with the supreme court guidance in weinberger,we have rarely found exhaustion statutes to be a jurisdictional bar.for instance,in anderson,we reviewed the exhaustion requirement of c,which states no decision which at the time of its rendition is subject to appeal to the dire
