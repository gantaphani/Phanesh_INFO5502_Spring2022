indiana michigan power indiana michigan appeals the judgment of the united states court of federal claims,indiana michigan power united states,dismissing its damages claims against the united states department of energy doe or government for breach of contract.we affirm.
background 
this action is one of several filed by the nation nuclear electric utilities in the court of federal claims seeking damages arising from the government failure to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel snf.the general factual background of the contracts and circumstances surrounding snf cases have been well outlined in the trial court opinion,as well as in opinions by this and other courts.see me.yankee atomic power united states.power dep t of energy.therefore,only the facts necessary for an understanding of the issues that give rise to this appeal are discussed.
under the nuclear waste policy act nwpa,title iii,stat,codified at,congress directed doe to enter into standard contracts with all entities that generate or hold title to radioactive waste,or spent nuclear fuel,of domestic origin for the acceptance of title,subsequent transportation,and disposal of such waste or spent fuel in consideration for initial and recurring annual fees,with removal to begin no later than january.seeking to avoid the inefficient and potentially unsafe prospect of allowing individual utilities to recycle or dispose of their own snf,congress enacted the nwpa to establish the federal responsibility,and a definite federal policy,for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel.roedler dep t of energy,quoting b.nuclear plant operators and utilities were mandated by congress to enter into standard contracts,the terms of which are presented at,as a prerequisite to obtaining renewal of their operating licenses.a maine yankee,at the nwpa effectively made entry into such contracts mandatory for the utilities.
on june,indiana michigan entered into a standard contract with doe,under which removal of snf from its bridgman,michigan,nuclear plant was to begin in in,doe announced that it would not begin snf collection until because its planned storage repository would not be ready until then.notice of inquiry,office of civilian radioactive waste management waste acceptance issues.may.one year later,doe asserted that it had neither a statutory nor contractual obligation to accept the utilities nuclear waste in the absence of such repository or temporary storage facility.maine yankee,at citing final interpretation of nuclear waste acceptance.
on june,the utility sued the government for partial breach of the standard contract in the court of federal claims,asking damages for mitigation costs,totaling million,incurred for its through rerack and expansion of its existing snf pool in and and future damages,totaling million,for forecasted investment in the construction of a private storage facility for housing snf not collected by doe by the collection start date.in light of this court decisions holding doe liable for breach of contract in snf cases in maine yankee,at,and northern states power united states,the trial court entered judgment for indiana michigan on the issue of liability on january.power united states.the trial court subsequently denied indiana michigan claimed damages,holding that,because indiana michigan claimed partial versus total breach,recovery for mitigation costs and present recovery for future damages is precluded.indiana michigan appeals,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of federal claims decision de novo for errors of law and for clear error on findings of fact.see glendale fed.bank,fsb united states.a finding may be held clearly erroneous when the appellate court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.in re mark,citations omitted.

indiana michigan argues that its rerack and investment in the temporary holding facility were done to mitigate the government partial breach.the government argues that the only way indiana michigan could recover the costs for its activities would be under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation,a claim it avers indiana michigan has waived.alternatively,it simply argues that the trial court applied the correct rule of law when it announced a per se ban on recovery of mitigation damages for partial breach claims.
we agree with the trial court that indiana michigan is not here alleging anticipatory repudiation of the entire contract,but bases its claim on partial breach.insofar as the government raises its anticipatory breach theory in support of the trial court finding that indiana michigan is not entitled to recovery its argument fails.first,neither the trial record,see indiana michigan.at appellant did not claim anticipatory breach,despite frequent discussions on the issue during trial,nor indiana michigan briefs contain a claim for a total anticipatory breach.second,contrary to the government assertion,the nature of indiana michigan action does not lend itself to the moniker of anticipatory repudiation.an anticipatory repudiation is a renunciation of a contractual duty before the time fixed in the contract for performance.franconia assocs.united states,d emphasis and alteration in original internal quotation and citation omitted.for an aggrieved party to recover damages for an anticipatory repudiation,it must elect to treat the repudiation as a total breach.see id.on the other hand,i f the injured party elects to or is required to await the balance of the other party performance under the contract,its claim is said instead to be one for damages for partial breach.restatement second of contracts cmt.b.a partial breach is a claim for damages based on only part of the injured party remaining rights to performance.id.
here,indiana michigan could not have claimed anticipatory repudiation even if it wanted to while the government did indicate that it would not meet the deadline,its actions did not portend an absolute refusal to perform the contract.the nwpa itself,and the standard contract terms drafted pursuant to it,compelled indiana michigan to bring an action for partial,not total,breach.had indiana michigan brought an action for total breach,doe would have been discharged from further responsibility under the contract,a situation apparently not desired by appellant and foreclosed by statute.the nwpa directed that doe and all nuclear utilities enter into standard contracts,a,and concomitantly conditioned the issuance and renewal of nuclear regulatory commission operating licenses upon the execution of those contracts,id.b a.additionally,the nwpa provided that doe was exclusively responsible for snf collection and disposal in the united states,thereby prohibiting indiana michigan or any other nuclear utility from seeking alternative disposal means.see a,b roedler,at.therefore,indiana michigan had no choice but to hold the government to the terms of the standard contract while suing for partial breach.
while we agree with the trial court that indiana michigan claim is for damages for partial breach,we disagree that costs are per se unrecoverable.in finding damages unrecoverable,the trial court cited coughlin blair,cal d,for the proposition that damages for partial breach are limited to costs incurred from the date of the breach to the time of trial if the breach is partial only,
