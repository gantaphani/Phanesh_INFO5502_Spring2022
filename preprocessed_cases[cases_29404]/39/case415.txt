this case turns on the interpretation of the phrase competitive basis in the workforce investment act wia.see a a.res care,res care appeals the decision of the united states court of federal claims claims court interpreting the statute as permitting the united states department of labor dol to select a contractor for the blue ridge job corps center blue ridge program through a for small businesses.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
under wia,dol administers a national job corps program that provides education,training,and support services to help youth obtain employment.there are job corps centers jccs across the nation,including blue ridge in marion,virginia,which res care has operated since.
in december,dol published a sources sought notice for a request for information the request seeking information from potential bidders on an upcoming procurement for the operation of blue ridge.at the time,res care was operating blue ridge under a contract that expired on march.the request invited a ll interested parties to submit a response but specifically encouraged firms that qualify as small businesses to respond with a capabilities statement that demonstrated their ability to operate the facility successfully.in response to the request,one large business and four small businesses submitted capabilities statements.res care,a large business,did not respond to the request.
based on the responses,a dol contracting officer found the large business and two of the four small businesses capable of operating blue ridge.in her review,the contracting officer considered twelve relevant areas of experience and the financial resources of each business.she specifically found that both small businesses were capable under all of the capability areas identified in the request.in particular,she found that,based on the responses from the two capable small businesses,dol would likely receive bids from at least two responsible small businesses and at fair market prices.because both of these requirements of federal acquisition regulation far,b the rule of two,had been met,the contracting officer recommended conducting the blue ridge contract selection as a small business.dol subsequently issued a presolicitation notice indicating that the next blue ridge contract,with a value of million,would be solicited as a set aside for small business for the base period beginning april,with three unilateral option years.
on april,res care filed its bid protest with the claims court alleging,inter alia,that dol violated wia by setting aside the blue ridge contract for small businesses section of wia describes how entities are selected for managing jccs.a a.it provides that dol shall select entities on a competitive basis,but enumerates certain exceptions set forth in a c of the competition in contracting act cica.id.the exceptions in a c describe instances in which the government may award a contract on a noncompetitive basis.res care argued that setting aside the blue ridge contract for small businesses violated the competitive basis provision in.
before the claims court,res care sought to supplement the administrative record with a declaration of its executive vice president of operations,richard myers the first myers declaration,and with a report entitled analysis of small business contracting in job corps the rell doran report.based on assorted criteria,the report concluded that large businesses outperform small businesses in administering jccs.the claims court denied res care request to supplement the administrative record with the rell doran report but admitted the first myers declaration for the sole purpose of evaluating whether res care was entitled to injunctive relief.res care,united states,c,slip.op.at.july.
on the parties for judgment on the administrative record the claims court denied res care motion and granted the government motion,dismissing the case.the court determined that the phrase competitive basis in wia did not mean full and open competition,reasoning that the ordinary meaning of the phrase simply requires two or more potential bidders to seek the contract award.res care,united states,fed.cl.on that basis,the court concluded that wia did not preclude small business in which two or more small businesses compete for a jcc contract id.the court also found that the contracting officer did not violate the rule of two in setting aside blue ridge for small businesses.id.at.
res care now appeals to this court,reiterating its contention that wia does not permit small business.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
we review the grant of a motion for judgment on the administrative record without deference.bannum,united states.the first question before this court is one of pure statutory interpretation whether wia competitive basis language permits small business.because the underlying issue is a question of statutory interpretation,it is also subject to review without deference.mudge united states.
the relevant language of states 
except as provided in subsections a to c of section of title,the secretary shall select on a competitive basis an entity to operate a job corps center and entities to provide activities described in this subchapter to the jobs corps center.
a a emphasis added.
when interpreting a statute,we begin our analysis with the language of the statute itself.info.tech.applications united states.if the statutory language is plain and unambiguous,then it controls,and we may not look to the agency regulation for further guidance.id.citing chevron,at.the meaning of the language is determined in the pertinent overall statutory context.bank of or.indep.ins.agents.
to interpret the term competitive basis,we presume that the term has its ordinary and established meaning.see info,at.as wia does not define competitive basis,we may refer to dictionary definitions to determine the ordinary meaning of an undefined statutory term.id.competitive is defined as characterized by,arising from,or designated to exhibit rivalry among two or more equally matched individuals or forces especially for a particular goal,position or reward,and as involving,or determined by competition.see res care,fed.cl.at quoting webster ii new riverside.dict.competition means a rivalry between two or more businesses striving for the same customers or market.id.neither definition mandates an unencumbered contest open to the entire realm of all possible bidders authorized selection criteria may circumscribe the range of permitted rivals.here,congress clearly viewed the use of for small businesses as competitive as indicated by the cica.see b providing that competitive procedures shall be used for small business defining competitive procedures to include competition limited to further small business act.a selection process confined to multiple small businesses bidding to operate a jcc thus satisfies the statutory competitive basis requirement.
res care argues for an alternate construction of this language.in res care view,wia must be read in conjunction with cica,which requires full and open competition in the government procurement process,e xcept as provided in sections,a,and of title.see a.those three exceptions contemplate a small business exception to cica full and open competition requirement b,examples where the government may use noncompetitive procedures,and simplified procedures for small purchases.because wia incorporates only one exception from cica and no others,such as b authorization of small business,res care argues that the plain meaning of wia dictates that is the only exception allowed by the statute.under that interpretation,dol would lack the flexibility and discretion to use small business in administering wia and instead must always hold full,open,and unfettered competition among all possible competitors except in the very special cases when applies.
wia plain language,however,requires rejection of res care argument.in,congress did not borrow the full and open competition phrase from cica.instead,simply states that selection of a jcc contractor shall occur on a competitive basis.a cardinal doctrine of statutory interpretation is the presumptio
