background 
this is a bid protest action challenging the legality of bean performance of dredging operations under corps solicitation no.the contract.bean is a limited liability company organized under delaware law.bean is owned by bean dredging,a company,and owned by stuyvesant dredging sdc,which is in turn wholly owned by a dutch corporation.thus,bean is foreign owned.the meridian is a dredge owned by a company,bean meridian bean meridian,and is documented under ch.hopper dredges are vessels that pump dredged material from the channel floor and store the material in containers called hoppers aboard the vessel.vessels are unable to store the dredged material on board the dredged material must be piped to a separate vessel or location.
on august,the corps issued bid solicitation no.for dredging in the vicinity of morehead city inner harbor,north carolina.because of environmental concerns,the placement of dredged material on the beaches was to be completed between november and april.bean was the low bidder,and proposed performing the work using the meridian,a dredging vessel chartered from bean meridian.norfolk was the second lowest bidder.
norfolk filed an expedited bid protest action in the court of federal claims challenging the legality of intervenor bean performance of the dredging operations in alleged violation of the terms of of the oceans act of.the parties agreed that bean should be initially awarded the contract,subject to termination in the event the court of federal claims should find that bean was not eligible to perform.

ii.analysis 
statutory construction 
the oceans act of the act changed the law regarding the chartering of dredging vessels in waters.the act required that a charterer of a dredging vessel in waters be at least owned by citizens.oceans act of,a,pub,stat,codified at app.a citing the domestic ownership requirements of app.however,the act included the following exceptions to this basic rule 
the amendment does not apply to 
a i the vessel stuyvesant,official number 
ii any other hopper dredging vessel documented under chapter of title,united states code before the effective date of this act and chartered to stuyvesant dredging company or to an entity in which it has an ownership interest however,this exception expires on december,or when the vessel stuyvesant ceases to be documented under chapter,whichever first occurs and 
iii any other dredging vessel documented under chapter and chartered to stuyvesant dredging company or to an entity in which it has an ownership interest,as is necessary a to fulfill dredging obligations under a specific contract,including any extension periods or b as temporary replacement capacity for a vessel which has become disabled but only for so long as the disability shall last and until the vessel is in a position to fully resume dredging operations however,this exception expires on december,or when the vessel stuyvesant ceases to be documented under chapter,whichever first occurs 
id.a,codified at app.note respectively,exceptions a i,a ii and a iii.
it is undisputed that bean,the charterer of the vessel meridian,was owned by sdc,a foreign enterprise,and thus is prohibited from chartering vessels for dredging in waters under the terms of app.a.norfolk ii.at.the parties principally dispute whether bean falls into one of the statutory exceptions a i,ii,or iii enumerated in the note to app.the applicability of exception a iii pertaining to dredges is principally contested.
the court of federal claims found that the three statutory exceptions in a i iii relating to the vessel stuyvesant,hopper vessels,and vessels in a of the act,were amenable to construction based on their plain meaning.norfolk ii.at.the court concluded that the only construction that gives effect to all of the conditions set forth in the exception and reads all of subsections a i,ii,and iii together was the following 
under subsection a iii,stuyvesant dredging company or an entity in which it has an interest can utilize any,even if not yet built,to fulfill contracts entered into utilizing stuyvesant or any other qualified hopper.in other words,the would be supplemental to the dredging activities involving hoppers.also,a so chartered can be used as a temporary replacement for a hopper or a.the latter event would occur when a contract is being performed only by a hopper or a that has become disabled.
id.at.the court later noted that 
a n arrangement would satisfy exception a iii only if the chartered vessel is necessary to fulfill dredging obligations under a specific contract,supplementing a hopper vessel documented as of,including any extension periods,or to complete temporary replacement of a hopper or performing a hopper contract.
id.at quoting oceans act of,a a iii emphasis added.
appellants argue that the court of federal claims erred in interpreting the statute such that bean chartering of the dredge meridian did not fall into exception a iii.they allege that the court of federal claims statutory interpretation is at odds with the structure of the exceptions in app.note.according to appellants,exception a i applies to the vessel stuyvesant itself exception a ii applies to any other hopper dredging vessel and exception a iii applies to any other dredging vessel.because these clauses are separated by,appellants argue that the three numbered clauses are independent.they argue that the court of federal claims impermissibly read limitations into the plain and unambiguous statutory language of exception a iii,specifically that the dredges must be documented before the effective date of the act,and that utilized dredges must be supplemental to the dredging activity involving hoppers.appellants contend that if congress had intended exception a iii to apply only to dredges documented as of,the date the act was enacted,it could have said so explicitly,just as it specified in exception a ii.they argue that tying all three exceptions to the operation of hopper vessels was erroneous.
norfolk responds that the court of federal claims properly interpreted the plain language of the statute.it argues that the statute was intended to exempt vessels,not companies,and was intended to provide for the continued availability of the vessel stuyvesant,not sdc.contra
