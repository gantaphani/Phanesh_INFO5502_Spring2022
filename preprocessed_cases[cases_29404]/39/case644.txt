background 
on march,the air force issued solicitation and request for proposals no.r rfp to obtain a contract for professional services in support of its space warfare center.the winning contractor was to examine,assess and develop means of integrating national intelligence assets with the department of defense space systems,in order to enhance combat and research and development capabilities at the space warfare center.the air force intended to make an award to one lead contractor,which would perform overall program management and integration,operations support,systems engineering and analysis,and other work related to the space warfare center.the term of performance was to be twelve months,beginning on october,with seven options.
under the rfp,the contract was to be awarded to an offeror who gives the government the greatest confidence that it will best meet the requirements affordably.rfp at.in accordance with a a and b,the rfp also disclosed all the significant factors and significant subfactors that the agency reasonably expect ed to consider,and their relative importance.a a b rfp at.
itac,rsis and a third offeror submitted timely proposals in response to the rfp.all three proposals anticipated that some of the work would be performed by subcontractors.rsis proposal relied heavily on the role of its subcontractors,which were to perform at least of the work on the contract.
the air force sent various evaluation notices ens to all three offerors.these evaluation notices were brief letters to the offerors requesting additional information regarding their proposals.the air force sent three ens to itac,five ens to rsis,and three ens to the third offeror.at issue in this case are ens,and,which the air force sent to rsis after the offerors had submitted past performance information,but before the due date for the other parts of the proposals.the ens at issue sought additional information to verify relevant past performance for the lead and support roles of at least ten subcontractors that rsis listed in its proposal.en.the air force sent ens to the other bidders requesting additional information on their subcontractors as well the disputed ens were labeled far a clarification s and included the notice,please note that this clarification does not constitute oral discussions with the offeror.en,referring to a.
rsis responded to the ens on may,explaining which parts of the project each subcontractor would support and detailing the subcontractors relevant experience with regard to those tasks.for example,in response to en,rsis responded,subcontractor aerojet has developed and integrated the and the jtags ir missile warning processing systems into the tactical missile warning operational architecture,similarities to contract requirements,v,and v.rsis response to evaluation notice.
the air force gave both itac and rsis an overall exceptional rating for their past performance experience.proposal analysis report for rfp r,july.the air force determined that prior contracts of rsis and its subcontractors were relevant to their ability to perform the space warfare center contract.
the air force performed an independent most probable cost analysis on the proposals submitted by rsis and the third bidder.the most probable cost analysis was an independent analysis of the bidder estimated cost for reasonableness and realism.rfp at.the air force assess ed the compatibility of the overall proposed costs with the scope of effort to be performed.id.the air force did not perform a most probable cost analysis on itac proposal,because its evaluation team found that itac proposed hours were so minimal and unrealistic that it was infeasible to perform an adequate analysis.source selection decision document at.as a result of this independent analysis performed with respect to rsis and the third bidder,the air force increased the estimated labor hours for rsis and the third bidder,after determining that additional hours were required in each labor category to successfully perform the effort.info.tech.applications united states,c,slip op.at.there is no suggestion that these adjustments resulted from rsis responses to the disputed 
on july,the air force announced its decision to award the contract to rsis.in its source selection decision document,the air force explained that all three proposals were rated equally for program management and integration and for past performance which was the subject of the disputed ens,and that these were not,therefore,discriminating factors.source selection decision document at.the air force determined that although a ll offerors provided proposals which met minimum contract requirements,and all proposals were fundamentally sound,key discriminators were made in mission capability,proposal risk,and.id.at.rsis performed higher than itac in the categories of mission capability and proposal risk.id.at.in the area of,the air force found,rsis provided the lowest overall price for the written task order and provided the best overall price to the government.id.at.the air force concluded 
in summary,rsis offered an excellent proposal with lower risk and several innovative approaches to improve efficiency of swc operations that were deemed to be beneficial to the government.as a result,the rsis proposal provided the overall best value to the government.based on my integrated assessment that the rsis proposal provided a better technical and lower risk offer,i direct the award to rs information systems.
id.because was one of the categories in which rsis scored higher than itac,the refusal of the air force to conduct a most probable cost analysis of itac proposal or make a similar adjustment to its labor hours to make them more realistic is alleged to have been a significant factor in itac not winning the contract.
on august,itac filed a bid protest with the general accounting office gao.the gao denied the bid protest and the air force awarded the contract to rsis on november.
on november,itac filed this bid protest in the court of federal claims.among the grounds for the bid protest was itac contention that the air force conducted discussions with rsis by virtue of the ens it sent to rsis,but failed to conduct discussions with itac,in violation of and.itac argued that it was impermissible for the air force to engage in discussions with rsis regarding the weaknesses and deficiencies in rsis past performance part of its proposal,and then hide sic from itac the perceived weakness and deficiencies in its cost proposal resulting in the air force declining to conduct a most probable cost analysis with respect to itac.at quoting plaintiff consolidated reply of.itac contended that the air force thereby improperly opened discussions with rsis without holding discussions with all bidders.the theory was that if discussions had been opened,itac would have had the opportunity to cure the weaknesses in its proposal.
the ability of the contracting officer to conduct discussions is governed by both statute and regulation.under d and b a,an agency may award a contract after discussions with the offerors or based on proposals received and without discussions with the offerors.d b a.if the agency decides to hold discussions,however,it first must establish a competitive range comprised of all the most highly rated proposals.c.in order to determine the competitive range,the agency may engage in communications with the offerors,which are defined as exchanges,between the government and offerors,after receipt of proposals,leading to establishment of the competitive range.b.
if the agency decides to award the contract after holding discussions,it must hold discussions with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range.d a b a i.however,the agency may hold discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification with one or more offerors.d b b a ii.the procurement regulations define clarifications as limited exchanges,between the government and offerors,that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.a.
on december,the court of federal claims denied the bid protest,granting the government motion for summary judgment on the administrative record.at.contrary to itac contention,the court determined that the air force had not conducted discussions.id.at.the court reasoned that section d contemplates that discussions will occur after a determination of the competitive range of proposals has been made,and in the context of offerors having the opportunity to revise their proposals.the court determined that,because the agency did not intend to allow offerors to revise their proposals and had not made a determination of the competitive range,none of the ens constituted discussions.id.at.the court concluded that the ens were either clarifications,under section a,or communications,under section b,and that the agency did not therefore improperly hold discussions with only one bidder.id.at.the court also rejected the other grounds of the bid protest.

discussion 
we review the grant or denial of motions for summary judgment upon the administrative record without deference.advanced data concepts,united states.we reapply the arbitrary and capricious standard of section of the administrative procedure act to the air force procurement decision.see impresa construzioni geom.domenico garufi united states,holding that b,by its plain terms and according to its legislative history,applies the administrative procedure act standard of review previously applied by the district courts quoting conf,at.consequently,our inquiry is whether the air force procurement decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
in order to establish standing,itac must show that it is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract,that itac was an interested party,prejudiced by the award to rsis.am.fed of gov t employees united states,cert.denied,d.the court of federal claims did not decide the question of prejudice,because it determined that there was no error in the procurement process,stating that,i f the court finds error,the court then examines whether the error was prejudicial to plaintiff.at emphasis added.this approach was erroneous.in fact,because the question of prejudice goes directly to the question of standing,the prejudice issue must be reached before addressing the merits.as we said in myers,prejudice or injury is a necessary element of standing.at.
to establish prejudice,itac must show that there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award but for the alleged error in the procurement process.alfa laval separation,united states,citation omitted.in other words,the protestor chance of securing the award must not have been insubstantial.see am.fed n,at impresa,at.here itac argues that the award to rsis should be set aside on a variety of grounds.if itac were successful,the award would be set aside,and itac might secure it.itac also argues that the air force improperly failed to conduct discussions with itac and that,if it had,itac would have been able to cure deficiencies in its bid.there is no question here that itac was a qualified bidder and that its proposal would have been improved and its chances of securing the contract increased if the problem with its cost estimate had been cured.the air force decision letter stated that a ll offerors provided proposals which met minimum contract requirements and all proposals were fundamentally sound.source selection decision document at.under these circumstances,itac has established prejudice and therefore standing,because it had greater than an insubstantial chance of securing the contract if successful on the merits of the bid protest.
the appellant primary argument,and the only argument worthy of extended treatment,is that the air force violated the statute and regulations by holding discussions with rsis and not with the appellant.
the statute provides,in part 
an executive agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in accordance with subsection a of this section and may award a contract 
a after discussions with the offerors,provided that written or oral discussions have been conducted with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range or 
b based on the proposals received and without discussions with the offerors other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification 
d.substantively identical language appears in b a.the purpose of the rule that the government may not hold discussions with only one bidder is to prevent a bidder from gaining an unfair advantage over its competitors by making its bid more favorable to the government in a context where the other bidders have no opportunity to do so.data johnson.the government contends that the ens in question did not constitute discussions,but rather were clarifications.
in order to construe the meaning of the terms discussion and minor clarification in the statute,we begin with an analysis of the language of the statute itself.int l bus.machs.united states,cert.denied,d.if the statutory language is plain and unambiguous,then it controls,and we may not look to the agency regulation for further guidance.chevron,natural res.def.council,d gallegos principi.because neither nor defines the terms minor clarification or discussion,we assume that the terms have their ordinary,established meaning,for which we may consult dictionaries.pesquera mares australes ltda united states,int l bus,at.
the relevant dictionary definitions are as follows.
discussion is defined as,consideration of a question in open usu.informal debate argument for the sake of arriving at truth or clearing up difficulties.webster international dictionary webster.webster defines to clarify in the relevant sense alternatively as,to free the mind or understanding of confusion,doubt,or uncertainty to explain clearly make understandable and to make less complex or less ambiguous put in order.id.at.webster defines minor in the relevant sense alternatively as,a inferior in importance comparatively unimportant lower in standing or reputation than others of the same kind b being the less important of two things.id.at.
although these definitions make clear that discussions are more substantial communications than minor clarifications,none of these various definitions serves to illuminate with any precision which specific exchanges of information constitute discussions,and which exchanges constitute minor clarifications.the existence of alternative dictionary definitions of a term,or the failure of dictionary definitions to provide a plain and unambiguous meaning of statutory language,indicates that the statute is open to interpretation.passenger boston me,d.where,as here,an agency has adopted a regulation by rulemaking,the chevron standard of deference applies to that regulation.united states haggar apparel,d pesquera mares australes,at.in such a case,we must defer to a properly promulgated regulation,if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.gallegos,at.
