background 
since,the department of education education has contracted with private collection agencies for services related to resolving defaulted student loans through the general services administration gsa federal supply schedule for financial and business solutions.see federal acquisition regulation far subpart.the federal supply schedule program is directed and managed by gsa and provides federal agencies see with a simplified process for obtaining commercial supplies and services at prices associated with volume buying.far.the gsa federal supply schedule contracts at issue are indefinite delivery,indefinite quantity contracts with the government.this type of contract allows agencies like education to order supplies and services in a streamlined process because the contractors are and must publish their pricing and terms for each type of supply or service called a special item number.see far a,b.orders placed against gsa schedule contracts are considered to be issued using full and open competition even though they are not subject to far part,which prescribes procedures for most negotiated contracts.far a.
in,education issued a request for quotations rfq for debt collection services under special item number seeking to issue task orders to contractors under the existing gsa schedule contract.the rfq contained a detailed statement of work explaining the required activities and standards applicable to collection on defaulted student loans and detailed how the contractors would be evaluated.the rfq also explained that the task order would include a base term and options periods but that the total term of performance under the rfq would not exceed months 
the ordering period for the task orders will be from the date of award through march,and an additional option period of up to months.the total ordering period will not exceed months from the date of the task order award.this is not a multiyear contract as defined in far sub part.
pioneer,enterprise,and various other agencies holding gsa schedule contracts with education submitted proposals.in,education awarded identical task orders pursuant to the rfq to pioneer,enterprise,and twenty other contractors.the task orders contained all of the standard contract details and material terms price,duration,obligations,and various other clauses as set forth in the rfq though some of those terms changed from the rfq.
the parties agree that the task orders contain a base term and that section of each task order sets forth an option that permits the government to unilaterally extend the term of the task order pursuant to that option up to months for a total ordering period base term optional extensions that does not exceed months 
far,option to extend the term of the task order march tailored 
a the government may extend the term of this task order 
b if the government exercises this option,the extended task order shall be considered to include this option clause.
c the total duration of the first ordering period of performance of this task order,including the exercise of any optional ordering periods under this clause,shall not exceed months from the date of contract award,excluding any award term s earned.
d the government may,at its discretion,exercise option periods of up to months,provided that the total task order period of performance does not exceed months from the date of the award.
this option in the task order parallels the far which it expressly cites.it is undisputed that if the government exercises an option under to extend the task order,no new task order is issued.see.section far option to extend services similarly permits the government to unilaterally require continued performance under the task order for up to additional months.this extension provision likewise parrots the language of the far which it expressly cites.education exercised its options under sections and for both pioneer and enterprise,unilaterally extending their task orders to february,and april,respectively.
each task order also included a clause entitled award term extension,which provided that the contractor could earn extensions in addition to the base period and any options exercised pursuant to sections and 
the contractor may earn performance extensions hereinafter called award terms,based upon the quality of performance during the evaluation periods.if the contractor has an average contractor performance and continuous surveillance cpcs rating of or greater over the life of the task order,or the last cpcs periods whichever is shorter,the government may award the contractor an extension in accordance with the terms of this clause in recognition of the contractor excellent or better quality performance.
section also specified that a ny award term extensions awarded under this clause will be executed in the form of a new task order issued by the contracting officer under the contractor then current gsa schedule contract.
in december,education began secretly auditing the contractors based on recommendations by the government accountability office for improved oversight.reviewers from education listened to roughly one hundred phone calls that each contractor made to defaulted borrowers and counted the number of times the contractor violated consumer protection laws.education then calculated an error rate for each contractor based on the number of phone calls containing at least one violation.based on their error rates,education decided not to issue task orders to pioneer or enterprise even though they scored excellent or better under the cpcs system.
on february,education notified pioneer and enterprise of its decision not to issue task orders to them.one day later,education notified five other contractors collectively,the competitors that it intended to issue task orders to them for a period not to exceed a specified number of months.these letters,titled notification of award term extension and each signed by the contracting officer,expressly stated if the contract is extended pursuant to,it will be accomplished via a contracting action,which will specifically identify all of the terms and conditions.emphasis added.
in march,pioneer and enterprise filed suit against the government in the court of federal claims,based on,inter alia,education proposed issuance of extensions under to the competitors.the complaints alleged that the court of federal claims had jurisdiction over the claims under the tucker act,b.the competitors intervened as defendants and they,along with the government,argued that the court of federal claims lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the court of federal claims dismissed the complaints.pioneer and enterprise appeal.we have jurisdiction under a.
