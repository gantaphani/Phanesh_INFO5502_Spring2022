plaintiffs filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.they sought to enjoin the air force from applying the cafeteria priority provision of the rs act to the mess hall services.they also sought a declaratory judgment that the rs act applies only to vending facility concessions and may not be applied to procurement contracts for military mess halls confers no authority on the department of education to regulate military procurement through application to military mess halls and does not constitute an exception to the open competition requirements of the competition in contracting act cica.on for summary judgment,the district court held that the provisions of the rs act applied to the award of the contract,and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of the secretaries and the intervenors,and denied it to the plaintiffs.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the interpretation of the rs act by the department of education doe is not entitled to deference,the rs act does not apply here because the kafb mess hall is not a vending facility,and rs does not qualify under cica as an exception to the requirement for full and open competition.our jurisdiction arises under and we affirm.
background 
statutory overview 
the two statutory schemes at issue in this case are the act,and the act.though employing slightly different approaches,both statutes are designed with the express purpose of providing opportunities for remunerative employment to blind or severely handicapped members of the community.the rs act provides that blind vendors shall have priority to operate vending facilities on federal property when such facilities are deemed necessary or desirable by the department or agency controlling the property on which the facility is to be located.the amendments extend this prescription to ensure that wherever feasible,one or more vending facilities are established on all federal property to the extent that any such facility would not adversely affect the interests of the united states.id.b.the rs act defines vending facilities as automatic vending machines,cafeterias,snack bars,cart services,shelters and such other appropriate auxiliary equipment necessary for the sale of articles or services.id.the statute vests the department of education,in the person of the commissioner of rehabilitative services commissioner,with the authority to promulgate rules and regulations,giving force and effect to the provisions of the statute,including the authority to designate state licensing agencies slas,which are authorized to license blind individuals to operate vending facilities on federal property.see id.the rs act defines federal property to include any building,land,or other real property owned,leased,or occupied by any department,agency or instrumentality of the united states including the department of defense and the united states postal service.id.
the jwod act establishes the committee for purchase from people who are blind or severely disabled the committee.the primary objective of the committee is to provide training and employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have severe disabilities.nish cohen,cir.under the jwod act,the committee is charged with creating and maintaining a procurement list of goods or services offered for sale by any qualifying agency for the blind or the severely handicapped.a.the committee is further charged with determining a market price for such goods or services,and promulgating other regulations governing the sale and delivery of such items.id.d.pursuant to the statute,any government agency determining a need for any goods or services on the procurement list must afford priority to a qualifying agency.id.d.
kirtland mess hall contract 
prior to october,the mess hall at kirtland air force base was operated directly by the military and was staffed primarily by government employees.certain auxiliary services,however,such as cleaning and busing,were not provided by military personnel,but by civilian workers under contract.in this case,because these services were on the procurement list promulgated by the committee,they were contracted to plaintiff rci,a qualified agency,in compliance with the provisions of jwod.in october,however,the air force decided to contract out the entire mess hall operation.only well after this decision was made and the contracting process had already progressed to advanced stages did the air force determine the applicability of the rs act to this contract.this determination was based on the doe definition of the term cafeteria as well as on memoranda from the commissioner and from the department of defense general counsel office,both expressing the view that the provisions of the rs act apply to military mess halls.
on september,selrico services,submitted a bid under the rs act on behalf of the nmcb for the provision of mess hall services to begin upon expiration of the contract with rci.this bid was accepted and the contract for mess hall services was subsequently awarded to intervenors nmcb.plaintiff nish,the central agency designated by the committee pursuant to c,joins rci in bringing this appeal challenging the determination by the air force that the mess hall at kirtland air force base constitutes a vending facility and,as such,is subject to the terms of the rs act.

military mess halls are vending facilities and chevron deference 
we first address plaintiffs contentions that military mess halls are not vending facilities within the meaning of the rs act,and the subsequent contention that interpretive rulings issued by the doe relating to mess halls are not entitled to deference.because we believe the latter is dependent upon the success of the former,we deal with them together.
plaintiffs argue that the doe views on the meaning of rs act are not entitled to deference.in chevron,natural resources defense council,d,the court set forth a test for determining whether an agency interpretation is entitled to deference.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear that is the end of the matter i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.see united states haggar apparel,d seneca cayuga tribe of indian gaming comm n,cir.
the court in chevron stressed that the power of a court to review agency interpretation of the statute is not a license for the court to impose its own policy or logistical preferences for those of the agency.we have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer,and the principle of deference to administrative interpretations has been consistently followed by this court.chevron,at.footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.though a reviewing court may find an agency interpretation imprudent or a poor policy choice,if it derives from a reasonable construction of the statute,the court is bound to respect it.
plaintiffs claim that the district court the chevron analysis by deferring to the agency interpretation without a proper determination of clear congressional intent.the face of the statute,plaintiffs claim,indicates a clear congressional intent to limit application of the rs act to vending facilities.at oral argument,plaintiffs urged us to adopt a definition requiring such facilities to be place s where a private individual runs a business selling goods and services to the public for profit.according to plaintiffs,because mess halls do not sell goods or services to the general public but simply serve to fulfill the military function of supplying meals to troops,they are not vending facilities within this definition therefore,there is no need to proceed to the second step of the chevron analysis.
in support of this position,plaintiffs offer several arguments.first,they argue that in reading the statute we should employ the two related canons of statutory interpretation known as ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis.the former holds that when general words follow specific words in a statute the meaning of the general words should be limited by the content and meaning of the specific words.see circuit city stores,adams,d.
noscitur a sociis is also used to limit the disruptive potential of overly broad or general terms in a statute.see jarecki searle,d.the maxim noscitur a sociis is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the acts of congress.singer,statutes and statutory construction if the legislative intent or meaning of a statute is not clear,the meaning of doubtful words may be determined by reference to their relationship with other associated words and phrases.
employment of these interpretive aids is necessary,plaintiffs claim,in order to give effect to the clearly expressed intention of congress to limit application of the rs act to concessions.specifically,plaintiffs point to various portions of legislative history to demonstrate that in passing the amendments to the rs act,congress did not intend to authorize the expenditure of funds for anything more than administrative costs.plaintiffs also cite various agency interpretations appearing to support the idea that congress intended to limit the scope of the rs act to concessions.accordingly,plaintiffs claim that in construing the rs act,the term cafeterias must be subordinated to the term vending facilities,and thus only those cafeterias which are in fact vending facilities may come within the purview of the statute.
ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis,however,while useful tools in statutory interpretation,are not necessarily deemed conclusive.circuit city,at.as a general rule,statutory language is to be interpreted according to the common meaning of the terms employed.our analysis of statutory construction must begin with the language of the statute itself,bread political action comm.fed.election comm n,d quoting dawson chem.rohm haas,d,and absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.id.quoting consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d.the rule of ejusdem generis is one well established and frequently invoked,but it is,after all,a rule of construction,to be resorted to only as an aid to the ascertainment of the meaning of doubtful words and phrases,and not to control or limit their meaning contrary to the true intent.mason united states.singer supra,at.
in order to invoke these aids,we must first find in the statute a patent ambiguity requiring clarification.here there is no such ambiguity on the face of the statute.nor do we find compelling nish reference to the legislative history of the rs act.although there is conflicting evidence regarding congressional intent,plaintiffs evidence fails to demonstrate that the clear intention of congress is contrary to that expressed in the plain language of the statute see russello united states,d.we must therefore be guided by that language.vending facilities is clearly defined as including cafeterias,thus there is no need to resort to either of these techniques to determine whether a given cafeteria falls within the definition of vending facilities.
second,application of ejusdem generis will not yield the result plaintiffs seek.in this statute,the more specific term is cafeteria,the more general vending facility.because ejusdem generis is only to be applied to determine the scope of a general word that follows a specific term,that canon has no relevance here.in other words,since the structure of the statute demonstrates a clear congressional intent to include cafeterias within the broader term vending facilities,there is no need to resort to ejusdem generis or noscitur a sociis to glean the proper scope of the term.see united states turkette,d.
plaintiffs second argument on chevron deference relies upon whitman american trucking assn,d,for the proposition that in order for agency rules to merit deference,the agency must show a textual commitment of authority,that textual commitment must be a clear one.id.at.plaintiffs claim that the rs act does not grant the doe authority to regulate military mess halls,and that congress would not delegate such vast authority without an express announcement of intent.congress does not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes.id.the supreme court has refused to defer to agency interpretations when those interpretations had an effect clearly unintended by congress,not the case here.in fda brown williamson tobacco,d,the court was called upon to determine whether a statute granting the fda authority to refuse approval to any drug it determined to be harmful to the public health implicitly delegated to the fda the authority to outlaw tobacco products.answering in the negative,the court explained that we must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency.id.at.
likewise,in mci telecommunications v.at t,d the court confronted the question whether a statutory grant of authority to the fcc allowing it to modify any aspect of included the authority to waive the tariff filing requirement for long distance carriers.the court found that such power was not delegated to the fcc within the delegation of power to modify any aspect of the statute.the court explained i t is highly unlikely that congress would leave the determination of whether an industry will be entirely,or even substantially,to agency even more unlikely that it would achieve that through such a subtle device as permission to modify requirements.mci,at.
plaintiffs seek to apply the same rationale here,arguing that congress can not be read as having granted the doe the authority to change the operational structure of the nation military mess halls through the simple inclusion of the word cafeterias in a statute.we disagree.first,we do not believe that the ramifications of bringing military mess halls within the purview of the rs act are so apparent that we may impute to congress an intention not to delegate this authority.agency action giving blind vendors a priority in the operation of military mess halls can not be equated with agency action purporting to outlaw tobacco products.we simply do not see the elephant in the mousehole.neither did the fourth circuit in nish cohen,cir nor the federal circuit in southfork systems,united states.
we are not persuaded that the legislative history on this question indicates clear congressional intent to exempt military mess halls from the application of the statute.the leg
