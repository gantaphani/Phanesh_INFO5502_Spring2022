taranto,circuit judge.
rocky mountain helium,llc sued the united states in the united states court of federal claims,asserting breach of two contracts concerning rocky mountain potential extraction of helium from beneath federal lands the helium contract and the settlement agreement the latter resolving a dispute centered on the former.the court of federal claims found lack of jurisdiction over both claims and,in the alternative,dismissed the helium contract claim on the merits.we partly reverse the jurisdictional dismissal of the helium contract claim but affirm the merits dismissal of that claim.we reverse the jurisdictional dismissal of the settlement agreement claim and remand for further proceedings on that claim.
in,rocky mountain and the united states bureau of land management entered into the helium contract,under which the bureau gave rocky mountain the right,for up to years,to extract helium gas from roughly acres of federal lands in colorado and utah.the helium contract federal helium contract fll stipulated that rocky mountain annually pay to the united states either rent of one dollar per acre,roughly or royalties based on the helium that rocky mountain extracted,whichever was greater.the helium contract also gave rocky mountain certain preferential rights to enter into a new agreement with the bureau if the bureau terminated the helium contract.if,within a year of such termination,the united states elects to enter into an agreement with another company for the sale,extraction or other disposition of helium that would be covered by the helium contract but for the termination,rocky mountain would have the right to step in and take that deal instead of the other company.
rocky mountain never extracted helium from the property which rocky mountain alleges was the result of inadequate cooperation from other firms whose oil and gas mining releases helium for collection.for one year,rocky mountain paid the rent due to the bureau,then it stopped paying.in nearly years,rocky mountain has made no payment on its contract.in december,the bureau informed rocky mountain that it had cancelled the helium contract due to nonpayment.rocky mountain filed an administrative appeal with the civilian board of contracts appeals cbca.on august,before a cbca decision,the parties entered into a settlement agreement.
under the settlement agreement,within specified periods the bureau had to direct certain oil and gas lessees of federal land to furnish the bureau with specified information the data about gas composition on the federal lands covered by the helium contract,and the bureau then had to provide the data to rocky mountain.within days of receiving the data,rocky mountain had to pay representing back rent to the bureau.after those events occurred,the helium contract would be reinstated.additional provisions specified certain interactions between the bureau,rocky mountain,and the oil and gas lessees to produce cooperation leading to actual helium collection.
the settlement agreement addresses what would happen if rocky mountain failed to make the payment in the specified time after receiving the data.that failure,the agreement says,shall trigger a sunset provision.the sunset provision,item iii of the agreement,specifies the consequences of such triggering 
rocky mountain agrees to completely and forever release any and all claims,rights,interest in or arising from federal helium contract fll,in their entirety and expressly including any preferential rights detailed therein,and any and all claims against the bureau,the department of the interior and the united states,relating to federal helium contract fll.furthermore rocky mountain agrees that upon triggering of the sunset provision,the bureau may contract with third parties for helium recovery on the lands covered by federal helium contract fll.
relatedly,the settlement agreement contains a disputes clause,which states the parties agree that,except in the event of a triggering of the sunset provision described at item iii herein,disputes or disagreements arising from operation of this agreement will be submitted to the honorable judge allan goodman at the cbca for adr alternative dispute resolution pursuant to cbca rule.it is undisputed that the cited rule generally provides for cbca participation in efforts,which are to be voluntary unless the parties jointly agree to be bound,and that the settlement agreement disputes clause required only voluntary efforts before judge goodman,not submission of a dispute for a binding decision.
under the settlement agreement,the bureau sought information from oil and gas lessees and provided rocky mountain with information on december,rocky mountain objected that the information was incomplete,was not the data required by the agreement.thus,rocky mountain refused to pay the due within days of delivery of the data.
on march,before the end of that period for payment,rocky mountain informed the bureau and judge goodman that it wanted to pursue mediation,thus invoking the agreement disputes clause.the bureau responded that it had supplied all the information necessary and therefore there was no dispute to mediate,but agreed to suspend the settlement payment deadline for ten days for rocky mountain to either make the payment or to explain exactly what information required by the settlement agreement the bureau had failed to provide.appellant appellee supp.letter at.rocky mountain repeated its request for mediation on april.
on april,the bureau sent a letter to rocky mountain stating that it was invoking the sunset provision of the settlement agreement and consider ed federal helium contract fully,finally,and permanently terminated.it added any recovery that rocky mountain may ultimately seek through litigation will be limited to money damages and will be vigorously contested by the bureau.id.rocky mountain alleges that,within a year,the bureau entered into a new lease with another company the bureau neither confirms nor denies that allegation.
the parties continued to discuss possible adr proceedings with judge goodman.appellant appellee supp.letter at.in those conversations,judge goodman never made a written or oral determination about whether the sunset provision had been triggered.id.it appears that neither party pursued adr further after september,and that the cbca closed its adr file in march.id.at.
on april,rocky mountain filed a complaint in the court of federal claims.rocky mountain alleged that the bureau breached two contracts the helium contract and the settlement agreement.the united states filed a motion to dismiss.the trial court granted the motion based on different jurisdictional and merits grounds.
as to the helium contract claim the court first found that rocky mountain lacked constitutional standing because the helium contract had been terminated in and never reinstated.it also dismissed that claim on the merits for the same reason.as to the settlement agreement claim the court found lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the disputes clause required submission of the dispute to judge goodman 
rocky mountain appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
we review de novo the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction,which in this case involves no factual findings on material disputed facts,and the dismissal for failure to state a claim.see radioshack united states,fed.cir.trauma serv.grp.united states,fed.cir.
count i of rocky mountain complaint alleges breach of the settlement agreement,while count ii alleges breach of the helium contract.like the court of federal claims,we discuss the helium contract first,then the settlement agreement.count iii of the complaint,seemingly covering both contracts,alleges breach of an implied duty of a good faith and fair dealing.we see no need for separate discussion of count iii.our rulings on the two simple breach counts shall be taken to extend to count iii claim insofar as that count applies,respectively,to the helium contract and settlement agreement.
as to the helium contract,although rocky mountain complaint might be taken to allege breach in,when the united states declared the contract terminated
