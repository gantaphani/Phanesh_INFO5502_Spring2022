plaintiffs appeal from a district court order dismissing their claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related state law claims.we affirm the district court dismissal.the district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the parties had failed to comply with the clause in their contract.although we conclude that the district court erred by holding that the clause applied to the claim,we conclude that the claim should be dismissed pursuant to fed.civ.b for failure to state a claim.accordingly,there is also no supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.
this dispute relates to contracts for the construction of a municipal transportation terminal.on may,defendant,the municipality of toa alta municipality,awarded a construction project to plaintiff,ossam construction ossam,to build the terminal on land owned by the municipality.the parties contemplated that the construction project would be undertaken in two phases,with two separately executed contracts.the phase i contract was executed on september,and the work was apparently completed without incident within the days provided in the contract.the phase ii contract was executed on september.from september of and continuing through december of,disputes arose regarding payments for the work performed in connection with the phase ii contract.on january,ossam issued a notice of default against the municipality due to its alleged nonpayment for the completed construction work.on february,the municipality notified ossam by letter that the contract between ossam and the municipality was being terminated effective immediately d ue to reasons of public policy in connection with the sound administration of municipal funds.ja.this letter was signed by mayor clemente agosto on behalf of the municipality.on the same day,municipal officials and police officers took control of the construction site,which was on municipal property.
after taking control of the site,the municipality initially barred ossam from removing any property from the construction site.the municipality alleges that this was necessary to fully inventory the property and determine the correct ownership pursuant to the contract.on february and,ossam was permitted to retrieve some of its property from the site.and on february,ossam was finally permitted access to the site to retrieve most of its property.appellants allege that at the time of filing the complaint,the municipality still retained security barriers and fences belonging to ossam.
on may,ossam,its president josé francisco and his wife sarina,and ossam francisco josé and his wife rosa julia,filed a complaint in the district court of puerto rico,against the municipality,agosto in his official capacity as mayor,agosto and his wife yaritza in their personal capacities,an indeterminate number of unnamed municipality police officers and officials in their official and personal capacities,along with their spouses,and any insurance compan ies that may be responsible to the plaintiffs.ja.the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated when the defendants acted under color of law to interfere with the plaintiffs fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendment rights during the construction site takeover in february of.the plaintiffs also claimed that these actions constituted a breach of contract and a violation of the constitution and laws of the commonwealth of puerto rico.ja.
the defendants moved to dismiss the claim for failure to state a claim,and also argued that ossam has not complied with the mandatory arbitration clause in the contract.ja.
the phase ii construction contract between ossam and the municipality included clause,which we refer to as the clause.it provided that 
i n the event that any controversy arises from the interpretation or of any other class among the parties with respect to any matter related to this contract,it shall be previously be sic required that before resorting to a judicial forum for the adjudication of their rights,that the parties exhaust a mediation procedure.the municipality and ossam will at all times attempt to resolve their claims and disputes among themselves in good faith and if unable to arrive at an agreement,they bind themselves to resolving the controversy or dispute through mediation.
ja emphases added.the phase i contract included the same clause with an additional final sentence stating that t he mediator decision will be final and firm.add.this sentence was not included in the phase ii contract 
the usual meaning of arbitration is that the dispute resolution is binding and final.see fit tech,bally total fitness holding,cir.conversely,the usual meaning of mediation is that the dispute resolution is.see in re atlantic pipe,cir.for purposes of resolving this case,we need not decide whether clause provides for nonbinding mediation or binding arbitration.

we first address whether the district court erred by holding that the plaintiffs claims must be mediated or arbitrated before pursuing judicial action.
here,the parties agree that the district court erred in concluding that the clause covers constitutional claims.this agreement is consistent with the plain text of the clause,which does not bring constitutional or claims within its scope.quite the opposite,the clause only encompasses matter s related to this contract.ja.a court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only where the court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.granite rock int l of teamsters,emphasis in original.here,there is no agreement between the parties to the claim.therefore,the district court erred by holding that clause of the construction contract applied to the appellants claim 
even though the district court erred in dismissing for lack of jurisdiction because of the clause,w e are not bound by the lower court rationale,but may instead affirm the grant of dismissal on any ground supported by the record.partido nuevo progresista,cir.we conclude that the claim is without merit and should have been dismissed for failure to state a claim.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue several different constitutional claims,alleging violations of the first,fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments.in none of these respects have the plaintiffs stated a viable claim.
first,there was no first amendment claim pleaded in the complaint.see ja.appellants can not raise an argument on appeal that was not squarely and timely raised in the trial court.l itigants must spell out their legal theories and squarely in the trial court otherwise,that claim ordinarily is deemed unpreserved for purposes of appellate review.thomas rhode island,cir.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
second,there is no plausible constitutional claim for fourth amendment,fifth amendment and fourteenth amendment seizure and takings with respect to the individual plaintiffs.the property allegedly seized or taken belonged to ossam,and not the individual plaintiffs.in their complaint to the district court,the appellants alleged throughout that they encountered a seizure of ossam property,equipment and materials,that the municipality ordered that ossam could not take any of its property,equipment or materials from the site,that municipality officers prevented access to ossam property and equipment,and that they were told removal of ossam equipment and property was forbidden.ja.
on appeal,the appellants repeat these allegations,claiming that they encountered a police seizure of ossam property,equipment and materials,that municipality officials,under color of law and pursuant to official authority prevented ossam personnel to remove most of its property,equipment and materials,and that a equipment was permitted to be removed but not ossam property,equipment and materials.appellant br.
therefore,with respect to the individual plaintiffs,there is no plausible fourth amendment,fifth amendment,and fourteenth amendment claim because no individual plaintiff property was alleged to have been taken 
third,with respect to ossam fourth amendment,fifth amendment,and fourteenth amendment property seizure and takings claims,we find that there is no plausible allegation in the complaint that the municipality engaged in action which would implicate.
insofar as ossam alleges a taking or seizure of its contract,or alleges that its contractual rights were violated by the termination of the contract or the detention of its property,these allegations do not state a constitutional claim.in dep t of housing,urban,cir,this court noted that as a general matter,w e have held with a regularity bordering on the echolalic that a simple breach of contract does not amount to an unconstitutional deprivation of property.to hold otherwise would run the risk of transmogrifying virtually every dispute involving an alleged breach of contract by a state or a state agency into a constitutional case.id.at.this principle is in other circuits as well these cases appear to rest on either of two distinct propositions.in the first category,some cases have held that not all contract rights constitute property protected by the constitution.see,constr.hous.auth.of camden,cir.unger,at yatvin,at.other cases recognize that contract rights can be property for constitutional purposes,and are protected against government actions taken in the government sovereign capacity,for example,by a statute eliminating certain contractual rights.see,cienega gardens united states,fed.cir.holding that the enactment of elihpa and lihprha,which eliminated some contractual rights,in the circumstances of that case effect ed a compensable taking.
a second category of cases holds that even if a private party contract rights constitute property,the exercise of contractual rights by a governmental does not give rise to a constitutional claim.see,b b trucking,at hughes commc ns,at.
indeed,the supreme court has repeatedly recognized that governments act in different capacities as sovereigns and as contracting parties and that t he two characters which the government possesses as a contractor and as a sovereign can not be fused nor can the government while sued in one character be made liable in damages for its acts done in the other.horowitz united states,quoting jones united states.cl.cl.see also perry united states,when the government makes contracts,it has rights and incurs responsibilities similar to those of individuals who are parties to such instruments.united states bostwick,the united states,when they contract with their citizens,are controlled by the same laws that govern the citizen in that behalf.
here,we need not resolve the exact scope of contractual property rights,but may instead assume that ossam contract rights could constitute property.but when a municipality acts in a contractual or proprietary capacity,actions such as contract termination or detention of property under the contract that would constitute a simple breach of contract when a entity is involved do not become a constitutional violation simply because the contracting party is a municipality 
in monell dep t of social services,the supreme court taught that a l ocal governing bod y can be sued directly under when it unconstitutional ly implements or executes a policy statement,ordinance,regulation,or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body officers.however,the court went on to hold that 
the language of,read against the background of the legislative history,compels the conclusion that congress did not intend municipalities to be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort.i t is when execution of a government policy or custom,whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under.
id.at emphasis added.here,the record does not contain any plausible allegations that the municipality was acting in a sovereign capacity pursuant to any statute,ordinance,regulation,or custom when it terminated the contract and took over the construction site and temporarily detained ossam property.
there is no allegation in the complaint that the municipality acted pursuant to a statute,ordinance,or regulation.the complaint did state that the municipality implemented customs and policies which caused the plaintiffs injuries.ja.there was no further development of this bare assertion in the complaint regarding any specific municipality actions undertaken pursuant to its customs and policies.in rosaura building municipality of mayaguez,cir,this court affirmed the district court dismissal of claims against the municipal government under monell,after it found that rosaura failed to plead a scintilla of facts against that government entity about the execution of a government policy or custom.id.at,citation omitted.here,given the record,we similarly conclude that there is no sufficient allegation that the municipality acted under color of law.
in summary,for purposes of a motion to dismiss,we conclude that the source of the municipality authority to secure the construction site stemmed from its proprietary capacity under the contract,and not its sovereign capacity.because the municipality is not alleged to have engaged in a sovereign act,there is no substantial constitutional claim that would support a cause of action pursuant to.thus,here,the municipality acts of terminating the construction contract and temporarily detaining ossam property do not give rise to constitutional claims cognizable under.
finally,to the extent that ossam complains about its exclusion from the construction site,ossam had no constitutional right to access the municipality construction site that would give rise to a claim.the appellants do not dispute that the construction site is on the property of the municipality.appellee off.br.there can not be a plausible constitutional claim that the municipality can not secure its own property.
because there is no substantial constitutional claim,we also conclude that there is no federal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state law claims,as the remaining state law claims were only argued to be allowed to proceed under supplemental jurisdiction.appellant br.as a general matter,a court will decline supplemental jurisdiction if the underlying federal claims are dismissed before trial.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.case law from this circuit supports this general principle that the unfavorable disposition of a plaintiff federal claims at the early stages of a suit will trigger the dismissal of any supplemental claims,at quoting rodríguez doral mortgage,cir.specifically,in camelio american,cir,this court held that after the district court had dismissed a suit federal claims for failure to state a claim,it also should have refrained from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and remanded them to state court.id.at.
we review a district court decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion,at.we conclude that the district court did not do so in dismissing the appellants supplemental state law claims.

although this final sentence was omitted in the original spanish language contract,the certified translation of the phase ii contract erroneously contained this sentence,see ja,when in fact,only the phase i contract contains this sentence in the original spanish version,see ja.the district court correctly noted this error.add.
we need not decide in this case whether a contractual agreement to arbitrate claims would be enforceable.see generally,gilmer lane,mcdonald city of west branch.
