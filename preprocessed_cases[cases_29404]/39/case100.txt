the government appeals the district court dismissal of counts i and ii of its complaint under the false claims act fca against triple canopy.omar badr,the original relator,also appeals the dismissal of his complaint including four additional fca counts counts ii v against triple canopy.for the following reasons,we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed counts ii v of badr complaint,but erred in dismissing counts i and ii of the government complaint.
in june,the government awarded a price contract to triple canopy to provide security services at the al asad airbase,the second largest airbase in iraq triple canopy was one of several security firms awarded the theatre wide internal security services contract under that contract,security at specific locations was governed by individual task orders.the task order for al asad was to.
under to,triple canopy agreed to provide internal security services at al asad and to supplement and augment security operations.these services included providing internal operations at entry control points,internal roving patrols,and prevent ing unauthorized access by enforcing security rules and regulations regarding authorized access to al asad including internal check points.to identified responsibilities triple canopy was tasked with in providing these services,including typical security functions such as repelling attacks,providing escorts,performing entrance searches,and preventing theft,as well as ancillary services such as running background checks,checking ammunition lists,and computerizing personnel systems.as relevant here,the final responsibility was to ensure that all employees have received initial training on the weapon that they carry,and that they have qualified on a army qualification course.marksmanship requirement.to satisfy the marksmanship requirement,employees had to score a minimum of rounds out of from a distance of meters.qualifying scorecards for the guards were to be maintained in their respective personnel files for one year.nothing in to expressly conditioned payment on compliance with the responsibilities.
to fulfill to,triple canopy hired approximately ugandan guards to serve at al asad under the supervision of americans.the guards personnel files indicate that they met the qualifying marksmanship score at a course in kampala,uganda.upon arriving at the base,however,triple canopy supervisors learned that the guards lacked the ability to zero their rifles and were unable to satisfy the qualifying score of on the marksmanship course.thus,shortly after their arrival,triple canopy supervisors were aware that the ugandans could not satisfy the final responsibility of to the marksmanship requirement.nonetheless,triple canopy submitted its monthly invoices for the guards.after a failed training attempt,a triple canopy supervisor directed that false scorecard sheets be created for the guards and placed in their personnel files.because there was attrition,replacement ugandan guards arrived at al asad during the year.these guards were also unable to satisfy the marksmanship requirement,and consequently additional false scorecards were created.
in may,toward the end of the contract,triple canopy attempted to have ugandan guards qualify in marksmanship before leaving for vacation.none could do so.a triple canopy supervisor ordered omar badr,a triple canopy medic,to prepare false scorecards for the guards,reflecting scores of for male guards and for the female guards.triple canopy site manager signed these new scorecards and them,showing that the guards qualified in june.
to was in effect for one year,and triple canopy presented monthly invoices for guard services during that time.each invoice listed the number of guards in service for that month the term guard was undefined.pursuant to to,a contracting officer representative cor was responsible for acceptance of the services triple canopy performed.the cor was appointed by the government and confirmed acceptance of triple canopy guard services by filing a material inspection and receiving report dd form.the dd required the cor to accept the services if they conform ed to contract and to sign the form if the services provided were received in apparent good condition.the cor completed twelve dd forms,none of which included any certification or endorsement from triple canopy.in total,triple canopy submitted invoices totaling for the ugandan guards a rate of per month for each guard.triple canopy did not receive a renewal of to,and the ugandan guards were thereafter dispatched to four other contract sites around iraq cobra,kalsue,delta,and basra.
badr eventually instituted a qui tam action under the fca against triple canopy in the eastern district of virginia.badr alleged five false claims counts al asad count i and cobra,kalsue,basra,and delta counts ii v.the government intervened on the al asad count and filed an amended complaint alleging that triple canopy knowingly presented false claims,in violation of u.a a count i,and caused the creation of a false record material to a false claim,in violation of a b count ii.specifically,the government alleged that triple canopy knew the guards did not satisfy to marksmanship requirement but nonetheless billed the government the full price for each and every one of its unqualified guards and falsified documents in its files to show that the unqualified guards each qualified as a marksman on a army qualification course.the government also brought several common law claims.
the district court granted triple canopy motion to dismiss the fca claims.united states ex rel.badr triple canopy,d.the court first dismissed count i because the government failed to plead that triple canopy submitted a demand for payment that contained an objectively false statement.next,the court dismissed count ii because the government failed to allege a false claim and failed to allege that the cor ever reviewed the scorecards.finally,the court dismissed counts ii v in badr complaint because he failed to plead with particularity the facts giving rise to the claims.the court also dismissed count i of badr complaint,concluding that badr lacked standing to press that claim because of the government intervention.the court later dismissed the government remaining common law claims both the government and badr filed timely appeals.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.united states ex rel.rostholder omnicare,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss under the rule,a complaint must state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,internal quotation marks omitted.facts that are merely consistent with liability do not establish a plausible claim for relief.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in addition,claims under the fca must also meet the more stringent particularity requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b.united states ex rel.ahumada nish,cir.rule b requires that an fca plaintiff must,at a minimum,describe the time,place,and contents of the false representations,as well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.united states ex rel.wilson kellogg brown root,cir internal quotation marks omitted.imposing this requirement serves to deter fishing expeditions.united states ex rel.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir harrison i.
section a a prohibits any person from knowingly caus ing to be presented to the government a false or fraudulent claim for payment.a a.to prove a false claim,a plaintiff must allege four elements a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct made with the requisite scienter that is material and that results in a claim to the government.united states ex rel.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir harrison ii.a false statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the government decision to pay.b.scienter under the fca encompasses actual knowledge,deliberate indifference,and reckless disregard,but does not require proof of specific intent to defraud.b.
the phrase false or fraudulent claim should be construed broadly,harrison i,at,to reach all types of fraud,without qualification,that might result in financial loss to the government,united states neifert white.liability thus attaches any time a false statement is made in a transaction involving a call on the fisc.harrison i,at.
the district court determined that count i failed to state a claim because the government did not allege the first element,a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct.in the court view,the government failed to sufficiently plead that triple canopy submitted a demand for payment containing an objectively false statement.triple canopy,d at.the court reached this determination by reasoning that the government never alleged that triple canopy invoiced a fraudulent number of guards or billed for a fraudulent sum of money.id.at.the government argues that triple canopy submitted false claims because its monthly invoices billed the government for guard services although the company knew its guards had failed to comply with one of to responsibilities,the marksmanship requirement.
we have previously recognized that a false claims plaintiff can not shoehorn what is,in essence,a breach of contract action into a claim that is cognizable under the fca.wilson,at.see also united states ex rel.steury cardinal health,cir noting that courts seek to maintain a crucial distinction between punitive fca liability and ordinary breaches of contract internal quotation marks omitted.in wilson,we concluded that two qui tam relators failed to plead a false claim when the claim was based on mere allegations of poor and inefficient management of contractual duties.wilson,at internal quotation marks omitted.an fca relator can not base a fraud claim on nothing more than his own interpretation of an imprecise contractual provision,id.at,we explained,particularly where the government never expressed dissatisfaction with the contract performance,id.at.see also harrison i,at noting fraud is limited to expressions of fact which admit of being adjudged true or false in a way that admit of empirical verification internal quotation marks omitted.
we reiterated the line between breaches of contract and fca claims in united states ex rel.owens first kuwaiti general trading contracting,cir.in owens,we rejected claims from a qui tam relator regarding the construction of the united states embassy in baghdad.while noting that some of the construction work required remediation,we nonetheless explained that t o support an fca claim,there needs to be something more than the usual communication between the government and the contractor over this or that construction defect and this or that corrective measure.id.at.we summarized the relators claims as issues of contractual performance involving a series of complex contracts pertaining to a construction project of massive scale.id.at.we expressly recognized that the purposes of the fca were not served by imposing liability on honest disagreements,routine adjustments and corrections,and sincere and comparatively minor oversights,particularly when the party invoking the fca is an uninjured third party.id.
while we have guarded against turning what is essentially a breach of contract into an fca violation,we have also continued to recognize that the fca is intended to protect the treasury against the claims of unscrupulous contractors,and it must be construed in that light.id.to satisfy this goal,courts have recognized that a claim for payment is false when it rests on a false representation of compliance with an applicable contractual term.united states sci.applications int l,saic.such f alse certifications are either express or implied.id.while we label the claim in this case as implied certification,we note that this label simply recognizes one of the variety of ways in which a claim can be false.harrison i,at 
courts infer implied certifications from silence where certification was a prerequisite to the government action sought.saic,at quoting united states ex rel.siewick jamison sci.eng g.recognizing that claims can be false when a party impliedly certifies compliance with a material contractual condition gives effect to congress expressly stated purpose that the fca should reach all fraudulent attempts to cause the government to pay out sums of money or to deliver property or services,united states ex rel.wilkins united health group,cir quoting,at,a purpose we explicitly recognized in harrison i.an example provided by the circuit helps explain the benefits of recognizing this theory 
consider a company that contracts with the government to supply gasoline with an octane rating of or higher.the contract provides that the government will pay the contractor on a monthly basis but nowhere states that supplying gasoline of the specified octane is a precondition of payment.notwithstanding the contract octane requirement,the company knowingly supplies gasoline that has an octane rating of only and fails to disclose this discrepancy to the government.the company then submits monthly invoice forms supplied by the that ask the contractor to specify the amount of gasoline supplied during the month but nowhere require it to certify that the gasoline is at least octane.so long as the government can show that supplying gasoline at the specified octane level was a material requirement of the contract,no one would doubt that the monthly invoice qualifies as a false claim under the fca despite the fact that neither the contract nor the invoice expressly stated that monthly payments were conditioned on complying with the required octane level.
accordingly,we hold that the government pleads a false claim when it alleges that the contractor,with the requisite scienter,made a request for payment under a contract and withheld information about its noncompliance with material contractual requirements.id the pertinent inquiry is whether,through the act of submitting a claim,a payee knowingly and falsely implied that it was entitled to payment.united states ex rel.lemmon envirocare of utah,cir.we appreciate that this theory is prone to abuse by parties seeking to turn the violation of minor contractual provisions into an fca action.saic,at the best manner for continuing to ensure that plaintiffs can not shoehorn a breach of contract claim into an fca claim is strict enforcement of the act materiality and scienter requirements.see also united states ex rel.hutcheson blackstone,cir same.in addition,parties who engage in abusive litigation remain subject to appropriate sanctions,whether in the context of the fca or otherwise.
applying these standards,we readily conclude that the government has sufficiently alleged a false claim for purposes of rule b and rule b.to lists the marksmanship requirement as a responsibility triple canopy must fulfill under the contract.the complaint contains an abundance of allegations that triple canopy did not satisfy this requirement and,instead,undertook a fraudulent scheme that included falsifying records to obscure its failure.the government complaint also properly alleges that triple canopy supervisors had actual knowledge of the ugandan guards failure to satisfy the marksmanship requirement and ordered the scorecards falsification.
turning to materiality,in implied certification cases this element operates to protect contractors from onerous and unforeseen fca liability as the result of noncompliance with any of potentially hundreds of legal requirements in contracts,because p ayment requests by a contractor who has violated minor contractual provisions that are merely ancillary to the parties bargain do not give rise to liability under the fca.saic,at.to establish materiality,the government must allege the false statement had a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the government decision to pay.b.express contractual language may constitute dispositive evidence of materiality,but materiality may be established in other ways,such as through testimony demonstrating that both parties to the contract understood that payment was conditional on compliance with the requirement at issue.hutcheson,at quoting saic,at.
