james mayfield brought a qui tam action under the false claims act.on a motion for summary judgment,the district court concluded that mayfield was barred by the doctrine of res judicata from bringing the majority of his claims against lockheed,and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the public disclosure provisions of the false claims act to consider the rest of mayfield claims against lockheed.
in determining that mayfield did not qualify as an original source of the information publicly disclosed in his prior state court lawsuit,the district court aligned itself with a minority of the circuits interpreting the original source exception.as a matter of first impression for this court,we choose instead to follow the majority interpretation.we thus vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for findings under this test.we further hold that mayfield prior state court lawsuit did not bar him from bringing the present claims under the false claims act.
statement of the facts and procedural history 
from november until his termination in march,james mayfield was employed with lockheed martin engineering sciences company lockheed.from january until this termination,mayfield worked with lockheed as its project specialist and was responsible for,among other things,overseeing the contents,preparation,execution and delivery of national aeronautics and space administration nasa form reports.
pursuant to the engineering,test and analysis contract eta contract between lockheed and nasa,lockheed was required to file one version of the nasa form nasa on a monthly basis and another nasa on a quarterly basis.essentially,the nasa form reports provided a basis for reporting and evaluating lockheed costs and expenses under the eta contract.the eta contract explicitly provided that payment of fees to lockheed under the contract was contingent upon compliance with contractual provisions controlling lockheed reporting of accurate cost overruns and cost at completion figures.
a.the state court action 
on february,mayfield filed a wrongful discharge suit in state court,alleging that lockheed wrongfully terminated his employment in retaliation for internally inquiring into whether an act he was required to perform was illegal.
as alleged in mayfield first amended petition,in december,mayfield became aware through his supervisor,ben carroll that lockheed was knowingly failing to report excessive costs and anticipated cost overruns under the eta contract as required by the compliance provisions of the contract.after carroll told mayfield that the budgets being used to complete the nasa form reports for nasa understated the future costs of operations,mayfield began to inquire into the legality of this conduct.mayfield involved more of his supervisors and management level employees in the matter,but,as alleged,soon became the victim of blatant retaliation.
in august,the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of lockheed.final judgment against mayfield was subsequently affirmed by the state court of appeals.see mayfield lockheed eng g scis,dist,pet.denied mayfield i.
b.the federal action 
on april,mayfield filed a second suit against lockheed in federal court pursuant to the qui tam provisions of the false claims act,fca 
mayfield alleged in his first amended complaint that lockheed knowingly failed to report excessive costs and anticipated cost overruns as required by the compliance provisions of the eta contract and,indeed,knew that it could not perform in accordance with the costs specified in the initial bid to nasa for the eta contract but knowingly submitted a false bid for the contract anyway.
on february,the district court granted lockheed motion for summary judgment.united states ex rel.mayfield lockheed martin eng g scis,d,mayfield ii.it held that the doctrine of res judicata precluded litigation of mayfield fca claims to the extent they were based on the conduct complained of in his state court action.id.at.it further held that although mayfield was not barred by res judicata from relitigating any claims arising out of conduct not complained of in his prior lawsuit,the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over these claims because mayfield was not the original source with respect to any allegedly wrongful conduct occurring after the filing of his prior lawsuit.
mayfield timely filed a notice of appeal,requesting review of both aspects of this final judgment.
standard of review 
by its terms,the public disclosure bar is jurisdictional.other circuit courts have specifically held that i n a qui tam suit brought under the fca,the jurisdictional issue of public disclosure clearly arises out of the same statute that creates the cause of action thus,a challenge under the fca jurisdictional bar is necessarily intertwined with the merits and should be resolved pursuant to either federal rule of civil procedure b or.see,united states ex rel.ramseyer century healthcare,cir.while our court has not addressed this specific jurisdictional point,we have previously stated that t he questions of subject matter jurisdiction and the merits will normally be considered intertwined where the statute provides both the basis of federal court subject matter jurisdiction and the cause of action.clark tarrant,cir see also eubanks mccotter,cir when the basis of federal jurisdiction is intertwined with the plaintiff federal cause of action,the court should assume jurisdiction over the case and decide the case on the merits.we see this case as presenting one such instance where questions of subject matter jurisdiction and the merits are intertwined because the defendant challenge to the court jurisdiction is also a challenge to the existence of a federal cause of action.williamson tucker,cir citing bell hood.the proper course of action for the district court was thus to find that jurisdiction exist ed and deal with the merits of the case.id.at.
the district court basically followed this procedure here.it styled lockheed challenge to the court subject matter jurisdiction as a summary judgment motion and,presumably,utilized this standard.however,instead of first considering the public disclosure bar question which goes to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court,it first considered lockheed affirmative defense of res judicata.we believe the jurisdictional bar should have been considered by the district court before it moved to the merits of lockheed affirmative defense.united states ex rel.fed.recovery,crescent city,cir we are persuaded that the district court never had jurisdiction over the action.united states ex rel.ass of nurse anesthetists allina health,cir stating,in a qui tam case where information was allegedly publicly disclosed,that a t the threshold,we must decide whether we have jurisdiction over this case.we therefore begin our review by addressing the fca public disclosure bar,found at b,and review the district court grant of summary judgment under a de novo standard of review,using the same standard utilized by the district court.see kerr lyford,cir holding that,under a rule standard,the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to the.
analysis of the public disclosure bara.presentation of the disputed mayfield is the original source of information 
as we have discussed the procedure and the historical underpinnings of the qui tam provisions of the fca in prior opinions,we need not repeat them here.see riley luke episcopal,cir en banc searcy philips am,cir.suffice it to say that in certain circumstances,suits by private parties on behalf of the united states against anyone submitting a false claim to the government are permitted.hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d.
the fca,the civil war statute under which these suits are permitted,has been amended only twice,once in and,more recently,in by the grassley amendments.id.in,interpreting the qui tam provisions as then written,the supreme court stated that a private plaintiff might bring a qui tam action even though his knowledge of fraud was gained from a government criminal indictment.see united states ex rel.marcus hess.in response,congress amended the fca to bar a court jurisdiction over qui tam suits that were based on evidence or information the government had when the action was brought.b ed.superceded.however,this amendment led to unintended results as it deprived potential relators who had themselves given valuable information to the government before filing their qui tam action of an ability to sue under the fca.see,united states ex rel.wisconsin dean,cir holding that the district court had no jurisdiction over a qui tam action brought by wisconsin based on information of medicaid fraud the state had uncovered because the state had reported the medicaid fraud to the federal government before bringing suit.
in response,in,congress amended the act to its current form.specifically,it repealed the government knowledge jurisdictional bar and replaced it with the public disclosure bar.see united states ex rel.rabushka crane,cir discussing the purpose behind the repeal as an accommodation of both of the fca goals of promoting private citizen involvement in exposing fraud against the government and preventing parasitic suits by opportunistic who add nothing to the exposure of fraud.
under e a,the jurisdictional provision for qui tam actions under the fca now provides that 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e a.in the related subsection immediately following this bar,the statute further defines an original source as 
a n individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
in federal recovery services,we drew from the plain language of e to set forth the three questions to be asked in a jurisdictional inquiry as whether there has been a public disclosure of allegations or transactions,whether the qui tam action is based upon such publicly disclosed allegations,and if so,whether the relator is the original source of the information.fed.recovery,at.
here,mayfield does not dispute that mayfield i served as a public disclosure of the information alleged in mayfield ii,nor does he challenge the finding that the allegations in this case are based upon the information disclosed in mayfield instead,mayfield contends that as the original source of the information,he is saved from the jurisdictional bar.the question before us on appeal thus turns on the statutory construction of the original source exception.
b.the parameters of the original source exception 
the statutory construction of the original source exception is the subject of much disagreement amongst the courts of appeals that have addressed it.the exception explicitly requires the satisfaction of a test the relator must demonstrate that he or she has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and the relator must demonstrate that he or she has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing his or her qui tam action.e b.
here,the district court found that 
mayfield clearly does not have direct knowledge of conduct occurring at lockheed after he filed his state court action because he was laid off from lockheed before that suit was filed.as such,mayfield is not an original source with respect to any wrongful conduct occurring after the filing of his prior lawsuit.
mayfield ii,d at.as developed more fully below,we do not read the original source exception to the jurisdictional bar to require that a relator have direct and independent knowledge of each false claim alleged in his complaint to have been submitted by the defendant 
a full understanding of the distinct definitions of direct knowledge and independent knowledge in the original source definition requires an analysis of the entire phrase direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.the courts of appeals are currently split regarding whether the phrase the information on which the allegations are based refers to information on which the allegations in the qui tam relator complaint are based or information on which the allegations in the public disclosure are based.the fourth,sixth,eighth and circuits have read information in subsection b of the original source definition in tandem with the term information in subsection a of the public disclosure bar immediately preceding the original source definition.this reading logically leads them to conclude that information in subsection b refers to the information on which the publicly disclosed allegations are based rather than the information contained in the relator qui tam complaint.see.ass of nurse anesthetists,at we have interpreted independent knowledge to mean knowledge not derived from the public disclosure.the independent knowledge requirement clearly serves the congressional goal of barring parasitic actions,but it is worth noting that it does not bar actions based on old news,in which the relator independently discovers information already known to the public.internal citations omitted united states ex rel.grayson advanced mgmt.tech,cir stating that the relators were not original sources of information underlying the publicly disclosed allegations,not the allegations in the qui tam complaint united states ex rel.findley employees club,t he allegations referred to in subparagraph b can only mean those allegations publicly disclosed,since those are the only allegations mentioned at all in section e.thus,an original source is a relator with direct and independent knowledge of the information,any essential element of the fraud transaction on which the publicly disclosed allegations are based.internal citations omitted united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir to qualify as an original source,the relator must have direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the publicly disclosed allegations are based.
in contrast,the third,ninth and tenth circuits have construed the information in the phrase the information on which the allegations are based to refer to the information contained in the qui tam complaint filed by the relator rather than the information contained in the public disclosure.see united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,cir to establish original source status knowledge,a qui tam plaintiff must allege specific opposed to mere exactly how and when he or she obtained direct and independent knowledge of the fraudulent acts alleged in the complaint and support those allegations with competent proof.emphasis added united states ex rel.mistick housing auth.of the city of,cir finding that the relator was not the original source because he did not have direct and independent knowledge of the most critical element of his claims in the qui tam complaint united states ex rel.barajas northrop,cir holding that an employee of a government subcontractor had direct and independent knowledge of the allegations contained in his qui tam complaint.
based on the district court holding that it lacked jurisdiction because mayfield did not have direct and independent knowledge of each separate nasa form submission claimed to constitute a false claim in the mayfield ii complaint,the district court apparently assumed the direct and independent knowledge requirement was tied to the information contained in the qui tam complaint rather than the information contained in the publicly disclosed material.in so assuming,it,without citation,followed the holdings of the third,ninth and tenth circuits.we disagree with this interpretation of e b.
looking at the public disclosure bar under e a and the original source definition under e b together,it makes sense that the first element of the original source exception is satisfied if an individual has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations in the public disclosure are based.we see no logic in interpreting the word information in subparagraph a to refer to information publicly disclosed and then interpreting information in subparagraph b a subparagraph clearly intended to define a term identified in subparagraph a to refer to each false claim alleged in the relator qui tam complaint.this construction fails to harmonize the subparagraphs of e.see also atl.cleaners dyers,united states.stating that identical words used in different parts of the same statutory section are intended to have the same meaning.as stated by judge luttig in united states ex rel.siller becton dickinson,cir 
t he fact that b refers to the information on which the allegations are based confirms that the only possible reference of the word information in b is to the information publicly exact same reference of the word in a.
id.at emphasis added.
as further support that this is the construction intended by congress,we recognize that those courts which define information to refer to allegations contained in the qui tam complaint have difficulty distinguishing between the terms direct and independent two discrete and necessary concepts under the original source definition.see united states ex rel.dick long island lighting,cir discussing the significance of the conjunction and in direct and independent knowledge see also mckenzie,at in construing the term original source other courts have impose d a conjunctive and qui tam plaintiffs.quoting united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.for example,in hafter,the tenth circuit defined direct knowledge to mean knowledge gained by the relator own efforts and not acquired from the labors of others and independent knowledge to mean knowledge not derivative of the information of others.hafter,at.we fail to see a distinction between these terms as so defined.
in contrast,those courts that define information to refer to information publicly disclosed do not encounter as much resistance in formulating distinct definitions for the two separate terms direct and independent.see,findley,at in order to be direct,the information must be knowledge.in order to be independent,the information known by the relator can not depend or rely on public disclosures.mckenzie,at the word direct is usually interpreted as marked by absence of intervening agency,while independent knowledge is not dependent on public disclosure.internal citation omitted.ass of nurse anesthetists,at defining direct as unmediated by anything but the plaintiff own labor and independent as knowledge not derived from the public disclosure.the we think incorrect construction of information as referring to allegations in the qui tam complaint renders the term independent meaningless,which we are bound not to do.see ins phinpathya,d white black,cir.for these reasons,we read the term information in subsection b of the original source definition to refer to the information on which the publicly disclosed allegations are based rather than the information contained in the relator qui tam complaint.
as mayfield is responsible for filing the publicly disclosed information in mayfield i,it is beyond dispute that dismissal on the basis that his knowledge is not independent of the public disclosure as that term is defined in e b would have been in error.however,we believe that remand is appropriate to allow the district court an opportunity to make factual findings regarding whether mayfield also satisfies the direct knowledge requirement based on the construction of the statute cited above.to aid the district court in this endeavor,prudence dictates some discussion of the direct knowledge requirement.
the courts of appeals have used varying formulations to define the term direct.see.ass of nurse anesthetists,at defining direct as unmediated by anything but the plaintiff own labor hafter,at defining direct as knowledge gained by the relator own efforts and not acquired from the labors of others united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante,prudential ins,cir defining direct as marked by absence of an intervening agency,instrumentality or influence immediate findley,at defining direct as knowledge of the information.
we interpret the term direct by its plain meaning as knowledge derived from the source without interruption or gained by the relator own efforts rather than learned through the efforts of others.webster new international dictionary ed.in so defining,we note that congress plainly and intentionally used the phrase an original source rather than the original source to craft the savings clause.e b.thus,for a court in this circuit to have jurisdiction pursuant to this exception,it is not charged with the duty of finding the single one true whistleblower.see stinson,at,discussing the legislative history to the amendments as demonstrating a congressional intent to encourage qui tam suits brought by insiders,such as employees who come across information of fraud in the course of their employment citing.at,reprinted in.rather,it must look to the factual subtleties of the case before it and attempt to strike a balance between those individuals who,with no details regarding its whereabouts,simply stumble upon a seemingly lucrative nugget and those actually involved in the process of unearthing important information about a false or fraudulent claim.compare.ass of nurse anesthetists,at finding that nurse association had direct knowledge that anesthesiologists routinely submitted fraudulent bills to medicare for anesthesia procedures because the nurses had personal knowledge of the defendants alleged false claims by virtue of communications with the defendants themselves and had seen the hospital records containing false claims,and united states ex rel.stone rockwell int l,cir holding that the relator satisfied the direct knowledge requirement even though he no longer worked with the defendant when the faulty pondcrete blocks were manufactured because he learned the facts underlying his claim while looking at the plans for production,and united states ex rel.cooper blue cross blue shield of,cir holding that a relator knowledge of an alleged fraud by a medicare secondary payor was direct because it was acquired through three years of the relator own claims processing,research,and correspondence with members of congress and the health care financing admin,and wang fmc,cir holding that an who had been called in to study a problem with a product had direct knowledge because he saw the problem with his own eyes and his knowledge was unmediated by anything but his own labor,with grayson,at finding no jurisdiction to entertain a qui tam action brought by relator attorneys who had represented two unsuccessful bidders in protesting the award of an faa contract because they at best verified their clients information alleged in the publicly disclosed administrative protest,and united states alcan eng g,cir holding that a member of an electrical workers union did not meet the direct knowledge element since he never participated in the negotiating,drafting,or implementation of relevant agreements,does not allege that he played any role in submitting false claims to the government,and simply heard as a member of the union that the electrical contractors were submitting false claims to the government.
we thus remand for the district court to make factual findings regarding the direct knowledge requirement of the first element.
analysis of the claim preclusive effect of mayfield i on mayfield ii 
in addition to finding that mayfield did not qualify as an original source of information regarding claims submitted by lockheed after he was terminated,the district court held that the doctrine of res judicata claim preclusion barred mayfield from relitigating any claims arising out of conduct complained of in his prior state court action.as stated,we see it beneficial to remand this case for factual findings regarding the direct knowledge requirement.however,in the interest of judicial efficiency,we now address the district court conclusion regarding l
