in this winstar case,first commerce corporation appeals the decision of the united states court of federal claims,which held on summary judgment that first commerce had not entered into a contract with the united states for favorable regulatory accounting treatment in exchange for first commerce acquisition of mutual federal savings bank of lowell,indiana,a failing thrift.first commerce united states,fed.cl.the court of federal claims held that a discrepancy between the terms of first commerce request for favorable accounting treatment and the forbearances actually granted by the government precluded the formation of a contract between first commerce and the united states.we hold that while the court of federal claims correctly discerned a discrepancy between offer and acceptance in this transaction,the court analysis was incomplete because it did not consider the possibility that the government made a counteroffer.we conclude that the government made a counteroffer to first commerce,and we vacate the decision of the court of federal claims and remand for further proceedings.
appellant first commerce corporation was organized in by a group of individual investors in indiana,for the purpose of acquiring a financially troubled thrift.according to first commerce,the federal home loan bank board fhlbb,acting primarily through its office located at the federal home loan bank of indianapolis,told first commerce that favorable regulatory treatment could be extended to investors acquiring failing thrifts,and provided first commerce with the names of candidate thrift institutions.first commerce selected mutual federal,which was close to insolvency but not actually insolvent.
in june,first commerce submitted an bid letter to the fhlb of indianapolis.the bid letter proposed that first commerce acquire mutual federal,infusing about million in new capital into the merged thrift.the bid letter stated that a ny excess of mutual liabilities over its tangible and identified intangible assets would be capitalized as an unidentified intangible asset which is to say that the merged thrift could,via purchase method accounting,record supervisory goodwill as an intangible asset arising from the acquisition.the bid letter further requested that federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic grant the merged thrift a regulatory forbearance,permitting first commerce to use generally accepted accounting principles amortization in accounting for the supervisory goodwill arising from the acquisition.in particular,first commerce requested permission to amortize the goodwill over years via the straight line method 
amortization of intangibles.the fslic shall agree that,notwithstanding generally accepted accounting principles,for regulatory accounting purposes,the value of any intangible assets resulting from accounting for the merger of first commerce into mutual in accordance with the purchase method may be amortized by the resulting institution over a period of years using the straight line method.
according to first commerce,officials of the fhlb of indianapolis informed first commerce that its bid was the best received for mutual federal.in november,first commerce filed with the fslic a formal application to acquire the outstanding stock of mutual federal.the application stated the following 
consummation of the acquisition by the holding company pursuant to the purchase agreement is conditioned upon the granting by the fhlbb and the fslic of certain regulatory forbearances and approvals in connection with the acquisition and the subsequent operation of the institution these forbearances,waivers and approvals,which applicants hereby request,are as follows 
purchase accounting amortization of intangibles.
for purposes of reporting to the fhlbb,with respect to the books and records of the institution,the fhlbb shall agree that purchase accounting shall be used to record the purchase of the institution capital stock,and the fhlbb shall agree that the value of any intangible asset resulting from the application of purchase accounting may be amortized by the institution using the level yield method over the lives of the related assets giving rise to such intangible asset.
thus,in contrast to the bid letter,first commerce formal application did not request year straight line amortization of goodwill.rather,it requested conventional gaap treatment level yield amortization over the lives of the related assets.although the precise implications of the difference between the two accounting treatments are disputed by the parties,it suffices for our purposes to state that gaap treatment would amortize the goodwill over a period shorter than years,because the related assets were mutual outstanding loans,and that newly merged thrifts generally sought longer amortization to improve their apparent profitability.see united states winstar,d first commerce,fed cl.at.
the formal application also included a business plan for the reorganized thrift,prepared by the same consulting group that prepared first commerce bid.like the forbearance request,first commerce business plan described level yield amortization of the goodwill over the lives of the assets and made no reference to an extended year amortization term.concurrently with first commerce application,mutual federal submitted an application for voluntary supervisory conversion with the fhlbb.mutual federal application reproduced precisely the forbearance request in first commerce application and included a copy of the same business plan,in both cases requesting the same level yield amortization of the goodwill.first commerce later filed amended applications,which reproduced the same request for level yield amortization over the lives of the intangible assets.
the fhlbb approved the acquisition,in a letter signed by representatives of the fhlbb office of general counsel and office of regulatory policy,oversight and supervision.the approval letter authorized and directed the secretary of the board to issue a letter granting mutual federal certain supervisory forbearances.the forbearance letter,issued by the federal home loan bank board,granted four specific forbearances.two are relevant here 
for purposes of reporting to the board,the value of any intangible assets resulting from the application of accounting in accounting for the purchase,may be amortized by mutual over a period not to exceed years by the straight line method.
not later than days following the date of consummation of the acquisition,mutual shall submit to the supervisory agent an opinion of independent certified public accountants that mutual has accounted for the transaction in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap except as herein provided by the board,for purposes of reporting to the federal home loan bank board a the value of any resulting unidentifiable intangible asset may be amortized by mutual over a period of years by the straight line method.
while first commerce application had requested level yield amortization over the lives of the related assets gaap treatment,the fhlbb forbearance letter granted straight line amortization over years as requested in first commerce original bid letter.thus,while the fhlbb grant of purchase method accounting treatment for intangible assets mirrored the terms of first commerce application,the method and length of amortization did not.
first commerce consummated its acquisition on july,and changed mutual federal name to first commerce bank,a federal savings bank.the record shows that,consistent with the fhlbb forbearance,first commerce accountants provided an opinion letter stating that the accounting for the acquisition complied with gaap,except that goodwill would be amortized over years by the straight line method for regulatory reporting purposes,as allowed by the fhlbb forbearance letter dated may.the record before us does not indicate whether this opinion was submitted to the fhlbb supervisory agent as required by the fhlbb forbearance letter.
the remaining facts follow the common pattern of winstar cases.in,congress passed firrea,imposing more stringent limits on the use of supervisory
