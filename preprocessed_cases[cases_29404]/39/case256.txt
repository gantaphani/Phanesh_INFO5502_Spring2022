plaintiff paul braunstein seeks damages based on arizona use of an affirmative action program in its award of a transportation engineering contract.we affirm the district court holding that braunstein lacks article iii standing.
background 
braunstein owns and operates baseplans,a small engineering and land surveying firm in arizona that previously performed work for the arizona department of transportation the department.the department is a state agency responsible for the planning,design,repair,and construction of roads in arizona.beginning in,braunstein filed three lawsuits against the department and its employees challenging their refusal to award him additional work.he filed the first two suits in state court alleging,inter alia,breach of contract,conspiracy,and antitrust violations.in,braunstein filed the present lawsuit in federal court,alleging that the department race and affirmative action program violated his right to equal protection.
in,the department hired the engineering firm dmjm harris,dmjm,as its prime contractor for the maricopa county regional freeway system.initially,the department itself hired other firms,including baseplans,on an asneeded basis to locate subsurface utilities that might need to be relocated during freeway construction.in,the department opted for a new contracting system under which the prime contractor,rather than the department,selected and contracted with other firms for the utility location work.dmjm chose aztec technical services aztec as its utility subcontractor,and the department modified its contract with dmjm accordingly.
in march,braunstein sued the department,a department official,dmjm,and aztec in arizona state court,alleging that they secretly and improperly conspired to divert utility location work to aztec.braunstein alleged breach of contract by the department and intentional interference with business expectancy by the other defendants.in june,the court granted summary judgment in favor of dmjm and aztec.the court found,among other things,that dmjm did not ask baseplans to submit a subcontracting proposal because it had experienced problems with baseplans on prior projects.in december,braunstein settled his breach of contract claim with the department and dismissed his claims against the department official.
in november,the department solicited bids for a new engineering and design contract to replace dmjm contract.six firms bid on the prime contract.braunstein did not bid on the contract because he could not satisfy a department requirement that prime contractors be able to complete percent of the contract work themselves.instead,braunstein contacted the bidding firms to ask about subcontracting for the utility location work.all six firms rejected braunstein overtures,and braunstein did not submit a quote or subcontracting bid to any of them.none of the prime bids submitted to the department identified baseplans as a chosen utility location subcontractor.
united states department of transportation regulations require that states receiving federal highway funds maintain a disadvantaged business enterprise dbe program.to qualify as a dbe,a small business must be at least percent owned by one or more individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged.id.the regulations presume that women,black americans,hispanic americans,native americans,asian pacific americans,subcontinent asian americans,and certain other ethnic minorities are socially and economically disadvantaged.id.a.the presumption of disadvantage is rebutted when an individual has a personal net worth above a specified amount.id.b.
the department reviewed the prime contract bids and scored them on a point scale.under the department system,a bidding prime contractor would receive a maximum of points for dbe participation if it was a dbe itself it committed to hiring dbe subcontractors to perform at least percent of the contract work or it demonstrated a good faith effort to achieve the percent goal but was unable to do so for reasons beyond its control.the department required that contracting firms adhere to their dbe participation commitments and file monthly dbe compliance reports.
all six firms that bid on the prime contract received the maximum points for dbe participation.no bidding firm was itself a dbe,but all six committed to hiring dbe subcontractors to perform at least percent of the work.only one of the six bidding firms selected a dbe as its desired utility location subcontractor.three of the bidding firms,including dmjm,selected aztec to perform the utility location work.aztec was not a dbe.
dmjm won the bid for the contract.the contract was for one year,but the department indicated that it expected to renew the contract annually for years.the department would decide whether to renew it based on dmjm performance.dmjm use of dbe subcontractors in future years would not factor into the department renewal decision.
in may,braunstein filed a second lawsuit in arizona state court against the department and department officials,alleging conspiracy and violation of antitrust,public records,and conflict of interest laws.the superior court dismissed all of braunstein claims,and the court of appeals affirmed.the state courts concluded that braunstein lacked standing to bring the claims under state law because he had not bid on the challenged contract.
also in may,we decided western states paving washington state department of transportation,cir.we upheld against a facial challenge the federal dbe program at the national level as a narrowly tailored means of remedying race and discrimination in the transportation contracting industry.id.at.however,we held that states,to survive an challenge to their own dbe programs,must produce evidence of discrimination against particular groups within particular state industries to demonstrate that their dbe programs are narrowly tailored to achieve congress compelling remedial interest.id.at.we struck down the washington department of transportation dbe program as unconstitutional because the record was devoid of any evidence of discrimination in the state transportation contracting industry.id.at.in january,the department suspended its dbe program in light of western states.
in november,braunstein brought this suit in federal court against the department,the state of arizona,and three named department employees the named defendants in their official and individual capacities.braunstein federal suit challenged arizona dbe program as violating the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and title vi of the civil rights act.title vi provides that no person shall be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.the attorney who litigated western states represents braunstein in this suit.
braunstein alleged that the department violated his right to equal protection by using race and gender preferences in its solicitation and award of the contract.he alleged that these preferences prevented him,as a business owner,from competing for subcontracting work on an equal basis.braunstein sought declaratory relief that the dbe program is unconstitutional damages based on,and and an injunction prohibiting defendants from implementing the dbe program.
in september,the district court dismissed the and claims against the state,the department,and the named defendants in their official capacities because of sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.the court found that braunstein alleged sufficient injury to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of standing,but warned that t his is not to say that after appropriate discovery a motion for summary judgment would not succeed.in may,the district court dismissed the damages claims against the named defendants because that provision does not provide for monetary relief against individual defendants.
in may,after the parties had finished discovery and filed cross motions for summary judgment,the district court dismissed as moot braunstein claims for injunctive and declaratory relief because the department had suspended its dbe program in.this left only braunstein damages claims against the state and the department under,and against the named defendants in their individual capacities under and.the court questioned sua sponte whether braunstein had article iii standing to pursue these remaining claims and ordered him to show cause demonstrating a redressable injury.the court wrote that it was difficult to see how braunstein was harmed by the dbe program.
in june,the district court concluded that braunstein lacked article iii standing to pursue his remaining claims because he had failed to show that the department dbe program had affected him personally.the court noted that braunstein was afforded the opportunity to bid on subcontracting work,and the dbe goal did not serve as a barrier to doing so,nor was it an impediment to his securing a subcontract.the court found that braunstein inability to secure utility location work stemmed from his past unsatisfactory performance for dmjm,not his status as a.t he reason braunstein did not get any of the utility subcontract work from the successful bidder on the contract had nothing to do with the fact that he did not qualify for dbe status,the court wrote.rather,he did not get any of the work because those who were in a position to provide it did not want to do business with braunstein.
in september,the district court awarded defendants attorneys fees under because braunstein and his lawyer persisted in pursuing claims long after it became clear they lacked merit.the court also imposed sanctions against braunstein attorneys under for unreasonably prolonging the proceedings.
braunstein and his attorneys timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
to satisfy article iii standing,a plaintiff must show he has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.bernhardt cnty.of,cir citing friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing these elements.although general allegations of injury can suffice at the pleading stage,the plaintiff must set forth specific facts to survive a motion for summary judgment based on lack of standing.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.a suit brought by a plaintiff without article iii standing is not a case or controversy,and an article iii federal court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.cetacean,at citing steel citizens for a better env t,d.
the supreme court has articulated a broad conception of article iii standing to bring equal protection challenges.in northeastern florida chapter of associated general contractors of america city of jacksonville,florida,d,plaintiff construction firms challenged an affirmative action program that set aside percent of city contracts for minority business enterprises.the court described their as the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process,not the loss of a contract.id.at.the court explained 
when the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group,a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.the injury in fact in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier,not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.
see also regents of of cal.bakke,d principal opinion by powell,plaintiff challenging a medical school affirmative action program need not prove that he would have been admitted absent the challenged program because his injury was the inability to compete for all seats in the entering class.the same rule applies where,as here,a prospective subcontractor challenges a government program that gives general contractors a financial incentive to hire subcontractors.adarand constructors,pena,d.
we applied this rule in bras california public utilities commission,cir,where we held that a plaintiff architect had standing to challenge a state law that established aspirational affirmative action goals,rather than strict quotas,for using minority and businesses in public utility contracts.similarly,in monterey mechanical wilson,cir,reh g denied,cir,we held that a general contractor had standing to challenge a state law requiring bidders on public contracts to show a good faith effort to hire a certain percentage of minority and subcontractors.id.
however,article iii standing to bring an equal protection challenge is not without limits.the rule that a plaintiff must assert a particularized injury,rather than a generalized grievance,applies with as much force in the equal protection context as in any other.united states hays,d.even if the government has discriminated on the basis of race,only those who are personally denied equal treatment have a cognizable injury under article iii.allen wright,d internal quotation omitted see also valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d rejecting the notion that every citizen has standing to challenge an affirmative action program.thus,in carroll nakatani,cir,we held that a plaintiff lacked standing to challenge racial preferences in a government loan program where the plaintiff filed only a symbolic,incomplete application and did not demonstrate an ability to compete for the loan.see also moose lodge irvis,d plaintiff lacked standing to challenge an organization racially discriminatory membership policy where he never sought to become a member.
braunstein argues that he has article iii standing because the dbe program prevented him from competing for subcontracts on an equal basis.it is true that braunstein challenges an affirmative action program that gave prime contractors an incentive to hire dbe subcontractors.but braunstein has not provided any evidence showing that the department dbe program affected him personally or that it impeded his ability to compete for utility location work on an equal basis.
braunstein wanted the prime bidding firms to select his company as a subcontractor to perform the utility location work under the contract with the department.however,unlike the prospective subcontractor plaintiffs in adarand,at,and western states,at,braunstein did not submit a quote or a bid to any of the prime contractors bidding on the government contract.he merely contacted the firms that bid on the contract.as a result,braunstein is like the plaintiff in carroll who filed an incomplete loan application and can not demonstrate he has been denied equal treatment.at.
braunstein argues that,under northeastern and bras,he need only establish that he was able and ready to seek subcontracting work under the contract.northeastern,at bras,at see also gratz bollinger,d plaintiff had standing to challenge university transfer admissions policy,even though he never applied as a transfer student,because he demonstrated that he was able and ready to do so.however,the plaintiffs in those cases sought prospective relief against government affirmative action programs.see,at bras,at gratz,at.here,the district court dismissed as moot braunstein claims for declaratory and injunctive relief because the department had suspended its dbe program ten months before he brought the suit.braunstein does not challenge that ruling on appeal.see western states,at.because braunstein surviving claims are for damages rather than prospective relief,he must show more than that he is able and ready to seek subcontracting work.see laidlaw,at plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for prospective and retrospective relief.
as in carroll,braunstein has done essentially nothing to demonstra
