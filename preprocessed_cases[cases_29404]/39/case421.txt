this interlocutory appeal is the latest in a line of attempts by the government to raise the unavoidable delays defense in breach of contract actions stemming from its failure to accept spent nuclear fuel snf from the nation nuclear utilities.in a combination of two decisions,the united states court of federal claims struck the government affirmative defense.entergy nuclear fitzpatrick,llc united states,entergy fitzpatrick i entergy nuclear fitzpatrick,llc united states,entergy fitzpatrick ii.because the court of federal claims correctly applied the nebraska public power rule,this court affirms the decision to strike the government unavoidable delays defense.
in early,the nuclear waste policy act nwpa established a comprehensive scheme to accept and dispose of snf and other radioactive waste hlw generated from the operation of nuclear power plants.see.addressing the national problem of storage and disposal of these materials,the act imposed on the government the responsibility to provide permanent disposal,while the costs of that disposal should be the responsibility of the generators and owners of such waste and spent fuel.id.a.the act also made the utilities responsible to provide and pay for snf storage until the united states department of energy doe accepts the material in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.id.a.
the nwpa authorized the secretary of energy to enter into contracts with nuclear utilities for the acceptance,transportation,and disposal of snf in return for payment of fees by the utilities.id.a.the act set specific requirements for these contracts,including when doe was to start accepting the snf and other radioactive waste.section a of the nwpa requires 
contracts entered into under this section shall provide that 
a following commencement of operation of a repository,the secretary shall take title to the radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel involved as expeditiously as practicable upon the request of the generator or owner of such waste or spent fuel and 
b in return for the payment of fees established by this section,the secretary,beginning not later than january,will dispose of the radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel involved as provided in this subchapter.
a emphasis added.
later,doe promulgated a regulation containing a contract,known as the standard contract.standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel high level radioactive waste,codified at.in compliance with the statute,the standard contract states that doe will begin acceptance of snf not later than january,in exchange for fees paid by the utilities,art.ii.
the nwpa also provided that the nuclear regulatory commission shall not issue or renew a license to any nuclear utility unless the utility has entered into a contract with doe,or doe certifies that good faith negotiations to enter such a contact are ongoing.b a.as this court noted in maine yankee,the nwpa effectively made entry into such contracts mandatory for the utilities.maine yankee atomic power united states,maine yankee.as a result,the nation nuclear utilities including the power authority of the state of new york,the original owner of the entergy nuclear power stations at issue here entered into contracts with doe and began making payments to doe.
by,doe knew it would be unable to accept snf by the january,deadline.it initiated a proceeding to address its obligations under the nwpa.doe opened the proceeding with its notice of inquiry on waste acceptance issues stating its preliminary finding that doe had no statutory obligation to accept snf beginning in in the absence of an operational repository or other facility constructed under the nwpa,may,indiana michigan power dep t of energy,indiana michigan.in april,doe issued its final interpretation that acknowledged it would not begin accepting snf by the january,deadline and took the position that it did not have an unconditional obligation to begin performance on that date,may.a number of parties petitioned the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia for review of the final interpretation.
the circuit held that section a b of the nwpa creates an obligation in doe,reciprocal to the utilities obligation to pay,to start disposing of the snf no later than january.indiana michigan,at.the circuit found that doe statutory obligation to meet the deadline was without qualification or condition.id.at northern states power dep t of energy,northern states.contrary to that ruling,and without seeking rehearing or further review by the supreme court,doe informed the utilities that it would not begin accepting nuclear waste by the statutory deadline.northern states,at.the utilities returned to the circuit seeking a writ of mandamus compelling doe to begin accepting snf on time.while that case was pending,doe asserted that under the standard contract unavoidable delays clause,it was not obligated to provide a financial remedy for the delay in performance.id.article ix of the standard contract contains provisions for delays.section a covers unavoidable delays by purchaser or doe and precludes a party liability for damages caused by failure to perform its obligations hereunder,if such failure arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the party failing to perform,art.ix a.
the circuit denied the specific writ requested by the utilities.while acknowledging that doe approach toward contractual remedies was inconsistent with the nwpa and the court holding in indiana michigan,the circuit found that the standard contract provides a potentially adequate remedy if doe fails to fulfill its obligations by the deadline.northern states,at.in doing so,the circuit rejected doe argument that it was not obligated to accept nuclear waste because its failure was unavoidable within the meaning of the unavoidable delays clause.id.at.reaffirming that the nwpa imposes an unconditional duty on doe to take the materials by,the circuit issued a writ of mandamus precluding doe from advancing any construction of the standard contract that would excuse its delinquency on the ground that it has not yet established a permanent repository or an interim storage program.id.at.accordingly,our sister circuit ordered doe to proceed with contractual remedies in a manner consistent with nwpa command that it undertake an unconditional obligation to begin disposal of the snf by january.id.at.the circuit also issued a order clarifying the scope of its northern states decision.northern states power dep t of energy,wl.may.the court explained that it had barred the doe from interpreting the standard contract as imposing only a contingent disposal obligation such an interpretation,we ruled,would place the doe in violation of its statutory duties under the nwpa,which required it to undertake an unconditional obligation.id.at.
to date,the utilities continue to make payments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars each year,even though doe has yet to accept any nuclear waste.so far,dozens of standard contract holders have sued the government in the court of federal claims seeking damages for doe delay in accepting snf.this court has addressed the standard contract on numerous occasions and held that the government failure to begin accepting snf as of january,is a partial breach of the contract.see,maine yankee,at.
this court,sitting en banc,addressed the circuit indiana michigan and northern states decisions in.nebraska public power dist.united states,en banc nebraska public power.in nebraska public power,the government asserted the unavoidable delays defense against a claim for damages resulting from doe failure to accept nuclear waste as of january.first,this court confirmed the circuit jurisdiction over the utilities statutory claim arising under section of the nwpa.id.at.the circuit mandamus order focused on statutory interpretation and did not impermissibly trespass upon the jurisdiction of the court of federal claims to determine the parties contractual rights.id.accordingly,the circuit mandamus order was afforded res judicata effect.id.
the nebraska public power opinion characterized the circuit opinion as precluding the gove
