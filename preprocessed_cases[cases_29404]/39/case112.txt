jason mann brought a false claims act fca retaliation action against heckler koch defense,hkd.he argued that hkd took adverse employment action against him because he investigated and opposed hkd attempts to defraud the united states.but mann actions fall outside the scope of fca protection.the fca shields employees from retaliation when they oppose fraud.and the conduct mann opposed involved nothing more than statements made by hkd during the course of a contractual bidding process.the district court rejected mann claim,and we now affirm.
hkd is in the business of selling firearms to united states military and law enforcement agencies.on november,the secret service issued a contract solicitation for rifles for its counterassault team.wayne weber,mann supervisor,believed that the statement of work sow detailing the specifications of the rifle matched up well with hkd rifle.but the sow required two components that were not available on the,ambilevers,which are devices that allow personnel to operate the rifle,and match triggers.nevertheless,hkd submitted its bid along with sample rifles on february.hkd noted that while it did not currently meet the ambilever and match trigger requirements,it would be able to provide these components if it won the bid.
around that same time,weber received aftermarket ambilevers for the from consultant larry vickers.mann and another hkd employee,robbie reidsma,thought that the ambilevers did not fit the and did not meet hkd typical quality standards.vickers echoed these concerns.but weber overruled them.in order to demonstrate that the sample could conform to the sow,weber arranged to deliver the ambilevers to jim galvin,a friend at the secret service.he sent reidsma to deliver the ambilevers to galvin on march,which was after the official close of bidding.
when weber informed mann of this delivery,mann expressed disapproval of weber handling of the bid.mann told weber that he should not have submitted the bid in the first place because it did not meet the sow specifications and that he should not have delivered the ambilevers after the deadline.mann also began investigating whether weber conduct violated federal contracting regulations or other laws.in early april,mann expressed his concerns about weber conduct to numerous hkd employees,who then relayed his concerns to hkd management.
martin newton,ceo of hkd,and the rest of hkd management took prompt action when they learned of mann concerns.newton immediately ordered hkd personnel to halt their informal investigation of mann allegations and instead retained john einwechter,an attorney specializing in these matters,to conduct a formal investigation.hkd also put mann on administrative leave for approximately one week starting on april.during the ensuing investigation,mann relayed his concerns about weber conduct to einwechter.einwechter concluded that while weber may have violated regulatory procedures by contacting galvin outside of proper channels,he did not violate the fca because there was no fraud.weber did not conceal his actions during the bid process,and,therefore,any regulatory violation was open and apparent on its face.
as for the bid,weber strategy proved to be ineffective.hkd began receiving complaints from the secret service in april about the deficiencies in the rifles.this was to be expected because hkd bid submission made plain that the bid was nonconforming.the secret service ultimately rejected hkd bid on may.
on june,mann filed a complaint against hkd,asserting that hkd retaliated against him for engaging in protected activity under the false claims act fca count i and defamed him under virginia law.hkd placed mann on administrative leave again on june,and terminated his employment the next month.mann contends he was dismissed because of his efforts to stop hkd attempts to defraud the united states and his filing of a retaliation claim.hkd,however,asserts that mann termination stemmed from his involvement in an unlawful scheme to procure machine guns for a small police force.mann later amended his complaint to assert an additional claim of retaliation on the theory that hkd retaliated against him for filing his initial retaliation claim count ii.
hkd filed a motion to dismiss all claims,which the district court granted with respect to count ii.hkd later moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims,and the district court granted that motion on july.mann heckler koch defense,d.the district court noted that mann never identified any instance of hkd making a false statement or engaging in fraudulent conduct.id.at.without evidence of a false or fraudulent claim against the united states,the district court reasoned,there was no reasonable possibility that hkd was violating the fca.id.therefore,mann did not qualify for fca protection.id.mann now appeals the district court rulings with respect to his claims of retaliation under the fca.
in this appeal,mann contends that hkd retaliated against him for his investigation of and opposition to hkd attempt to defraud the united states.mann also asserts that hkd retaliated against him for his filing of the initial retaliation claim.we shall first set forth the framework for addressing claims under the fca and then proceed to address mann particular contentions.
the fca is a statutory scheme designed to discourage fraud against the federal government.robertson bell helicopter textron,cir.its roots lie in the rampant fraud perpetrated by contractors against the government during the civil war,and it has served ever since as a safeguard against unscrupulous government contractors.wilkins louis hous,cir.the cornerstone provision of the fca prohibits any person from presenting a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the united states.a.
there are two enforcement mechanisms to police this prohibition.first,the attorney general can bring a civil action to remedy violations of.a.second,a private party can bring a qui tam action,which is an action brought in the name of the united states.b graham county soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson.
congress amended the fca in,adding an provision to protect whistleblowers.false claims amendments act of,stat.the relevant part of this provision states 
any employee who is discharged,demoted,suspended,threatened,harassed,or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section,including investigation for,initiation of,testimony for,or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section,shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.
the purpose of h is to promote enforcement of the fca by assur ing those who may be considering exposing fraud that they are legally protected from retaliatory acts,at.congress recognize d that few individuals will expose fraud if they fear their disclosures will lead to harassment,demotion,loss of employment,or any other form of retaliation,and,accordingly,sought to halt companies and individuals from using the threat of economic retaliation to silence whistleblowers.id.in furtherance of this goal,h creates a cause of action for employees who suffer retaliation for taking measures to prevent contractor fraud against the united states.
employees seeking to bring a cause of action under h must meet three elements derived from the statutory text.zahodnick int l business machines,cir.an employee must prove that he took acts in furtherance of a qui tam suit his employer knew of these acts and his employer took adverse action against him as a result of these acts.id.only the first element,referred to as the protected activity prong,is at issue in the instant case.
an employee need not actually file a qui tam suit to engage in protected activity,however.eberhardt integrated design,cir.protected activity encompasses measures taken in furtherance of an action filed or to be filed under this section.h emphasis added.the to be filed language manifests congress intent to protect employees while they are collecting information about a possible fraud,before they have put all the pieces of the puzzle together.united states ex rel.yesudian howard.
accordingly,the protected activity element includes situations in which litigation could be filed legitimately and excludes those in which an employee fabricates a tale of fraud to extract concessions from the employer,or just imagines fraud but lacks proof.neal honeywell,cir,abrogated on other grounds by graham county,at.thus,employees engage in protected activity when they meet what has been called the distinct possibility standard.under this standard,protected activity occurs when an employee opposition to fraud takes place in a context where litigation is a distinct possibility,when the conduct reasonably could lead to a viable fca action,or when litigation is a reasonable possibility.eberhardt,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the distinct possibility standard is an objective one.it enjoys widespread support among the circuits because it focuses attention on the ills the statute is designed to prevent.see,eberhardt,at yesudian,at united states ex rel.hopper anton,cir neal,at,abrogated on other grounds by graham county,at.and the consensus view is that this standard requires that protected activity relate to company conduct that involves an objectively reasonable possibility of an fca action.see eberhardt,at.things muddy a bit when determining how to apply the test.some courts take the perspective of the employee,considering only those facts known by the employee during the course of the protected conduct.see yesudian,at.others adopt the employer perspective,taking into account the facts known by the employer at the time of the retaliation.see united states ex rel.sanchez lymphatx,cir.
this apparent disagreement is illusory.courts who take the employer perspective are merely combining the first element of h,that the employee engaged in protected activity,with the second element,that the employer is aware of the employee conduct.for example,in sanchez,the circuit posed the dispositive question as whether an employee actions are sufficient to support a reasonable conclusion that the employer could have feared being sued in a qui tam action.id.
combining the protected activity and notice elements is a perfectly reasonable approach when both elements are in dispute.but where,as in the instant case,only the protected activity element is at issue,viewing the distinct possibility standard from the employer perspective makes little sense.such an interpretation would render the second element of a h claim superfluous because the definition of protected activity would include notice to the employer.and w e can not interpret a statute in a manner that would render some of its language meaningless.etape chertoff,cir.
furthermore,this interpretation would deny protection to an employee who acted reasonably if the employer happened to know additional facts that defeat the possibility of an fca action.such a result would certainly not be consistent with congress intent that the fca shield employees who take reasonable measures to oppose fraud.therefore,when the sole question relates to an employee protected activity,we apply the distinct possibility standard from the perspective of the facts known by the employee at the time of the protected conduct.
mann contends that he engaged in protected activity by opposing and investigating hkd attempts to defraud the united states.but mann can not meet the distinct possibility standard because of one undeniable fact there was no fraud.therefore,based on the facts known to mann at the time of his conduct,there was no reasonable possibility that his efforts could lead to a viable fca action.
first we consider mann actions opposing hkd bid efforts.these fall into three categories mann opposed hkd submitting the bid,using aftermarket ambilevers,and delivering the ambilevers after the close of bidding.first turning to mann opposition to hkd bid submission,mann admission that he never read the final version of the bid until the onset of this litigation casts some doubt upon his claims.the relevant bid language states,ambidextrous fire lever currently not available for delivery date timeline of test weapons.it will be available if bidder is successful.mann views this straightforward language as an attempt to fraudulently induce the united states into accepting a nonconforming bid.that may well be his sincere belief,but it is not an objectively reasonable one.
the fca covers only false or fraudulent claims,and the bid language demonstrates that hkd conduct was open and straightforward,not fraudulent.a a.hkd made no effort to hide the defects in its bid.rather,it took care to point them out so as not to deceive the united states.indeed,the bid explicitly stated that hkd could not,at that time,meet the ambilever and trigger specifications.thus,hkd submitted a bid free of false statements or efforts to camouflage defects.it was unreasonable,to say the least,to expect opposition to such a bid to lead to a viable fca action.
mann also takes exception to bid language indicating that while the ambilevers are currently in production and available,they will not be available for the initial delivery date of the test weapons.mann claims that this statement is false,a contention hkd disputes.in any event,the relevant facts under the distinct possibility standard are not what mann now knows.rather,they are what mann knew at the time of the protected conduct.and mann has failed to produce any evidence on appeal that he ever raised this issue with anyone prior to the instant litigation.indeed,he might not even have been aware of this bid language before his termination because he had not read the final version of the bid at that time.accordingly,mann newfound concerns over the in production language are not helpful to his claim.
mann actions regarding the bid submission are best characterized not as opposing fraud,but as voicing disagreement concerning the bid strategy.he entertained business concerns regarding a bid that did not meet all the requirements.but the fca does not empower courts to adjudicate strategic business decisions and to protect the dissenters from these decisions from all consequences.see united states ex rel.owens first kuwaiti general trading contracting,cir.the fca scope is commensurate with its purpose.it covers only fraudulent claims against the united states without fraud,there can be no fca action.accordingly,while mann may or may not have been correct as a matter of business strategy,his conduct falls outside the scope of the fca.
turning to the procurement of aftermarket ambilevers,mann expressed concern over the quality of the ambilevers.specifically,mann thought the ambilevers fit too loosely on the.but hkd management disagreed and deemed the ambilevers to be of acceptable quality.accordingly,there was a disagreement between hkd management and mann about what component part features were most suitable for purposes of the bid.
these sorts of disagreements occur all the time,but they do not rise to the level of fraud unless there is a claim made on the public fisc that misrepresents the quality of a product in an effort to achieve an unwarranted payment for inferior goods.see luckey baxter healthcare,cir.mann never identifies any instance where hkd misrepresented the quality of the ambilevers or in any way overbilled.indeed,hkd bid submission does not even discuss the quality of the ambilevers.without such a misrepresentation,mann opposed nothing more than a business decision,and this can not form the basis of an fca action.see owens,at.if it did,fca litigation would extend to innumerable business judgment calls that involve no fraudulent misrepresentations.and the resulting legal morass would serve as an impediment to productive government contracting,just as fraudulent practices unquestionably do.id.
as for mann opposition to the delivery of the ambilevers after the close of bidding,mann once again fails to demonstrate the existence of fraud.hkd conduct was certainly unconventional.indeed,it submitted the ambilevers outside of normal channe
