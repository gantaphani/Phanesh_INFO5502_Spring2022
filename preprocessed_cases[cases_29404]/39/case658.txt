background 
the facts relevant to the issue before us are not in dispute.awad dealings with the united states government began in,when he notified the embassy in switzerland of a bombing plot by the may organization,a radical terrorist group.awad association with the may organization led the department of justice to seek his testimony in the planned prosecution of mohammed rashid,the leader of the may organization,who was believed to have been responsible for the bombing of a pan american world airways pan am flight in.
awad was approached by daniel bent,the attorney for the district of hawaii,and larry lippe,an attorney with the department of justice.bent and lippe told awad that,in return for his testimony against rashid,he would receive citizenship and a passport.awad agreed to cooperate with the government,and was brought to the united states in december of.upon his arrival in the united states,awad entered the marshals service witness security program witsec.in the course of his enrollment in witsec,awad signed a memorandum of understanding which outlined the details of the witsec program and the obligations of both awad and the marshals service.the memorandum of understanding provided that awad was to surrender all identification to the marshals service for safekeeping and that in return he would be given new identification documents.the memorandum of understanding stated in relevant part as follows 
the witness acknowledges that it is necessary to place in safekeeping with the marshals service all identification documents driver license,credit cards,that reveal true identity for reasons of security.the marshals service agrees to retain these documents indefinitely,and will return the documents to the witness should desire to revert to true identity.
in keeping with the memorandum of understanding,awad turned over his passport to the marshals service.awad stayed in the witsec program until may of,when he voluntarily withdrew.at that time,he unsuccessfully requested the return of his passport.
in,awad testified before a federal grand jury investigating mohammed rashid role,and that of the may organization,in the pan am flight bombing.in addition,in and,awad traveled to greece and testified against rashid in criminal proceedings there.
meanwhile,awad engaged in efforts to obtain citizenship or,in the alternative,to retrieve his passport.shortly after receiving awad grand jury testimony,bent took awad to the boston office of the immigration and naturalization services ins and assisted him in completing paperwork for political asylum,having explained to awad that he had to receive political asylum as a prerequisite to citizenship.awad was granted political asylum in april of.at that time,he received a refugee travel document but not a passport.eventually,in,largely through his own efforts,awad received citizenship and a passport.his passport never was returned to him.
awad eventually brought suit in the northern district of mississippi,asserting against the united states various causes of action in his amended complaint,filed in may of,awad alleged false imprisonment,conspiracy,intentional infliction of emotional distress,bad faith breach of contract,invasion of privacy,negligence,trespass to chattels,and conversion.see awad,wl at.awad stated in his amended complaint that his causes of action arose under the first,fourth,fifth,eighth and ninth amendments to the constitution of the united states,section,et,section,the tucker act,and other laws and treaties of the united states.am.compl.at,awad,wl.awad based his tucker act claims,see a,upon his oral agreement with bent and lippe the agreement,am.compl.at and,the memorandum of understanding,id.at,and representations that he alleged were made to him by various government agents and representatives,id.at,and.awad stated in his amended complaint that he was seeking to recover million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.am,demand for judgment.
following a bench trial,the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over awad claims.awad,wl at.in the case of each of awad claims alleging a tort,the court determined that the cause of action was grounded in the existence of agreements made with the united states relating to awad providing testimony and entering the witsec program.the court therefore concluded that the cause of action lay within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of federal claims under the tucker act,a,since awad was seeking to recover in excess of.id.at.
the district court determined that awad claim for false imprisonment could not stand independently of a contractual claim,as the required element of detention of the plaintiff necessarily relied on the failure of the united states to fulfill its alleged contractual duty to supply awad with citizenship and a passport.id.at.likewise,the court determined that awad claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was inextricably intertwined with the government supposed breach.id.at.according to the district court,the outrageous government conduct necessary to support such a claim was dependent upon the government breach of its alleged contractual obligations to awad.id.as to awad negligence claim,the court determined that the claim necessarily arose from the government alleged breach of contract 
any duty the government had to provide awad with united states citizenship or a passport sprang initially from the agreement awad allegedly made with bent and lippe likewise,any duty the government had to return awad passport sprang initially from the agreement awad allegedly made with the united states marshals service.
