background 
the pertinent facts are not in dispute.on february,the air force issued a request for proposals rfp for advisory and assistance services to support the aerospace research,development,test,and evaluation activities ardteas at the air force flight test center at edwards air force base in california.id.at.
the ardteas procurement was a small business set aside.id.at.under the small business act,a party may not be awarded a contract as a small business concern unless it agrees that,in the case of a contract for services except construction,at least percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.o a.the limitation on subcontracting los clause,set forth at,implements the mandate of the act.the los clause requires an offeror to agree that at least percent of its personnel costs under the contract will be based upon work of its own employees.the clause states 
b by submission of an offer and execution of a contract,the agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for 
services except construction.at least percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.
id.the rfp incorporated the los clause by reference.centech.at.
the air force disclosed to prospective offerors for the ardteas contract that it would interpret the los clause in accordance with air force policy memorandum the policy memorandum.id.at.accordingly,prior to issuing the rfp,on august,the air force electronically transmitted the policy memorandum to prospective offerors.id.the transmission stated in pertinent part as follows 
far clause,limitations on subcontracting,which applies to small business contracts,states the small business prime contractor must perform specified minimum amounts of work,when the contract has been set aside for a small business 
w ithin air force material command,we interpret the clause at to mean that the minimum amounts of work can be performed by the collective efforts of either small business members of a formal joint venture or a small business prime contractor together with the first tier small business subcontractor s,when the circumstances outlined in attachment are present.
id.at quoting the policy memorandum footnotes omitted.attachment to the policy memorandum stated that p teams could be a mix of large business and small business subcontractors so long as performance of work requirements was met by the cooperative efforts of the small prime contractor and the small business members of the subcontractor group.id.at quoting attachment.in short,according to the policy memorandum,a small business prime contractor could meet the requirements of the los clause if at least percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel was based upon the work of employees of the small business prime contractor alone,or in combination with the work of employees of small business subcontractors with which the prime contractor entered into a cooperative effort.
four offerors,including centech and the incumbent contractor,tybrin corporation tybrin,submitted proposals in response to the rfp.id.centech proposed to apportion the work between its own employees and those of subcontractors,including a large and a small business.id.more specifically,relying on the policy memorandum in structuring its proposed model,centech planned to incur itself percent of the total cost of contract personnel using its own employees.the proposal indicated,however,that centech would combine the efforts of its own employees and small business subcontractor employees so that the resulting combined personnel costs would exceed percent of the personnel costs incurred in performing the contract work.id.
after offers were submitted,the air force source selection evaluation team sset evaluated centech proposal for compliance with the los clause.the sset determined that,based on its proposal,centech would and could comply with the los clause.on april,the air force awarded the ardteas contract to centech.id.at.centech awarded contract incorporated the los clause by reference.id.
on may,tybrin protested the award of the contract to the government accountability office gao claiming that the air force had failed to evaluate submitted proposals in accordance with the rfp stated evaluation criteria.id.subsequently,on june,tybrin filed a supplemental protest with gao,claiming that the air force should have disqualified centech proposal for noncompliance with the los clause.id.responding to tybrin supplemental protest,the air force conceded that centech proposed that its own employees would account for only percent of the cost of contract performance.id.the air force stated,however,that centech proposal complied with the los clause as interpreted by the policy memorandum,because the collective efforts of the personnel from centech and its small business subcontractors would exceed percent of the cost of contract performance for personnel.id.
after receiving tybrin supplemental protest,gao sought the views of the small business administration sba.id.responding,the sba took the position that,in accordance with o a and its own regulation,see a,a small business receiving a contract must agree to meet by itself the requirements of the los clause.centech.at.the sba regulation states that a small business must agree that,i n the case of a contract for services except construction,the concern will perform at least percent of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel with its own employees.a.
on august,the air force stayed performance of centech contract while it reconsidered whether centech met the conditions of the rfp.centech.at.accordingly,that same day,gao dismissed all of tybrin protests as moot.id.six days later,the air force retracted the policy memorandum.id.on august,centech notified the contracting officer by mail that,while its initial cost proposal was consistent with the policy memorandum,it,by itself,had already performed work accounting for more than percent of the personnel costs under the contract to date and would continue to do so,as reflected in updated cost models which it submitted to the air force.id.
on september,the contracting officer issued a determination of.id.in the determination,the contracting officer explained that,based on centech proposal indicating that work of its employees would account for only percent of personnel costs under the contract,centech did not meet the subcontracting limitation requirements set forth in the statute and regulation.id.for that reason,the contracting officer considered centech ineligible to receive the ardteas contract.twelve days later,centech challenged the contracting officer determination.id.in particular,centech contended that the contracting officer had erred by refusing to consider the new information it had submitted in the form of updated cost models.id.
on september,the air force referred the matter of centech responsibility to the sba under the sba certificate of competency coc program.the coc program is authorized by the small business act.see b a.a coc is a written instrument issued by the sba to a government contracting officer.it certifies that a small business concern possesses the responsibility to perform a specific procurement contract.see a.by regulation,w hen a solicitation requires a small business to adhere to the limitations on subcontracting,a contracting officer finding that a small business can not comply with the limitation shall be treated as an element of responsibility and shall be subject to the coc process.d see also f stating that c ompliance with the los clause is considered an element of responsibility and not a component of size eligibility.
on september,centech responded to the sba request for information by providing a chart that showed how it would meet the los requirement.centech.at.other documents provided to the sba by centech included narratives,a compliance matrix,and spreadsheets.id.together,these submissions reflected that centech had changed its previously proposed mix of prime and subcontractor labor costs.id.at.
by letter dated december,the sba informed the contracting officer that,notwithstanding what was stated in centech proposal,the sba had concluded that centech would comply with the subcontracting limitation during its performance of the contract,and that the sba had found centech responsible and had issued a coc to centech.id.at.on december,the air force reinstated the award to centech based on the sba issuance of the coc.id.at.shortly thereafter,on december,tybrin protested to gao the air force reinstatement of the award to centech,claiming that the air force should have found centech proposal unacceptable because,in the proposal,centech did not offer to comply with the los clause.id.
on march,gao sustained tybrin protest.in re tybrin,comp.west,at,wl.in its decision,gao began its analysis by stating that,a s a general matter,an agency judgment as to whether a small business offeror will be able to comply with a subcontracting limitation presents a question of responsibility for review by the sba id.at,wl.gao noted,however,that it had consistently held that where a proposal,on its face,should lead an agency to the conclusion that an offeror has not agreed to comply with the subcontracting limitation,the matter is one of the proposal acceptability.id.gao further noted that it had long held that a proposal that fails to conform to a material term or condition of the solicitation,including the subcontracting limitation,is unacceptable and may not form the basis for an award.id.on that basis,gao concluded that,g iven the air force determination that centech proposal failed to comply with a material term of the solicitation the subcontracting limitation and,accordingly,that the proposal could not form the basis for award under the rfp,the agency shouldhave found centech proposal to be unacceptable,rather than finding centech nonresponsible and forwarding the matter to the sba for its consideration.id.at,wl.
gao acknowledged the sba disagreement with its gao view that where a proposal,on its face,should lead the contracting agency to the conclusion that an offeror has not agreed to comply with the subcontracting limitation,the matter is one of the proposal acceptability,rather than the offeror responsibility.id.rejecting the sba position,gao stated 
t he issue here does not concern whether a bidder or offeror can or will comply with the subcontracting limitation requirement during performance of the contract where we recognize that the matter is one of responsibility or,in certain cases,contract administration,but rather,whether the bidder or offeror has specifically taken exception to the subcontracting limitation requirement on the face of its bid or proposal.given that the determination in this latter,limited circumstance involves the evaluation of a bid or proposal for compliance with a material term of the solicitation,the determination is one of responsiveness or acceptability,rather than responsibility.
id.at,wl.gao concluded by recommending that the air force reopen discussions and request and review revised proposals,evaluate those submissions consistent with the terms of the solicitation,and make a new source selection decision.id.at,wl.
on march,the sba requested reconsideration of gao decision.centech.at.the sba took issue with gao statement in in re tybrin,comp.west at,wl,that the record establishes that it was clear to the air force that centech proposal as submitted and as evaluated provided that percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel would be expended for centech employees,and,accordingly,that centech did not meet the subcontracting limitation requirements set forth in statute and regulation.the sba contended that it was never clear to the air force whether centech proposal met or did not meet the limitation,arguing that it is not uncommon for contracting officers and procuring agencies to misunderstand the limitations on subcontracting requirements and how to calculate the requirement.the sba maintained that the referral to the sba,an expert in the subcontracting limitations,was therefore appropriate.
gao denied sba request on april.in its denial,gao stated that it found unpersuasive sba suggestion that the air force did not understand the subcontracting limitation.in re small bus,no.gao read the record as a whole to be replete with statements evidencing the air force understanding and its recognition that centech proposal did not meet the subcontracting limitation requirements.id.gao found that the sba failed to set out any factual or legal grounds that would warrant reversal or modification of its decision,as required by gao standard for reconsideration.id.
in response to gao recommendation,the air force issued an amendment to the solicitation requesting revised proposals.centech.at.all four original offerors,including centech,submitted revised proposals on july.the revised proposals were under consideration on october,the date of oral argument before us.oral arg.at,available at search case.
on july,centech filed suit in the court of federal claims,seeking reinstatement of its original award and a declaration that the air force decision to follow gao recommendation and take corrective action was arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion.centech.at.centech asked the court to enjoin the air force from expending any funds for the services contemplated by the ardteas procurement except under the contract originally awarded to centech.id.at.tybrin intervened in the suit.id.at.
centech argued that the air force irrationally followed gao recommendation,where gao mischaracterized the matter of los compliance as one of acceptability as opposed to contract administration.id.at.as seen,the air force took corrective action based upon gao determination that centech proposal was unacceptable because it failed to meet the requirement of the los clause.id.at.according to centech,compliance with the los clause was not required to be evaluated as a condition for award,but instead should have been examined after award,once the air force actual requirements were defined.id.at.under centech theory,its representation in its proposal that it would perform only percent of the labor itself did not render its proposal unacceptable because its failure to meet that clause was not a failure to meet a mandatory,material requirement of the solicitation,but was a matter of contract administration.id.
pursuant to court of federal claims rule,centech and tybrin and the government filed for judgment on the administrative record regarding the air force decision to follow gao recommendation.the court of federal claims denied centech declaratory and injunctive relief,holding that the air force had been justified in following gao recommendation.id.at.the court first pointed out that o provides that a concern may not be awarded a contract as a small business contractor unless it agrees to perform at least percent of the cost of personnel with its own personnel.id.at.the court stated that centech proposal,on its face,did not do that.id.at.the court continued as such,centech proposal violated the mandate of the small business act,which makes the prime contractor agreement to perform percent of the labor costs itself a prerequisite to obtaining the award.id.
the court of federal claims next stated that gao had correctly determined that centech proposal was unacceptable because it failed to comply with the los mandator
