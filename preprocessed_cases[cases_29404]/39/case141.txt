barnard construction barnard sued the city of lubbock,texas city for breach of contract in the northern district of texas.the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment,and barnard appeals.
barnard submitted the lowest bid for a pipeline construction contract to the city.the city hired an independent engineering company to act as engineer for the project.the engineer was responsible for,inter alia,the bid form for the pipeline construction project.the bid form included a line item for rock excavation,but only for one of the fifteen pipelines line,because the engineer data suggested that rock excavation was needed only in the one pipeline.prior to the bidding process,the city expressly stated that the engineer data was for informational purposes only,and that bidders had the opportunity to drill their own test holes.the city also offered a question and answer session prior to bidding and made changes to the pipeline construction contract via addenda as a result of the question and answer session.barnard did not drill its own test holes.
barnard and the city entered into a written contract.the city estimated that cubic yards of rock would need excavating from line but whatever quantity of rock was excavated from line,the city would pay barnard at the unit price for which they bid.in performance of the contract,barnard discovered lines other than line required rock excavation as well.barnard excavated rock from several lines other than line.after barnard billed the city for all rock excavated,the city initially paid,but later offset payment for rock excavated outside of line.barnard sued for breach of contract and on appeal argues for reversal of summary judgment.first,barnard argues that the city decision to pay for all rock excavated is a final,conclusive decision pursuant to the contract.in response,the city maintains it had communicated to barnard before or at the time of payment that it might later offset payment for rock excavated outside of line in addition,barnard argues that the contract is unambiguous in its terms requiring payment of all rock excavated,or alternatively,that it is ambiguous thereby warranting reversal of summary judgment.
we review an appeal from summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.degan ford motor,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.because this suit is based on diversity jurisdiction,we apply texas substantive law to determine whether the city was entitled to summary judgment.fireman fund ins.murchison,cir.
we review the interpretation of a contract,including the question of whether the contract is ambiguous,de novo.constitution state ins,cir citation omitted.
barnard first argument,that the city decision to pay for all rock excavated is a final,conclusive decision pursuant to the contract,fails because the contract grants the city authority to make a final determination regarding the amount and quantity of work done by barnard in excavating rock.paragraph of the general conditions reads,in pertinent part 
any decision by the owner representative,or deemed denial by the owner representative,shall be final and conclusive in the absence of fraud.
paragraph of the general conditions of the agreement,clearly states,in pertinent part 
unless otherwise specified,it is mutually agreed between the parties to this agreement that the owner representative has the authority to review all work included herein.the owner representative has the authority to stop the work whenever such stoppage may be necessary to ensure the proper execution of the contract.the owner representative shall,in all cases,determine the amounts and quantities of the several kinds of work which are to be paid under the contract documents,and shall determine all questions in relation to said work and the construction thereof,and shall,in all cases,decide every question which may arise relative to the execution of this contract on the part of said contractor.
the record is clear that the city,via the owner representative,told barnard that it was only considering barnard request to pay for rock outside of line barnard does not allege the city has committed fraud in making this decision.the owner representative made a final decision as to the amount and quantity of excavated rock for which barnard was to be paid when it determined under the contract that it need not pay for rock excavated outside of line.
barnard second argument also fails.first,it argues that the contract is unambiguous thereby requiring payment for rock excavated outside of line.alternatively,barnard argues the contract is ambiguous and therefore creates a genuine issue of material fact,requiring reversal and remand.whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide.coker coker.if the written contract is worded such that it can be given a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation,then it is not ambiguous and the court will construe the contract as a matter of law.davidson,webster,coker,at.the court must give meaning to each of its provisions,in light of the circumstances surrounding the contract execution,excluding statements of the parties as to what they intended.davidson,at see also universal credit daniel.
first,barnard argues that the following circumstances,which they contend were not taken into account by the district court,existing at the time of execution,support its interpretation that the contract is unambiguous the city provided all the forms for the bidding process and did not allow any alteration of the form or negotiation of the terms no bidder could bid on a unit price for rock anticipated to be encountered except on the blank provided for rock excavation on line and no bidder could increase an amount for work performed on one line in order to pad or cover unpaid work performed on another line.as the argument goes,because barnard could not bid on rock outside of line,it was irrelevant whether it took the opportunity to investigate the conditions outside of line.however,barnard neglects to consider that the city did allow for an opportunity for the bidders to ask questions,a process through which the contract could be changed and through which addenda were added to the contract.
in the general conditions section of the contract,under paragraph,contractor understanding,it states 
it is understood and agreed that the contract has,by careful examination,satisfied itself as to the nature and location of the work,the confirmation of the ground,the character,quality and quantity of materials to be encountered,the character of equipment and facilities needed preliminary to and during the prosecution of the work,and the general and local conditions,and all other matters which in any way affect the work under the contract documents.
unless otherwise specified herein,all loss,expense,or damage to contractor arising out of the nature of the work to be done,or from the action of the elements,or from any unforeseen circumstance and the prosecution of the work,shall be sustained and borne by the contractor at its own cost and expense.
paragraph of the general conditions clearly places the risk of unforeseen circumstances on barnard.see,city of cleveland.barnard bore the risk in undertaking the project under the terms of the contract.
arguing that the city interpretation is unreasonable because it confers a windfall,barnard maintains that paragraph of section of the contract unambiguously mandates payment for rock excavation,including all of the extra cost of equipment and labor associated with the excavation of rock over and above the excavation of nonrock materials in a tunnel or trench.section is titled,measurement and payment.paragraph appears in part,titled,general.the contract has both specific provisions,such as providing a line item for rock excavation only for line,as well as general provisions,for example in section in paragraph labeled rock excavation,in which it states,p ayment will be made at the unit price bid for rock excavation.where a contract appears on
