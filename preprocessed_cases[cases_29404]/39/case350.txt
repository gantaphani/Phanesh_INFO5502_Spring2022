under the act,et,bidders on certain construction projects funded by the federal government must pay workers specified wage rates based upon the type of work performed.see.the department of labor the department or secretary determines the categories of jobs and the prevailing wage rates for those jobs in the community where the construction project will be undertaken.see.this case involves the department conformance regulations,a ii a,which explain how the secretary determines the wages for a type of job that is left out of the department wage decision,but that a contractor subsequently requires for the project.such omissions are not uncommon.
after it had been awarded a federal contract,appellant mistick pbt mistick proposed several types of jobs and accompanying minimum rates of pay that were left out of the secretary determination.mistick argues the department acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by refusing to evaluate mistick proposed wage rates in light of several previously approved types of jobs and accompanying wage rates.the district court agreed with the department that because the conformance process results in a wage rate,and because the supreme court held in united states binghamton,that the courts have no jurisdiction to review whether the secretary wage determination correctly represents the wages prevailing,b,in a locality,the department application of the conformance regulations is insulated from judicial review.we disagree with this conclusion.in accordance with our prior decision in ball,ball brosamer,reich,we conclude that the act does not provide clear and convincing evidence that congress sought to preclude review under the administrative procedure act apa,et,of violations of department regulations.we hold,however,that the department did not apply its conformance regulations here in an arbitrary and capricious fashion.
mistick won a bid to be general contractor for crawford square rental phase iii crawford square,a residential construction project in allegheny county,pennsylvania,which was administered by the urban redevelopment authority of pittsburgh the authority.because the project received federal funding and was subject to the act,the secretary conducted a survey of prevailing wages for similar projects in allegheny county and issued a wage determination in july the wage determination,which applied to crawford square.
mistick needed to employ seven types of workers not addressed by the wage determination operators of backhoes,bobcats,excavators,rollers,graders,and pavers.mistick requested that the authority conform these seven types of jobs to classifications found in an earlier wage determination,which was based upon a november wage survey the wage determination.the authority rejected mistick request and concluded that the bobcat classification should be conformed to the wage rates paid to a drywall finisher because the work required of a bobcat operator is not comparable to the power equipment classifications and mistick other requested classifications should be conformed to the wage rates paid to bulldozer operators because each involved the operation of power equipment.mistick objected,contending that the power equipment operator classifications in the wage determination used by the secretary were inapplicable here because they addressed equipment needed on a heavy commercial land development project and crawford square was a residential development.
pursuant to a ii c,the dispute was submitted to the department of labor administrator of the wage and hour division of the employment standards administration the administrator.mistick requested that two and roller conformed to the wage rates paid to drywall finishers and that the other five positions be conformed to the wage rates paid to ornamental ironworkers.a section chief rejected mistick proposal without stating reasons and approved the authority determination consequently,bobcat operators were assigned a wage rate of and the other six positions were assigned a wage rate of.mistick appealed to the administrator.mistick agreed that the bobcat operator position was properly conformed to the wage rate paid to drywall finishers,but objected to conforming the remaining six classifications to the much higher wage rate paid to a bulldozer operator.these six classifications,mistick contended,all involved operating light machinery much closer in nature to a bobcat which had been conformed to the drywall finisher position than a bulldozer.at most,mistick argued that these classifications involved the skill of a drywall finisher or an ornamental ironworker.
the administrator declined to conform the six remaining new classifications to the drywall finisher or ornamental ironworker positions.instead,the administrator conformed these positions to the bulldozer classification,citing one of the agency past decisions,tower construction,wl dep t of labor,wage appeals bd,for the proposition that the administrator will not conform power equipment operator positions to equipment operator classifications.the administrator noted that it made no change to the bobcat classification only because mistick did not take issue with that conformance.pursuant to b,mistick appealed to the administrative review board the board.mistick argued to the board that if the administrator was going to follow tower construction,it would be more reasonable to conform the six new equipment operator positions to the conformed bobcat operator classification and not the more highly skilled bulldozer classification.mistick also argued that tower construction was and that it was arbitrary for the administrator to compare mistick requested classifications only to power equipment operator positions.
the board rejected mistick challenge but did not offer any findings why these new classifications differed from the bobcat classification.instead,the board relied upon procedural grounds and concluded that it need not compare mistick six requested classifications with the bobcat classification.the board also determined that the administrator properly followed tower construction by comparing mistick six remaining requested classifications only to power equipment operator positions.
on august,mistick filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia alleging violations of the act and the apa.the district court held that binghamton precluded judicial review of mistick challenge to the department application of its conformance regulations because the essence of mistick challenge falls upon the correctness of the department decision rather than the actual procedure that the board employed.mistick pbt chao,slip op.at,wl,at july.in the alternative,the district court held that there was nothing arbitrary and capricious about the board decision to conform the six new classifications to one of the power equipment classifications as opposed to any of the equipment classifications.mistick filed a timely notice of appeal,invoking our jurisdiction under to review the final decision of the district court.
to understand the dispute in this case,some background is needed on the wage determination process employed prior to a construction firm bid for a federal contract and the subsequent conformance process set forth in the department regulations.the board provided a helpful summary of both processes in its opinion,setting out the fundamental differences between the two processes 
a wage determination dictates the minimum wage rates paid to classifications of employees.it is incorporated into bid packages and ultimately into the contract.thus all bidders are provided with the same information concerning the minimum wage rates that must be paid on a federal procurement.the administrator typically engages in extensive analysis of statistical data in determining locally prevailing or rates.interested parties must challenge wage determinations prior to submissions of bids on procurement.this requirement ensures an equitable procurement process in order that competing contractors know in advance of bidding what rates must be paid so that they can bid on an equal basis.
a conformance,on the other hand,entails adding an employment classification omitted from a wage determination.conformance occurs after the conclusion of bidding on the contract and assumes that the wage determination that was included in the bid specifications essentially is correct with the limited deficiency that a needed job classification and wage rate are missing.the conformance mechanism is designed to facilitate expedited addition of a missing classification and wage rate while simultaneously maintaining the integrity of the bidding procedure.the administrator must i determine which classification already listed in the wage determination is most comparable in terms of skill to the class of employee performing under the contract but omitted from the wage determination,and ii derive a wage rate for the omitted class which is reasonably related to the listed rates.the administrator is not required to conduct a wage survey or to issue a de novo wage determination in order to effect a conformance.

in united states binghamton,a successful bidder for a contract sought damages from the government because the wage determination upon which its bid was based contained wage rates that were too low and left it unable to obtain workmen at the rates specified in the contract schedule id.at.the court rejected the bidder claim and held that when the secretary determines what wages are prevailing in a locality,see b formerly,that determination is not an affirmative representation that the bidder is entitled to rely on in the computation of its bid.at.while the act provides a cause of action for employees to recover from the contractor the amount due the employees under the minimum wage schedule,id.at,t he act does not authorize or contemplate any assurance to a successful bidder that the specified minima will in fact be the prevailing rates,id.at.thus,t he correctness of the secretary determination is not open to attack on judicial review.id.at.
discussing binghamton,the supreme court has since noted that while the correctness of the secretary wage rate determination is not subject to judicial review,a t least two courts of appeals have held,however,that the practices and procedures of the secretary are reviewable under the standards of the administrative procedure act,et.research,coutu,d citing virginia marshall,cir.constr.trades council goldschmidt,cir emphasis added additional citation omitted.the court,however,express ed no view on the latter question.at.
the department argues that this case falls within the category of decisions that binghamton holds are not subject to judicial review.we disagree with the department and conclude that the department application of its conformance regulations is subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act.under the conformance process,as prescribed by a ii a,the secretary must determine whether a proposed rate reasonably relates to existing rates in the wage determination.the department argues that because the result of the conformance process is the determination of a wage rate,binghamton bar applies and the department application of the conformance regulations must also be immune from judicial review under the apa.
but this argument reads too much into binghamton.binghamton determined only that the act does not provide contractors a cause of action for challenging,as the fourth circuit put it,the substantive correctness of the wage determination marshall,at.binghamton does not grant the department license to arbitrarily apply its own regulations with respect to a government contractor and escape all apa review of its practices and procedures in its dealings with a contractor.binghamton does not refer to the apa nor otherwise address in any way the extent to which a contractor may seek apa review of whether the department acted arbitrarily in applying its practices and procedures.
indeed,we have previously reviewed a facial challenge to the validity of the conformance regulations.constr.trades dep t,martin,cert.denied,d.the litigation over the validity of parts of the conformance regulations in martin demonstrates that the conformance process is not,contrary to the district court suggestion,simply something that reflects the secretary view of what are the correct prevailing wages in a community.as the department explained,t he conformance mechanism is designed to maintain the integrity of the bidding procedure the administrator is not required to conduct a wage survey or to issue a de novo wage determination in order to effect a conformance.mistick,slip op.at,wl at.the conformance regulations set out a specific and critical regulatory process that allows the department to exercise binding discretion over contractors and employees in filling a contractual gap,based upon specific standards in a ii a that look not to prevailing wages but what new wage rates would reasonably relate to rates in the wage determination.as binghamton does not answer the question before us,we employ the familiar framework for determining whether congress has precluded a party from seeking apa review of an agency practices and procedures.
the apa provides for judicial review of final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,and allows for judicial review except to the extent that statutes preclude judicial review or agency action is committed to agency discretion by law,a.see also id.with respect to the first exemption,there is a strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action.bowen.acad.of family physicians,d.o nly upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.abbott labs.gardner,d quoting rusk cort,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d.the second exemption is applicable in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.citizens to overton park,volpe,d.
the department directs us to nothing in the act,let alone clear and convincing evidence,demonstrating that congress sought to preclude judicial review of the secretary compliance with the conformance regulations or,looking even to the broader administrative activity at issue here,the department alleged failure to follow its own regulations in its dealings with a contractor.nor are we aware of any such provision.the department does not argue that the conformance regulations are so broad as to constitute one of those rare instances where there is no law to apply.to the contrary,the conformance regulations set out specific criteria that are capable of review.the department argues instead that we should employ a pertinent presumption of statutory construction that congress knows how to create a cause of action when it wants to and presume that congress did not intend for review of the conformance process.as abbott laboratories makes clear,however,the presumption we are to apply cuts the other way.under the apa,absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,we must presume that congress did not intend for the department to be insulated from judicial review in applying the
