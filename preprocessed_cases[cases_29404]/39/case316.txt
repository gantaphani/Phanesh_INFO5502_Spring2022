introduction 
plaintiff,concrete works of colorado,cwc initiated this action in,challenging the constitutionality of an affirmative action ordinance enacted by the city and county of denver hereinafter the city or denver.the ordinance established participation goals for racial minorities and women on certain city construction and professional design projects.denver has amended the ordinance twice since this lawsuit was initiated but it remains essentially unchanged for purposes of this case.
in,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of denver.see concrete works of,city county of denver,concrete works i.after cwc appealed,this court reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for trial.see concrete works of,city county of denver,cir concrete works ii.on remand,a bench trial was held and the district court entered judgment in favor of cwc on its claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.see concrete works of,city county of denver,d,concrete works iii.the district court enjoined denver from enforcing the ordinance.see id.cwc entitlement to damages was reserved and the district court directed entry of judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.see id.at.denver then brought this appeal.
section ii.of this opinion summarizes the challenged denver ordinances and this litigation to date.section iii.generally presents the applicable law and the parties positions thereon.in section,we examine the evidence upon which denver relies to support the ordinances.at trial,denver presented historical evidence,statistical evidence,and anecdotal evidence which are discussed respectively in subsections,and.in section,we discuss the legal framework used by the district court to evaluate denver evidence.section vi.contains a discussion of cwc rebuttal evidence,including its challenges to denver use of marketplace data and to the reliability of denver disparity studies.in section,we address the question of narrow tailoring.
exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,a we reverse and remand.
ii.background 
comprehensive statements of the relevant facts and prior proceedings in this case are fully set out in our previous opinion and in the two district court orders.see concrete works ii,at concrete works iii,d at concrete works i.at.in particular,the most recent order of the district court contains a thorough description of the numerous studies commissioned by the city and the operation of the ordinances.see concrete works iii,d at.consequently we have summarized only the most relevant facts.
the appellate record in this case is prodigious.the trial transcript,including opening and closing statements,exceeds three thousand pages and the entire appellate appendix exceeds ten thousand pages.consequently,the parties ability to cogently frame the issues and provide record support for their respective positions was particularly critical.though we are under no obligation to do so,this court made every reasonable effort to locate pertinent portions of the record when a citation to such was omitted by the parties.
a.the ordinances 
in,the city promulgated an affirmative action program codified as ordinance the ordinance.the ordinance established the mayor office of contract compliance mocc and delegated to that office authority to promulgate such rules and regulations informal guidelines as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of the ordinance.subject to exemptions adopted by the manager of public works,the ordinance applied to all contracts for which bidding was required before the city could make an award.
the ordinance contained annual goals for the utilization of minority business enterprises mbes and women business enterprises wbes.of the total dollars spent annually for construction contracts with the city,the goal was to mbes and to wbes.the annual goals for professional design and construction services were of annual expenditures to mbes and to wbes.mbes were defined in the ordinance as businesses at least owned by one or more eligible minorities and with daily business operations controlled by one or more eligible minorities.minorities were defined as persons of black,hispanic,or american indian descent.wbes were defined as businesses at least owned by one or more women and with daily business operations controlled by one or more women.to participate in the program,both mbes and wbes were required to obtain certification from the city.notwithstanding the requirement to meet annual goals,the mocc could set individualized participation goals for specific city construction and professional design projects.on some projects,goals were set at zero.
prime contractors and subcontractors who bid on city contracts were required to commit to the goals and requirements set forth in the ordinance.bidders could comply with the ordinance by meeting the project participation goals or by demonstrating sufficient good faith efforts to meet those goals.bidders could meet the requirements by demonstrating that they sought to subcontract with but were unsuccessful or that they rejected a certified mbe or wbe because it did not submit the lowest bid or was not qualified.if the bidder failed to meet either the or requirements,the bid was considered not responsive.
in,the city replaced the ordinance with ordinance the ordinance.the district court stated that the ordinance differed from the ordinance as follows 
the ordinance amended the ordinance by expanding the definition of covered contracts to include limited categories of privately financed projects on land added updated information and findings to the statement of factual support for continuing the program refined the requirements for certification and graduation mandated the use of mbes and wbes on change orders and expanded sanctions for improper behavior by mbes,wbes or majority owned contractors in failing to perform the affirmative action commitments made on city projects.it changed the definition of descent by eliminating the provision for blood quantum alternative to tribal membership.
concrete works iii,d at.the ordinance was amended in by ordinance the ordinance.annual participation goals for both mbes and wbes were reduced to of total dollars spent on construction projects and of total dollars spent on professional design contracts.a substantive change prohibited an mbe or a wbe,acting as a bidder,from counting work toward project goals.
b.the lawsuit 
in january,cwc filed a complaint in federal district court alleging that the ordinance violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.cwc is a colorado construction firm owned and operated by a male.cwc alleged that it lost three contracts with the city because it failed to comply with the participation goals or meet the requirements set out in the ordinance.cwc sought both damages and injunctive relief.after a motion for summary judgment filed by the city was granted by the district court,cwc appealed.this court reversed,concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed,making the grant of summary judgment inappropriate.see concrete works ii,at.the case was remanded for trial id.at.
the district court conducted a bench trial in february and june on the constitutionality of the three ordinances.the court ruled in favor of cwc and concluded that the ordinances violated the fourteenth amendment.see concrete works iii,d at.the court enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance,the ordinance,and the ordinance.see id.the court reserved ruling on cwc claim for damages.see id.the city then brought this appeal.
iii.standard of review and burdens of proof 
remedial measures 
cwc argues that the ordinances violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment which provides that n o state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.because the use of racial preferences is a highly suspect tool,the measures contained in the ordinances are subject to strict judicial scrutiny.city of richmond croson,d plurality opinion t he purpose of strict scrutiny is to smoke out illegitimate uses of race and ensure that the means chosen fit the compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.to withstand cwc challenge,the measures in the ordinances must serve a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.see adarand constructors,pena,d adarand iii wygant jackson bd.of,d plurality opinion.
denver asserts that it has a compelling interest in remedying racial discrimination within its jurisdiction.a clear majority of the supreme court has expressly held that a state interest in remedying the effects of past or present racial discrimination may in the proper case justify a government use of racial distinctions.shaw hunt,d.a plurality of the court has also stated that a governmental entity can use its spending powers to remedy private discrimination,if it identifies that discrimination with the particularity required by the fourteenth amendment.croson,at.plurality opinion.because an effort to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination is not a compelling interest,denver can demonstrate that its interest is compelling only if it satisfies two conditions.shaw,at.emphasis added.first,it must identify the past or present discrimination with some specificity.id.at.quotation omitted.second,it must also demonstrate that a strong basis in evidence supports its conclusion that remedial action is necessary.id.at.quotation omitted.
denver can meet its burden without conclusively proving the existence of past or present racial discrimination.see concrete works ii,at t he fourteenth amendment does not require a court to make an ultimate judicial finding of discrimination before a municipality may take affirmative steps to eradicate discrimination.denver may rely on empirical evidence that demonstrates a significant statistical disparity between the number of qualified minority contractors and the number of such contractors actually engaged by the locality or the locality prime contractors.id.quoting croson,at.plurality opinion.furthermore,denver may rely on statistical evidence gathered from the denver metropolitan statistical area msa.see id.at.denver may supplement the statistical evidence with anecdotal evidence of public and private discrimination.see id.at see also id.at personal accounts of actual discrimination or the effects of discriminatory practices may,however,vividly complement empirical evidence.
neither croson nor its progeny clearly state whether private discrimination that is in no way funded with public tax dollars can,by itself,provide the requisite strong basis in evidence necessary to justify a municipality affirmative action program.id.at.denver,however,clearly may take measures to remedy its own discrimination or even to prevent itself from acting as a passive participant in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry.croson,at.plurality opinion quotation omitted.thus,denver may establish its compelling interest by presenting evidence of its own direct participation in racial discrimination or its passive participation in private discrimination.see concrete works ii,at.
the question of whether denver has demonstrated a strong basis in evidence is a question of law.see id.at.as such,we review that question and any attendant legal questions de novo.underlying factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see id.
once denver meets its burden,cwc must introduce credible,particularized evidence to rebut denver initial showing of the existence of a compelling interest.adarand constructors,slater,cir adarand vii.r ebuttal evidence may consist of a neutral explanation for the statistical disparities.coral constr.king county,cir cited with approval in concrete works ii,at.cwc can also rebut denver statistical evidence by showing that the statistics are flawed demonstrating that the disparities shown by the statistics are not significant or actionable or presenting contrasting statistical data.see also eng g contractors ass of,metro.dade county,cir same contractors ass of,city of,cir same.this court has repeatedly emphasized that the burden of proof at all times remains with cwc to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the ordinances see adarand vii,at we reiterate that the ultimate burden of proof remains with the challenging party to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of an program.quotation omitted concrete works ii,at see also wygant,at.plurality opinion the ultimate burden remains with the plaintiff to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of an program.
remedial measures 
this court applies intermediate scrutiny to the measures contained in the ordinances.see concrete works ii,at.to withstand cwc challenge,denver must establish an exceedingly persuasive justification for those measures.united states virginia,d quotation omitted.denver can meet its burden by demonstrating that the preferences serve important governmental objectives and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives.id.quotation omitted.neither this court nor the supreme court has developed a framework for analyzing equal protection challenges to remedial measures.see eng g contractors ass n,at the supreme court has not addressed the question explicitly,and there is a similar dearth of guidance in the reported decisions of other federal appellate courts.further,the parties have not provided this court with any comprehensive arguments on this issue.cwc implicitly advocates that the classifications must also survive strict judicial scrutiny.denver argues that the statistical and anecdotal evidence it presented is sufficient to survive strict scrutiny so,a fortiori,the measures necessarily survive intermediate scrutiny.
to meet its burden of demonstrating an important governmental interest,denver must show that the measures in the ordinances were based on reasoned analysis rather than through the mechanical application of traditional,often inaccurate,assumptions.for women hogan,d.thus,the evidentiary basis necessary to demonstrate denver important governmental interest may be something less than the strong basis in evidence required to justify remedial measures.see eng g contractors ass n,at contractors ass of,at logically,a city must be able to rely on less evidence in enacting a gender preference than a racial preference because applying croson evidentiary standard to a gender preference would eviscerate the difference between strict and intermediate scrutiny.
denver argues that it can satisfy its burden of production without introducing evidence showing its active or passive participation in gender discrimination.this approach has been embraced by both the ninth and eleventh circuit courts of appeal.see ensley branch,naacp seibels,cir under the intermediate scrutiny test,a local government must demonstrate some past discrimination against women,but not necessarily discrimination by the government itself.one of the distinguishing features of intermediate scrutiny is that,unlike strict scrutiny,the government interest prong of the inquiry can be satisfied by a showing of societal discrimination in the relevant economic sector.coral constr,at unlike the strict standard of review applied to programs,intermediate scrutiny does not require any showing of governmental involvement,active or passive,in the discrimination it seeks to remedy.we need not resolve this issue,however,because denver has introduced evidence that links the city to gender discrimination in the local construction industry.see,infra.
iv.denver evidence supporting its compelling interest and its important governmental interest 
historical evidence 
at trial,denver introduced evidence detailing its construction contracting practices before the ordinance.in,the city council enacted an ordinance creating an affirmative action office aao within its department of public works dpw according to testimony from the city first affirmative action officer,wesley martin,the aao sought to ensure that minority contractors were hired to participate in city construction projects.martin further testified that minority contractors were available but the city rules,guidelines,and biases operated to effectively bar them from participating in city contracting.in,the city council passed a resolution establishing a voluntary program aimed at increasing minority participation in city contracting.martin testified that the resolution had very little impact on how city projects were bid,mainly because the program had no enforcement mechanism.
in,the department of housing and urban development hud commenced an investigation into a grievance filed by the minority association of contractors.the grievance alleged that minority contractors were not being utilized on,federally funded projects in violation of applicable federal statutes.hud provided the city with a preliminary investigative report dated september,in which hud concluded,
the c ity failed to take those reasonable actions to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limited participation in the benefits of the community development block grant program,and failed to make reasonable efforts to meet the special needs of the minority contractors which in effect resulted in minority contractors not taking full advantage of the community development block grant program.
martin testified that this hud report was significant because it was the first time the city was actually told that they were in apparent with affirmative action requirements.
martin also testified that the hud report led congresswoman patricia schroeder to request an investigation by the general accounting office gao.the gao evaluated,inter alia,the dpw compliance with federal affirmative action requirements for minority construction contractors.in a report released on september,the gao report,the gao concluded that certain dpw contracting practices appeared to have a significant negative effect on minority and other categorical groups of contractors covered by federal affirmative action requirements.these practices included requiring contractor prequalification,advertising for most bids only on a limited basis,and providing inadequate time to submit a bid proposal.see concrete works ii,at.appended to the gao report was a chart detailing the dpw utilization of minority contractors on federally funded city projects.that chart indicates that a total of was awarded for such contracts between july,and december.of that total,or was awarded to minority firms.
in,the united states department of transportation dot threatened to withdraw federal financial assistance for contracting projects at denver stapleton international airport unless the city took measures to facilitate minority participation on stapleton projects.in a letter to the city mayor,the dot asserted that the dpw prequalification requirement,while neutral on its face,was unjustified and operated to bar minority contractors from obtaining dpw contracts.the letter directed the city to eliminate or modify the prequalification requirement and to develop and authorize an affirmative action plan and procedure.in,the city council adopted an affirmative action program which applied to all contracts funded by the dot.the plan contained percentage participation goals for both mbes and wbes.
a report on the utilization by the dpw of minority and women contracting firms prepared by the aao and dated april,indicates that of all dpw contract dollars were awarded to mbes in,in,in,in,in,and in.with respect to wbes,of all dpw contract dollars were awarded to wbes in in,and in.martin testified that the information on mbe and wbe project participation was provided by the contractors and that the aao had no procedure by which it could monitor actual participation.he characterized the utilization numbers as overstated.although the aao report estimated the total number of mbes and wbes in the denver msa,it did not estimate their availability as a percentage of all construction firms.
in,the city began to consider expanding its affirmative action program to include all dpw construction projects,not just those receiving federal funding.the city held a public hearing at which the city council heard testimony from minority contractors and other individuals regarding utilization of mbes and wbes on local construction projects.the testimony included specific examples of discrimination encountered in the denver construction industry.many minority contractors testified that they worked on projects that had federal requirements for minority participation but were almost completely excluded from city projects without federal affirmative action requirements.additionally,the director of governmental affairs for the associated general contractors of colorado stipulated at the hearing that there was discrimination in the industry against minorities and women.the city council subsequently enacted ordinance,series of,which set goals for mbe and wbe participation in all city construction projects managed by the dpw.the annual goal for mbe participation was of dollars spent.for wbe participation,the goal was of dollars spent.
in,the year after ordinance was passed,the aao reported that mbe participation on all dpw construction contracts was wbe participation was.in,mbe participation was and wbe participation was.in,the aao reported mbe participation on all dpw projects at and wbe participation at.in,mbe participation was and wbe participation was.
ordinance was set to expire in.in that year,the dpw surveyed local contractors by soliciting written responses to questionnaires.the city council also conducted public hearings on the utilization of mbes and wbes on dpw projects.the stated objective of the hearings was t o determine the current mbe and wbe utilization levels on dpw projects and to assess their overall capabilities also,to investigate the extent and impact of any past discriminatory practices or barriers to mbe and wbe participation on dpw projects and to identify any special problems affecting mbes and wbes in specific areas of the construction industry.based on the responses to the questionnaires and the extensive testimony presented at the hearings,the city council determined that ordinance should be extended with modification.it,therefore,enacted ordinance,series of,which,inter alia,set higher annual participation goals for mbes and wbes.
statistical disparity studies 
in,denver hired,inter alia,browne,bortz coddington,and harding ogborn collectively bbc to assess the propriety of the dpw goals program in light of the supreme court decision in croson.bbc issued a final report on june,the study.it determined that data showing mbe and wbe participation on most dpw construction projects was tainted by federal and city affirmative action programs that had been in place for more than a decade.consequently,the study analyzed the availability and utilization of mbe and wbe construction and design firms on city bond projects from the and.these projects were not subject to the goals program.denver argues that this data provides a true measure of mbe and wbe utilization on public contracts.
the conclusions reached by bbc were expressed,in part,in the form of disparity indices.a disparity index is calculated by dividing the percentage of mbe and wbe participation in city contracts by the percentage of mbes and wbes in the relevant population of local construction firms.a disparity index of demonstrates full mbe and wbe participation,whereas the closer the index is to zero,the greater the mbe and wbe underutilization.concrete works ii,at.data from eight city bond projects undertaken between and showed disparity indices of less than for mbes and less than for wbes.on a bond project for a renovation of the museum of natural history,the disparity indices were for mbes and for wbes.finally,for housing bond projects,the disparity indices were for mbes and for wbes.
the study also examined mbe and wbe utilization in the overall denver msa construction market,both public and private.because dpw construction contracts represented only of all construction in the denver msa,bbc believed that the data would not be skewed by the dpw goals program and would reflect the utilization of mbes and wbes in the market in which denver obtained its construction and professional design services.disparity indices for,calculated by using census bureau data,were for mbes and for wbes.for,the disparity indices were for mbes and for wbes.additional disparity indices for were calculated using data obtained from telephone surveys conducted by a private telemarketing firm retained by bbc.the disparity indices calculated from this data were for mbes and for wbes.
finally,bbc interviewed representatives of mbes,wbes,construction firms,and government officials.they also reviewed testimony given at hearings held in by the dpw and the denver city council.based on this information,the study concluded that,despite denver efforts to increase mbe and wbe participation in dpw projects,some denver employees and private contractors engaged in conduct designed to circumvent the goals program.in an effort to ensure that projects were awarded to certain contractors,denver employees avoided the goals program by using change orders to existing contracts rather than putting new work out to bid.employees also characterized some major construction projects as remodeling because remodeling projects fell under the auspices of the department of general services dgs which had no goals program.other responses indicated that prime contractors continued to call wbes they knew were no longer in business and counted those calls as efforts to meet the goals program.others bid shopped in an effort to prevent mbes and wbes from submitting the lowest bid,or characterized subcontractors as suppliers and then contended the goals program did not apply because not enough work was subcontracted.after reviewing the statistical and anecdotal evidence contained in the study,the city council enacted the ordinance.
in,bbc prepared an additional study analyzing the utilization of mbes and wbes in the goods,services,and remodeling industries the dgs study.bbc analyzed,inter alia,data for construction and remodeling contracts issued by the dgs.during the relevant period,these contracts were not subject to a goals program but were most likely subject to bonding and prevailing wage requirements.the disparity indices calculated for dgs remodeling projects were for mbes and for wbes.for remodeling projects,the disparity indices were for mbes and for wbes.
after this court decided concrete works ii,denver commissioned another study by bbc the study.using census bureau data,the study again examined utilization of mbes and wbes in the construction and professional design industries within the denver msa.the census data included information on employment and revenues for proprietorships,partnerships,and subchapter s corporations with ten or fewer stockholders.information on c corporations was unavailable.according to the study,firms were classified as minority or if the sole owner or at least half of the partners or shareholders were minorities or women.the study acknowledged that the census bureau data on hispanic,asian,and native american firms were generated from sampling and underrepresented total marketplace utilization and total availability of those firms.the study,however,also noted that census information indicates that the same relationships between utilization and availability presented in the report would also be found if the entire population of hispanic,asian and native firms were represented.
the study also concluded that mbes and wbes were more likely to be or businesses.the study concluded that firms were less likely to have paid employees than firms but that firms were more likely to have paid employees than white or other firms.to determine whether these factors explained overall market disparities,the study used the census data to calculate disparity indices for all firms in the denver msa construction industry and separately calculated disparity indices for firms with paid employees and firms with no paid employees.
the census bureau information was also used to examine average revenues per employee for denver msa construction firms with paid employees.hispanic,asian,native american,and firms with paid employees all reported lower revenues per employee than firms.a comparison of revenues per employee for firms was not included in the study because of the small number of constructions firms with paid employees.
the study also used census data to calculate rates of within the denver msa construction industry.the data indicated that of blacks and of hispanics working in the construction industry were compared with of whites working in the construction industry.for women,were compared to of men.data from the professional design industry demonstrated that of women in that industry were compared to of men.the study concluded that the disparities in the rates of for blacks,hispanics,and women persisted even after controlling for education and length of work experience.the study controlled for these variables but reported that blacks and hispanics working in the denver msa construction industry were less than half as likely to own their own businesses as were whites of comparable education and experience.white women in the construction industry owned businesses at of the rate expected given their education and experience.additionally,women working in the denver professional design industry owned businesses at of the expected rate.bbc was unable to perform an analysis of rates for blacks,hispanics,asians,and native americans working in the professional design industry because the necessary data was unavailable.
in late and early,bbc also conducted a telephone survey of construction firms doing business in the denver msa.the survey collected information on firm revenue length of time in business ethnic,racial,and gender status of business ownership work history with the city qualifications interest in future work with the city and other characteristics.information was obtained for all construction and professional design firms,including c corporations.based on information obtained from the survey,bbc calculated percentage utilization and percentage availability of mbes and wbes.percentage utilization was calculated from revenue information provided by the responding firms.percentage availability was calculated based on the number of mbes and wbes that responded to the survey question regarding revenues.using these utilization and availability percentages,the study showed disparity indices of for mbes and for wbes in the construction industry.in the professional design industry,disparity indices were for mbes and for wbes.the study concluded that the disparity indices obtained from the telephone survey data were more accurate than those obtained from the census data because the data obtained from the telephone survey was more recent,had a narrower focus,and included data on c corporations additionally,it was possible to calculate disparity indices for professional design firms from the survey data.
the study also contained a summary of a disparity study conducted in for the denver housing authority the dha study and a disparity study conducted for the regional transportation district the rtd study.because the rtd had an affirmative action program in place,the rtd study examined the utilization of minority and firms by the private sector in the denver area marketplace.the rtd study,inter alia,examined both prime contracting and subcontracting in the denver msa construction industry.the disparity indices shown in the rtd study are summarized below 
the dha study examined the utilization of by the denver housing authority for the years,and.both census data and information from the dha vendor file were used to measure availability.the dha study found disparities between the utilization and availability of in some areas in some years,including years that dha had an affirmative action program in place.
after it was presented with the study,the city enacted the ordinance.the ordinance made several changes to the ordinance.see concrete works iii,d at supra.
in,the city retained national economic research associates,nera to conduct a study to estimate the availability of mbes and wbes and to examine,inter alia,whether race and gender discrimination limited the participation of mbes and wbes in construction projects of the type typically undertaken by the city the nera study.the nera study used a more sophisticated method to calculate availability than the earlier studies conducted by bbc.the study first identified the construction specialities and geographic areas in which the city spent the bulk of its construction funds.the mocc provided nera with information for the years relating to the city construction contracts.that information included the name of the project,the name and address of each contractor and subcontractor,the task performed,the contract type,the amount paid to each contractor,and the total value of each project.nera excluded projects funded by the federal government and projects relating to the construction of denver international airport because they were not representative of the typical city construction project.public library projects funded by the library bond program were prorated because their large size was atypical.nera used the firms postal zip codes to determine their location.
each construction contract or task performed was then assigned a standard industrial classification sic code.sic codes catagorize businesses by specialization and are used by the census bureau to report economic statistics.nera then used this data to summarize the city construction expenditures by project type and geographic area.the study showed that more than of the city construction dollars were paid to firms located in adams,arapahoe,boulder,denver,douglas,and jefferson counties.further,forty sic codes accounted for of all city construction expenditures.
nera used the geographic and specialization information to calculate availability.availability was defined as the ratio of firms to the total number of firms in the sic codes and geographic market area relevant to the city contracts.the total number of firms was obtained from dun bradstreet marketplace database.the number of firms was obtained from a directory compiled by bbc from different sources.nera then successfully located of the in the directory.the information it obtained from these firms was used to adjust for the possibility of overcounting.nera also sampled firms in the dun bradstreet marketplace database to make an undercount adjustment.the final result was a weighted average of availability for each racial group and for women.availability was calculated for both prime contractors and subcontractors in each group.
the nera study then compared availability and utilization in the colorado construction industry.the statewide market was used because necessary information was unavailable for the denver msa.nera believed the statewide data was relevant because the denver msa accounted for nearly of the total value of construction work done in colorado.additionally,data collected in by the census bureau was used because more current data was unavailable.the nera study calculated disparity indices for the statewide construction market in colorado as follows for african american firms,for hispanic firms,for asian and other minorities,and for firms.nera considered a disparity to be substantially significant if it was less than because the equal employment opportunity commission considers a selection rate for any group that is or less of the selection rate for the group with the highest rate to be evidence of adverse impact.d.
the nera study also contained an analysis of whether african americans,hispanics,or asian americans working in the construction industry are less likely to be than similarly situated whites.using data from the public use microdata samples pums of the census of population and housing,nera obtained a sample of individuals working in the construction industry,of whom resided in the denver msa.nera was able to obtain the following information for each individual race whether the individual was or worked for someone else sex marital status age education access to capital including dividend and interest income,spouse income,and home ownership number of children living at home and personal handicaps.nera considered these factors possible determinants of.using this information,nera conducted two probit regressions one for colorado and one for the denver msa.the study concluded that in both colorado and the denver msa,african americans,hispanics,and native americans working in the construction industry have lower rates than whites.asian americans had higher rates than whites.nera concluded that the high rate of for asian americans was consistent with studies showing that immigrants are more likely to be than individuals born in the united states.close to of the asian americans in the pums data used by nera were immigrants.
using the availability figures calculated earlier in the study,the nera study then compared the actual availability of in the denver msa with the potential availability of if they formed businesses at the same rate as whites with the same characteristics.
finally,the nera study examined whether minorities and women in the construction industry have lower earnings than white males with similar characteristics.using linear regression analysis,nera was able to compare business owners with similar years of education,of similar age,doing business in the same geographic area,and having other similar demographic characteristics.even after controlling for several factors,the results showed that african americans,hispanics,native americans,and women had lower earnings than white males.in the denver msa,the earnings of women in the construction industry were of the earnings of white men.the earnings disparity for african americans was,for hispanics it was,and for native americans it was.no disparity was shown for asian americans.
nera also conducted a mail survey of both and to obtain anecdotal evidence on their experiences in the construction industry.approximately of the who received the questionnaire responded.of the who responded,indicated that they had experienced at least one incident of disparate treatment within the last five years while engaged in business activities.these business activities included,inter alia applying for a commercial loan,applying for a bond,obtaining quotes from suppliers,bidding or working on private and public sector prime contracts,bidding or working on private and public sector subcontracts,receiving payments for subcontracting work,being required to do inappropriate or extra work on a project,and having to meet unnecessarily strict quality or performance standards.the survey also posed the following question how often do prime contractors who use your firm as a subcontractor on public sector projects with goals or requirements also use your firm on public sector or private sector projects without goals or requirements percent of minorities and of white women who responded to this question indicated they were seldom or never used on projects.
were also asked whether the following aspects of procurement made it more difficult or impossible to obtain construction contracts bonding requirements,insurance requirements,large project size,cost of completing proposals,obtaining working capital,length of notification for bid deadlines,prequalification requirements,and previous dealings with an agency.this question was also asked of in a separate survey.with one exception considered each aspect of procurement more problematic than.to determine whether a firm size or experience explained the different responses,nera conducted a regression analysis that controlled for age of the firm,number of employees,and level of revenues.the results again showed that with the same,single exception,had more difficulties than with the same characteristics.additionally,the results of a telephone survey of and firms not responding to the mail survey led nera to conclude that it is likely the disparities are greater than indicated.the telephone survey indicated that firms were more likely to have responded to the mail survey than if they had actually experienced the difficulties delineated in the survey question.
after the nera study was completed,the city enacted the ordinance.the ordinance reduced the annual goals to for both mbes and wbes and eliminated a provision which previously allowed to count their own work toward project goals.see concrete works iii,d at.
anecdotal evidence 
the district court memorandum and order contains a comprehensive synopsis of the anecdotal evidence presented by denver at trial.see id.at.that evidence was extensive and included the testimony of the senior of a large,construction firm who stated that when he worked in denver,he received credible complaints from minority and construction firms that they were subject to different work rules than firms.he also testified that he frequently observed graffiti containing racial or gender epithets written on job sites in the denver metropolitan area.further,he stated that he believed,based on his personal experiences,that many firms refused to hire minority or subcontractors because they believed those firms were not competent.
several witnesses testified that they experienced difficulty prequalifying for private sector projects and projects with the city and other governmental entities in colorado.see id.at.one individual testified that her company was required to prequalify for a private sector project while no similar requirement was imposed on firms.several others testified that they attempted to prequalify for projects but their applications were denied even though they met the prequalification requirements.
other testified that their bids were rejected even when they were the lowest bidder that they believed they were paid more slowly than firms on both city projects and private sector projects that they were charged more for supplies and materials that they were required to do additional work not part of the subcontracting arrangement and that they found it difficult to join unions and trade associations.see id.at.there was extensive testimony detailing the difficulties experienced in obtaining lines of credit.one wbe testified that she was given a false explanation of why her loan was declined another testified that the lending institution required the of her husband even though her husband,who also owned a construction firm,was not required to obtain her a third testified that the bank required her father to be involved in the lending negotiations.
the most poignant anecdotal testimony involved recitations of racially and harassment experienced by at work sites.women were called bitches and blacks were called nigger or dumb nigger.one year old truck driver was called a dumb,mexican.even more disturbing was the testimony that minority and female employees working on construction projects were physically assaulted and fondled,spat upon with chewing tobacco,and pelted with bolts thrown by males from a height of eighty feet.
v.the legal framework applied by the district court 
the district court began its examination of the city evidence with the disparity studies conducted by bbc and nera.the court criticized the studies because they did not answer the following six questions posed by the court for the first time in its memorandum and order 
is there pervasive race,ethnic and gender discrimination throughout all aspects of the construction and professional design industry in the six county denver msa does such discrimination equally affect all of the racial and ethnic groups designated for preference by denver and all women does such discrimination result from policies and practices intentionally used by business firms for the purpose of disadvantaging those firms because of race,ethnicity and gender would denver use of those discriminating firms without requiring them to give work to certified mbes and wbes in the required percentages on each project make denver guilty of prohibited discrimination is the compelled use of certified mbes and wbes in the prescribed percentages on particular projects likely to change the discriminatory policies and programs that taint the industry is the burden of compliance with denver preferential program a reasonable one fairly placed on those who are justly accountable for the proven discrimination 
concrete works iii,d at.
believing that its six questions set the proper legal framework for analyzing the city evidence,the district court criticized denver disparity studies and refused to give weight to much of denver evidence because it did almost nothing to answer those questions and because the methodology used in the studies was not designed to answer the relevant questions.id.at.the court questions,however,misstate controlling precedent and denver burden at trial.
read in context with the other five questions and the record,it is clear from the first question that the district court believed denver was required to prove the existence of discrimination.instead of asking whether denver had demonstrated strong evidence from which an inference of past or present discrimination could be drawn,the question asks whether denver evidence shows that there is pervasive discrimination.see id.at.the second and third questions then refer to such discrimination and the sixth question asks whether the burden of compliance is placed on those firms accountable for the proven discrimination.id.emphasis added.it appears the district court may have been persuaded by cwc erroneous and unsupported statement in its written closing argument that denver had the burden of establishing by a preponderance that not only were there inferences of discrimination,but in fact that the inferences were correct.denver,however,bore no such burden.
in concrete works ii,this court clearly stated that the fourteenth amendment does not require a court to make an ultimate finding of discrimination before a municipality may take affirmative steps to eradicate discrimination.at.denver initial burden was to demonstrate that strong evidence of discrimination supported its conclusion that remedial measures were necessary.strong evidence is that approaching a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation,not irrefutable or definitive proof of discrimination.croson,at.the burden of proof at all times remained with cwc to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that denver evidence did not support an inference of prior discrimination and thus a remedial purpose.adarand vii,at quotation omitted.
consistent with its second question,the district court concluded that the aggregation of all racial and ethnic groups as equally victimized by discrimination and equally entitled to the preferential remedies is particularly problematic for fourteenth amendment equality analysis.concrete works iii,d at emphasis added.in croson,a majority of the court noted that richmond affirmative action program included racial groups that,as a practical matter,may never have suffered from discrimination in the construction industry in richmond.at.consequently,the court questioned whether richmond could justify the program as an attempt to remedy past discrimination.see id.denver,however,did introduce evidence of discrimination against each group included in the ordinances.thus,denver evidence does not suffer from the problem discussed by the court in croson.the district court,however,apparently believed denver could not satisfy its burden of introducing strong evidence unless it was able to show that each group suffered equally from discrimination.croson imposes no such requirement.
the district court third question also misstates the applicable law underlying that question is the district court conclusion that denver must demonstrate that the private firms directly engaged in any discrimination in which denver passively participates do so intentionally,with the purpose of disadvantaging minorities and women.the district court provided no support for its conclusion and this court could find none.the croson majority concluded that a city would have a compelling interest in preventing its tax dollars from assisting local trade organizations in maintaining a racially segregated construction market.at.thus,denver only burden was to introduce evidence which raised the inference of discriminatory exclusion in the local construction industry and linked its spending to that discrimination.
the supreme court has clearly stated that the inference of discriminatory exclusion can arise from statistical disparities.see id.accordingly,we conclude that denver can meet its burden through the introduction of statistical and anecdotal evidence alone.to the extent the district court required denver to introduce additional evidence to show discriminatory motive or intent on the part of private construction firms,the court erred.denver was under no burden to identify any specific practice or policy that resulted in discrimination.neither was denver required to demonstrate that the purpose of any such practice or policy was to disadvantage women or minorities.to impose such a burden on a municipality would be tantamount to requiring direct proof of discrimination and would eviscerate any reliance the municipality could place on statistical studies and anecdotal evidence.accord associated contractors of,coalition for econ,cir.
guided by the erroneous third question,the court concluded that denver disparity studies were flawed because they do not generate a fair inference that there are discriminatory barriers to participation in the construction industry that are different from societal discrimination.concrete works iii,d at emphasis added.the district court provided no authority for its conclusion that the city must demonstrate that any identified discrimination in the construction industry is not a reflection of societal discrimination.denver,in fact,is not required to show that the discriminatory practices in the construction industry were unique to that industry or differed from societal discrimination.under the district court approach,a municipality is without the power to remedy even proven discrimination in the construction industry as long as that discrimination merely reflects general societal discrimination.denver offers the persuasive hypothesis that the district court position arose from a misinterpretation of croson admonition against reliance on general societal discrimination to support affirmative action programs.see croson,at.plurality opinion.we are not suggesting that societal discrimination without more would suffice.indeed,the converse is true.the croson plurality statements,however,have no application when,as in this case,the municipality presents specific evidence of discrimination in the local construction industry.if such evidence is presented,it is immaterial for constitutional purposes whether the industry discrimination springs from widespread discriminatory attitudes shared by society or is the product of policies,practices,and attitudes unique to the industry.denver statistical and anecdotal evidence is relevant because it identifies discrimination in the local construction industry,not simply discrimination in society.the genesis of the identified discrimination is irrelevant and the district court erred when it discounted denver evidence on that basis.
the district court erroneous view of the law affected its analysis of denver evidence.after considering the anecdotal evidence,the court found that the evidence supported the conclusion that women and minority groups are disadvantaged in trying to compete in the construction industry because of the prevalence of negative views about them.id.at see also id.in summary,the anecdotal evidence shows that race,ethnicity and gender affect the construction industry and those who work in it.notwithstanding that finding,the court deemed the anecdotal evidence unpersuasive because it did not show that the negative views prevalent in the construction industry were different than any societal views.see also id.at it can not be determined whether these incidents involving harassment at work sites are manifestations of societal prejudices or fairly attributable to employers as a business policy.the district court erroneous belief that denver was required to show the existence of specific discriminatory policies and that those policies were more than a reflection of societal discrimination resulted in the court improperly discounting much of denver statistical and anecdotal evidence.
the district court fourth question appears to be the basis upon which the court rejected the evidence denver presented on marketplace discrimination.see,infra.the question expresses the erroneous legal conclusion that a municipality may only remedy its own discrimination.this conclusion is contrary to both our holding in concrete works ii and the plurality opinion in croson.it appears to be a reflection of the erroneous statement made by cwc in its closing argument.see supra.this court recognized in this very case that a municipality has a compelling interest in taking affirmative steps to remedy both public and private discrimination specifically identified in its area.concrete works ii,at emphasis added.in concrete works ii,we remanded this case for trial and stated,the record before us does not explain the denver government role in contributing to the underutilization of mbes and wbes in the private construction market in the denver msa,and this may well be a fruitful issue to explore at trial.id.at.we also stated that we do not read croson as requiring the municipality to identify an exact linkage between its award of public contracts and private discrimination.id.at.our comments indicate that denver can meet it burden of demonstrating its compelling interest with evidence of private discrimination in the local construction industry coupled with evidence that it has become a passive participant in that discrimination.see id.thus,contrary to the wording of question four,denver was clearly not required to demonstrate that it is guilty of prohibited discrimination to meet its initial burden.
likewise,the district court fifth question manifests the erroneous conclusion that denver was required to demonstrate the ordinances will change discriminatory practices and policies in the local construction industry.denver program can survive the equal protection challenge brought by cwc if denver can show that the ordinances are narrowly tailored to remedy denver participation in the identified discrimination there is no requirement that the ordinances must also eliminate the discrimination.in fact,any such requirement would be illogical.if firms persisted in their discrimination,they could effectively defeat all affirmative action legislation.
finally,contrary to the district court sixth question,the ordinances do not have to be tailored to place the burden of compliance only on those firms accountable for the discrimination.a plurality of the supreme court has stated that a s part of this nation dedication to eradicating racial discrimination,innocent persons may be called upon to bear some of the burden of the remedy s uch a sharing of the burden by innocent parties is not impermissible.wygant,at.quotations omitted.the proper focus is on whether the burden on third parties is too intrusive or unacceptable.see id.at.united states paradise,d plurality opinion.
the sixth question also appears to be implicated in the district court statement rejecting denver disparity studies while statistical studies may suggest that some showings of disparity may create an inference of discrimination,they say nothing about who is responsible for such discrimination.concrete works iii,d at.the district court then intimated that it would be illogical to assume that male caucasian contractors will only do business with other male caucasians even where that is contrary to their economic interests.id.such an assumption,while perhaps economically illogical,nonetheless is consistent with the district court own observation that,d iscriminating behavior is irrational and not subject to the often used legal standard of reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances.id.at.additionally,this court has previously concluded that denver statistical studies which compare utilization of to availability,support the inference that local prime contractors are engaged in racial and gender discrimination.concrete works ii,at.thus,denver disparity studies should not have been discounted because they fail to specifically identify those individuals or firms responsible for the discrimination.
the six questions posed by the district court as its aggregate litmus test contain misstatements or misapplications of the legal principles that govern equal protection cases like the one before the court.not only did the district court analyze the ordinances and denver evidence supporting them through an incorrect legal framework,it also discounted denver studies as biased because they failed to address the six questions.see concrete works iii,d at.according to the court,this bias was evident when the articulated purposes of the studies were contrasted with the court questions.see id.because the court six questions incorrectly state denver burden,however,the studies can not be criticized as biased on that basis.we conclude the district court framework imposed a greater burden on denver than that required by applicable law.accordingly,the court failed to give sufficient weight to denver evidence.see id.criticizing denver disparity studies because the methodology was not designed to answer the relevant questions id.at discounting denver anecdotal evidence because it does not answer the six questions considered in the court evaluation of the statistical evidence.
vi.cwc arguments and rebuttal evidence 
a.the disparity.use of marketplace data 
the district court,inter alia,concluded that the study,the study,the nera study,and the other disparity studies upon which denver relied were significantly flawed because they measured discrimination in the overall denver msa construction industry,not discrimination by the city itself.see id.at the question,denver says,is what happens in the market without the ordinances.that may be consistent with scientific methodology but it does not square with the applicable law.the court may have believed that marketplace data is irrelevant because such data would not answer question four would denver use of those discriminating firms without requiring them to give work to certified mbes and wbes in the required percentages on each project make denver guilty of prohibited discrimination id.at.the district court conclusion,however,is directly contrary to our holding in adarand vii that evidence of both public and private discrimination in the construction industry is relevant.see at.
consistent with the district court conclusion,cwc continues to argue,as it did in concrete works ii,that marketplace data is irrelevant because the ordinances can be justified only by evidence of discrimination by the city itself or by prime contractors while working on city projects.see supra.cwc argument is based on language used in croson but taken out of context by cwc and by memorandum orders issued by two federal district courts.see croson,at.associated util.contractors of,mayor city council,d,webster fulton county,d,summarily aff,cir.in croson,the court criticized richmond data,in part,because it did not show what percentage of total city construction dollars minority firms now receive as subcontractors on prime contracts let by the city.croson,at.relying on this language,cwc argues that the city can not meet its burden of demonstrating strong evidence of discrimination unless it demonstrates that it directly participates in discrimination or indirectly participates by utilizing contractors who discriminate on city projects.it further argues that evidence of marketplace discrimination is irrelevant to this determination and can never assist the city in meeting its burden.
cwc argument is not supported by the language it cites from croson when that language is read in context.in the croson majority opinion,the court noted,by example,some of the flaws in the evidence presented by the city of richmond.in addition to criticizing the city because it did not present data showing the percentage of city dollars received by minority subcontractors on city construction projects,the court also faulted richmond evidence that mbe membership in local contractors associations was extremely low.see id.at.the court criticism,however,was not that the evidence of low participation in such associations was irrelevant.instead,the court criticized the information because it did not consider nondiscriminatory explanations for the low level of membership.see id.importantly,the court specifically concluded that if richmond had linked the evidence showing low mbe participation in trade associations to the number of local mbes eligible for membership,any resulting statistical disparity,if large enough,could support an inference of discriminatory exclusion.see id.if such an inference could be drawn,the city would have a compelling interest in preventing its tax dollars from assisting these organizations in maintaining a racially segregated construction market.id.thus,contrary to cwc mischaracterization of the court statements in croson,the court actually concluded that evidence of marketplace discrimination could be used by a municipality to meet its burden of producing strong evidence but that richmond failed to meet its burden because,inter alia,it failed to offer any such evidence.
the conclusion reached by the majority in croson that marketplace data is relevant in equal protection challenges to affirmative action programs is consistent with the approach later taken by the court in shaw hunt.in shaw,a majority of the court relied on the majority opinion in croson for the broad proposition that a governmental entity interest in remedying the effects of past or present racial discrimination may in the proper case justify a government use of racial distinctions.at.the shaw court did not adopt any requirement that only discrimination by the governmental entity,either directly or by utilizing firms engaged in discrimination on projects funded by the entity,was remediable.the court,however,did set out two conditions which must be met for the governmental entity to show a compelling interest.first,the discrimination must be identified discrimination.id.at.quotation omitted.the city can satisfy this condition by identifying the discrimination,public or private,with some specificity.id.quoting croson,at.emphasis added.the governmental entity must also have a strong basis in evidence to conclude that remedial action was necessary.id.quotation omitted.thus,shaw specifically stated that evidence of either public or private discrimination could be used to satisfy the municipality burden of producing strong evidence.
cwc argument that the marketplace data is irrelevant is also inconsistent with binding precedent in this circuit.in adarand vii,we specifically concluded that evidence of marketplace discrimination can be used to support a compelling interest in remedying past or present discrimination through the use of affirmative action legislation.see at w e may consider public and private discrimination not only in the specific area of government procurement contracts but also in the construction industry generally thus any findings congress has made as to the entire construction industry are relevant.emphasis added.further,in this very case we rejected the argument cwc reasserts here that marketplace data is irrelevant and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether denver could link its public spending to the denver msa evidence of discrimination.concrete works ii,at.we clearly stated that evidence explaining the denver government role in contributing to the underutilization of mbes and wbes in the private construction market in the denver msa was relevant to denver burden of producing strong evidence.id.at emphasis added.
consistent with our mandate in concrete works ii,the city attempted to show at trial that it indirectly contributed to private discrimination by awarding public contracts to firms that in turn discriminated against mbe wbe subcontractors in other private portions of their business.id.the city can demonstrate that it is a passive participant in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry by compiling evidence of marketplace discrimination and then linking its spending practices to the private discrimination.croson,at,joined by rehnquist,and white.therefore,evidence of marketplace discrimination is not only relevant but,in this case,it is essential to the city claim that it is an indirect participant in private discrimination.consequently,we again reject cwc argument and conclude that the district court determination that the marketplace data was irrelevant was a legal error that significantly affected the court analysis of denver evidence.
at trial,the city presented testimony from doing business in the denver msa to support its assertion that it is a passive participant in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry because it contracts with firms which discriminate against women and minorities.id.at least eight testified that general contractors who use them on city construction projects refuse to use them on private projects.the witnesses specifically named the contractors who engaged in this practice.an employee of the mocc identified eighteen of those contractors as firms that have performed city contracts.based on this testimony,the district court found that,
the city does not want to pay tax dollars to support firms that discriminate against other firms because of their race,ethnicity and gender.yet,the anecdotal evidence shows that denver has repeatedly and knowingly done just that.during the taking of testimony about the experiences of minority and firms in dealing with other contractors on projects not involving denver,the city lawyers carefully demonstrated that those same contractors often do business with the city.
concrete works iii,d at discussing narrow tailoring.cwc does not challenge this finding.the anecdotal evidence supporting the district court finding would not be sufficient on its own to support denver burden of demonstrating a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.however,this evidence links denver spending to private discrimination.see concrete works ii,at.consequently,we conclude that the anecdotal evidence and the district court factual finding based on that evidence amply support denver position that it indirectly contributes to private discrimination in the denver msa construction industry.see croson,at,joined by rehnquist,and white,it is beyond dispute that any public entity,state or federal,has a compelling interest in assuring that public dollars,drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens,do not serve to finance the evil of private prejudice.
cwc argument that the lending discrimination studies and business formation studies presented by denver are irrelevant is also foreclosed by circuit precedent.in adarand vii,we concluded that evidence of discriminatory barriers to the formation of businesses by minorities and women and fair competition between and construction firms shows a strong link between a government disbursements of public funds for construction contracts and the channeling of those funds due to private discrimination.at.evidence that private discrimination results in barriers to business formation is relevant because it demonstrates that are precluded at the outset from competing for public construction contracts.see id.at.evidence of barriers to fair competition is also relevant because it again demonstrates that existing are precluded from competing for public contracts.see id.thus,like the studies measuring disparities in the utilization of in the denver msa construction industry,studies showing that discriminatory barriers to business formation exist in the denver construction industry are relevant to the city showing that it indirectly participates in industry discrimination 
the city presented evidence of lending discrimination to support its position that in the denver msa construction industry face discriminatory barriers to business formation.denver introduced a disparity study prepared in and sponsored by the denver community reinvestment alliance,colorado capital initiatives,and the city.the study stated purpose was to determine what barriers,if any,small businesses face when seeking credit from financial institutions,and whether there is any difference in treatment among small business owners seeking credit based on their ethnicity.the study ultimately concluded that despite the fact that loan applicants of three different backgrounds in this sample were not appreciably different as businesspeople,they were ultimately treated differently by the lenders on the crucial issue of loan approval or denial.in adarand vii,this court concluded that this very study,among other evidence,strongly support ed an initial showing of discrimination in lending.at see also id.at lending discrimination alone of course does not justify action in the construction market.however,the persistence of such discrimination supports the assertion that the formation,as well as utilization,of construction enterprises has been impeded.citation omitted.the city also introduced anecdotal evidence of lending discrimination in the denver construction industry.see concrete works iii,d at.
cwc did not present any evidence that undermines the reliability of the lending discrimination evidence but simply repeats the argument,foreclosed by circuit precedent,that it is irrelevant.the district court criticized the evidence because it failed to determine whether the discrimination resulted from discriminatory attitudes or from the neutral application of banking regulations.see concrete works iii,d at.we have already concluded,however,that discriminatory motive can be inferred from the results shown in disparity studies.because the district court criticism is not directed at the methodology used or conclusions drawn in the lending discrimination study,it does not undermine the study reliability as an indicator that the city is passively participating in marketplace discrimination.indeed,in adarand vii we took judicial notice of the obvious causal connection between access to capital and ability to implement public works construction projects.at.the district court other criticisms are erroneous in light of this court holding that the study support s an initial showing of discrimination in lending.id.
denver also introduced evidence of discriminatory barriers to competition faced by in the form of business formation studies that were included in the bbc and nera studies.the study and the study both showed that all minority groups in the denver msa formed their own construction firms at rates lower than the total population but that women formed construction firms at higher rates.the nera study employed a more sophisticated analysis to examine rates and controlled for gender,marital status,education,availability of capital,and variables.as discussed,supra,the nera study concluded that african americans,hispanics,and native americans working in the construction industry have lower rates of than similarly situated whites.asian americans had higher rates.the nera study did not calculate rates for women working in the construction industry.the nera study also concluded that minority and female business owners in the construction industry,with the exception of asian american owners,have lower earnings than white male owners.this conclusion was reached after controlling for education,age,marital status,and disabilities.
although cwc asserts that the district court correctly concluded that the business formation studies can not be used to justify the ordinances,the court conclusion conflicts with our holding in adarand vii.see at.t he existence of evidence indicating that the number of mbes would be significantly but unquantifiably higher but for such barriers is nevertheless relevant to the assessment of whether a disparity is sufficiently significant to give rise to an inference of discriminatory exclusion.id.at.further,the district court conclusion that no inference of discrimination can be drawn from the studies because such a conclusion would require the problematic assumption of a direct relationship between the rate of formation of new businesses and the number of persons working as employees in the industry erroneously ignores the fact that the nera study controlled for variables like education and level of experience.concrete works iii,d at.
in its written closing argument,cwc asserted that the business formation study included in the study is flawed because it did not control for variables such as the type of educational degree received and types of work experience conceding that the nera study was better,cwc nevertheless argues that it too is flawed because it did not control for,inter alia,quality of education or culture.the district court faulted the study because it did not control for marital status,veteran status,availability of other sources of income and hours worked during the previous year.concrete works iii,d at.the court also noted that the nera study failed to control for prior business experience,religion,cultural history and whether parents were.id.at.
even assuming that it is possible to adequately measure variables like quality of education and culture,neither the district court nor cwc provided any explanation of how the failure to control for any of these variables undermines the reliability of the business formation studies.while the report prepared by cwc expert,george lanoue,indicated that cultural differences or immigration status may affect business formation rates,lanoue did not explain what he meant by the term cultural differences,did not conduct a study that controlled for these variables and,more importantly,did not testify that controlling for the variables would eliminate the disparities.g eneral criticism of disparity studies,as opposed to particular evidence undermining the reliability of the particular disparity studies is of little persuasive value.adarand vii,at.
in sum,the district court erred when it refused to consider or give sufficient weight to the lending discrimination study,the business formation studies,and the studies measuring marketplace discrimination.that evidence was legally relevant to the city burden of demonstrating a strong basis in evidence to support its conclusion that remedial legislation was necessary.see id.at.cwc generalized denouncements of the studies fall far short of the credible,particularized evidence necessary to rebut the city evidence.id.at.
beyond its conclusion that denver disparity studies were largely or wholly irrelevant because they measured marketplace discrimination and not discrimination by the city itself or by contractors working on city projects,the district court identified numerous perceived flaws in the studies.acknowledging that disparity studies may,when properly conducted,constitute persuasive evidence in equal protection cases,the district court relied on language in croson plurality opinion to set the standards those studies must meet.according to the district court,
the probative force of statistical disparity studies depends upon whether the data used provide meaningful measurements of the number of minority firms qualified and willing and able to perform a particular service as well as the number actually used in public contracting,directly or indirectly.
concrete works iii,d at quoting croson,at.as we have already concluded,disparity studies that measure the use of in the relevant marketplace,in addition to those that measure the direct or indirect use of in public contracting,are also probative.the court,however,also discredited the conclusions reached in denver disparity studies either because those studies failed to address the six questions developed by the court or because they failed to control for certain variables.
size and experience 
in concrete works ii,this court reversed the grant of summary judgment,in part,because it was unclear from the record whether the study overstated the availability of in the denver construction market.we noted that a disparity index calculated on the basis of the absolute number of mbes in the local market may show greater underutilization than does data that takes into consideration the size of mbes and wbes.concrete works ii,at.at trial,both parties had the opportunity to present evidence on the effect firm size and capacity had on the disparities shown in denver studies.
cwc challenges denver disparity studies as unreliable because the disparities shown in the studies may be attributable to firm size and experience rather than discrimination.cwc argument is based on a report submitted by its expert,george lanoue,which contains an extensive discussion of firm size and experience.lanoue first asserts that are generally smaller and less experienced than majority firms.he then contends that smaller and less experienced firms are less qualified and less able to undertake city construction projects.he concludes that because denver disparity studies do not control for firm size and experience,the availability figures used in those studies are inflated.thus,cwc argues the disparity indices calculated in the studies are unreliable because they are not based on the availability of only those firms qualified,willing,and able to work on city projects.
the district court noted that denver disparity studies contain no analysis of the actual qualifications and capacities of the mbes and wbes in the denver msa,but instead assume that,at any given time,all are available to perform each contract.concrete works iii,d at.the court criticized denver assumption as implausible and concluded that a ggregating all of the mbes and wbes in estimating availability without regard for the size of the businesses is a serious flaw in the methodology and impairs the value of the results.id.at.
denver acknowledges that are generally smaller than firms in terms of revenues and number of employees and are slightly less experienced.additionally,in his written report,another cwc expert,john lunn,asserts that the only conclusion that can be drawn from denver studies is that minority and firms are smaller and less experienced than the average of all construction firms in the denver construction market.although cwc did not conduct its own marketplace disparity study that controlled for firm size and experience,its argument that the disparity studies are unreliable because they fail to control for size and experience is deserving of consideration in light of the uncontroverted evidence that are generally smaller and less experienced than majority firms.
denver counters,however,that a firm size has little effect on its qualifications or its ability to provide construction services and that,like all construction firms,can perform most services either by hiring additional employees or by employing subcontractors.at trial,denver introduced evidence that the median number of employees of all construction firms in the denver msa is three and presented testimony that even firms with few permanent employees can perform large,public contracts by hiring additional employees or subcontractors and renting equipment.additionally,the district court found that most firms have few permanent employees and must grow or shrink their performance capacity according to the volume of business they are doing.id.at.
cwc responds that elasticity itself is relative to size and experience are less capable of expanding because they are smaller and less experienced.the district court found that a firm ability to expand depends upon its access to increased resources,including workers with the needed skills,equipment,material and operating capital.id.the court did not find that a firm size affected its ability to obtain these resources but concluded that the firm access to information,its reputation in the community and the skills of its managers all had an effect.id.thus there is no finding by the district court that smaller,less experienced firms are less able to expand.
even if we assume that are less able to expand because of their smaller size and more limited experience,cwc does not respond to denver argument and the evidence it presented showing that experience and size are not race and variables and that construction firms are generally smaller and less experienced because of industry discrimination.the lending discrimination and business formation studies both strongly support denver argument that are smaller and less experienced because of marketplace and industry discrimination.in addition,denver expert david evans testified that discrimination by banks or bonding companies would reduce a firm revenue and the number of employees it could hire.robin hackett,the owner of a wbe,testified that she has difficulty finding and retaining white male employees because they are ridiculed by others in the industry for working at a wbe.hackett also testified that she is excluded from participating in a labor pool of employees shared by other local firms.those firms sharing this labor pool are able to bid a bigger volume of work and not worry about manning the projects.even lunn,cwc expert,admitted during that the size and revenue differences between and firms could be due in part to the presence of discrimination.
denver also argues that cwc argument lacks merit because the study,the dgs study,the study,and the nera study all controlled for size and the study controlled for experience.it asserts that the study measured revenues per employee for construction and concluded that the resulting disparities,suggest that even among firms of the same employment size,industry utilization of mbes and wbes was lower than that of male owned firms.similarly,the study controlled for size,calculating,inter alia,disparity indices for firms with no paid employees which presumably are the same size.cwc responds by simply making the bald allegation that the study control for size is a pretense and that the control is meaningless.this glib response is wholly inadequate to rebut denver argument and the conclusions drawn in the disparity studies.
based on the uncontroverted evidence presented at trial,we conclude that the district court did not give sufficient weight to denver disparity studies because of its erroneous conclusion that the studies failed to adequately control for size and experience.denver is permitted to make assumptions about capacity and qualification of to perform construction services if it can support those assumptions.the assumptions made in this case are consistent with the evidence presented at trial and support the city position that a firm size does not affect its qualifications,willingness,or ability to perform construction services and that the smaller size and lesser experience of are,themselves,the result of industry discrimination.further,cwc did not conduct its own disparity study using marketplace data and thus did not demonstrate that the disparities shown in denver studies will decrease or disappear if the studies controlled for size and experience to cwc satisfaction.consequently,cwc rebuttal evidence is insufficient to meet its burden of discrediting denver disparity studies on the issue of size and experience.
specialization 
the district court also faulted denver disparity studies because they do not control for firm specialization.see concrete works iii,d at aggregating all of the mbes and wbes in estimating availability without regard for the particular services or type of work in which they specialize is a serious flaw in the methodology and impairs the value of the results.the court criticism would be appropriate only if there was evidence that are more likely to specialize in certain construction fields.cwc has failed to marshal any such evidence.its appellate brief contains only the conclusory statement that tend to be congregated in certain construction specialities.this assertion is unsupported by any citation to the record and cwc does not direct this court to any corroborative study or other evidence.further,there is no identified evidence showing that certain construction specializations require skills less likely to be possessed by.in fact,cwc statement appears to contradict the testimony of the city expert,evans,that the data he reviewed showed that mbes were represented widely across the different construction specializations.
in his expert report,lunn criticizes denver disparity studies because they aggregate construction firms without regard to specialization or size.although lunn report contains an example that illustrates his criticism,he conceded during that the example was purely hypothetical and was not based on any data from the denver msa construction industry even though he had access to that data.lunn also testified that he had not done any investigation into whether aggregation bias caused the disparities shown in denver studies.
not only does cwc offer no support for its position that are clustered in certain construction specialities,but it has failed to demonstrate that the disparities shown in denver studies are eliminated when there is control for firm specialization.in contrast,the nera study,which controlled for subspecialty yet still showed disparities,provides support for denver argument that firm specialization does not explain the disparities.
in his report,cwc expert,lanoue,contends that the availability data used in denver disparity studies is unreliable because it is not a measure of only those firms actually bidding on city construction projects.lanoue asserts that,all other measures than bidding are merely proxies for availability u nless a firm makes a bid,it is not actually available for public contracting.lanoue position appears to constitute an implicit conclusion that only studies which equate availability with actual bids on a basis can be used to support denver burden.to calculate availability at the level of certainty urged by cwc,denver would be compelled to survey each mbe,wbe,and majority firm each time bids are sought for a construction project to determine which firms actually bid on the project,either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor.while this approach may provide an accurate count of available firms,it says nothing about whether those firms are qualified.if availability is calculated on an individual basis using lanoue approach,it is possible that unqualified firms would be included in the availability figure simply because they bid on a particular project.conversely,qualified firms would not be included if,for any reason,they chose not to bid on the project.thus,lanoue approach itself illustrates why disparity studies must make assumptions about availability as long as the same assumptions can be made for all firms 
cwc does not identify any evidence showing that bid on city projects at a different rate than firms.thus,it has not demonstrated that differences in bidding practices may explain the disparities found in denver studies.additionally,we do not read croson to require disparity studies that measure whether construction firms are able to perform a particular contract.the studies must only determine whether the firms are capable of undertak ing prime or subcontracting work in public construction projects.croson,at.

john lunn,cwc expert,criticized denver studies because they used stock data and not flow data.studies utilizing stock data provide information on an industry at a discrete point in time.flow data show changes that occur in the industry over time.lunn testified that substantial changes in a market situation and substantial changes in flows do not show up in studies utilizing the stock concept.he then speculated that a study utilizing flow data might show no disparities even though an analysis of stock data may indicate that discrimination is present.lunn,however,illustrated his point by using a hypothetical involving law school admissions he did not test his hypothesis on actual flow data from the denver construction market and he did not testify that any substantial change had occurred in the denver construction industry which would make a study using flow data more reliable than the disparity studies conducted by bbc and nera.
denver individual studies examined the denver construction industry from the through.each study showed disparities between and.thus,considered in the aggregate the disparity studies themselves undermine cwc unsupported assertion that the use of flow data would explain the disparities.
utilization of on city projects 
cwc argues that denver can not demonstrate a compelling interest because it overutilizes on city construction projects.this argument is an extension of cwc argument that denver can justify the ordinances only by presenting evidence of discrimination by the city itself or by contractors while working on city projects.because we have concluded that denver can satisfy its burden by showing that it is an indirect participant in industry discrimination,cwc argument relating to the utilization of on city projects goes only to the weight of denver evidence.
in concrete works ii,this court concluded that cwc had raised a genuine issue of material fact relating to denver reliance on data from construction projects not subject to the ordinances or the goals program which predated the ordinances.we noted that one set of data reveal ed extremely low mbe and wbe utilization.concrete works ii,at referring to the dgs study.similarly,data analyzing the utilization of on bond projects for which goals were never set also showed underutilization of.see id.at referring to the study.in contrast to this data,however,the record also contained studies showing very strong utilization on city projects subject to the goals program.see id.at.consistent with this court mandate in concrete works ii,at trial denver sought to demonstrate that the utilization data from projects subject to the goals program was tainted by the program and reflect ed the intended remedial effect on mbe and wbe utilization.id.at.
in the pretrial order,the parties stipulated that the city utilization of mbes exceeded their availability in of the years measured since.cwc asserts that this indicates there is no underutilization of mbes by the city and,thus,data on the utilization of mbes on city projects provides no support for the remedial measures denver argues that the data is the better indicator of past discrimination in public contracting than the data on all city construction projects.
at trial,denver presented evidence that the high utilization of mbes on city projects subject to the goals program was the result of the program and not the absence of discrimination.particularly persuasive was denver evidence that mbe utilization rates on city construction projects declined significantly after the goals program was amended in.one amendment eliminated the minimum annual goals for mbe participation and replaced them with a system whereby goals were set for each individual project.another amendment required mbes seeking certification to demonstrate that they had suffered from past discrimination.the drop in utilization rates can thus be linked to a relaxation of the city efforts.cwc presented no evidence that otherwise explains the decrease in utilization rates after the amendments became effective.
denver also presented uncontroverted testimony that the goals and projects were similar.one of denver experts testified that the same pool of construction firms worked on both the goals and projects.additional evidence indicated that projects that should have been performed by the dpw were diverted to the dgs to avoid the goals program.this demonstrates that there was at least some overlap in the character of the goals projects administered by dpw and the projects administered by the dgs.again,cwc presented no evidence that the character of the projects was significantly different or that they involved different pools of prime contractors.finally,cwc argument that overutilization of mbes on city projects rendered mbes unavailable to work on private projects has little persuasive value in light of the extensive evidence on industry elasticity and denver evidence that in,dpw projects accounted for less than of all mbe revenues.we conclude that denver presented ample evidence to support the conclusion that the evidence showing utilization on city projects not subject to the ordinances or the goals programs is the better indicator of discrimination in city contracting.
cwc also attacks the data presented by the city and the conclusions drawn from that data.because cwc takes the position that the city can only remedy its own discrimination or the discrimination of contractors while working on city projects,it asserts that the data is the only relevant data presented by denver.it further argues that the data provides insufficient support for denver burden.we have rejected cwc argument that the marketplace data is irrelevant but agree that the data is also relevant to denver burden.we note,however,that denver did not rely heavily on the data at trial but focused primarily on the marketplace studies to support its burden.
cwc attempts to rebut the evidence by noting flaws in some of the disparity indices calculated on projects in the study.cwc first criticizes the portion of the study which examined the eight local bond projects undertaken between and.cwc asserts that the disparity indices calculated for these bond projects are meaningless because they were calculated using availability figures.this valid criticism undermines the persuasive value of these disparity indices.cwc also challenges the conclusions drawn in the portion of the study that analyzed five private housing projects constructed in with revenue bonds but not subject to the goals program.the flaws cwc notes in this study are legitimate and support its position that the minority utilization figures are inaccurate and,thus,the subject disparity indices in the study may not be reliable.
cwc also asserts that denver can not rely on the peat marwick study to support the ordinances because that study found no evidence of discrimination in bonding by the city.unfortunately,we can not evaluate the merits of cwc argument because it has provided no record citation directing us to this study and we were unable to locate it in the appellate record.we also note that while it was discussed in concrete works i,it is not referred to in concrete works iii.after a search of the trial transcript,unguided by any record citation,we were able to locate and review only one piece of relevant evidence the testimony of a witness,wesley martin.on the following exchange occurred between martin and cwc counsel,
q you would agree that they did find there that there was no evidence of bonding discrimination in the bonding industry 
a i believe they termed it a little bit differently than that,if i recall from reading that.they said that there was no immediate evidence of discrimination evident there,but i do think they came to a conclusion that it did not exist.
this testimony provides no support for cwc argument that the peat marwick study found no evidence of discrimination,either by denver or by the bonding industry.because we can not review the study itself,we can not determined whether it rebuts denver other evidence and we conclude that cwc argument is waived.
the city also relied on the dgs study,the gao report,and the dot threat to withdraw federal funding as evidence of city discrimination on projects.cwc does not rebut or even discuss the dgs study which showed disparity indices of for mbes and for wbes on dgs remodeling projects.on dgs remodeling projects the disparity indices were for mbes and for wbes.with respect to the gao report,cwc asserts that the only finding reached in that report was that the dpw prequalification requirement had a disparate impact on minorities.cwc then summarily argues that this finding does not support the conclusion that the city was discriminating because the dpw prequalification requirements were race neutral.the gao report,however,concluded that the prequalification system was applied in an inconsistent and subjective manner and that it appeared to have a greater adverse effect on small and minority contractors.the report also concluded that the dpw advertising procedures for bid proposals and its lack of a procedure to assure that contractors had adequate time to prepare bid proposals had a greater negative effect on smaller less experienced contractors and minority contractors.denver has already conceded that mbes are generally smaller and less experienced than firms and has introduced evidence indicating that both characteristics are the result of industry discrimination.see.a,supra.
cwc also asserts that denver reliance on the gao report is misplaced because the report contained an incorrect minority availability figure of.in the study,bbc used census data to estimate mbe availability in at.the gao report,however,did not calculate disparity indices or attempt to determine whether minority contractors were being underutilized.as cwc itself concedes,the report concluded only that denver contracting practices and policies adversely affected small contractors and minority contractors more than majority contractors.cwc criticism does nothing to rebut this finding.as the report itself indicates,the gao did not rely on the availability figure to reach its conclusions 
since denver had not established specific goals for minority contractor participation in federally assisted construction contracts,no measure was available to determine whether the current level of participation was reasonable.however,denver identified about percent of the construction contracting firms in the denver metropolitan area as being owned by minorities.
although the gao report is not particularly compelling because it contains very little analysis,the conclusions drawn in the report do provide some support for denver position that it engaged in discriminatory conduct.cwc arguments are insufficient to rebut those conclusions.
cwc attempt to discredit denver reliance on the dot threats to withdraw federal funding is also unpersuasive.like the gao report,the dot found that denver prequalification requirements operated as a barrier to minority firms.in,the dot threatened to initiate administrative proceedings to terminate federal funding for stapleton international airport unless denver modified its prequalification procedures and developed an affirmative action plan applicable to stapleton.we again reject cwc argument that the dot findings do not show discriminatory conduct by denver because the prequalification requirements were.cwc also asserts that the dot findings are flawed because the dot erroneously determined that minority contractor utilization was in and in.cwc again points to the study prepared by bbc which calculated mbe availability in at and argues that,based on the dot utilization figures,mbes were actually overutilized on projects.cwc does not provide any record citation to support its assertion that the dot determined minority utilization to be in and in.we have reviewed all the materials in the appellate record relating to the city dispute with the dot and could not locate the source of cwc information or confirm its accuracy.thus,we are unable to consider cwc argument.in addition,we question whether an accurate disparity index can be calculated by using availability figures from one study and utilization figures from a second study.there is simply no way to determine whether similar methods were used in the two studies.
in sum,denver has demonstrated that the utilization of on city projects has been affected by the affirmative action programs that have been in place in one form or another since.thus,the data is the better indicator of discrimination in public contracting.cwc criticisms of the disparity indices reported in the study persuasively rebuts that data.cwc,however,is unable to persuasively rebut the other evidence,including the dgs study,the gao report,and the dot threatened administrative action.we conclude that,on balance,the data provides some support for denver position that its belief that racial and gender discrimination existed in public contracting before the enactment of the ordinances was supported by strong evidence.
revenue comparisons 
the study contained tables showing that revenues per employee were lower for hispanic,asian,native american,and construction firms in the denver msa than for firms.cwc argues that this data on revenues is flawed.in his expert report,cwc expert,lanoue,asserted that prime contractors report gross revenues differently than subcontractors a subcontractor counts only those revenues earned by its own employees while a prime contractor also includes amounts it receives but pays out to subcontractors.at trial,lanoue testified that all the evidence suggests that white,firms are more likely to be prime contractors.thus,cwc argues that the revenue comparisons contained in the study overstate the revenues of firms.
cwc argument rises or falls on the correctness of the statement in lanoue expert report that mwbes,as newer,smaller firms,tend more often to be subcontractors than prime contractors.lanoue did not identify any study or other evidence upon which he based his statements.in fact,availability data reported in table of the nera study appear to contradict lanoue statement.that data shows that both mbes and wbes are almost equally likely to be prime contractors as they are to be subcontractors.when an expert opinion is not supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law,or when indisputable record facts contradict or otherwise render the opinion unreasonable,it can not support a jury verdict.brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d.
lanoue statements,at best,provide tenuous support for cwc argument.however,denver does not challenge the district court finding,apparently based on lanoue unsupported testimony,that small minority firms most often work as subcontractors.concrete works iii,d at.thus,we must credit cwc argument but conclude it is only marginally persuasive and further note that denver reliance on the data was minimal.
to support its related argument that firms have greater revenues per employee because they are larger and more experienced,cwc offered the testimony of craig long.long,who has worked in the denver construction industry for years,testified that larger more experienced firms are more competitive and more profitable per employee because they,inter alia have more access to cash so they can take advantage of discounts can obtain lower prices from suppliers if they have established relationships with them and can obtain credit at lower rates.we have already concluded,however,that are less able to benefit from the advantages long describes because of discrimination.
cwc also argues that the revenue comparisons are flawed because they do not identify the source of the revenues.cwc takes the position that denver can not use evidence of revenue differences to show that it is a passive participant in marketplace discrimination unless it can demonstrate that all revenues were derived from work done in the denver msa.it appears uncontested that denver studies did not exclude revenues that firms earned on projects outside the denver msa.see id.noting that the data used in the nera study do not limit revenues to what was earned by work done in colorado.lanoue testified that ascertaining the source of firm revenues is important because it identifies the entities or individuals responsible for the discrimination.given our conclusion,supra,that denver other evidence supports the conclusion that it is a passive participant in marketplace discrimination,cwc criticisms regarding the source of revenues are irrelevant.
anecdotal evidence 
faced with the prodigious anecdotal evidence presented by denver at trial,cwc argues that many of the examples of discrimination are not severe or extreme.the anecdotal evidence,however,included several incidents involving profoundly disturbing behavior on the part of lenders,firms,and individual employees.the anecdotal testimony revealed behavior that was not merely sophomoric or insensitive,but which resulted in real economic or physical harm.while cwc also argues that all new or small contractors have difficulty obtaining credit and that treatment the witnesses characterized as discriminatory is experienced by all contractors,denver witnesses specifically testified that they believed the incidents they experienced were motivated by race or gender discrimination.they supported those beliefs with testimony that firms were not subject to the same requirements imposed on them.
there is no merit to cwc argument that the witnesses accounts must be verified to provide support for denver burden.anecdotal evidence is nothing more than a witness narrative of an incident told from the witness perspective and including the witness perceptions.in this case,the anecdotal evidence was not subject to rigorous.see id.at this court limited the number of witnesses to be called for this purpose to avoid duplication under,received lay opinions under,expansively accepted hearsay and applied a liberal standard of relevance.cross examination of these witnesses was restricted to avoid unduly prolonging the trial.denver was not required to present corroborating evidence and cwc was free to present its own witnesses to either refute the incidents described by denver witnesses or to relate their own perceptions on discrimination in the denver construction industry.
after considering denver anecdotal evidence,the district court found that the evidence shows that race,ethnicity and gender affect the construction industry and those who work in it and that the egregious mistreatment of minority and women employees had direct financial consequences on construction firms.id.at.the court,however,failed to credit any of denver anecdotal evidence because it did not answer the six questions posed by the court.see id.at t aken as a whole,the anecdotal evidence does not answer the six questions considered in the court evaluation of the statistical evidence.as we conclude supra,however,the district court six questions represent a misstatement of the governing law and imposed an erroneously high burden on denver.based on the district court findings regarding denver anecdotal evidence and our review of the record,we conclude that the anecdotal evidence provides persuasive,unrebutted support for denver initial burden.int l of teamsters united states,d concluding that anecdotal evidence presented in a pattern or practice discrimination case was persuasive because it brought the cold statistics convincingly to life.
the record contains extensive evidence supporting denver position that it had a strong basis in evidence for concluding that the ordinance and the ordinance were necessary to remediate discrimination against both mbes and wbes.the information available to denver and upon which the ordinances were predicated,indicated that discrimination was persistent in the local construction industry and that denver was,at least,an indirect participant in that discrimination.
before enacting the ordinance,denver was informed by the gao that the dpw was likely not complying with federal requirements.a year after the gao report,the dot threatened to withdraw federal funding for stapleton international airport because the dot took the position that minority contractors were not being utilized at appropriate levels.the city then held public hearings at which extensive testimony was given detailing discrimination against mbes and wbes on local construction projects.in,the city solicited written responses to questionnaires and conducted additional hearings on the issue of discrimination in the local construction industry.
the city then retained bbc to evaluate the utilization of on local construction projects.bbc ultimately produced the study which showed large disparities in the utilization of mbes and wbes on construction projects undertaken in the denver msa.further,the study indicated that there were disparities in the utilization of on city projects.the anecdotal evidence collected by bbc and summarized in the study strongly suggested that there was ongoing discrimination against mbes and wbes in the denver construction industry.
before enacting the ordinance,denver had the opportunity to evaluate the considerable amount of information contained in the study.that study used both census data and information obtained from a telephone survey to examine the utilization of mbes and wbes in the denver construction and professional design industries.the census data showed disparities in the utilization of mbes and the survey data showed disparities in the utilization of mbes and wbes.the study also showed that blacks and hispanics working in the denver construction industry had lower rates of than whites and that women had lower rates of than men.the disparities in rates persisted even though the study controlled for education and length of work experience.
the study also contained a summary of the rtd study and the dha study.the rtd study showed disparities in the utilization of prime contractors and subcontractors in the denver msa construction industry.the dha study found some disparities in the utilization of on dha projects.in addition,the separate dgs study showed disparities in the utilization of mbes and wbes on dgs construction and remodeling projects.
the city then retained nera to examine whether discrimination limited participation in contracting.the nera study showed disparities in the utilization of in the colorado construction industry.it also concluded that african americans,hispanics,and native americans working in the denver msa construction industry have lower rates than whites.the nera study then used the information on rates to calculate the potential availability of mbes if they formed construction businesses at the same rate as whites.it then compared potential availability to the actual availability of mbes in the denver msa.in the case of african american,hispanic,and native american prime contractors and subcontractors,potential availability exceeded actual availability.
the nera study also examined the earnings of minorities and women in the construction industry.the study showed disparities in the earnings of women,african americans,hispanics,and native americans.finally,the results of a mail survey conducted by nera showed that engaged in business activities experience disparate treatment at a higher rate than.
to meet its initial burden,denver was not required to unequivocally establish the existence of discrimination nor was it required to negate all evidence of.concrete works ii,at.after properly considering all relevant evidence presented by denver at trial and the district court undisputed factual findings,we conclude that denver met its initial burden of producing strong evidence of racial discrimination in the denver construction industry.denver has also shown that the measures were based on reasoned analysis.moreover,although cwc does not raise the issue,we conclude that denver had a strong basis in evidence to conclude that action was necessary to remediate discrimination against before it adopted both the ordinance and the ordinance.see shaw,at.t he institution that makes the racial distinction must have had a strong basis in evidence to conclude that remedial action was necessary,before it embarks on an program.quotation omitted emphasis in original.
to rebut denver evidence,cwc was required to establish that denver evidence did not constitute strong evidence of such discrimination.concrete works ii,at.cwc can not meet its burden of proof through conjecture and unsupported criticisms of denver evidence.rather,it must present credible,particularized evidence.adarand vii,at.cwc has not met its burden.its legal arguments urging us to disregard denver data,marketplace data,lending discrimination study,and business formation study lack merit.further,its criticisms of the methodologies used in those studies,albeit legitimate in some very limited circumstances,merely nip at the edges of denver evidence and are insufficient to undermine the reliability of the studies.cwc hypothesized that the disparities shown in the studies on which denver relies could be explained by any number of factors other than racial discrimination.however,it did not conduct its own marketplace disparity study controlling for the disputed variables and has presented no other evidence from which this court could conclude that such variables explain the disparities.although cwc advanced a seemingly meritorious argument that the size and experience of may explain the disparities,denver additional evidence persuasively dispelled that argument.
w hether a strong basis in evidence of past or present discrimination exists,thereby establishing a compelling interest for the municipality to enact a ordinance,is a question of law.concrete works ii,at.we conclude that denver ha
