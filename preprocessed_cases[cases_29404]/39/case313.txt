this appeal is our second review of the constitutionality of fees assessed by the city of albuquerque and its municipal union,local,against employees who were not members of the union.the supreme court has held that employees who are not members of a union may be assessed a fair share of the costs of union expenses arising from the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements and other union activities that benefit all of the employees of a public sector employer.lehnert ferris faculty ass,d.in the first appeal of this case,we held that the city fair share fee assessed for union activities violated the constitution.finding the fee overcharged employees because it billed them for activities of the union that did not benefit them,we remanded the case for a hearing to determine the amount of the overcharge and to refund any excess fees to employees.wessel city of albuquerque,cir wessel i 
on remand,the district court concluded that the city and union had failed to prove what portion of fair share fees were allocated for activities benefitting local.as a remedy for the constitutional violation,the court ordered local to refund all fees it collected from the employees.in addition to this refund,the district court also ruled that the city was required to refund amounts it received from local under an indemnification provision we held void as against public policy in wessel 
in this appeal,the city and local challenge both conclusions.we agree with the district court that local failed to meet its burden of proof in showing what portion of the fair share fee benefitted the employees.we conclude,however,that the district court applied the wrong standard in ordering the city to refund amounts it received under the indemnification provision.
having jurisdiction under,we affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
union representation.the american federation of state,county,and municipal employees afscme,is a labor union that represents municipal employees nationwide.afscme provides numerous services to its local affiliates,including contract negotiation,and representation in grievance and arbitration proceedings.afscme also provides some funds to its affiliates to pay local expenses incurred in providing these services.
local is the largest afscme local affiliate in new mexico,representing municipal employees of the city of albuquerque.the city,in turn,recognizes local as the exclusive representative of municipal employees for collective bargaining purposes.see albuquerque,code ch.city employees may join afscme by paying a fee,which is divided among the local,council,and national entities.
employees who do not wish to join the union are not required to do so.see albuquerque,a city employees have the right to refuse to join and participate in the activities of employee organizations.under federal law,however,if at least of employees in the bargaining unit are union members,members may be charged a fair share fee,which is their proportionate share of the union costs of negotiating and administering the collective bargaining agreement and adjusting the grievances and disputes of bargaining unit employees.id.
the first appeal.in,thirteen city employees who chose not to join local filed suit under against the city,various city officials,local and afscme.the employees claimed the defendants violated their first amendment rights by requiring them to pay disproportionately high fair share fees.both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court ruled that local fair share notice was unlawful,but ruled in favor of the defendants on all other claims,including the constitutionality of the fair share fees.
in,we reversed the district court conclusion that the fair share fees were constitutional.applying supreme court precedent,we concluded that at least some of the purposes for which the fees were collected could not be charged back to members.wessel i,at.in particular,we found the portion of the fees collected that went to afscme national union to serve as exclusive representative in other bargaining units would not inure to the benefit of the members of the local organization and their collection violates the principles expressed by the supreme court in lehnert.id.consequently,the portion of the fair share fee collected for these purposes was not chargeable to employees.we also concluded a provision in the collective bargaining agreement allowing the city to be indemnified by the union for services,which were later determined to be unconstitutional,was void as against public policy.id.at.we remanded to the district court to determine how much of the fair share fee,if any,could appropriately be charged to the plaintiffs.id.at.
remand.on remand,the union defendants urged the district court to find that the entire fee was properly chargeable to.the district court disagreed for two reasons.it first concluded that wessel i had already determined at least some portion of the fair share fee had been charged for activities that did not benefit local.second,the district court held that the defendants had failed to satisfy their burden of proof with regard to any of the fair share fees collected from the because they did not show what portion went to other locals and,conversely,what portion went to expenses related to bargaining on behalf of local.d.since the union defendants had failed to establish what portion of the fair share fees were chargeable to members,the district court refunded the entire fee to the plaintiffs.
the district court also ordered the city to refund local payments made pursuant to the indemnification clause we found to be void in wessel 
ii.analysis 
the union defendants and the city raise two issues on this appeal.first,they claim the district court wrongly concluded that the entire fair share fee was not properly chargeable to local.second,they argue that the district court should not have ordered the city to refund the payments for litigation expenses paid by local under the indemnification provision.we address each argument in turn.
chargeability of the fair share fee 
the union defendants primary argument is that the entire fair share fee was constitutionally permissible.in support of their argument,they presented testimony at the remand hearing that all of the services of afscme,as an exclusive bargaining representative at the national level,are also available to local on an basis.accordingly,they claim the entire fair share fee is properly chargeable to employees.the union defendants also argue that our decision in wessel i did not preclude the district court from reconsidering whether expenses related to exclusive bargaining were in fact a chargeable benefit to local.
the district court rejected these arguments.the court concluded that wessel i precluded relitigation of whether exclusive bargaining representation inured to the benefit of local.the district court also found the union defendants had failed to meet their burden of showing what portion of the fair share fee was unconstitutional.specifically,the district court found the union defendants did not show that fair share fees were spent only on activities that the union considered to be chargeable to d at collected funds for services that were not chargeable under supreme court precedent and our decision in wessel i and charged for services provided at the national level too nebulous to benefit local.the court further found the union defendants argument that they could not apportion expenses for exclusive representation lack ed credibility as they had detailed information apportioning other chargeable services.id.
scope of wessel 
the union defendants first argument is that wessel i did not foreclose the possibility that the entire fair share fee was chargeable to the employees.we disagree.
our previous decision considered whether the fees collected in this case violated the constitutional standard on expenses as articulated in lehnert ferris faculty,d.wessel i,at.in lehnert,the supreme court notes t here must be some indication that the payment is for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization.at.applying and quoting lehnert,we held expenses are not chargeable if they are unrelated to an objecting employee unit.wessel i,at.after reviewing the record,we found some evidence in the record that a portion of the fees collected went to the national union to serve as exclusive representative in other bargaining units.id.rejecting the union defendants argument that the entire fee was constitutional,we held 
such fees would not inure to the benefit of the members of the local organization and their collection violates the principles expressed in lehnert.we disagree with the district court conclusion that the union did not exceed the constitutional limitations on the types of expenses properly included in a fair share fee.
id.consequently,we remanded the case to the district court to hold a hearing to determine which fees are attributable to expenses in local as distinguished from those which do not inure to the benefit of the local bargaining unit.id.
we agree with the district court that wessel i explicitly resolved the question of the chargeability of the entire fair share fee for sums collected for use by afscme as exclusive bargaining representative for other local unions.the panel opinion in wessel i was unambiguous.we stated that collection of fees for this purpose violates the principles expressed in lehnert,at,and remanded for necessary on the amount of the overcharge.accordingly,the district court did not err in its understanding of the scope of wessel 
law of the case 
the union defendants argued below that the law of the case doctrine should not preclude them from showing their fees for exclusive bargaining services were properly chargeable to local.on appeal,they argue the testimony at the remand hearing demonstrates that the panel in wessel i was wrong in its holding that a portion of the fee was not properly chargeable.again,we disagree.
generally,once a court decides an issue,the same issue may not be relitigated in subsequent proceedings in the same case.grigsby barnhart,cir.unlike res judicata,the law of the case doctrine is not an inexorable command,but is to be applied with good sense.united states monsisvais,cir quoting major benton,cir.accordingly,the doctrine is subject to three exceptions when the evidence in a subsequent trial is substantially different when controlling authority has subsequently made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues or when the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.grigsby,at.we read these exceptions narrowly,requiring district courts to apply the law of the case unless one of the exceptions specifically and unquestionably applies.monsisvais,at internal quotations omitted.
here,only the first exception might be applicable.under this exception,c ourts have generally permitted a modification of the law of the case when substantially different,new evidence has been introduced.major benton,cir.the exception does not apply,however,where the additional evidence provided at the supplemental hearing was evidence the proponent had in its possession,but failed to produce,at the time of the original hearing.monsisvais,at.
in wessel i,the foundation for our holding was the conclusion that charges for afscme service as exclusive bargaining representative for local unions other than local would not inure to the benefit of the members of the local organization.at citing.at.on remand,the union defendants sought to counter this conclusion.they offered testimony that the accounting description had no substantive significance and,therefore,funds dedicated to these functions did benefit local unions.essentially,afscme argues here that its services as national exclusive bargaining representative for other local unions are available to local therefore chargeable to.
this issue was addressed in wessel i.in those proceedings,the employees identified afscme bargaining representative services as an example of a expense.they argued 
the original and revised notices do not limit expenses chargeable to nonmembers to the costs of negotiating and administering the collective bargaining agreement with the city and adjusting the grievances and disputes of bargaining unit employees.both expressly state that chargeable expenses include s erving as exclusive representative in other bargaining units.
wessel i.at.in response,the union defendants contended 
local admits that the original and revised notice calculated the chargeability percentage based on expenditures germane to collective bargaining included,where appropriate,expenditures related to s erving as exclusive representative in other bargaining units.local disputes any implication that such expenditures are not authorized 
we are not persuaded on the basis of this prior record that the union defendants on remand have presented substantially different evidence such that a departure from the law of the case is warranted.grigsby,at major,at.accordingly,the district court did not err on remand in relying on our decision in wessel 
having said this,we note the district court did accept testimony regarding the union defendants treatment of exclusive bargaining expenses.the court concluded the evidence did not show such expenses were properly chargeable to members under lehnert.even if the law of the case doctrine did not apply,we are bound by the district court factual findings in this regard.we thus turn to the evidence produced on remand.
burden of proof 
in a thorough written order,the district court concluded the union defendants had not satisfied their burden of showing that the fair share fees were collected to finance costs associated with otherwise chargeable activities consistent with our decision in wessel i.we agree for two reasons.first,the record demonstrates the union defendants failed to produce any evidence showing what portion of the fair share fee funded afscme work as exclusive bargaining representative.second,the union defendants witnesses failed to convince the district court that those funds used for exclusive representation were also available to local and therefore chargeable.our review of the district court factual determinations is for clear error.nieto kapoor,cir.
the primary reason the district court found the entire fair share fee should be refunded was the union defendants inability or unwillingness to separate out the costs of serving as exclusive bargaining representative from their total expenditures.under lehnert,the union bears the burden of proving the proportion of chargeable expenses to total expenses.at.
on remand,the union defendants witnesses conceded they could not determine the cost of serving as exclusive bargaining representative in other bargaining units.at.based on this testimony,the district court concluded the union defendants attempt to justify their inability to meet their burden does not provide a defense for not meeting it.d at.because of the lack of evidence,t he portion that relates to the union serving as the exclusive bargaining representative of locals other than local was not properly collected from and must also be refunded.d at.it was undisputed that some portion of the fair share fee went to fund afscme work as exclusive bargaining representative.since the union defendants did not identify the various components that made up the fees,and because they had the burden of proof,the court ordered them to refund the entire amount.we agree with this conclusion.
even if we were tempted to depart from the law of the case and consider the union defendants testimony that exclusive bargaining expenses were properly chargeable,we would still affirm.the district court concluded that the union defendants testimony lacked credibility and specificity such that it could not credit the explanation of the union defendants interpretation of exclusive bargaining services.we give the district court determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses great deference.dill city of edmond,cir.
we agree with the district court that the lack of explanation undermined the union defendants claims.first,the district court found that the union defendants
