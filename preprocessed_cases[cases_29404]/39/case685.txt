on january,the united states postal service usps awarded federal express fedex a contract valued at approximately billion.under the provisions of this contract,fedex agrees to provide air transportation network services to deliver the usps express,priority,and first class mail.the usps negotiated this contract with fedex on a basis that is,the usps did not solicit competitive bids.emery worldwide airlines,emery,an air transportation provider that currently transports postal mail under certain air service contracts with the usps,filed an action in the united states court of federal claims court of federal claims or trial court contesting the usps fedex contract award.after determining that it had subject matter jurisdiction,the trial court granted the government motion for summary judgment upholding the contract and denied emery for summary judgment,emery worldwide airlines,united states.we affirm.
background 
the usps currently uses a piecemeal system of dedicated air transportation networks to deliver express,priority,and first class mail a dedicated network uses aircraft that are operated exclusively for the transportation of a single customer parcels,the usps mail in this case.emery currently operates a fleet of dedicated aircraft under contracts with the usps.at least six other dedicated system air transportation providers also currently carry express,priority,or first class mail.some first class mail is also carried on commercial aircraft.
the usps recognized that dedicated networks are inefficient and expensive.it also realized that commercial aircraft failed to deliver over of postal mail on time.therefore,the usps sought to contract with a single air transportation provider that could provide a shared or system in which the provider would reliably,effectively,and affordably carry postal mail.a shared system aircraft provides transportation services for more than one customer.such a system allows the usps to take advantage of economies of scale,paying for only a portion of operating and overhead costs.a shared system also relieves the usps from paying for an entire plane flight to a particular destination when it only requires transportation of a small amount of mail in other words,a system allows the usps to on a plane that already flies on a particular route.
in august,the usps hired pricewaterhousecoopers,llp pwc to conduct a market assessment of the air transportation industry.with assistance from mergeglobal,pwc developed an analysis the pwc analysis,which is dated january.in the analysis,pwc used publicly available data to assess several carriers potentially available for the contract 
by autumn,it was clear that the usps was seriously considering awarding a contract to fedex to provide the mail transportation services at issue.indeed,on september,postmaster general william henderson held a press conference on the topic of fedex strategic alliance discussions.at the end of the year,the usps had developed a transportation agreement with fedex on a basis.the usps never sought competitive bids from other carriers rather it negotiated solely with fedex.
on january,emery filed an action in the court of federal claims and moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the usps from awarding a contract to fedex for transportation of express,priority,and first class mail.fedex entered the case as an intervenor.the usps moved to dismiss the case on three grounds emery lacked standing because it was not an interested party the court of federal claims lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the usps is not a federal agency for purposes of the tucker act and the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction because the action could not be brought against the usps in its own name.the trial court allowed emery to amend its complaint to name the united states as a defendant and determined that emery is an interested party.the court deferred ruling on whether it possessed tucker act jurisdiction.
during a hearing on january,the united states presented a document entitled justification for noncompetitive purchase with federal express corporation justification,which was signed on january,on behalf of the usps.the justification outlines nine usps requirements for transporting express,priority,and first class mail.these requirements include,inter alia ability to decrease the usps reliance on dedicated aircraft and move toward a network nationwide coverage capacity strong financial stability that is not overly dependant on the usps for its total livelihood and an infrastructure capable of tracking parcels.the justification emphasizes the usps preference for a contractor that can provide a network that will decrease its current operating costs and overhead outlays.
the justification also describes options the usps had under its internal guidelines,the purchasing manual,for procedures it could use to purchase transportation services.one option available was an open,competitive bidding procedure.based on its extensive experience in awarding competitively bid contracts,the usps in its justification explained that such a procedure was not feasible for the contract at issue.the usps indicated that competitive bidding would take between one and two years and would require substantial expenditures to design an appropriate network for each viable competitor before it could establish a definitive basis for pricing.the justification also provided that under the purchasing manual,instead of conducting a competitive bidding procedure,the usps could select a single supplier and negotiate a contract with it this negotiation procedure was followed by the usps in developing the contract with fedex.
the justification then indicates that six carriers,including emery and fedex,had existing national air networks potentially large enough in geographical scope to perform the contract for express,priority,and first class mail.as evidenced by the justification,the usps considered each of these potential providers.in describing emery,the usps noted that emery possesses a fleet of only planes,which are on average years old and are likely to depreciate rapidly and require significant maintenance costs.the usps also indicated that it was unlikely emery could meet the usps requirements at a price without relying on usps payments for a significant portion of its revenue.the usps further recognized that emery has only of the daytime flight capacity required by the usps and only flies to sixty cities only sixty percent of which overlap with the existing usps network although the usps required transport to at least cities.
after analyzing all six carriers,including emery and fedex,the usps in the justification remarked that fedex is uniquely situated to meet the usps needs.further,the justification concludes that a award to fedex is so compelling that competition would not be in the best interests of the usps.
the usps attached the pwc analysis to the justification as an appendix.in its analysis,pwc screened out potential suppliers that did not meet particular usps requirements.these requirements were categorized into seven filters,which closely mirror the justification requirements.emery was filtered from consideration after the second filter national geographic scope,which considers number of airports served,airport overlap with the existing usps network,and ability of a carrier to cost effectively serve additional airports.after the sixth filter in the pwc analysis,only fedex remained.accordingly,both the usps in the justification and pwc in its analysis determined that fedex is best suited to meet the usps needs for the contract at issue.notably,the pwc analysis also demonstrates that emery possesses a very small market share of goods transport services compared to fedex and other air shipping companies.
on january,jp morgan securities,jp morgan,which was hired by the usps board of governors the board,presented a report to the board finding that the transportation agreement contemplated by the usps and fedex is fair and achieves the usps objectives.the jp morgan report also confirms that over the contract period,the usps will save approximately billion by using a fedex system rather than its current piecemeal network.
on january,the court of federal claims entered an order denying emery application for a temporary restraining order and formalizing its earlier ruling that emery is an interested party that has standing to bring suit.the usps awarded fedex the contract on january,a synopsis of the contract was placed in the commercial business daily cbd on february.
emery amended its complaint on january,it sought a declaratory judgment to set aside the contract and an injunction to stop performance under the contract.emery alleged that the usps violated the administrative procedure act apa and pointed to no fewer than ten alleged defects in the procurement process emery and the united states filed for summary judgment.
the court of federal claims first determined that it possessed jurisdiction over this suit.it next stated that in accordance with the tucker act,b,the court of federal claims reviews award procurement protests under apa review standards.under that standard,the trial court indicated that an award could be set aside only if the decision lacked a rational basis or if it involved a prejudicial violation of a regulation or procedure.
the trial court next addressed whether the usps violated f,which provides in selecting modes of transportation,the usps shall make a fair and equitable distribution of mail business to carriers providing similar modes of transportation to the usps.the trial court determined that the usps did not violate f because that provision contemplates a award to a single provider.the trial court then indicated that competitive bidding is not required under f because d and the usps purchasing manual allow the usps to award contracts.
the trial court next examined b and indicated that the usps violated the statute plain language,which requires that a contract between the usps and a carrier be made available for public inspection at least fifteen days prior to the effective date of the contract.nonetheless,the court determined that b does not apply to domestic contracts.the trial court noted that b was enacted in while the civil aeronautics board cab maintained responsibilities and after the cab sunset act,stat,the usps was authorized to use competitive bidding or negotiations in place of cab.therefore,the trial court determined that the original purpose of the b publication requirement to ensure uniformity of terms ceased to exist when the cab was divested of responsibility.consequently,citing justice kennedy concurrence in public citizen united states department of justice,d kennedy,concurring,the trial court determined that the plain language of the statute would lead to patently absurd consequences that congress could not possibly have intended and therefore concluded that b did not bind the usps.
the trial court also addressed emery assertion that the usps violated provisions in the usps purchasing manual by failing to synopsize the purchase in the cbd prior to awarding the contract.the usps and fedex argued that publication in the cbd was not required by the purchasing manual and that its publication in the cbd satisfied the manual strictures.based on the plain language of the provisions,the trial court determined that the cbd synopsis must be publicized prior to the contract award.nonetheless,applying an apa standard of review similar to apa review in a bid protest case,the trial court refused to set aside the contract because emery failed to establish that violation of the purchasing manual publication requirement prejudiced emery.
the trial court next reviewed numerous arguments directed to establishing that the usps decision lacked a rational basis.the court indicated that it would review these types of claims under the apa rational basis standard of review used in bid protest cases.the trial court recognized that the usps did not engage pwc to conduct an interactive process rather it noted that the usps had a award to fedex as an objective and pwc task was to justify it.nonetheless,after considering each allegation made by emery in great detail,the trial court determined that emery failed to establish that the usps decision to contract with fedex on a basis lacked a rational basis.
after addressing the merits of emery claim,the trial court considered the balance of the harms and the public interest and entered judgment for the united states and fedex,denying emery injunctive relief to halt performance of the usps fedex contract and declaratory relief to set aside the contract.in conclusion,the court of federal claims denied the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,denied emery for summary judgment,and granted the government motion for summary judgment,dismissing the complaint and ordering judgment for the united states and fedex.this appeal followed the aforementioned events.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
the breadth of jurisdiction in the united states court of federal claims is a legal question that this court reviews de novo.ramcor servs.group united states.
the history of judicial review of government contracting procurement decisions is both long and complicated.impresa construzioni geom.domenico garufi united states.in,the supreme court in perkins lukens steel,held that aggrieved protesters lacked standing to challenge government contract awards in federal courts.the perkins court reasoned that the public contracts act of was designed solely to protect the government.id.at.that is,the supreme court determined that disappointed potential contractors had no standing because they suffered no legally cognizable injury.
after perkins,government contract procurement cases were brought in the court of federal claims on a limited basis under a theory that the government made an implied contract with prospective bidders to fairly consider their bids heyer prods.united states.this venue was available because the tucker act granted the court of federal claims jurisdiction over claims founded on implied contracts with the united states,a.prior to,court of federal claims review was narrow and an aggrieved party was typically limited to monetary relief.impresa,at.in,congress enacted the federal courts improvement act of fica,a,stat,which,inter alia,granted the court of federal claims jurisdiction to provide declaratory and injunctive relief.id.in,however,the federal circuit limited court of federal claims jurisdiction in government procurement actions to cases brought before a contract is awarded.united states john grimberg,en banc.
following passage of the apa in,the district of columbia circuit in scanwell laboratories,shaffer,held that government contract procurements were reviewable in federal district courts.the scanwell court determined that standing to challenge agency actions was grounded in the judicial review provisions of the apa.
in,congress passed the administrative dispute resolution act of adra,stat.this statute provides in part 
both the unties sic states court of federal claims and the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or proposed procurement.both the united states court of federal claims and the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction to entertain such an action without regard to whether suit is instituted before or after the contract is awarded.
b supp.v emphasis added.this statutory provision allowed both federal district courts and the court of federal claims to hear the full range of cases previously subject to review in either system.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of levin.
yet,to prevent forum shopping and to promote uniformity in government procurement award law,congress sought to channel the entirety of judicial government contract procurement protest jurisdiction to the court of federal claims therefore,as part of the adra,congress enacted a sunset provision,which terminated federal district court jurisdiction over bid protests on january,d,stat.at.it is clear that congress intent in enacting the adra with the sunset provision was to vest a single judicial tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction to review government contract protest actions.senator cohen,who offered the provision at issue,described the adra intended impact on jurisdiction 
the legislation is designed to increase the efficiency of our procurement system by consolidating jurisdiction over bid protest claims in the court of federal claims.the legislation would reverse the decision of the circuit in scanwell providing district courts with jurisdiction to hear bid protest claims has led to forum shopping and the fragmentation of g overnment contract law.consolidation of jurisdiction in the court of federal claims is necessary to develop a uniform national law on bid protest issues and end the wasteful practice of shopping for the most hospitable forum.congress established the claims court now the court of federal claims for the specific purpose of improving the areas of g overnment contracts scanwell jurisdiction frustrates this purpose and deprives litigants of the substantial experience and expertise the court of federal claims has developed in the g overnment contracting area.
cong.rec.daily ed.june,statement of cohen.
senator levin,who introduced the adra legislation,recognized that the sunset provision applied not only to bid protests,but to procurement protests in general after years,the jurisdiction of the district courts would terminate,and the court of federal claims would exercise judicial jurisdiction over procurement protests.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of levin emphasis added.consequently,it is clear that the court of federal claims is the only judicial forum to bring any governmental contract procurement protest.see novell,united states,d,t here is no longer jurisdiction for the district courts in government bid protest cases rather congress effectively subsumed apa jurisdiction of the district courts into the more specific jurisdictional language of the adra.
the united states contends that it is not subject to court of federal claims jurisdiction because the usps is not a federal agency as specified by the adra,b.that section gives the court of federal claims jurisdiction over actions objecting to proposed or actual contract awards by a federal agency.while title of the united states code does not define federal agency,it does define agency 
as used in this title the term agency includes any department,independent establishment,commission,administration,authority,board or bureau of the united states or any corporation in which the united states has a proprietary interest,unless context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense.
supp.v emphasis added.nothing in b indicates that this definition of agency does not apply in determining whether a government entity is a federal agency under.further,dictates that an agency for purposes of title must be within the domain of the united states.accordingly,federal agency as used in b falls within the ambit of agency as used in.consequently,we must consider whether the usps is an agency under.
the postal reorganization act of,stat,created the usps to replace the former post office department.butz eng g united states.the usps is statutorily defined as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the united states.section indicates that an independent establishment of the united states is an agency for purposes of.
indeed,one of our predecessor courts in butz,in the course of examining tucker act jurisdiction over the usps in a government contract case,noted that by creating the usps,congress in no way intended to strip the post office department of its public service character.at.to determine whether the court had tucker act jurisdiction under the theory of an implied contract with the usps,the butz court examined agency as used in,which is identical in pertinent part to the current.
in sum,the usps is a agency,and consequently is a federal agency for purposes of b,unless context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense,emphasis added.
under supreme court jurisprudence,it is clear that we may only consider statutory text in construing the statutory term context.in rowland california men colony,d,the supreme court discussed,which provides in determining the meaning of any act of congress,unless the context provides otherwise the word person includes the rowland court stated that c ontext here means the text of the act of congress surrounding the word at issue,or the texts of other related congressional acts at.it continued if congress had meant to point further afield,as to legislative history,for example,it would have been natural to use a more spacious phrase,like evidence of congressional intent,in place of context.id.at.in hubbard united states,d,the supreme court similarly indicated that statutory text alone should be used to interpret the word context in the portion of that provides the term department means one of the executive branches enumerated in section now of title,unless context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense.emphasis added.the emphasized statutory language is identical to the context clause at issue in.interpreting this language,the hubbard court quoted rowland for the proposition that the text of congressional acts alone should be used to determine the context,and then stated review of other materials is not warranted.id.at.
in light of rowland and hubbard,it is clear that to determine whether context shows that the term agency was intended to be used in a more limited sense than described in,only statutory text may be considered.neither the statutory text surrounding the word context in nor the text of any related congressional act clearly indicates that agency was not meant to include the usps.indeed,the butz court determined that the context of the postal reorganization act does not require a limited reading of the term independent establishment for our jurisdictional purposes.at.consequently,the usps is a agency and a federal agency for purposes of b.
the united states also argues that procurement protest jurisdiction history prevents the court of federal claims from exercising jurisdiction over government contract procurement protests involving the usps,such as the one at issue the government points out that senator levin indicated that the adra would give e ach court system district courts and the court of federal claims jurisdiction over the full range of bid protest cases previously subject to review in either system.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of levin emphasis added.the united states argues that prior to the passage of the adra,the court of federal claims could not hear this case because emery did not submit a bid and court of federal claims jurisdiction prior to passage of the adra,which rested on an implied contract theory,required bid submission the united states then asserts that prior to passage of the adra,federal district courts did not have scanwell jurisdiction over the usps because scanwell review is premised on the apa and a specifically exempts the usps from the apa.section a provides 
except as provided by subsection b of this section,and except as otherwise provided in this title or insofar as such laws remain in force as rules or regulations of the postal service,no federal law dealing with public or federal contracts,property,works,officers,employees,budgets,or funds,including the provisions of chapters and of title,shall apply to the exercise of the powers of the postal service.
emphasis added.judicial review under the apa is specifically described in chapter of title.accordingly,the government argues that because district court jurisdiction was premised on apa review and because a purports to exempt the usps from apa review,scanwell jurisdiction could not lie had this case been brought to a district court prior to passage of the adra consequently,the government argues that prior to enactment of the adra neither the court of federal claims nor federal district courts could have possessed jurisdiction over the suit at issue and therefore,it contends that the court of federal claims does not now have jurisdiction over this suit.
the government assumes that prior to enactment of the adra,scanwell jurisdiction was available in district courts for both pre and government procurement cases.therefore,the government can not properly argue that prior to enactment of the adra,no cases could be brought in district courts the government simply argues that prior to passage of the adra,district courts were not available for cases involving the usps.
we need not decide whether,prior to passage of the adra,federal district courts possessed jurisdiction over procurement protests involving the usps.the adra clearly states that the court of federal claims has jurisdiction over federal agenc ies with respect to a proposed award or the award of a contract.b.the normal understanding of a statute bare language is not conclusive but it is entitled to prevail unless overcome by a persuasive showing from the purpose or history of the legislation.lutheran mut.life ins.united states.while the legislative history undergirding the adra indicates that the court of federal claims was to gain traditional scanwell jurisdiction,that history fails to state whether the usps was subject to scanwell jurisdiction in federal district courts prior to passage of the adra.further,notwithstanding a,numerous courts have recognized that district court jurisdiction may be invoked to test the validity of a procurement decision made by the usps.see,peoples gas,light coke united states postal,cir t he exemptions found in section of the postal reorganization act do not manifest a congressional intent to foreclose all judicial review of alleged violations by the postal service procurement regulations.united states postal,d carter chevrolet agency,united states postal,d express one int l united states postal.express one int l united states postal.but see concept automation,united states postal.determining that a prevents usps procurement decisions from judicial review.
t he relevant inquiry into legislative intent is not whether congress correctly perceived the then state of the law,but rather what its perception of the state of the law was.brown servs,d.neither the adra text nor its legislative history clearly exclude the usps from present court of federal claims jurisdiction.further,in enacting the adra,congress did not have a well established body of case law indicating that usps procurement protests were not properly subject to district court jurisdiction under scanwell.therefore,without explicit congressional direction regarding scanwell jurisdiction in cases involving the usps,the language of controls,which indicates that the court of federal claims has jurisdiction over all government procurement protest cases,including those involving the usps.indeed,the government position amounts to an argument that no judicial forum is available to review usps government contract protests.without express statutory language from congress or clear legislative history for support,we refuse to twist a and b statutes originally enacted years apart to find that no judicial body possesses jurisdiction to judicially review protests involving the usps 
accordingly,the court of federal claims possesses jurisdiction over the usps in government procurement protest suits.
standard of reviewing the usps actions and inactions 
this case presents two novel questions regarding standard of review.first,we must determine whether to apply apa review to government procurement protests involving the usps.second,if we apply apa review,we must determine whether apa review of a award is identical to apa review of a bid protest action.
apa review of usps procurement protests 
section a of title of the united states code provides that except as explicitly provided for or insofar as federal laws remain in force as usps rules or regulations,no federal law,including chapters and of title of the united states code,applies to the usps.judicial review under the apa is specifically described in chapter of title.therefore,a indicates that apa review does not apply to the usps.
conversely,the adra explicitly imports apa standards of review into the court of federal claims review of government contract procurement protests.b supp.v in any action under this subsection,the courts shall review the agency decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section of title.the legislative history of the adra makes clear that the court of federal claims applies the administrative procedure act standard of review previously applied by the district courts to all procurement protest cases impresa,at emphasis added quoting conf,at.
there is a conflict in the law.the trial court in this case failed to address this issue,as did the litigants all assumed that if the court of federal claims had jurisdiction,apa review applies.
in,the supreme court had the opportunity to address whether congress precluded apa review of usps action by its enactment of a.air courier conference of am.am.postal workers union,afl cio,d.the supreme court,however,declined to decide this issue because the usps raised it for the first time in its brief in opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari and it was not argued to or considered by either the federal district court or district of columbia circuit below.id.at.in a footnote,the majority noted that this issue could be waived by the parties because it is not jurisdictional.id.at.the air courier court then proceeded to decide the case based on standing to sue under the apa.
similar to the supreme court in air courier,we decline to address the breadth of a.each party before the trial court,in its briefs to this court,and at oral argument contended that if we found jurisdiction under the tucker act,apa review applies.because the judicial review provisions of the apa are not jurisdictional,califano sanders,d,and because the court of federal claims possessed tucker act jurisdiction over this suit,both parties waived any arguments concerning the effect of a on apa review.consequently,we will apply the apa review strictures in this case 
apa review of a sole source award 
the apa provides that a reviewing court must set aside agency actions that are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a supp.v.under this standard,the agency action is entitled to a presumption of regularity,citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d,and the agency action must be upheld as long as a rational basis is articulated and relevant factors are considered,motor vehicle manufacturers ass of the united states state farm mutual automobile insurance,d bowman transportation,arkansas best freight system,d.
pursuant to these general precepts,the impresa court clearly delineated the proper standard of review under the apa in a bid protest context.it stated that a bid award may be set aside if either the procurement official decision lacked a rational basis or the procurement procedure involved a violation of regulation or procedure.impresa,at.when a challenge is brought on the first ground the test for reviewing courts is to determine whether the contracting agency provided a coherent and reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion and the disappointed bidder bears a heavy burden of showing that the award decision had no rational basis.id.at citations omitted.when a challenge is brought on the second ground,the disappointed bidder must show a clear and prejudicial violation of applicable statutes or regulations.id.at.to establish prejudice in an action involving an alleged statutory or regulatory violation,a protester must show that absent the error,there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award.alfa laval separation,united states,statistica,christopher.
identical review standards apply under the apa in the context of a award.see myers investigative and sec,united states,fed.cl.using bid protest jurisprudence under the apa in a award context varicon int l office of pers,indicating that a party that did not receive a contract is analogous to a disappointed bidder that under the apa,must demonstrate that the agency award had no rational basis or involved a clear and prejudicial violation of applicable statutes or regulations.that is,a award may be set aside if either the award lacked a rational basis or the procurement procedure involved a violation of a statute,regulation,or procedure.see impresa,at.under the first ground,the party challenging the award bears a heavy burden of showing that the award decision had no rational basis,see bowman,at.impresa,at.to meet this burden,a disappointed party can show the agency decision to conduct a procurement process lacked a rational basis the agency requirements lacked a rational basis or based on the requirements,the selection of the awardee lacked a rational basis.the test for reviewing courts is to determine whether the contracting agency provided a coherent and reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion.see burlington truck lines united states,d indicating that an agency must articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made impresa,at.
when a party contends that the procurement procedure in a case involved a violation of a statute,regulation,or procedure,it must establish prejudice by showing that it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award,see statistica,at.a disappointed party can establish prejudice either by showing proceeding without the violation would have made the procurement official decision to make a award rather than to conduct a competitive bidding process irrational,see bowman,at,and in a competitive bidding process,the complaining party would have a substantial chance of receiving the award,see alfa laval,at or proceeding without the violation,the complaining party would have a substantial chance of receiving the award,see id.
rational basis for sole source award to fedex 
the usps decision to contract out its priority,express,and first class mail on a basis was rational.the justification demonstrates that the usps considered conducting a competitive bidding process for the contract at issue.the usps rationally recognized,based on its previous experience,that a competitive bidding process would take much longer to perform than negotiating a award and would require the usps to expend a great amount of resources to design appropriate potential networks with each viable competitor.
the justification also provides insight into the rationality of the requirements the usps sought in choosing a contractor.prior to awarding fedex the contract at issue,the usps contracted primarily with multiple dedicated air transport carriers for delivery of priority,express,and first class mail.the usps recognized that this piecemeal system suffered from a myriad of deficiencies,including cost inefficiencies relating to operating procedures and overhead.it also realized that dedicated carriers tend to be less financially stable and more reliant on the usps for financial viability than carriers capable of providing.further,the usps recognized that the commercial airlines that currently transport some first class mail are unreliable in achieving performance.appreciating these difficulties,the usps set forth a number of characteristics that it sought in a carrier for the award.the primary characteristic the usps desired was a single carrier that could provide.the usps rationally determined that unlike a system,in a system,the usps could purchase incremental space on carriers based on its needs.such a shared system allows the usps to reduce significantly operating and overhead costs arising from economies of scale and provides the usps the ability to on a plane already scheduled to travel a particular route.as a necessary component of a shared lift system,the usps also sought a carrier that was not overly dependant on the usps for its financial livelihood.these requirements under which the usps conducted its award decision were rational.
finally,the usps decision to select fedex as the awardee was rational as was its decision to exclude emery from consideration for the contract.while the trial court determined that the usps had the objective of awarding fedex the contract and hired pwc to justify that decision,pwc analysis and the usps decision were nonetheless rational.both the justification and the pwc analysis indicate that it was unlikely that emery could meet the usps national network requirements at a cost effective price without relying on postal payments for a significant portion of its overall revenue.this adverse factor indicates that emery could not provide a system that would benefit the usps.as support for eliminating emery from consideration,the trial court pointed out that the publicly available information cited in the pwc analysis showed that emery does not maintain a substantial business carrying parcels other than postal mail.based on emery small market share of parcel transport service,it was rational for the usps to determine that emery could not provide a substantial delivery system on which the usps could largely.further,the pwc analysis and justification provide ample support,including recitation of market share of shipments,for the usps decision to select fedex over emery and companies that pwc considered more viable than emery for this contract,such as airborne express and united parcel service.
none of the countless other arguments made by emery attacking the rationality of the usps decision garner any weight.
b and the usps purchasing manual 
emery contends that the usps violated b and provisions in the usps purchasing manual by failing to post adequately the contract and a synopsis of the contract,respectively.even assuming arguendo that the usps violated these requirements,emery can not establish prejudice neither publication of the contract for public inspection nor a publication synopsizing the usps purchase prior to the effective date of the contract would have affected the rationality of the usps decision to conduct a process or would have given emery a substantial chance of procuring the contract,because the usps rationally determined emery could not meet its rational requirements.
section f of title provides 
in selecting modes of transportation,the postal service shall give highest consideration to the prompt and economical delivery of mail and shall make a fair and equitable distribution of mail business to carriers providing similar modes of transportation services to the postal service.
emery argues that this statutory provision prohibits the usps from awarding a contract for transportation of express,priority,and first class mail to a single provider of transportation services.alternatively,emery contends that f requires competition for the contract at issue.
by enacting the postal reorganization act,congress sought to untie the usps hands from the political strings that bound the old post office department,at there is widespread agreement that vestiges of century political patronage practices have persisted in the post office department too long and that one of the cardinal needs of postal reform is to seal the postal service from partisan political influence,at the committee simply,and hopefully,recommends that politics in the post office be abolished and authorizes the postal service to insure the fulfillment of that policy.in doing so,congress endeavored to provide the usps freedom to act in a manner,at top management must be given authority to provide an efficient and economical postal system.postal management has been severely and unjustly hampered in its efforts to administer the department in a businesslike way.id.ultimately,the mails are completely dependant upon transportation.yet,the post office department today labors under restrictions on its ability to procure transportation services that are often rigidly confining and in some instances inexcusably archaic.
to effectively and efficiently provide mail service in a manner,the postal reauthorization act provides the usps with extensive flexibility in its transportation decisions,at the committee primary motive is to improve postal service within the present regulatory framework,while at the same time affo
