a corporation which provided foster family agency and group home foster care services for dependent minors of the juvenile court brought a civil rights action for damages under section against the county of los angeles county.the corporation complaint alleged,among other claims,the county violated its procedural and substantive due process rights by placing all of its facilities on do not refer status without adequate notice,hearing,or an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies.the trial court found as a matter of law the federal adoption assistance and child welfare act did not create rights enforceable in a section action.the court further found the corporation contracts were terminable at the convenience of the county and thus created no constitutionally protected property interest.finally,the court found the county act of placing all the corporation facilities on do not refer status was neither arbitrary nor capricious.as an alternative and independent ground the court found the county was protected from liability by the doctrine of qualified immunity.accordingly,the trial court found the county was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and granted its motion for summary judgment.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
appellant,angelica group homes thomas and william foundation angelica,received a license to operate foster family group homes and beginning in entered into contracts with the county to provide group home foster care.angelica later received a license to operate a foster family agency as well.appellants,otis benn and his wife lillian benn,are the founders and principals of angelica.by angelica operated five group homes,four for minors and one exclusively for the care of minor mothers and their babies.according to the benns,at its peak angelica group home and foster family agencies employed more than people and enjoyed revenues exceeding million annually.
in april the county grand jury juvenile services committee issued its final report on group homes.the report raised several concerns about the quality of care foster children received in group homes.the county board of supervisors took several actions in response.among other things,the county board of supervisors mandated increased program audits and financial audits to ensure the quality of care provided in group homes.
in the fall of the county conducted a program audit of angelica group homes.the county representative had an exit conference with the benns at the conclusion of the audit to discuss her findings.the county in its written report found angelica was seriously out of compliance with state regulations and the statement.the county audit found,among other deficiencies,angelica had not been providing required individual and group counseling had not secured court authorizations for psychotropic medications for some residents foster children medical and dental needs had not been timely addressed required reports to the department of children and family services dcfs and case workers were not timely and foster children had been provided inadequate clothing,food and activities.the benns offered to prepare and submit a corrective action plan to address the deficiencies discovered during the audit.they were required to submit their corrective action plan within days of the october,audit report.the record contains no evidence the benns ever submitted a corrective action plan.
earlier,on october,the county placed the group home in perris,california on do not use status.an investigation by the dependency court legal services group found problems with the group home which ranged from inadequate medical care to inadequate food and clothing.
the county apparently placed angelica four other group homes on do not refer status shortly thereafter.
the county conducted repeat audits of angelica foster family agency.the county found angelica in material breach of contract because it continue d to find deficiencies with medical and dental care and psychotropic medication authorizations.in january the county placed angelica foster family agency on do not refer status as well.
also in the county conducted a fiscal audit of angelica covering the year january,to december.the county reported his findings to the county board of supervisors in may.in general terms,the audit disclosed serious deficiencies in angelica controls over the disbursement of group home funds,including numerous questionable expenditures,a lack of accounting records and limited or no supporting documentation.as a result the questioned in expenditures made by angelica with county funds received under its group home and ffa contracts.the report recommended the dcfs resolve the questioned costs and collect any disallowed amounts.
the dcfs demanded payment from the benns but apparently did not otherwise institute proceedings of any kind to enforce its request.according to the benns,the county refused to take angelica off do not refer status until angelica repaid the county the requested amounts.
the parties group home contract provides the county may impose a do not refer order in the event the county,in its sole discretion,determines deficiencies pose a health or safety risk to any child.the contract provision discussing the suspension of intake,and do not refer status,states notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement,the county retains the right to suspend referrals of children to contractor at any time at its sole discretion,in a manner consistent with the procedures outlined in exhibit to the extent possible and reasonable and without interfering with any law enforcement investigation,the county will discuss the reason s for suspension of referral with the contractor verbally and in a written letter at the time of the decision.the contractor may discuss the recommendation or action with representatives from the county as set forth in exhibit 
alternatively,if the program audit reveals deficiencies which do not pose an immediate health or safety risk,then the contractor must cure the breach within the time set by the county and submit a corrective action plan.if the contractor fails to submit or implement a corrective action plan,or fails to satisfactorily cure the violations or breach,then the county may place the contractor on do not refer status until the violation or breach is cured.if the violation or breach is not cured within days the county may terminate the contract however,the contractor may request an appeal in which case no remedy will be enforced until the appeal is resolved 
on the other hand,the contract also provides the county may terminate the contract for convenience when deemed in its best interests to do so 
angelica and the benns filed a civil rights suit against the county and others in march seeking damages under section.they claimed they received no written notice the do not refer status was being extended to all the angelica group homes.as a result,the benns claimed,they were denied the opportunity to present a corrective action plan in order to remove the do not refer directive.the benns claimed the county failure to provide the requisite notice and opportunity to be heard contravened its contractual obligations specifying how a contractor may cure defaults discovered during a program audit.angelica and the benns complaint alleged the county action deprived angelica of a constitutionally protected property interest,violated angelica procedural and substantive due process rights and this same lack of procedural safeguards violated federal statutory law as well.because the effect of the county action was to prohibit future placements of dependent children in any of angelica facilities,the benns claimed the do not refer directive effectively put angelica out of business,for which they sought monetary redress.
in the meantime,the california department of social services,which controls the licensing of foster family agencies and group homes,had been conducting its own investigation of angelica.in february the state filed formal accusations against angelica,seeking to revoke angelica licenses.the accusations of misconduct and deficiencies covered the period through.the accusations ranged from minor allegations such as graffiti scrawled on facility walls to very serious matters such as allegations of molestation of foster children in angelica facilities.
in september,and without admitting the truth of the allegations,angelica and the benns entered into a stipulation and waiver with the state.angelica and the benns agreed to immediately surrender angelica licenses and to permanently waive the right to apply or to reapply for any license issued by the department.angelica and the benns further waived their right to a hearing on the truth of the accusations and the right to an appeal by entering into the stipulation and waiver.
angelica and the benns filed their second amended and operative complaint in april.by this time only the county remained as a defendant.the complaint alleged seven causes of action,only three of which remain at issue in this appeal alleged violations of the federal adoption assistance and child welfare act,specifically violations of section,subdivision a,and,by failing to afford angelica a hearing to determine the propriety of depriving angelica of foster care maintenance payments based on the program and fiscal audits alleged violations of procedural due process by imposing and maintaining do not refer status on angelica group homes without providing the contractually required notice,the opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies,and a hearing to challenge the county decision and alleged violations of substantive due process by the county arbitrary and capricious action in imposing the do not refer directive,thereby depriving angelica of its protected property interest in its contracts with the county.angelica complaint sought compensatory damages under section,interest,attorneys fees and cost of suit.
the county moved for summary judgment,or,in the alternative,summary adjudication of issues.after extensive briefing,supplemental briefing and oral argument covering several months the trial court ultimately granted the county motion for summary judgment.the trial court found as a matter of law the adoption assistance and child welfare act did not create rights enforceable in a section action.the court further found the corporation contracts were terminable at the convenience of the county and thus created no constitutionally protected property interest.finally,the court found the county act in placing all the corporation facilities on do not refer status was neither arbitrary nor capricious given the alleged problems discovered during the various audits.as a separate and independent ground,the trial court found the county was immune from liability for its actions under the doctrine of qualified immunity.accordingly,the trial court found the county was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and granted its motion for summary judgment.angelica and the benns appeal from the adverse judgment

ii.angelica has no property interest protected by the due process clause of the federal constitution based on its contracts with the county.
angelica contends its contracts with the county gave it a reasonable expectation of an entitlement to continued foster children placements and thus a protected property interest in continued funding from the county,enforceable in an action under section section 
absent a finding the group homes posed a health or safety risk to foster children,the parties contract required the county to provide angelica certain procedural protections before the county could impose do not refer status on its group homes.apparently,angelica was not provided the contractually required notice,was not provided the opportunity to prepare and implement a corrective action plan as provided for in the contract,and was not given appeal rights prior to the county decision to impose the do not refer directive.to the extent the county failed to adhere to these contractual requirements for being placed on permanent do not refer status,angelica had a breach of contract claim.however,angelica does not assert a breach of contract claim.instead,angelica seeks damages for alleged violations of its constitutional rights.
section imposes liability on anyone who,under color of state law,deprives a person of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.
a threshold requirement to a substantive or procedural due process claim is the plaintiff showing of a liberty or property interest protected by the constitution a contract with a state entity can give rise to a property right protected under the fourteenth amendment however,although every contract may confer some legal rights under state law,not all contracts give rise to a property right protected under the due process clause as the supreme court has emphasized,t he hallmark of property,is an individual entitlement grounded in state law,which can not be removed except for cause.citations.once that characteristic is found,the types of interest protected as property are varied and,as often as not,intangible,relating to the whole domain of social and economic fact.citations.
t wo general types of contract rights are recognized as property protected under the fourteenth amendment where the contract confers a protected status,such as those characterized by a quality of either extreme dependence in the case of welfare benefits,or permanence in the case of tenure,or sometimes both,as frequently occurs in the case of social security benefits or where the contract itself includes a provision that the state entity can terminate the contract only for cause.
the contract at issue in this case does not fall into any of the categories of contracts recognized as creating a protected property interest.angelica does not have protected status characterized by extreme dependence on the state as might a qualified welfare or social security recipient angelica had a contract to supply services to the county.neither the contract subject matter nor its terms provide the requisite degree of permanence as a contract for tenure or employment for a term of years might most significantly,the contract contains no provision stating it could only be terminated for cause 
angelica notes these facts but contends the clearly articulated,mandatory procedures set forth in the contract for being placed on do not refer status created an entitlement to continued placements.angelica argues these procedural requirements were intended to be such a significant restriction on decision making they gave rise to a legitimate claim of entitlement.
procedural requirements ordinarily do not transform a unilateral expectation into a constitutionally protected property interest.citation.a constitutionally protected interest has been created only if the procedural requirements are intended to be a significant substantive restriction on decision making.citations.if the procedures required impose no significant limitation on the discretion of the decision maker,the expectation of a specific decision is not enhanced enough to establish a constitutionally protected interest in the procedures.citation.
contrary to angelica argument,the procedural steps specified in the contract for placing a group home on permanent do not refer status did not restrict the decision maker discretion regarding how or whether it could terminate the in this case effectively terminate the contract by preventing new referrals to its homes.the group home contract by its terms permitted the county to terminate that contract at any time for convenience when the county deemed termination to be in its best interest.
as to the parties foster family agency agreement,it does not contain any of the procedural safeguards found in the group home contract for being placed on do not refer status.moreover,the county may terminate the foster family agency contract among other reasons simply for convenience,provided the termination is not arbitrary and capricious,unreasonable or discriminatory.according to the dcfs report of january,repeated audits of the angelica foster family agency and reviews of corrective action plans continued to find problems with medical and dental care,as well as with psychotropic medication authorizations.because these matters affected the health and welfare of the children,and remained uncorrected despite multiple audits and corrective plans,the dcfs recommended the angelica foster family agency be placed on do not refer status as well.as a matter of law the county action is not arbitrary and capricious,unreasonable or discriminatory in light of the serious nature of the deficiencies prompting the do not refer status.
the mere inclusion of the termination for convenience clause in the contracts eliminated the essential characteristic of permanence and entitlement necessary to a finding of a protectable property right.as courts have held,when a state entity can terminate a contract for reasons other than cause the contract does not confer a protected status on the plaintiff 
for example in economic development corporation of dade county,stierheim a contractor brought a civil rights action against the county and county manager for claims arising from termination of a contract to distribute funds pursuant to a grant program administered by hud.under the parties contract the county could terminate the agreement on one of two conditions for cause,if the contractor failed to perform or without cause,for convenience on two weeks notice.given this contractual provision,the court found the contractor had no assurances that its contract would still be in force for more than the next two weeks.this lack of an entitlement to the continued existence of its contractual relationship with the county prevented the contractor from acquiring a property interest in its contract with the county.
the court considered it immaterial the contract had actually been terminated for cause rather than for the county convenience.that the county cancelled the contract pursuant to the provision instead of the convenience provision does not affect this analysis.the question of whether a party has a property interest in a contract entails an examination of the rights that party has under the contract.if there was no property interest when the contract was entered into,no property interest was created by the contract being terminated pursuant to one of its provisions instead of another.it is the existence of the convenience provision,not its invocation,that defeats the contractor claim that it was deprived of property without due process of law when the contract was terminated.
similarly,in omni behavioral health miller a corporation which provided foster care services to wards of the state of nebraska brought civil rights claims against a police detective whose investigation of allegations of abuse of residents at a foster care facility allegedly resulted in the closing of the facility.omni,as angelica in the present case,asserted it had a protected property interest as a result of its contract with the state.the omni court recognized that a contract with a state can give rise to a protected property interest when the state entity can terminate the contract only for cause.however,in omni either party could terminate the contract for any reason with days written notice,and for this reason the court found the contract did not create a protected property interest the contract between omni and the state was terminable at therefore did not have the permanence of tenure,and the parties did not have a dependency relationship similar to that created by welfare benefits.if every disgruntled contractor were allowed to allege a constitutional violation when it lost a government contract,the federal courts would be overrun with state law contract claims.citation.
so too in the case at bar.although the parties contracts were not at will contracts as in omni,they contained termination for convenience clauses.the contracts thus gave angelica no assurance of continued foster children placements,no assurance of continued funding from the county,and thus no permanent rights.this lack of an entitlement to the continued existence of its contractual relationship with the county prevented angelica from acquiring a property interest in its contract with the county.
it is true,the county did not terminate its contracts with angelica but rather placed angelica on do not refer status.the do not refer directive prevented future placements and future funding which eventually caused angelica to have no further dealings with the county.the county act thus arguably amounted to a de facto termination of the contract.nevertheless,whether the contracts were actually terminated is immaterial to the analysis whether the contracts gave angelica a constitutionally protected property interest.to recall,the hallmark of a constitutionally protected property interest is an entitlement which can not be removed except for cause.because angelica interest in the contracts could have been taken away for something less than cause,and indeed at the county the contracts inception or at any time lack of permanence defeats angelica claim it was deprived of its constitutionally protected property rights without due process of law.
accordingly,the trial court did not err in concluding the county was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on angelica claim for damages for alleged violations of procedural due process based on its contracts with the county.
iii.the provisions in the adoption assistance and child welfare act relied on by angelica do not create individual rights enforceable in an action under section.
angelica contends it also had a protected property right pursuant to statute,specifically section,subdivision a,and section,of the adoption assistance and child welfare act act,enforceable in an action under section.
the united states supreme court has held section safeguards certain rights conferred by federal statutes as well however,i n order to seek redress through,a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right,not merely a violation of federal law.citation.the united states supreme court has traditionally looked at three factors when determining whether a particular statutory provision gives rise to a federal right.first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.citation.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.citation.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.citations.
on the other hand,section is not available to enforce a violation of a federal statute where congress has foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment itself and where the statute did not create enforceable rights,privileges or immunities within the meaning of.
in wilder virginia hospital association the united states supreme court found the boren amendment to the medicaid act created a substantive federal right enforceable by providers under section to require states to adopt reasonable and adequate reimbursement rates.to qualify for federal financial assistance,states were required to submit a plan to the secretary of health and human services for approval,which among other requirements,established a scheme for reimbursing health care providers.in congress passed the boren amendment to the medicaid act which required states to establish provider reimbursement rates which were reasonable and adequate to meet the costs of efficiently and economically operated facilities.a nonprofit association of public and private hospitals filed suit against the state of virginia for declaratory and injunctive relief,claiming the state plan violated the medicaid act because its reimbursement rates were not reasonable and adequate.the supreme court found there was little doubt that health care providers are the intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment.the provision establishes a system for reimbursement of providers and is phrased in terms benefiting health care providers the court also found the obligation imposed on the states was not too vague or amorphous to be judicially enforceable because the statute and regulations set out factors the state was required to consider when setting its rates 
in blessing freestone by contrast,the united states supreme court concluded mothers and children who were entitled to child support services under title of the social security act had no private right of action to require state agencies to comply with its provisions.t he requirement that a state operate its child support program in substantial compliance with title was not intended to benefit individual children and custodial parents,and therefore it does not constitute a federal right.far from creating an individual entitlement to services,the standard is simply a yardstick for the secretary to measure the systemwide performance of a state title program.thus,the secretary must look to the aggregate services provided by the state,not to whether the needs of any particular person have been satisfied.
in suter artist the united states supreme court considered the very statute at issue in this case,the adoption assistance and child welfare act.the issue in artist was whether section a created private rights,enforceable by child beneficiaries in a section action,to require states to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal of children from their homes.the court reviewed the statute in its entirety and agreed the act imposed a requirement on the states,but that requirement only goes so far as to ensure that the state have a plan approved by the secretary which contains the listed features.in reviewing the language of the specific subdivision the court concluded section,subdivision a confers neither an enforceable private right on its beneficiaries nor creates an implied cause of action on their behalf.careful examination of the language relied upon by the child beneficiaries,in the context of the entire act,leads us to conclude that the reasonable efforts language does not unambiguously confer an enforceable right upon the act beneficiaries.the term reasonable efforts in this context is at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather generalized duty on the state,to be enforced not by private individuals,but by the secretary the court pointed out other sections of the act provided enforcement mechanisms.under the act the secretary of health and human services has the authority to reduce or eliminate payments to a state on a finding the state plan no longer complies with the statute or the state has failed to comply with its own plan 
congress amended the social security act in in section to clarify no provision of the social security act is to be considered unenforceable solely because of its inclusion in a section of the act requiring a state plan or specifying the contents of a state plan.the amendment expressly states it is not intended to limit or expand the grounds for determining the availability of private actions to enforce state plan requirements.congress further specified the amendment is not intended to alter the holding in suter artist that section,subdivision a is not enforceable in a private right of action.
subsequent to the amendment,the court in white by white chambliss addressed another one of the provisions at issue in this case.in white,a mother,individually and as the personal representative of the estate of her daughter who died while in foster care,brought suit against several officials of the south carolina department of social services under section.the mother argued she had a private right of action under section,subdivision a which specifies in order to receive federal funding the state has to establish standards for foster family homes and child care institutions reasonably in accord with recommended national standards.the white court found that for the same reasons articulated in suter artist,section a does not create an enforceable right.as with section a at issue in suter artist,section a similarly provided only general guidelines for the state plan,no specific directives to enforce,and was subject to the alternative enforcement mechanism of the suspension,reduction,or withdrawal of funds by the secretary.in these circumstances,the court held suter forecloses the argument that section a of the aacwa the act provides the source for an enforceable right through section.
later in gonzaga university doe the united states supreme court considered whether the family educational rights and privacy act provided a personal remedy enforceable under section to a former undergraduate under provisions of the act prohibiting funding of educational institutions which have a policy or practice of releasing education records to unauthorized persons.the court reviewed prior section precedent and expressed the view this precedent made clear that unless congress speak s with a clear voice,and manifests an unambiguous intent to confer individual rights,federal funding provisions provide no basis for private enforcement by.citation.
the gonzaga court rejected the notion its cases permitted anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action under section.the court emphasized it was rights and not the vaguer and broader benefits or interests which may be enforced under section borrowing from cases regarding implied rights of action the court observed the inquiry overlaps with that under section i n either case we must first determine whether congress intended to create a federal right.for a statute to create such private rights its text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited.citation.in addition,a plaintiff must show the statute manifests an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.citation.
under these standards the gonzaga court found the family education rights and privacy act did not confer enforceable rights.first,the court noted the statutory language lacked the sort of language critical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights.the provisions instead spoke to the secretary of education,directing no funds be made available to any institution which had a prohibited policy or practice.the court commented,t his focus is two steps removed from the interests of individual students and parents and clearly does not confer the sort of individual entitlement that is enforceable under.reinforcing its view the act did not create individual rights,the court noted the statutory provision did not create a private remedy,but instead authorized the secretary of education to deal with violations of the act 
as noted,angelica claims section,subdivisions a,and of the adoption assistance and child welfare act confer an individual entitlement enforceable through a section action.section is entitled state plan for foster care and adoption assistance.these subsections of subdivision a state in order for a state to be eligible for payments under this part,it shall have a plan approved by the secretary which provides that the plan shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the state,and,if administered by them,be mandatory upon them 
subdivision a requires a state plan to establish an authority or authorities which shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining standards for foster family homes and child care institutions which are reasonably in acc
