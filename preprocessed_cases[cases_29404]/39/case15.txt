facts background 
regulatory framework 
arbour counseling services arbour,owned and operated by defendant appellee universal health services,uhs,is a provider of services in lawrence,massachusetts arbour participates in the state medicaid program,known as masshealth,and bills masshealth for services rendered to individuals insured by the program.
the state has promulgated regulations governing the masshealth program.see generally regs.chapter in particular pertains to the provision of services at both parent centers and satellite facilities around the state in the regulations,a satellite facility,such as the arbour clinic at issue in this case,is a mental health center program at a different location from the parent center that operates under the license of and falls under the fiscal,administrative,and personnel management of the parent center.id.satellite facilities are classified as either autonomous or dependent autonomous facilities have sufficient staff and services to substantially assume their own clinical management independent of the parent center,while dependent facilities operate under the direct clinical management of the parent center.id.
the regulations contemplate that mental health centers will employ qualified core staff members engaged in disciplines such as psychiatry,psychology,social work,and psychiatric nursing.see id.setting forth staff composition requirements id.setting forth requisite staff qualifications.all staff must receive supervision within a formalized relationship,commensurate to the individual skill and level of professional development.id.e.noncore counselors and unlicensed staff in particular must be under the direct and continuous supervision of a fully qualified professional staff member trained in one of the core disciplines.id.f.
satellite programs are subject to additional regulations regarding staff supervision and integration with parent centers masshealth payment for rendered services is conditioned on the satellites compliance with these provisions.id.as arbour lawrence clinic is a satellite of a parent center located in malden,relators claims are largely premised on a failure to conform to the strictures of the regulation.
facts relevant to relators claims against uhs 
relators daughter,yarushka a teenage recipient of masshealth benefits began seeing arbour counselor maria pereyra in after experiencing behavioral problems at school.pereyra,though on staff at arbour,had no professional license to provide therapy.relators met with pereyra supervisor,clinical director edward keohan,after yarushka complained that she was not benefiting from counseling.during the meeting,relators became concerned that keohan was not supervising pereyra and was unfamiliar with yarushka treatment.
yarushka was eventually transferred to another staff member,diana casado,also ostensibly supervised by keohan.like pereyra,casado was unlicensed.relators quickly became unsatisfied with her treatment of their daughter and believed that casado was not being properly supervised.
in february,yarushka was once again assigned to a new therapist,anna fuchu.fuchu held herself out as a psychologist with a,though relators later learned that she had trained at an unaccredited online school and that her application for a professional license had been rejected.notwithstanding fuchu lack of essential credentials,she treated yarushka and eventually diagnosed her with bipolar disorder.
several months later,when yarushka behavioral problems had not abated,officials at her school informed relators that she would be permitted to attend classes only if she saw a psychiatrist.when relators told this to fuchu,she referred yarushka to maribel ortiz,another staff member at arbour.believing ortiz to be a psychiatrist,relators referred to her as ortiz.they eventually discovered,however,that she was not a psychiatrist,but rather a nurse,and that she was not under the supervision of the one arbour staff psychiatrist,maria gaticales herself not,or eligible for board certification,as contemplated by the regulations.see regs.a.nonetheless,on may,ortiz prescribed a medication called trileptal for yarushka purported bipolar disorder.
yarushka soon experienced an adverse reaction to the drug.although she called ortiz for guidance,her two phone messages went unreturned.when her condition worsened,yarushka decided to discontinue the medication,having not heard from anyone at arbour in several days.on may,yarushka had a seizure and was hospitalized.
in the days following yarushka seizure,relators spoke with keohan and voiced their dissatisfaction with their daughter care.yarushka stepfather julio escobar began to suspect that at arbour was supervising ortiz when keohan claimed to have no knowledge of the relators sic repeated efforts to reach ortiz,and of yarushka recent seizure.after their conversation,keohan directed the staff psychiatrist gaticales to supervise ortiz.yarushka resumed treatment at arbour,but suffered another seizure in october,this one fatal.
after yarushka death,relators spoke with anna cabacoff,a social worker at arbour who had worked with yarushka in the past.cabacoff informed them that the counselors who had cared for yarushka were not properly licensed to provide treatment without supervision or to prescribe medication,and that gaticales was not and accordingly unqualified to supervise the other staff members.
in the months following the death of their daughter,relators filed complaints with several state agencies,including the disabled persons protection committee dppc,division of professional licensure dpl,and the department of public health dph.although the ensuing dppc report found that there was insufficient evidence of abuse of a disabled person,it concluded that ortiz and gaticales may have been out of compliance with relevant requirements concerning qualifications and supervision.
dph determined,after an investigation,that arbour had violated fourteen distinct regulations,including those relating to staff supervision and licensure the dph report deemed relators allegations valid and found that 
t he psychiatrist personnel record indicated that she was not qualified to supervise a nurse practitioner because she was not board certified in psychiatry.clinical therapist and clinical therapist personnel files indicated they were not licensed.clinic director said that he supervised clinical therapist and clinical therapist,but did not document these meetings.
the report also concluded,based on a comprehensive review of arbour personnel files,that therapists were not licensed for independent practice and also were not licensed in their discipline.though all therapists required clinical supervision,there was no documentation to show that any had received such supervision prior to january,despite having been hired as early as.as a result of the dph report,arbour entered into a plan of correction with the agency to rectify the identified deficiencies.
in addition,arbour clinical director keohan entered into a consent agreement with the board of registration of social workers,within the dpl in the agreement,keohan admitted to sufficient facts meriting the board conclusion that,inter alia,he had authorized pereyra unlicensed practice of social work at the clinic,in violation of massachusetts law.as a consequence,the agreement imposed a period of supervised probation on keohan license to practice social work in the state.fuchu,another staff member who had treated yarushka,also entered into a consent agreement wherein she admitted to holding herself out as a psychologist despite not being licensed.she agreed to pay a civil penalty.
procedural background 
relators filed their second amended complaint in february of,reciting the above allegations and setting forth fourteen counts against defendant uhs under both the federal and massachusetts false claims acts the complaint alleged that arbour,in submitting bills for services rendered by pereyra,casado,fuchu,and ortiz in connection with the treatment of yarushka rivera and other masshealth recipients fraudulently misrepresented that those staff members were properly licensed supervised,as required by law.the complaint further alleged that arbour made similar fraudulent misrepresentations with regard to additional unidentified clinical staff members and nurse practitioners,who had treated patients other than yarushka.finally,relators alleged that arbour had engaged in fraudulent billing during a period of with core staff and supervision requirements,insofar as the clinic had failed to employ at least one fully certified psychiatrist and one fully certified psychologist.
the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.in determining whether relators had pleaded the requisite element of falsity,the court drew a distinction between requirements that masshealth imposes on providers as preconditions to reimbursement conditions of payment and those imposed as preconditions to participation in the program in the first instance conditions of participation.the court held that only noncompliance with the former could establish the falsity of a claim.relying on chapter preamble,which states in part that cmr establishes requirements for participation of mental health centers in masshealth,the court observed that the chapter generally does not establish preconditions to payment.united states ex rel.escobar universal health,dpw,wl,at.the court then evaluated the text of individual regulations cited in the complaint to determine whether they constituted conditions of participation or of payment.the court analyzed the regulations through the lens of the preamble,effectively assuming that each regulation imposed only a condition of participation,unless its plain provisions suggest ed that it is also a precondition of payment.id.
applying that rubric,the district court ruled that relators claims failed on the merits,since there was no indication in the text of any of the pertinent regulations that they were intended as conditions of payment,rather than as conditions of participation as stated in the preamble.id.at.the only exception was the overarching regulation pertaining to satellite centers section which states that s ervices provided by a satellite program are reimbursable only if the program meets the standards described below.see id.at.the court went on to note that section sets forth different requirements for autonomous and dependent satellite programs because relators had failed to plead whether the lawrence arbour clinic was autonomous or dependent,the court held that the complaint did not plead with particularity a misrepresentation of compliance with any condition of payment,as required by federal rule of civil procedure b.id.at.the court also held that the counts of the complaint directed at unnamed staff members and arbour pattern of noncompliance with core staffing requirements also failed to allege fraud with particularity.id.at.
relators now appeal from the dismissal of their complaint.
ii.analysis 
false claims act generally 
the false claims act fca or act is an expansive statute,intended to reach all types of fraud,without qualification,that might result in financial loss to the government.cook,united states ex rel.chandler,d internal quotation marks omitted.as relevant here,the act proscribes knowingly present ing,or caus ing to be presented,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.a a.to be actionable,a false or fraudulent statement must be material to the government decision to pay a claim.united states ex rel.loughren unum,cir.the act qui tam provisions authorize private individuals to sue on behalf of the united states in order to recover monies alleged to have been defrauded from the government.b united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,cir.
in defining the notion of falsity under the fca,which the statute itself does not do,a number of circuits have developed two categories of false submissions those that are factually false and those that are legally false.see,united states ex rel.conner salina reg l health,cir mikes straus,cir.courts have further subdivided claims in the latter group based on whether they proceed on a theory of either implied or express certification of compliance with conditions of payment.see united states ex rel.wilkins united health,cir collecting cases.
this circuit recently has eschewed distinctions between factually and legally false claims,and those between implied and express certification theories,reasoning that they create artificial barriers that obscure and distort the statute requirements.united states ex rel.hutcheson blackstone,cir.instead,we take a broad view of what may constitute a false or fraudulent statement to avoid foreclos ing fca liability in situations that congress intended to fall within the act scope.united states ex rel.jones brigham women,cir alteration in original quoting hutcheson,at.we ask simply whether the defendant,in submitting a claim for reimbursement,knowingly misrepresented compliance with a material precondition of payment.new york amgen,cir.preconditions of payment,which may be found in sources such as statutes,regulations,and contracts,need not be expressly designated.hutcheson,at.rather,the question whether a given requirement constitutes a precondition to payment is a and inquiry,amgen,at,involving a close reading of the foundational documents,or statutes and regulations,at issue.united states sci.applications int l,hereinafter saic the existence of express contractual language specifically linking compliance to eligibility for payment may well constitute dispositive evidence of materiality,but it is not a necessary condition.
establishing falsity 
the district court whose decision we review de novo,amgen,at acknowledged our rejection in hutcheson of judicially created formal categories,at,but held that the distinction between conditions of participation and conditions of payment nonetheless survived only misrepresentation of compliance with the latter would establish that a claim was false within the meaning of the fca.the court reasoned that,because the holdings of both decisions were framed in terms of conditions of payment,hutcheson and the subsequent case of amgen at least implicitly accepted the condition of of participation dichotomy.escobar,wl,at see amgen,at to survive a b motion,plaintiffs must show that the claims at issue in the litigation misrepresented compliance with a material precondition of medicaid payment such that they were false or fraudulent.hutcheson,at w e hold that the complaint,in alleging that the hospital and physician claims represented compliance with a material condition of payment that was not in fact met,states a claim under the fca.the court also pointed to cases from other circuits that have adopted such a framework.escobar,wl,at citing cases from second and sixth circuits.
to be sure,hutcheson and amgen held that a plaintiff states a claim under the fca when he or she alleges that a recipient of government funds has misrepresented its compliance with a condition of payment.but while the district court concluded that only claims premised on misrepresentation of compliance with a condition of payment are cognizable under the fca,we find that any distinction is not relevant here.as in amgen,the provisions at issue in this case clearly impose conditions of payment.
section of the masshealth regulations expressly provides that s ervices provided by a satellite program are reimbursable only if the program meets the standards described below in subsections a through d.subsection a pertains to parent centers supervision of satelli
