appellants sued the united states and defendants who dredged the mississippi river gulf outlet to recover damages sustained during hurricane katrina.the district court dismissed the claims against the dredgers because it determined that the defendants acted pursuant to contracts with the united states government under authority granted by an act of congress.the appellants argue that the district court improperly dismissed their claims refused to allow them to amend their complaint refused to allow them to conduct discovery and entered judgment in favor of those defendants whose actions had been stayed after they filed petitions under the limitation of liability act.we affirm.
in,philip reed filed a class action against the united states and dredging companies contractor defendants to recover damages the class suffered as a result of hurricane katrina.reed also sought injunctive relief to prevent future dredging activities.several months later,fellosea ackerson filed a substantively identical complaint on behalf of named plaintiffs against the same contractor defendants.the united states was not a named defendant in ackerson complaint.the district court consolidated the actions.
reed and ackerson plaintiffs alleged that the contractor defendants dredging activities caused environmental damage to protective wetlands in the mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo.the plaintiffs also alleged that the mrgo project caused an amplification of the storm surge in the new orleans region during hurricane katrina,undermining the levees and flood walls along the mrgo and the industrial canal that breached and flooded bernard parish and orleans parish.the plaintiffs asserted claims against the contractor defendants for negligence,breach of implied warranty,concealment,and violation of laws and sought a myriad of damages and an injunction to prevent future dredging activities.
the united states filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,claiming the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because reed had not filed an administrative claim as required by the admiralty extension act the district court granted the government b motion and dismissed the claims against the united states.this dismissal is not at issue on appeal.the contractor defendants also filed a motion to dismiss under rule b and rule c.
while the contractor defendants motion was pending before the district court,some of the contractor defendants limitation defendants filed complaints under the limitation of liability act which allows a shipowner facing potential liability for a maritime accident to limit his liability to the value of his vessel and cargo and automatically stays all other suits against the shipowner so that all claims will be litigated in the limitation proceeding several contractor defendants bean defendants did not file limitation actions.the limitation actions were transferred to the judge presiding over the original reed and ackerson complaints,where they were consolidated.
the plaintiffs filed a motion to stay the limitation actions and allow their claims against all of the contractor defendants to continue.the district court held a hearing on the contractor defendants motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs motion to stay the limitation actions.because the stays prevented the court from holding a hearing with respect to the limitation defendants,the action proceeded only as to the bean defendants,but the limitation defendants participated as amicus curiae.
the court granted the contractor defendants motion to dismiss under rules b and c,concluding that the contractor defendants had immunity under yearsley ross construction and boyle united technologies the court denied the plaintiffs request to conduct discovery to determine whether the contractor defendants had done anything to place them outside of yearsley protection,calling the request a fishing expedition.the court also denied the plaintiffs request for leave to amend their complaints as futile.the district court entered separate judgments against reed and ackerson.the court also entered a separate order in each case denying as moot the plaintiffs motion to stay the limitation proceedings.
the plaintiffs appealed these rulings,and the appeals were consolidated.the plaintiffs claim the district court erred in granting the contractor defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings,denying their request for discovery,denying their motion to amend,and denying their motion to stay the limitation proceedings.
we review a grant of judgment on the pleadings under rule c de novo we agree with the district court ruling that based on the pleadings,the contractor defendants are entitled to immunity under yearsley.
in yearsley,the supreme court considered whether a contractor that built dikes in the missouri river pursuant to a contract with the federal government could be held liable for damage caused by the construction of the dikes the contract was part of a federal project authorized by an act of congress,and it was undisputed that the federal government authorized and directed the project the court concluded that the contractor could not be held liable,holding that when authority to carry out the project was validly conferred,that is,if what was done was within the constitutional power of congress,there is no liability on the part of the contractor for executing its will.the court also noted that w here an agent or officer of the government purporting to act on its behalf has been held to be liable for his conduct causing injury to another,the ground of liability has been found to be either that he exceeded his authority or that it was not validly conferred.
the plaintiffs contend that invoking yearsley requires the government contractor to show that an agency relationship existed between the contractor and the government,and they argue that in this case an agency relationship is not evident on the face of the pleadings.to support their argument,the plaintiffs rely on language from this court decision in bynum fmc which states that it is the law at least in this circuit that the contractor must be an agent of the government before invoking its immunity.this statement is not as definitive,nor binding,as the plaintiffs suggest.the bynum court acknowledged that yearsley only contains an apparent requirement that the contractor possess an actual agency relationship with the government and that federal courts certainly have not always required such a relationship.additionally,this statement is dicta,and we have never held that yearsley requires a agency relationship between the government and a contractor.
the language regarding agency on which the plaintiffs rely appears in an introductory section of the bynum opinion entitled legal background,which provided a brief overview of the modern government contractor defense historic analogues and the reasons provided by federal and state courts for the adoption of the modern defense.after concluding its discussion of the legal background,the court set forth a federal defense for manufacturers without discussing,applying,or citing yearsley.therefore,the court statements regarding yearsley were unnecessary to its holding and constitute nonbinding dicta 
the court statement in bynum is not compelled by our prior case law.the bynum court cited to whitaker in support of its statement that a contractor must be an agent of the government before invoking its immunity in whitaker,we held that a manufacturer of grenades and a manufacturer of fuses were not agents of the government and therefore not entitled to immunity after a grenade prematurely exploded during an army training exercise the bynum court reliance on whitaker to support its understanding of yearsley is problematic,however,because whitaker does not cite yearsley.additionally,the case whitaker does cite to support its holding powell united states cartridge is a fair labor standards act case that likewise does not cite yearsley.most importantly,both bynum and whitaker addressed product liability and not contractor liability as in yearsley.the application of the contractor defense in the context of manufa
