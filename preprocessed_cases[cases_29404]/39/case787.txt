this case arises from the city of poway the city plan to divest itself of ownership of the poway royal mobilehome park the park.the city held one hearing in which it approved resolutions allowing it to issue bonds and loan the proceeds to the poway redevelopment agency redevelopment agency for its purchase of the park,and the redevelopment agency to later loan the proceeds and resell the park to wakeland housing and development corporation wakeland or its subsidiary,on the condition that it obtain a determination of status from the internal revenue service irs.if wakeland or its subsidiary did not qualify,the redevelopment agency would retain ownership of and manage the park so the status of the bonds would not be jeopardized.
plaintiffs,poway royal mobilehome owners association and of its members sometimes collectively the owners association,appeal a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of defendants,the city,the city council of the city of poway city council,city manager james bowersox,and the redevelopment agency sometimes collectively the city.the owners association contends the court erred by finding it may not maintain promissory estoppel and related claims against the city arising from its alleged breach of oral promises to provide the owners association with a real,true and opportunity to purchase the park at fair market value.additionally,the owners association contends the court abused its discretion by denying it leave to file a third amended complaint to attach a resolution of the city council in an effort to satisfy the requirement of a written contract.we affirm the judgment.
additionally,the owners association challenges the judgment in the city action to validate its plan to divest itself of the park and associated bond financing.the owners association contends the court ignored that during the city public hearing under the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra f,it failed to submit evidence that wakeland or its subsidiary qualified for bond financing,or that the park met the requirement of being a qualified residential rental project,meaning percent or more of the residential units are occupied by individuals whose income is percent or less of area median gross income rule.d a.we agree the tefra hearing was insufficient,and accordingly reverse that judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the park has spaces and is situated on approximately acres of land.in january the redevelopment agency purchased the park,intending to stabilize rents and preserve affordable housing.in the redevelopment agency transferred ownership of the park to the city.also in,the city issued bonds in the amount of,which paid off debt related to the redevelopment agency purchase of the park in.city staff and contract employees managed the park until,when that responsibility was transferred to wakeland.
in the city adopted a goal for the divestiture of its mobilehome parks.the city orally advised tenants of the park that when and if it decided to sell the park it would give them an opportunity to purchase it.the owners association represented tenants in seeking private ownership,and the city knew percent of the park tenants were willing,ready and able to purchase the park at fair market value.
in november,however,the city announced its intent to sell the park to a united states code section c nonprofit housing corporation using tax exempt bond financing,which would exclude the owners association and residents of the park as purchasers since they can not qualify as a nonprofit entity.nonetheless,in february the owners association submitted a proposal to the city to purchase the park.the following june the city rejected the proposal and agreed to sell the park to the redevelopment agency,which would resell it to wakeland,a nonprofit housing corporation,contingent on it qualifying for status under federal law.
the city then filed a complaint for validation of its sale of the park and associated bond financing.the complaint alleged the city would first sell the park to the redevelopment agency for million,its asserted fair market value,plus reserve deposits to ensure the park successful operation.to finance the purchase,the city agreed to issue bonds not to exceed million and loan the proceeds to the redevelopment agency,and to take an additional note from it for approximately million.wakeland would then purchase the park from the redevelopment agency for million,plus reserve deposits,and would assume the redevelopment agency rights and obligations under the bond financing documents and million loan agreement with the city.
the owners association answered the complaint and contested the legality of the city actions.additionally,the owners association filed a first amended complaint against the city for promissory estoppel and declaratory relief.the parties stipulated to the consolidation of the two actions.
the first amended complaint alleged the city and redevelopment agency orally and publicly,and in certain instances,in writing,expressed an intent to allow the owners association and tenants to purchase the park on terms that are,true and real,that reasonably relate to the p ark fair market value and are customary and usual for any sale to of a mobilehome park where the ownership will be converted to residential ownership.the city allegedly breached the promise by not offering the park to the owners association and tenants on reasonable terms,but rather concoct ing a sales price,terms and a financing scheme for the park that eliminated owners association or tenants as purchasers.specifically,the city required bond financing provided nonprofit housing corporation bidders,including wakeland,with financing information and park financial information,but refused to provide the same information to the owners association gave the owners association an unreasonably short period to submit a purchase proposal set a closing date for the sale so soon it precluded the owners association from complying with the statutory process for converting the park to resident ownership and allowed nonprofit housing corporations to submit offers on the park that did not require the payment of any cash.
the first amended complaint also alleged that in reliance on the city representations,tenants of the park signed or renewed leases,financed mobilehome purchases,relinquished the opportunity to move to other mobilehome parks and anticipated earning equity on their mobilehome spaces.the complaint sought an order requiring the city to provide the owners association and tenants of the park with a price and terms for them to purchase the p ark that are true,real and,is at the fair market value of the p ark and upon customary and usual,fair and reasonable terms for sale to.alternatively,the complaint prayed for million in economic damages and damages for emotional distress.
the city demurred on the ground the promissory estoppel doctrine may not trump the requirement that public agency contracts must be adopted in accordance with statutory procedures that require,for instance,formal approval and a writing signed by the appropriate official.the court issued a tentative order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.after a hearing,however,the court granted the owners association leave to amend.
in december the owners association filed a second amended complaint,adding a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on leases between the city and park tenants.the complaint alleged the leases incorporate by reference california mobilehome residency law,which requires an owner to give notice to tenants of the intent to sell a mobilehome park civil code,and the notice the city gave the tenants here was a sham because it was not notice of an intent to sell the park on true,real and terms.
the promissory estoppel cause of action remained essentially the same,but added that the city unfairly offered bond financing and subsidized the sale to wakeland,and alleged the city engaged in a sham,length transaction with wakeland,which transaction will have the inevitable result of substantially increasing the present rents at the p ark to service the excess debt the city and the redevelopment agency are creating.regarding the city representations,the second amended complaint alleged the city and agency,through members of the city council,bowersox,and employees of the agency,including,but not limited to,david narevsky,orally,and publicly,and in certain circumstances,in writing expressed that intent.
the city again demurred and the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court determined the second amended complaint did not allege unusual circumstances to justify a claim for promissory estoppel against a public agency,and estoppel would thwart the protection of the statute of frauds and statutory procedures for public contracts.the court also found the complaint failed to state a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant as such a cause of action may not extend beyond the terms of the contract in force between the parties,and in any event,the city complied with the notice requirement.
the owners association moved for reconsideration,arguing it could provide the previously alleged writing to confirm the city promise.the owners association offered the minutes from the city council july,regular meeting,in which the city council approved a consent calendar that included item,the adoption of goal for city and redevelopment agency mobile home parks and haley ranch estates goal.the draft of the goal,prepared by the city housing commission,notes the redevelopment agency and the city had worked together to own and operate mobilehome parks,including the park,as a way of providing stable ownership and rents at these properties.the housing commission has requested and received approval from the city council to develop a long term plan and goals for these properties to guide the city and redevelopment agency.the draft also stated the goal for transferring ownership of mobilehome parks was t o insure an ownership and rent structure which maintains and enhances the quality and service of these properties,and as a matter of policy the city should design a strategy which would transfer ownership to an entity such as a corporation,resident or similar structure which will insure the ownership operates the properties consistent with this policy.
the owners association also offered the deposition testimony of the city deputy director of redevelopment,narevsky,who the goal draft.he testified the term corporation as used in the policy section of the above draft meant a charitable organization,nothing more than that.a proposed third amended complaint added the sentence,a true and correct copy of a city council resolution confirming and ratifying any verbal promises is attached as exhibit.it did not include any reference to narevsky testimony.
in a tentative ruling the court denied the motion,explaining the language of the goal draft did not require sale of the park to the owners association,and it was not a binding document signed by the city.after a hearing,the court affirmed its ruling,and on april,it entered a judgment of dismissal.
as for the validation action,in october the parties had stipulated to the city filing of a supplemental complaint to reflect changes in the agreement between the city and wakeland for purchase of the park.the purchaser would now be poway royal estates,llc pre,a wakeland entity.
a hearing was held in february,after which the court took the matter under submission.on march,it granted the city request for validation and entered judgment.we discuss facts pertaining to the validation action below.

promissory 
in california,under the doctrine of promissory estoppel,a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.the remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.citations.promissory estoppel is a doctrine which employs equitable principles to satisfy the requirement that consideration must be given in exchange for the promise sought to be enforced.wilson los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,d.the elements of promissory estoppel are a clear promise,reliance,substantial detriment,and damages measured by the extent of the obligation assumed and not performed.toscano greene music th,d.
it is well established that an estoppel will not be applied against the government if to do so would effectively nullify a strong rule of policy,adopted for the benefit of the public.city of long beach mansell cal d,mansell city of south san francisco cypress lawn cemetery th,d.the courts of this state have been careful to apply the rules of estoppel against a public agency only in those special cases where the interests of justice clearly require it.mansell,supra,at,fn.the facts upon which such an estoppel must rest go beyond the ordinary principles of estoppel and each case must be examined carefully and rigidly to be sure that a precedent is not established through which,by favoritism or otherwise,the public interest may be mulcted or public policy defeated.ibid.
we conclude the second amended complaint does not allege exceptional circumstances necessary to justify application of the promissory estoppel doctrine against the city,and leave to amend would not cure the defect.
the second amended complaint alleged the city breached a promise to the owners association and park tenants by requiring bond financing for purchase of the park.the owners association submits the city financing mechanism excluded it from purchasing the park because a residents organization converting a park to private ownership can not ever qualify as a charity,a prerequisite to obtaining the bond financing required by the city.the second amended complaint also alleged the city deprived the owners association of a true opportunity to purchase the park because it set the selling price above the park fair market value.at the hearing on the demurrer on the first amended complaint,the owners association argued the city offered the property to wakeland at a price that we believe we going to show is almost million more than the property is worth.
the second amended complaint sought an order requiring the city to provide the owners association and park residents with a price and terms for them to purchase the p ark that are true,real and,meaning at the fair market value of the p ark and upon customary and usual,fair and reasonable terms for sale.
the owners association asserts that because it did not allege the city was required to actually sell it the park,its claim is not for breach of contract and the trial court erred by relying on public contract law in sustaining the demurrer.we reject the assertion.the owners association theory is that the city breached an agreement that purportedly ties its hands in several respects it must conduct the sale of the park in a certain manner,which excludes the acceptance of offers only from nonprofit housing corporations relying on bond financing it must include the owners association in the bid process even if it determines the owners association operation of the park is infeasible and not in the best interest of the city,the park or its tenants and it is precluded from asking for or accepting more than the owners association considers fair market value for the property.for instance,the city would have to reject wakeland offer of million,even though an independent appraiser valued the property at that amount,as the owners association deems it substantially above fair market value.we agree with the trial court that the owners association action is actually for breach of contract,and the city may not put itself in such a situation absent compliance with proper procedures.
it is undisputed that the city is a general law city.the powers of a general law city include only those powers expressly conferred upon it by the legislature,together with such powers as are necessarily incident to those expressly granted or essential to the declared object and purposes of the municipal corporation.city of orange san diego county employees retirement th,d city of orange.a general law city must comply with state statutes that specify requirements for entering into contracts.citations.ibid.a contract entered into by a local government without legal authority is wholly void,ultra vires,and unenforceable.mezzetta,city of american canyon th,d mezzetta.o ne who makes a contract with a municipal corporation is bound to take notice of limitations on its power to contract and also of the power of the particular officer or agency to make the contract.id.at,fn,d.
under government code section,subdivision b,the mayor or another officer designated by ordinance shall sign a ll written contracts and conveyances made or entered into by the city.the word shall in government code section is mandatory.south bay senior housing city of hawthorne th,d.the only writing the owners association relies on,the minutes from the city council july,meeting,is not signed by the city mayor and thus does not qualify as a contract further,the minutes do not show the city promised the owners association anything in particular.the stated goal in divesting mobilehome parks was merely to insure an ownership and rent structure which maintains and enhances the quality and services of these properties,and the policy was to design a strategy which would transfer ownership to an entity such as a corporation,resident or similar structure.neither the goal nor the policy bind the city to a particular procedure for selling the park.indeed,the policy anticipated the possible sale of the park to a corporation,which would include wakeland.accordingly,the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the owners association motion for reconsideration and bid to file a third amended complaint to attach the writing.
beyond that,the owners association claims are based on the allegation in the second amended complaint that beginning in and on many occasions,unnamed members of the city council,city manager bowersox,and employees of the redevelopment agency,including narevsky,orally expressed an intent to afford the a real,true and opportunity to purchase the park.the complaint does not allege the specifics of the representations or where they took place.there is no suggestion the city ever approved such an oral agreement,or even that the issue was submitted to the city for formal consideration.
the owners association cites no authority to support application of the promissory estoppel doctrine based on similar alleged oral agreements.it relies on city of orange,supra,th,d,in which the court concluded that read together the language of government code section and provisions of a municipal code not at issue here,do not unambiguously require that every city contract,without exception,be in writing and signed by the mayor.city of orange,at,d.
in city of orange,the court considered the general purpose of government code section,which is to ensure that expensive decisions are not hastily made and to create a broad base of authority by requiring contract approval by a number of different individuals.city of orange,supra,th at,d.the court held the city could enforce an oral option contract with the retirement association that required it to hold open its settlement offer in litigation between it and the city,as restrictions on a municipality power to contract are designed to protect the public,not those who deal with the public.id.at,d.
the court further explained the oral option contract imposed no financial burden on the city,the sole consideration was the city agreement to stay litigation while considering the retirement association settlement offer,and the litigation standstill would save the city money if the offer were accepted.city of orange,supra,th at,d.under those circumstances,the purpose of government code section prevent hasty decisions on important public served by honoring the oral option agreement because it gave the city adequate time to review the settlement offer and secure approval from city officials without fear the retirement association would withdraw the offer.city of orange,at,d.orange had much to gain and little,if anything,to lose from the oral option contract.ibid.
city of orange is readily distinguishable on its facts.here,in contrast to that case,private parties seek to enforce an alleged oral promise against a public entity,which is ordinarily not subject to promissory estoppel.further,the city has little or nothing to gain and much to lose if the promissory estoppel doctrine is held to bind it to the alleged oral representations of its council members or employees.for instance,the city could not sell the park to wakeland,or anyone else for that matter,for the agreed price of million,as that amount allegedly exceeds fair market value by some million and thus deprives the owners association of a genuine opportunity to purchase the park.accordingly,the alleged oral agreement may place a financial burden on the city.
it is true that government code section,standing alone,does not expressly require that every contract of a municipality be in writing.however,a statute prescribing a city method for contracting may impliedly prohibit any other method of contracting.nash city of los angeles,see also mcquillin,municipal corporations ed.in our view,government code section impliedly requires a written contract here,because an oral contract would violate the statute purpose of requiring a city governing body to make considered decisions on important matters affecting the public fisc.no single individual has absolute authority to bind the municipality many parts of the city government must work together.mezzetta,supra,th at,d.
the owners association reliance on mansell,supra,cal d,is likewise misplaced.mansell involved and complicated boundary disputes that affected thousands of persons who lived in the alamitos bay area.because a variety of factors cast a cloud on the title to this land to such an extent the normal procedure of removing such a cloud,by an action to quiet title,was of no practical value id.at,the legislature attempted to resolve the disputes by disclaiming state and other public interests in certain tidelands and submerged lands.the city manager and the city clerk,however,refused to perform their ministerial duties to carry out the legislation on the ground it violated constitutional and common law prohibitions against the alienation of tidelands and submerged lands.the city sought a writ of mandate compelling the officers to perform their duties,and the state was the real party in interest.
among other arguments,the city and state raised an equitable estoppel argument against themselves.they asserted that since the subject lands were filled and improved with the knowledge and acquiescence of the state and city and that since annexation of the area in the city has exercised full municipal jurisdiction over building permits,approving subdivision maps,constructing and maintaining streets and city services,and collecting taxes,it would result in manifest injustice if they claimed paramount title.mansell,supra,cal d at.the court noted the estoppel argument was not relevant to its decision ibid,but it nonetheless considered the issue and found the elements of estoppel present.id.at.
the court explained the activities,representations,and conduct of the state and its subtrustee the city rise to the level of culpability necessary to support an equitable estoppel against them the stipulated facts clearly establish that from an early date the state and city have been aware of the serious and complex title problems in the alamitos bay area.more importantly,those public entities have been in a position to resolve such problems and to determine the true boundaries between public and private lands.this they have not done.instead they have conducted themselves relative to settled and subdivided lands as if no title problems existed and have misled thousands of homeowners in the process.mansell,supra,cal d at.
the mansell court concluded application of the estoppel doctrine would not have a deleterious effect on the public policy of ensuring public ownership of tidelands,as development in the alamitos bay area has resulted in an area providing an impressive array of public facilities for navigation and recreation.mansell,supra,cal d at.the court cautioned that the estoppel issue arose in a peculiar context id.at,similarly compelling circumstances will not often recur id.at,and it intended to create an extremely narrow precedent for application in future cases.ibid.
here,in contrast,the city did not raise the estoppel doctrine against itself,and application of the doctrine would have deleterious effects.mansell and city of orange are unhelpful to the owners association as they do not address the scenario at issue here.a decision is authority only for the point actually passed on by the court and directly involved in the case.general expressions in opinions that go beyond the facts of the case will not necessarily control the outcome in a subsequent suit involving different facts.gomes county of mendocino th,d chevron,workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.
numerous cases hold promissory estoppel may not be raised against a public entity when it would defeat the public policy of requiring adherence to statutory procedures for entering into contracts.see,seymour state of california d.no estoppel against state based on oral lease when statute required a written lease approved by specified officer state of california haslett d.estoppel could not be raised against the state to render effective an oral agreement to enter into a lease when it was not approved by the officer designated by statute santa monica unified sch.dist.persh d.no estoppel against a school district when a written offer was orally affirmed but not ratified or approved by the board as required by statute.the doctrine of estoppel is not available to defeat the effective operation of a policy adopted to protect the public.city of fresno california highway com.d.likewise,we conclude estoppel is unavailable here against the city to enforce the alleged oral contract.the court properly granted the demurrer to the first cause of action 
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
there is implied in every contract a covenant by each party not to do anything which will deprive the other parties thereto of the benefits of the contract.citations omitted.this covenant not only imposes upon each contracting party the duty to refrain from doing anything which would render performance of the contract impossible by any act of his or her own,but also the duty to do everything that the contract presupposes that he or she will do to accomplish its purpose.harm frasher d.
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not extend beyond the terms of the contract at issue.new plumbing contractors,nationwide mutual ins.th,d.in gibson government employees ins.d,the court sustained a demurrer because the plaintiffs did not allege the defendant failed in any way to perform pursuant to the terms of the contract id.at,and we have not found any case which extends a covenant of good faith and fair dealing beyond the terms of the contract in force between them.id.at.
civil code section,subdivision a,a provision of the mobilehome residency law,states not less than days nor more than one year prior to an owner of a mobilehome park entering into a written listing agreement with a licensed real estate broker for the sale of the park,or offering to sell the park to any party,the owner shall provide written notice of his or her intention to sell the mobilehome park by mail or by personal delivery to the president,secretary,and treasurer or any resident organization formed by homeowners in the mobilehome park as a nonprofit corporation,stock cooperative corporation,or other entity for purposes of converting the mobilehome park to condominium or stock cooperative ownership interests and for purchasing the mobilehome park from the management of the mobilehome park.
it is undisputed that the city notified the owners association in a timely manner of its intent to sell the park.the second amended complaint alleged the notice nonetheless violated civil code section,subdivision a because it was a sham in that the city had no intent to sell the park on true,real and terms.the notice also allegedly breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the leases between the city and tenants of the park since the leases incorporate the terms of the mobilehome residency law.
the sample lease attached to the second amended complaint states the agreement is intended by lessor and homeowner to comply with the california mobilehome residency law sections et of the california civil code,a copy of which is attached hereto and made part hereof.neither the lease nor civil code section,subdivision a,however,required the city to offer the park to the residents under any particular terms.moreover,the complaint allegation the notice the city gave was a sham is an unsupported conclusion of fact or law the court was not bound to accept as true.accordingly,the court properly sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action and entered a judgment of dismissal

on february,the owners association appeared ex parte and argued the matter should not proceed on the law and motion calendar,but should proceed as a regular trial with the presentation of evidence outside the administrative record.the court determined the matter would proceed on the law and motion calendar and the evidence would be limited to the administrative record.at the february hearing,the owners association argued the city was actually moving for summary judgment,and because it did not comply with the notice requirement for a summary judgment motion the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.

tefra hearing 
the city noticed a tefra hearing under united states code section f for june.at the hearing,the city adopted resolutions approving its sale of the park to the redevelopment agency resolution,and its issuance of revenue bonds to finance the redevelopment agency purchase and allow the city to retire and refinance debt associated with the park resolution.the redevelopment agency adopted resolutions approving its purchase of the park and an operating agreement between it and wakeland resolution no,and requesting that the city issue the revenue bonds resolution no.
the owners association contends the judgment in the validation action was improper because the city presented no evidence at the tefra hearing that wakeland or its subsidiary qualified as a charitable corporation under united states code section c,or that the park satisfied the rule pertaining to the provision of housing 
the city concedes that at the time of the hearing,pre approval from the irs was pending.the city asserts pre status was not a prerequisite of the hearing,because the sale of the park was contingent on it receiving approval from the irs,and if it did not get approval the redevelopment agency could not sell the park to pre.
the city also asserts it was not required to present any evidence that percent of the park spaces would be available for housing because the mobilehome park sale and operating agreement agreement between the redevelopment agency and pre provides purchaser shall restrict occupancy of not fewer than twenty percent of the mobilehome spaces to very low income households and not fewer than an additional forty percent of the mobilehome spaces to lower income households the purchaser shall annually submit to agency a summary of the income,household size and rent payable by each of the residents of the affordable spaces who provide income certificates to purchaser.the agreement includes provisions on establishing maximum monthly rentals for spaces based on percent of the san diego county median income for relevant family sizes.
preliminarily,we note the city bond resolution is misleading as to the authority for its issuance of bonds.the resolution preamble states the agency intends to,but is not obligated to,sell the park to wakeland,a corporation,or an entity formed by wakeland,provided th
