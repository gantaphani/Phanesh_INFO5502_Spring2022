after two unsuccessful attempts to provide armed correctional officers in the santa clara county jail when control of the jail was transferred from the sheriff sheriff or sheriff office to the newly formed county department of correction correction,in the santa clara county board of supervisors retransferred jail functions requiring armed officers to the sheriff.correctional officers were transferred to the sheriff office for assignment as sheriff transportation officers,sheriff security officers,and deputies of the sheriff to work in the jail.thereafter,plaintiff santa clara county correctional peace officers association sought declaratory relief to establish that these officers were deputy sheriffs with penal code section a peace officer status.plaintiffs also requested a writ of mandate directing defendant county of santa clara to provide post training and take whatever steps were needed to regularize the position of these officers.the trial court found that correctional officers were not deputy sheriffs and denied extraordinary relief.

sheriffs and deputy sheriffs are peace officers a and have the authority to carry firearms.sheriff deputies employed at the jail had peace officer training and the full powers of peace officers and performed all the functions for which armed officers were needed at the jail.when the jail was transferred to correction,the deputies were transferred from the sheriff office to that department,but retained a contractual right to transfer to the sheriff office as vacancies arose.by june,a substantial number had done so,thus reducing the number of armed officers below that required by state law.
