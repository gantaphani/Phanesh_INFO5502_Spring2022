masco corporation masco appeals from the judgment of the court of federal claims holding,on for summary judgment,that the united states had not infringed the claims of patents and,directed to an electronic dial combination lock.masco united states,fed.cl,masco.we conclude that the court erred in construing the transmitting a force applied to the dial to the lever limitation as a limitation,but did not otherwise err in its claim construction.moreover,we conclude that the court erred in holding that issue preclusion applied to the issues of whether a lever was pushed in the accused device and whether pushing and pulling actions were equivalent.accordingly,we,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the litigation that culminated in the present appeal began on march,when masco sued the united states for reasonable compensation for the alleged use by the united states of the and patents,assigned to lagard,lagard.lagard merged into masco prior to the filing of this suit.in its complaint,masco identified a high security electronic dial combination lock,designated,as the device that allegedly infringed claims of each patent.this lock was produced by third party defendant group and was supplied to the general services administration,an agency of the federal government.third party defendants mosler,and hamilton products group,incorporate the patented lock into products that they sell to the united states.
this case is related to an earlier lawsuit between and lagard in the eastern district of kentucky.group lagard,d i.i concerned patent,which is the parent of the and patents.in that case,the court determined that the patent was not invalid,and that the accused device,which was the same lock,did not infringe the apparatus claims of the patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.i at.we affirmed the judgment of the district court in group lagard,ii.
claim of each of the and patents sets forth a method of controlling an electronic lock these are the only independent claims in suit.claim of the patent is reproduced below.
a method of controlling an electronic lock including a dial,a rotatable cam wheel operably connected to the dial and defining a surface,a locking mechanism movable between a locked position and an unlocked position,and a movable lever operably connected to the locking mechanism and having a protrusion adapted to engage the cam wheel,the method comprising the steps of 
holding the lever in a position where the protrusion can not contact the surface of the cam wheel and in such a manner that the lever and the dial are operably disconnected and the lever will not move in response to rotation of the dial 
electronically determining whether an input combination corresponds to a predetermined combination 
operably connecting the lever and the dial,while maintaining the lever in a position where the provision can not contact the surface of the cam wheel in response to a determination that the predetermined combination has been input and 
transmitting a force applied to the dial to the lever after the lever and the dial have been operably connected to drive the lever to a position where the protrusion can contact the surface of the cam wheel in such a manner that the lever will be pulled by the cam wheel during rotation of the cam wheel.

claim of the patent is similar it is reproduced below.
a method of controlling a lock including a knob,a rotatable cam wheel operably connected to the knob and defining a surface,a locking mechanism movable between a locked position and an unlocked position,and a movable lever operably connected to the locking mechanism and having a protrusion adapted to engage the cam wheel,the method comprising the steps of 
holding the lever in a position where the protrusion can not contact the surface of the cam wheel and in such a manner that the lever and the knob are operably disconnected and the lever will not move in response to rotation of the knob

masco patented lock is depicted in figure of the patent,which is reproduced below.
in the patented lock,the lever normally does not engage cam wheel.the lever has a cantilever arm resting in a notch in solenoid housing.when a solenoid within the solenoid housing receives a signal,plunger within the solenoid housing moves and projects a ball upward.tooth on the periphery of cam wheel engages projected ball.subsequent to this,force is supplied from the rotation of the dial.as the dial is rotated,thus turning cam wheel,force from tooth acting on the ball forces the solenoid housing to the right.cantilever arm integral with and angled with respect to the lever remains in contact with the solenoid housing.the solenoid housing thus drives cantilever arm and lever counterclockwise.this force drives lever toward cam wheel until protrusion on the lever engages a slot on the cam wheel.further cam wheel rotation pulls the lever to the left to withdraw the locking bolt.
masco contends,and the government does not dispute,that patent describes the accused lock.figure of that patent,which depicts the initial locked position of the mechanism,is reproduced below.
in the lock,a stepper motor rotates a gear through a small arc.the rotation of this gear meshes a toothed outer portion on one side of the gear with gear teeth on the periphery of a cam wheel.dial and cam wheel rotation then acts through the gear teeth to rotate the stepper motor gear clockwise.the rotation of the stepper motor gear drives a linkage,which acts on the bottom of sliding element to drive the element downward compare figure with figure,below.the element has a slot that receives a pin on lever.downward movement of the sliding element moves the pin and the lever downward until a protrusion of the lever engages a slot on the cam wheel.at this point,the position of the mechanism is as shown in figure below.continued rotation of the cam wheel pulls the lever to the left to withdraw bolt.
in the present case,the court of federal claims held a markman hearing to construe several disputed claim limitations,and issued a claim construction ruling.masco united states,fed.cl.claim construction ruling.among these,the court construed to drive to mean to push,id.at,held that a dial must bear divisions that a user can read,id.at,and construed forming a rigid connection between the lever and the knob of claim of the patent to require a rigid connection between all parts in the chain of parts between the lever and the knob during the unlocking procedure,id.at.the court held that the holding the lever in a position step in each independent claim was not a limitation,because the court determined that holding was an act which precluded treatment under,paragraph.id.at.similarly,the court held that the operably connecting the lever and the dial step of claim of the patent was not a function limitation,because the court determined that connecting was an act.id.at.however,the court held that the transmitting a force step of each independent claim was a function limitation,because the court held that transmitting was a function,not an act.id.
after issuing its claim construction ruling,the court of federal claims entertained for summary judgment and granted summary judgment of noninfringement to the united states.masco at,at.the court held that masco was precluded from proving that the lever in the accused lock was pushed,or that pulling and pushing were equivalent actions,because of the district court findings in specifically,the court of federal claims relied on the i court findings that 
t he patent lock accomplishes its positively driving function by pushing the lever into the cam wheel.in the lock,the lever is pulled into the cam wheel in a substantially different way.thus,the lock mechanism is not the same as disclosed in the patent specification,nor is it equivalent 
id.at,at quoting i at emphases added.the court of federal claims concluded that the issue before it was identical to the issue in i and was actually litigated in the earlier case.id.at,at.the court also held that the issue was necessary to the judgment in id.at,at.finally,the court found that the issue had been fully and fairly litigated in the kentucky district court.id.the court thus precluded masco from attempting to establish that the lever was pushed in the or that pushing and pulling are equivalent.because masco was unable to establish as a matter of law either literal infringement or infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,the court entered summary judgment of noninfringement of both the and patents.id.at,at.masco appeals the court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement to the government,its denial of masco motion for summary judgment of infringement,and the court construction of the to drive,dial,forming a rigid connection between the lever and the knob,and transmitting a force limitations.

claim constructiona.to drive 
the court of federal claims interpreted the term to drive as meaning to push.masco challenges this interpretation,stating that the word drive is broader than the word push and that the court improperly read in limitations from the preferred embodiment.we affirm the court construction of this limitation.
we begin,as did the court of federal claims,with the words of the claim itself.the court cited a general dictionary definition defining to drive,in part,as t o push,propel,or press onward forcibly.claim construction ruling at quoting the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.however,the court found that the plain language of the claim did not resolve the question of the scope of to drive.id.at.although the definition cited suggests that the force moves away from the actor,other definitions do not indicate this.for example,a definition of drive taken from the field of mechanical engineering defines the term simply as t he means by which a machine is given motion or power or by which power is transferred from one part of a machine to another.dictionary of scientific and technical terms sybil parker et,ed.because the plain meaning did not resolve the construction of the term,the court properly turned for guidance to the intrinsic record,consisting not only of the claims themselves,but also the specification and the prosecution history that was in evidence.see teleflex,ficosa am,vitronics conceptronic,holding such intrinsic evidence to be the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language.the court found that the specification implicitly equates to drive with to push 
when the proper combination has been entered,all parts of the lock are linked.the critical point is the junction between the camshaft wheel,which has a boss,and the solenoid housing,which has a detent.the specification states that t he solenoid cam surface includes a small sloped protrusion or boss for engaging and pushing an extended detent in the solenoid housing upon rotation of the cam wheel,lines.correspondingly,t he solenoid housing is a rigid body or element,for positively operating,driving or moving the lever from its disengaged position to a position for engaging the nose part,lines.
the cam surface and the solenoid housing operate together.the cam surface push es the solenoid housing and the solenoid housing driv es the lever.therefore,there is a clear,if implicit,equalization between to drive and to push in the specification.
claim construction ruling at.
the court of federal claims also made reference to the prosecution history of the parent patent,which was properly in evidence,and which the parties agreed was intrinsic evidence to be used in construing the patent and the patent.id.the prosecution history of a parent application may be considered in construing claim terms.elkay ebco,when multiple patents derive from the same initial application,the prosecution history regarding a claim limitation in any patent that has issued applies with equal force to subsequently issued patents that contain the same claim limitation.jonsson v.the stanley works,see also mark i marketing donnelley sons,holding that,for estoppel purposes,the relevant prosecution history included not only the application upon which the patent issued but also the parent and grandparent applications.the court determined that the prosecution history of the patent showed that the applicants thought of the driving force as a pushing.claim construction ruling at.the court found support for this in the following passage from a proposed amendment after final rejection that was submitted on august,
consider briefly applicant invention.one aspect of applicant invention is directed to a combination lock having improved tamper resistance.the present invention also provides more predictable operation of the lock by positively engaging the fence lever with the cam wheel when the nose part on the fence lever and the slot in the cam wheel are properly aligned.the tamper resistance and improved operation features of the lock in one aspect of the invention are provided,in part,by either holding the lever out of engagement with the cam wheel,providing a positive driving mechanism for pushing the lever into engagement with the cam wheel,providing a means by which the cam wheel can push a link mechanism such as a shaft or rod to push the lever into engagement with the cam wheel when a portion of the cam wheel is properly aligned with a portion on the shaft so as to allow the cam to push the shaft after entry of a proper combination.
the term to drive was inserted into claim of the issued patent in an amendment submitted on may.this amendment was made in response to a rejection of the claim as anticipated by a german patent,number.in the lock described in the german patent,a tension spring pulls the lever into engagement with the cam wheel surface after an electromagnetic blocking element has been moved.the pertinent part of the amendment reads as follows 
transmitting a force applied to rotating the dial to the lever after the lever and the dial have been operably connected to drive move the lever to a position where the protrusion can contact the surface of the cam wheel in such a manner that the lever will be pulled by the cam wheel during rotation of the cam wheel.
masco argues that drive is a part of the description of the action in which the force that moves the lever is transmitted from the dial,not supplied from some other source such as the spring in the german patent.masco relies on the explanatory argument in the same amendment,which distinguished the german reference 
the force generated by the spring is not applied to the dial.nor is it transmitted from the dial to the lever.thus,in contrast to the present invention,the german reference fails to teach or suggest a combination of method steps including the step of transmitting a force applied to the dial to the lever to drive the lever.
masco points out that it did not argue that drive distinguished prior art that pulled or explicitly define drive to mean push.because of this,masco argues,the amendment did not distinguish pushing and pulling,nor did it limit the direction of force.
we do not agree.the addition of transmitting a force applied to the dial to the lever to the claim by itself made clear that the force that moves the lever is transmitted from the dial,not from some other source.as the court of federal claims found,the patentee use of the term drive in the specification equated driving with pushing.the amendment distinguished the pushing action of the claimed invention from the pulling action disclosed in the german patent by inserting the word drive,denoted in the specification as a pushing action,in place of the word move,which had no directional connotations.masco proposed definition of drive to encompass pulling actions is inconsistent with the specification of the patent and with the prosecution history of the patent and its parent patent.see litton,honeywell,rejecting a patentee proposed broad construction of a claim limitation as inconsistent with the prosecution history.because the amendment distinguished the pulling action found in the german patent,masco can not now maintain that the proper scope of the to drive term is broad enough to encompass that pulling action.
masco argues that the court erred in applying,paragraph to the fourth step of the methods set forth in claim of the patent and claim of the patent.in particular,it argues that the court erred in holding that the phrase transmitting a force used in those claims was properly interpreted as a function,not as an act.the government responds that the phrase is too amorphous to be interpreted as an act.we agree with masco.
section,paragraph,provides that 
an element of a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure,material,or acts in support thereof,and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure,material,or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.
paragraph.it is well established that this statutory provision can apply not only to a combination of mechanical elements,but also to a combination of steps in a process claim.tekmar,quoting federico,commentary on the new patent act,vol,reprinted in pat.trademark off.soc y.the use of the word means to describe a claim limitation gives rise to a presumption that the inventor used the term advisedly to invoke the statutory mandates for clauses.sage,devon,quoting york,central tractor farm family.similarly,in the context of method claims,the use of the term steps for signals the drafter intent to invoke,paragraph.greenberg ethicon.however,even where the drafter employs the step for language,section,is implicated only when steps plus function without acts are present,at,at.
claim of both the and patents sets forth a method of controlling a lock,comprising a number of steps.the fourth step of the method of claim of the patent is set forth below.
t he method comprising the steps of 
transmitting a force applied to the dial to the lever after the lever and the dial have been operably connected to drive the lever to a position where the protrusion can contact the surface of the cam wheel in such a manner that the lever will be pulled by the cam wheel during rotation of the cam wheel.
patent,ll.the fourth step of the method of claim of the patent is similar it is reproduced below.
t he method comprising the steps of 
transmitting a force applied to the knob to the lever through the rigid connection after the lever and the knob have been operably connected to drive the lever to a position where the protrusion can contact the surface of the cam wheel in such a manner that the lever will be pulled by the cam wheel during rotation of the cam wheel.
patent,ll.neither of these claims employs the step for language that signals the drafter intent to invoke,paragraph rather,the claims employ the term steps of.thus,there is no presumption that these limitations are in format.
in construing these limitations,the court of federal claims properly examined the claim limitations to see whether any act was present,stating that i f an act is present,then the limitation is not a step plus function limitation.claim construction ruling at.in its assessment of whether an act was present in each claim limitation,the court followed the reasoning of judge rader concurrence in,athletic track and court construction.in his opinion,judge rader drew the following distinction between acts and functions under,paragraph 
the underlying function of a method claim element corresponds to what that element ultimately accomplishes in relationship to what the other elements of the claim and the claim as a whole accomplish.acts,on the other hand,correspond to how the function is accomplished.
the court held that transmitting was a function rather than an act,reasoning that t he word transmitting without more does not explain how the force is transmitted.claim construction ruling at.since in the court view this limitation set forth a function without an act,the court held that it was a step plus function limitation.id.
we do not agree.where the claim drafter has not signaled his intent to invoke,paragraph by using the step s for language,we are unwilling to resort to that provision to constrain the scope of coverage of a claim limitation without a showing that the limitation contains nothing that can be construed as an act.method claims are commonly drafted,as in this case,by reciting the phrase steps of followed by a list of actions comprising the method claimed.an application of,paragraph in the present circumstances would render the scope of coverage of these method claims uncertain and disrupt patentees settled expectations regarding the scope of their claims.c ourts must be cautious before adopting changes that disrupt the settled expectations of the inventing community.festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,d.we thus hold that where a method claim does not contain the term step s for,a limitation of that claim can not be construed as a limitation without a showing that the limitation contains no act.
such is not the case here.the underlying function of the transmitting a force limitations,or in judge rader formulation,what those limitations ultimately accomplish in relation to what the other limitations and each claim as a whole accomplish,is to drive the lever into the cam.a standard mechanical engineering dictionary defines transmission as a term applied to various methods of transmitting and transforming power as by a a line shaft,b belts and pulleys,and c gears.nayler,dictionary of mechanical engineering ed.a general unabridged dictionary defines transmit as used in mechanics and physics to mean t o cause light,heat,sound,to pass through a medium also,of a medium,to allow light,to pass through to conduct.also,to convey force or movement from one part of a body,or of mechanism,to another.oxford english dictionary,vol.xviii ed.transmitting a force describes how the lever is driven into the cam.in other words,transmitting in the sense of causing a force to be conveyed through a medium by mechanical parts is an act,since it describes how the function of the transmitting a force limitation is accomplished.accordingly,we reverse the holding of the court of federal claims and hold that the transmitting a force limitation of claim of each of the and patents is not a limitation.
c.other claim limitations 
in its claim construction ruling,the court of federal claims held that the term dial in claim of the patent must include divisions.claim construction ruling at.masco argues that the term should not be limited to dials bearing divisions.it cites a general dictionary definition,which states that dial means a movable control knob or other device on a radio or television receiver used to change the frequency.masco also cites passages from the specification in which the dial is described simply as a part that is rotated,causing internal parts to move.masco also refers to the testimony of director of engineering from i,describing a knob without divisions as a dial.
we discern no error in the court construction.the court found that the plain language of the claim did not resolve the issue,but noted a general dictionary definition of dial as a plate or disk with graduations or figures,as for the indication of pressure,number of revolutions,as by the movements of a pointer.claim c
