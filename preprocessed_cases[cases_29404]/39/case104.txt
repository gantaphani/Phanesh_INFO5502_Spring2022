this case arises from the attempt by the people of north carolina and their elected representatives to end racial and discrimination in state highway construction subcontracting.the state statutory product of extensive study and refinement in response to developments in federal prime contractors to engage in good faith efforts to satisfy participation goals for minority and women subcontractors on projects.through these nonmandatory,participation goals,the state seeks to provide a fair opportunity for all subcontractors to compete for public work.
denied a contract because of its failure to demonstrate good faith efforts to meet these participation goals,a prime contractor brought this action,asserting that the goals violate the equal protection clause,and seeking injunctive relief and money damages.after extensive discovery and a bench trial,the district court held the challenged statutory scheme constitutional both on its face and as applied.the contractor appeals.
we do not believe that the state met its burden of proof in all respects.but we agree with the district court that the state produced a strong basis in evidence justifying the statutory scheme on its face,and as applied to african american and native american subcontractors,and that the state demonstrated that the scheme is narrowly tailored to serve its compelling interest in remedying discrimination against these racial groups.accordingly,for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
we begin with a summary of the statutory scheme and the litigation at issue here.
in,the north carolina general assembly enacted a statute setting forth a general policy promoting the use of small,minority,physically handicapped and women contractors in state construction projects.the statute directed the north carolina department of transportation the department and other state agencies to encourage and promote this policy.id.in and,the legislature amended section to set specific participation goals on state transportation construction contracts,first for businesses percent and then for businesses percent.b.the department promulgated and implemented regulations pursuant to section titled minority business enterprise and women business enterprise programs for highway and bridge construction contracts collectively the program.admin.code.the north carolina statutory scheme largely mirrored the federal disadvantaged business enterprise dbe program,with which every state must comply in awarding highway construction contracts that utilize federal funds for example,as in the dbe program,a prime contractor in north carolina would be excused from the specific subcontracting participation goals by demonstrating good faith efforts to attain such goals.see id.at.
in,a north carolina prime contractor challenged in state court the constitutionality of section.see dickerson carolina,harrelson,appeal dismissed.the contractor relied on city of richmond croson,which affirmed the principle that courts must apply strict scrutiny to all legislation.in croson the supreme court recognized that i t is beyond dispute that any public entity,state or federal,has a compelling interest in assuring that public dollars,drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens,do not serve to finance the evil of private prejudice.id.at.the court held,however,that to remedy such discrimination through measures,a governmental entity must identify with some specificity the racial discrimination it seeks to remedy and present a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action is necessary.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted in response to the dickerson lawsuit,the state suspended operation of section.
the north carolina general assembly then commissioned a national research and consulting firm,mgt of america mgt,to study the state transportation construction industry.in,mgt completed that study,which concluded that north carolina minority and women subcontractors suffered from discrimination in the road construction industry and were underutilized in state contracts.
after receiving the study,the general assembly directed the department to reimplement the program to achieve the goals of section.the department adopted various changes that the study suggested,but it set the same overall percentage goals for participation by minority and women subcontractors.nevertheless,in the court of appeals of north carolina dismissed as moot the pending legal challenge to the statute in dickerson,at.
in,the general assembly commissioned mgt to update the study.the resulting study concluded that minority and women subcontractors remained underutilized in road construction.
four years later,in october,the department sought bids on a project to relocate a road in iredell county,north carolina.pursuant to the program,as reimplemented in,the department set participation goals for minority and women subcontractors of percent and percent,respectively.rowe,rowe,a general contractor owned and operated by a white male,submitted the lowest bid on the project.rowe bid included percent women subcontractor participation,but no minority subcontractor participation.the department rejected rowe bid in favor of a slightly higher bid,which included percent women subcontractor participation and percent minority subcontractor participation.
the department denied rowe the contract because rowe failed to demonstrate good faith efforts to attain the levels of minority participation on the project.at the time of rowe submission,assertedly documenting its good faith efforts,it was one of only submissions that the department rejected.these rejections constituted percent of the good faith efforts submissions that the department had considered.
the department determined that,with respect to good faith efforts,rowe submission contained discrepancies in the number of minority subcontractors rowe solicited,did not demonstrate solicitation of enough minority subcontractors to allow for consideration of a fair number of quotes,did not adequately describe the subcontracting work available for the iredell project,and evidenced no strategy for meeting the department participation goals.rowe unsuccessfully appealed the denial to the state highway administrator.
in april,rowe filed this action in federal district court against the department and several state officials,including governor michael easley and chief in their official capacities,and secretary of transportation lyndo tippett and state highway administrator len sanderson in their official and individual capacities.alleging that the statute and the defendants actions in administering the program violated rowe rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,rowe challenged the constitutionality of section on its face and as applied.rowe also alleged a violation of,which rowe has abandoned on appeal.rowe sought a declaratory judgment that the statutory scheme was invalid,an injunction against its continued administration,and compensatory and punitive damages.
in,at the state request,mgt prepared and issued its third study of subcontractors employed in north carolina highway construction industry.as detailed within,the study marshaled a wealth of evidence to conclude that disparities in the utilization of minority subcontractors persisted.in response to this study,the general assembly substantially amended section,and the governor signed the amended statute into law on august.the new statute modified the previous statutory scheme in five important respects.
first,the amended statute expressly conditions implementation of any participation goals on the findings of the study.section,as amended,authorizes remedial action only in instances in which the study show s a strong basis in evidence of ongoing effects of past or present discrimination that prevents or limits disadvantaged and businesses from participating as subcontractors in projects at a level which would have existed absent such discrimination.b.the amended statute also requires that the department,to the extent reasonably practicable,incorporate narrowly tailored remedies identified in the study.id.
second,the amended statute eliminates the and percent annual goals set forth in the predecessor statute.instead,as amended,the statute simply requires the department to establish annual aspirational goals,not mandatory goals,for the overall participation in contracts by disadvantaged and businesses that shall not be applied rigidly on specific contracts or projects.id.the statute further mandates that the department set goals or goals for each disadvantaged and business category that has demonstrated significant disparity in contract utilization based on availability,as determined by the study.id.
third,the amended statute narrows the definition of minority to encompass only those groups that have suffered discrimination.the statute had previously defined minority to include,among others,african americans,hispanic americans,portuguese americans,asian americans,american indians,and alaskan natives.see.c incorporating definition of minority contained in i.the amended statute replaces this list by defining minority as only those racial or ethnicity classifications identified by the study that have been subjected to discrimination in the relevant marketplace and that have been adversely affected in their ability to obtain contracts with the department.c.
fourth,the amended statute requires the department to reevaluate the program over time and respond to changing conditions.accordingly,the department must conduct a study similar to the study at least every five years.id.b.the department must then promulgate rules consistent with findings made in the subsequent studies,id,and must report to the general assembly after the release of each study for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of the statute should continue in force and effect,id.d.
finally,the amended statute contains a sunset provision.as amended in,the statute was set to expire on august.e.the general assembly subsequently extended the sunset provision to august.e.
several aspects of the program remain unchanged.for example,a prime contractor that does not meet goals may still demonstrate compliance by making good faith efforts to solicit minority and women subcontractors.admin.code.
in evaluating whether a bidder has made good faith efforts,the department considers,inter alia,whether the bidder s olicit ed minority and women subcontractors through all reasonable and available means and allowed sufficient time for them to respond followed up on these solicitations selected work to be performed by minority and women subcontractors to increase the likelihood of meeting program goals provided minority and women subcontractors with adequate information about the plans,specifications,and requirements of the contract negotiated in good faith with minority and women subcontractors accepted quotes from minority and women subcontractors in the absence of sound reasons to reject them and assisted minority and women subcontractors in obtaining bonding,lines of credit,or insurance.see app.a,cited in admin.code.
as discussed above,the good faith requirement proved permissive in practice prime contractors satisfied the requirement in percent of cases,failing to do so in only of attempts.
in light of the amendments to section,the defendants moved to dismiss all or part of this action on various grounds.
initially,they contended that the amendments rendered rowe attack on the statute moot.the district court rejected this argument.the court recognized that the amended statute did away with many of the alleged shortcomings of its predecessor and so undoubtedly differs from the old statute in material respects.rowe,tippett,at march.but the court concluded that rowe suit continued to present a live controversy because the statutory amendments did not resolve the primary problem which the plaintiff first complained of the use of remedial race and preferences without valid evidence of past racial and gender discrimination.id.at.the court reasoned that rowe could i n that sense contend that the amended statutory scheme disadvantage s it in the same fundamental way.id.at quoting ne.chapter of associated contractors of am.city of jacksonville.
the district court did,however,dismiss all of rowe claims for damages against the state officials sued in their individual capacities,concluding that qualified immunity barred these claims.the court also dismissed easley from the suit,holding that he had no role in implementing the challenged statutory scheme.in addition,the court dismissed rowe claims against the department,as well as its damages claims against the individual defendants in their official capacities,holding them barred by sovereign immunity.but the court concluded that rowe claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against tippett,varnedoe,and sanderson survived under the doctrine set forth in ex parte young.
after extensive discovery and a bench trial at which numerous witnesses testified and over one thousand pages of exhibits were admitted into evidence,the district court upheld the constitutionality of the statutory scheme in all respects.rowe challenges this holding on appeal 
keeping in mind the statutory scheme and the rulings of the district court,we turn to the legal principles governing rowe claims.as always,on appeal from a bench trial,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see pcs phosphate,norfolk,cir.

a state need not conclusively prove the existence of past or present racial discrimination to establish a strong basis in evidence for concluding that remedial action is necessary.see,e,concrete works,at.instead,a state may meet its burden by relying on a significant statistical disparity between the availability of qualified,willing,and able minority subcontractors and the utilization of such subcontractors by the governmental entity or its prime contractors.croson,at plurality opinion.we further require that such evidence be corroborated by significant anecdotal evidence of racial discrimination.troopers ass n,evans,cir.
those challenging remedial measures must introduce credible,particularized evidence to rebut the state showing of a strong basis in evidence for the necessity for remedial action.see concrete works,at internal quotation marks omitted.challengers may offer a neutral explanation for the state evidence,present contrasting statistical data,or demonstrate that the evidence is flawed,insignificant,or not actionable.see eng g contractors,at contractors ass of,city of philadelphia,cir contractors ass i coral constr.king county,cir.however,mere speculation that the state evidence is insufficient or methodologically flawed does not suffice to rebut a state showing.see concrete works,at.
finally,to satisfy strict scrutiny,the state statutory scheme must also be narrowly tailored to serve the state compelling interest in not financing private discrimination with public funds.alexander,at citing adarand,at.
precedent dictates,and the parties agree,that courts apply intermediate scrutiny to statutes that classify on the basis of gender.adkins rumsfeld,cir see also.for women hogan.a defender of such a statute meets this burden by showing at least that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.hogan,at internal quotation marks omitted.of course,intermediate scrutiny requires less of a showing than does the most exacting strict scrutiny standard of review.see clark jeter.
although the supreme court has established a strong basis in evidence requirement for measures subject to strict scrutiny,courts work without an analogous evidentiary label from the supreme court for programs.eng g contractors,at.our sister circuits,however,provide guidance in formulating a governing evidentiary standard.these courts agree that such a measure can rest safely on something less than the strong basis in evidence required to bear the weight of a program.see also concrete works,at contractors ass i,at coral,at.
in defining what constitutes something less than a strong basis in evidence,the courts,though diverging in their choice of words,also agree that the party defending the statute must present sufficient probative evidence in support of its stated rationale for enacting a gender preference,the evidence must be sufficient to show that the preference rests on analysis rather than on stereotypical generalizations.eng g contractors,at concrete works,at t he measures must be based on reasoned analysis rather than on the mechanical application of traditional,often inaccurate,assumptions.quoting hogan,at contractors ass i,at coral,at see also.builders ass n,milliken,cir striking down measure where the defendants presented no evidence that businesses suffered a disadvantage in competing for state contracts.
when a plaintiff alleges,as rowe does,that a statute violates the equal protection clause,not only as applied,but also on its face,the plaintiff bears a heavy burden.the supreme court has,as a policy matter,expressed a strong preference for avoiding facial challenges.richmond med.ctr.for women herring,cir en banc.the court disfavor s such challenges because they often rest on speculation,run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint,and threaten to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the constitution.state grange.state republican party.in its facial challenge,therefore,a plaintiff has a very heavy burden to carry,and must show that a statutory scheme can not operate constitutionally under any circumstance.west virginia dep t of health human,cir citing united states salerno.
of course,even if a plaintiff can not mount a successful facial challenge,it may nonetheless be able to demonstrate that the application or enforcement of a statute is unconstitutional.where substantial record evidence exists as to the application of the challenged statutory scheme,a court has the concrete facts necessary to assess such an challenge.see herring,at.
bearing in mind the legal standards applicable to rowe facial and challenges,we examine the evidence offered by the parties at trial with respect to discrimination in subcontracting,and the district court findings of fact as to that evidence.
we outline first the state statistical evidence of discrimination in subcontracting,including its disparity evidence and regression analysis.
the study performed by mgt,the national research and consulting firm commissioned by the state,analyzed the the amount of subcontracting dollars minority and businesses actually won in a market and the amount of subcontracting dollars they would be expected to win given their presence in that market.mgt grounded its analysis in the disparity index,which measures the participation of a given racial,ethnic,or gender group engaged in subcontracting.to calculate a disparity index,mgt divided the percentage of total subcontracting dollars that a particular group won by the percent that group represents in the available labor pool,and multiplied the result by.the closer the resulting index is to,the greater that group participation.for example,if african american subcontractors represented percent of the available labor pool and won percent of the subcontracting dollars,the disparity index would be or full participation.similarly,if african american subcontractors represented percent of the available labor pool and won percent of the subcontracting dollars,the disparity index would be or half participation.
after croson,a number of our sister circuits have recognized the utility of the disparity index in determining statistical disparities in the utilization of minority and businesses.see,rothe ii,at concrete works,at scott,at eng g contractors,at contractors ass i,at associated contractors of,coal.for econ.equity,cir.generally,courts consider a disparity index lower than as an indication of discrimination.see rothe ii,at eng g contractors,at see also d directing federal agencies to regard a selection rate of lower than percent as evidence of disparate impact employment discrimination.accordingly,mgt considered only a disparity index lower than as warranting further investigation.
after calculating a disparity index for each relevant racial or gender group,mgt tested for the statistical significance of the results by conducting standard deviation analysis through the use of.as explained in the study,t he determines if the relationship between availability and utilization suggested by the disparity index value supports a conclusion of disparity.in other words,the results of the allow us to conclude if the results found in the disparity index represent real disparity.put simply,standard deviation analysis describes the probability that the measured disparity is the result of mere chance.eng g contractors,at.mgt considered a finding of two standard deviations a of to demonstrate with percent certainty that disparity,as represented by either overutilization or underutilization,is actually present.see also eng g contractors,at.
the study analyzed the participation of minority and women subcontractors in construction contracts awarded and managed from the central department office in raleigh to determine utilization of minority and women subcontractors,mgt developed a master list of contracts mainly from electronic databases and hard copy files.mgt then selected from that list a statistically valid sample of contracts,and calculated the percentage of subcontracting dollars awarded to minority and businesses during the period ending in june.
to estimate percentage of a particular group in the relevant market created a vendor list comprising subcontractors approved by the department to perform subcontract work on projects,subcontractors that performed such work during the study period,and contractors qualified to perform prime construction work on contracts.the study included the latter group because according to the state expert,vincent eagan prime contractors are qualified to perform subcontracting work and often do perform such work.indeed,rowe itself performed substantial amounts of subcontracting work on department projects during the pendency of this litigation.to ensure accuracy,mgt submitted its master list to the department for verification.
based on the utilization and availability figures,the study returned the following disparity analysis 
as these figures demonstrate,prime contractors underutilized all of the minority subcontractor classifications on construction contracts during the study period.the disparity index for each group was less than and,thus,warranted further investigation.the results,however,demonstrated marked underutilization only of african american and native american subcontractors.for african americans the of fell outside of two standard deviations from the mean and,therefore,was statistically significant at a percent confidence level.in other words,there was at least a percent probability that prime contractors underutilization of african american subcontractors was not the result of mere chance.for native american subcontractors,the of was significant at a confidence level of approximately percent.the for hispanic american and asian american subcontractors,and,respectively,demonstrated significance at a confidence level of approximately percent.the disparity index for women subcontractors found that they were overutilized during the study period.the of demonstrated that this overutilization was statistically significant at a percent confidence level.
the study also revealed that,on average,non minority male subcontractors won more valuable subcontracts than did minority and women subcontractors.from to,the average subcontract awarded to nonminority male subcontractors yielded more than double the dollars won by minority subcontractors and nearly triple the dollars won by women subcontractors.
to corroborate the disparity data,mgt conducted a regression analysis studying the influence of certain company and business a particular focus on owner race and a firm gross revenues.mgt obtained the data from a telephone survey of firms that conducted or attempted to conduct business with the department.the survey pool consisted of a random sample of such firms of this group,participated in the survey.
mgt used the firms gross revenues as the dependent variable in the regression analysis to test the effect of other variables,including company age and number of employees,and the owners years of experience,level of education,race,ethnicity,and gender.the analysis revealed that minority and women ownership universally had a negative effect on revenue.african american ownership of a firm had the largest negative effect on that firm gross revenue of all the independent variables included in the regression model.these findings led mgt to conclude that for african americans,in particular,the disparity in firm revenue was not due to or managerial characteristics alone.
to rebut the state statistical evidence of discrimination,rowe attacked the study methodology and pointed to findings from the study that,according to rowe,undermine the state evidence of discrimination.
rowe argued that mgt availability estimate insufficiently accounted for the qualifications and willingness of minority subcontractors to perform subcontracts.see croson,at.the state estimated availability of minority and women subcontractors in the relevant labor pool using vendor data data reflecting the number of approved subcontractors in the state,subcontractors that performed on department projects,and prequalified prime contractors.
rowe expert,george lanoue,testified that bidder data reflecting the number of subcontractors that actually bid on department availability better than vendor data.however,lanoue acknowledged that the state does not compile bidder data.he further conceded that bidder data actually reflects skew ed availability in the context of a goals program that urges prime contractors to solicit bids from minority and women subcontractors.furthermore,lanoue did not contradict eagan previous testimony that the only source of bidder data available estimated a higher percentage of businesses in the relevant labor pool than did mgt estimate.in short,neither rowe nor its expert has demonstrated that the vendor data used in the study was unreliable,or that bidder data would have yielded less support for the conclusions reached.
lanoue did suggest another measurement of availability prime contractors assessments of subcontractor qualifications.however,he acknowledged that no such documentary evidence exists in north carolina.moreover,when pressed,lanoue failed to explain how such data would not be skewed by discriminatory barriers in the marketplace.
in short,rowe challenge to the availability estimate failed because it could not demonstrate that the study availability estimate was inadequate.see concrete works,at a challenger can not meet its burden of proof through conjecture and unsupported criticisms of the state evidence.further,rowe presented no viable alternative for determining availability.see sherbrooke turf.dep t of,cir plaintiff failed to establish that better data was available or that defendant was otherwise unreasonable in undertaking this thorough analysis and in relying on its results.
rowe next argued that alternative disparity evidence in the study disproves the existence of discrimination.rowe pointed to evidence that minority subcontractors participate on projects at a level consistent with their avail ability in the relevant labor pool.for example,while african american subcontractors represented percent of the workforce available for department projects,they represented percent of the firms participating on department subcontracts,resulting in a disparity index of only.the state responded that evidence as to the number of minority subcontractors working on projects does not effectively rebut the evidence of discrimination in terms of subcontracting dollars.the state pointed to evidence indicating that prime contractors used minority businesses for work in order to comply with the department goals.for example,in support of this contention,the state presented evidence from the study that african american ownership had a significant negative impact on firm revenue unrelated to firm capacity or experience.rowe did not offer any contrary evidence or in any other way challenge this evidence.
the state further bolstered its position by presenting evidence that minority subcontractors have the capacity to perform work.the study concluded,based on a sample of subcontracts and reports of annual firm revenue,that exclusion of minority subcontractors from contracts under was not a function of capacity.during the study period,well over percent of the department subcontracts were valued at or less,with over percent valued at or below.further,the state expert,eagan,explained that capacity constraints do not operate with the same force on subcontracts as they may on prime contracts because subcontracts tend to be relatively small.rothe ii,at faulting disparity analyses of total construction dollars,including prime contracts,for failing to account for the relative capacity of firms.rowe offered no objective evidence to the contrary.
in addition to the statistical evidence set forth above,the state also presented evidence demonstrating that from september to april,during the program suspension,prime contractors awarded substantially fewer subcontracting dollars to minority and women subcontractors on projects.between and,for example,the total amount of these subcontracting dollars declined percent.the decline was most significant for native american and women subcontractors.meanwhile,the share of subcontracting dollars awarded to nonminority male subcontractors increased.
rowe did not and does not argue that the actual data on which the state relied in reaching these conclusions is flawed.instead,rowe continues to argue that evidence of a decline in utilization does not raise an inference of discrimination.this is so,rowe contends,because race and measures afford a competitive advantage that disappears when such measures cease.however,the very significant decline in utilization of minority and women provides a basis for a fact finder to infer that discrimination played some role in prime contractors reduced utilization of these groups during the suspension.see,slater,at finding that evidence of declining minority utilization after a program has been discontinued strongly supports the government claim that there are significant barriers to minority competition in the public subcontracting market,raising the specter of racial discrimination see also sherbrooke turf,at.such an inference is particularly compelling for businesses because,even during the study period,prime contractors continued to underutilize them on road projects.
the state additionally relied on three sources of anecdotal evidence contained in the study a telephone survey,personal interviews,and focus groups.
the telephone survey produced evidence of an informal good old boy network of white contractors that discriminated against minority subcontractors.more than of african american respondents to the telephone survey agreed that an informal network of prime and subcontractors existed in the state,as did percent of native americans,percent of hispanic americans,and percent of asian americans.notably,more than half of african american respondents believed the network excluded their companies from bidding or winning a contract,as did percent of native americans,percent of hispanic americans,and percent of asian americans.tellingly,nearly half of nonminority male respondents corroborated the existence of an informal network,but only percent of them believed that the network excluded their companies from bidding or winning contracts.
a large majority of african american respondents also reported that double standards in qualifications and performance made it more difficult for them to win bids and con tracts,that prime contractors view minority firms as being less competent than nonminority firms,and that nonminority firms change their bids when not required to hire minority firms.a majority of native american respondents reported these same inequities.
further,percent of african american respondents and percent of native american respondents believed that prime contractors sometimes dropped minority subcontractors after winning contracts.nearly of african american respondents and percent of native american respondents reported that they themselves had been dropped by a prime contractor after the department awarded the contract.only percent of nonminority male respondents reported the same.
interview and responses echoed and underscored these reports.several respondents indicated that prime contractors already know who they will use on the contract before they solicit bids.an african american participant stated that the good old boy network affects his business because prime contractors just pick up the phone and call their buddies,the ones that they go deer hunting with every saturday morning and so,we find ourselves out of that market completely.another african american respondent explained that prime contractors prefer to use other less qualified firms to avoid subcontracting with african firms.a native american subcontractor reported that prime contractors use their preferred subcontractor regardless of the bid price.several minority subcontractors reported that prime contractors do not treat minority firms fairly,pointing to instances in which prime contractors solicited quotes the day before bids were due,did not respond to bids from minority subcontractors,refused to negotiate prices with them,or gave minority subcontractors insufficient information regarding the project.
seeking to rebut the state anecdotal evidence,rowe again attacked the study methodology.rowe contended the anecdotal data was flawed because the study did not verify the anecdotal data and mgt oversampled minority subcontractors in collecting the data.
as to its first contention,rowe offered no rationale as to why a fact finder could not rely on the state unverified anecdotal data.indeed,a fact finder could very well conclude that anecdotal evidence need indeed verified because it is nothing more than a witness narrative of an incident told from the witness perspective and including the witness perceptions.concrete works,at.
rowe second contention also misses the mark.as our precedent makes clear,anecdotal evidence simply supplements statistical evidence of discrimination.see.troopers,at.thus,the state expert,eagan,testified that the study oversampled representatives from these groups to get at the problems faced by women and minorities.surveying more nonminority men would not have advanced the inquiry.moreover,eagan testified that although the study oversampled minority groups,the samples were randomly selected.
to rebut the substance of the anecdotal data on which the state relies,rowe pointed to evidence indicating that minority subcontractors enjoy excellent or good relationships with prime contractors.for example,percent of african american respondents to the telephone survey rated their experiences with prime contractors as excellent or good,as did over percent of native american respondents.these responses indicate that,when utilized on contracts,minority subcontractors enjoy positive experiences with prime contractors.but they do not negate the state compelling anecdotal evidence that minority subcontractors face obstacles to successful bidding.
after consideration of the above evidence and extensive argument of counsel,the district court granted judgment to the state,upholding in all respects the constitutionality of both section and the department administration of the program.
in its written opinion,the district court found as fact that d isparity ratios in the study highlighted the underutilization of minority subcontractors by prime contractors bidding on state funded highway projects the general assembly relied on evidence demonstrat ing a dramatic decline in the utilization of minority subcontractors during the p rogram suspension anecdotal support relied upon by the legislature confirmed and reinforced the general data demonstrating the underutilization of minority subcontractors and the average contracts awarded women subcontractors are significantly smaller than those awarded other subcontractors.rowe,tippett,d.given the evidence outlined above,we can not conclude that the district court clearly erred with respect to any of these findings.
this,of course,does not end our inquiry.we must next determine if these facts justify the court ultimate conclusion that the north carolina statutory scheme withstands constitutional challenge.
we first address whether the state statutory scheme as it relates to minorities survives strict scrutiny review.
strict scrutiny requires that we conduct the most exacting judicial examination of the evidence the state put forth to support its minority participation goals.troopers,at quoting wygant,at.we have done so and conclude,for the following reasons,that the state presented a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that the minority participation goals were necessary to remedy discrimination against african american and native american subcontractors.
as previously explained in detail,the state data powerfully demonstrates that prime contractors grossly underutilized african american and native american subcontractors in public sector subcontracting during the study period.these findings have particular resonance because since,the general assembly has encouraged minority participation in highway projects,and yet african american and native american subcontractors continue to be underutilized on such projects.
moreover,the disparity index in the study demonstrated statistically significant underutilization of african american subcontractors at a percent confidence level,and of native american subcontractors at a confidence level of approximately percent.although the probative force of the evidence relating to african american subcontractors is stronger than the evidence relating to native american subcontractors,the evidence in the study for both groups demonstrates a high likelihood of actual disparity.
the state bolstered the disparity evidence with regression analysis demonstrating that african american ownership correlated with a significant,negative impact on firm revenue.further,as the district court found,the state demonstrated that there was a dramatic decline in the utilization of minority subcontractors during the p rogram suspension.rowe,d at.both native american and african american subcontractors experienced significant declines in subcontracting dollars during that period.
to summarize,the state evidence showing a gross statistical disparity between the availability of qualified african american and native american subcontractors and the amount of subcontracting dollars they win on public sector contracts establishes the necessary statistical foundation for upholding the minority participation goals with respect to these groups see croson,at id.at highlighting richmond inability to show what percentage of total city construction dollars minority firms now receive as subcontractors on prime contracts let by the city cone hillsborough county,cir finding statistical evidence of disparity in public sector subcontracting dollars sufficient to defeat summary judgment concrete works,at finding sufficient evidence of discrimination in construction industry despite over utilization of minority businesses on city projects subject to goals program.therefore,we next consider whether the state anecdotal evidence of discrimination against these two groups sufficiently supplements the state statistical showing.
the surveys in the study exposed an informal,racially exclusive network that systemically disadvantaged minority subcontractors.the state could conclude with good reason that such networks exert a chronic and pernicious influence on the marketplace that calls for remedial action.see slater,at as a result of closed contracting networks,firms are seldom or never invited to bid for subcontracts on projects that do not contain affirmative action requirements.internal quotation marks omitted.
in maryland troopers,we cautioned against inferring discrimination from reports of cronyism absent evidence of racial animus.at.here,however,majorities of african american and native american respondents agreed that prime contractors have higher standards for minority subcontractors,view minority subcontractors as being less competent than nonminority businesses,change their bidding practices when not required to hire minority subcontractors,and drop minority subcontractors after winning contracts.together,these responses suggest strongly that the underutilization of african american and native american subcontractors is more than a mere byproduct of misguided yet cronyism.rather,they indicate that racial discrimination is a critical factor underlying the gross statistical disparities presented in the study.unlike in maryland troopers,where we found no gross statistical disparity,corroborated by anecdotal evidence,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,the state here presented substantial statistical evidence of gross disparity,corroborated by disturb ing anecdotal evidence.
in sum,the state has met its burden of producing a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that minority participation goals were necessary to remedy discrimination against african american and native american but not asian american or hispanic american subcontractors.particularly compelling is the state evidence that prime contractors grossly underutilized african american and native american subcontractors during the study period and that these subcontractors are disadvantaged by a racially exclusive old boys network.in circumstances like these,the supreme court has made it abundantly clear that a state can remedy a public contracting system that withholds opportunities from minority groups because of their race.see adarand,at.
to withstand constitutional scrutiny,however,the north carolina statutory scheme must also be narrowly tailored to achieve the state compelling interest in remedying discrimination against african american and native american subcontractors in subcontracting.we have identified the following factors as relevant in evaluating whether a state statute is narrowly tailored 
the necessity of the policy and the efficacy of alternative race neutral policies the planned duration of the policy the relationship between the numerical goal and the percentage of minority group members in the relevant population the flexibility of the policy,including the provision of waivers if the goal can not be met and the burden of the policy on innocent third parties.
belk bd.of,cir en banc.finally,we consider a program overinclusiveness,croson,at,its tendency to benefit particular minority groups that have not been shown to have suffered invidious discrimination,alexander,at.we address each factor in turn.
narrow tailoring requires serious,good faith consideration of workable alternatives,but a state need not exhaust every conceivable alternative.grutter bollinger.the study details numerous alternative measures aimed at enhancing the development and competitiveness of small or otherwise disadvantaged businesses in north carolina.
for example,the state small business enterprise program favors small businesses for highway construction procurement contracts of or less.this program permits the department to waive the institutional barriers of bonding and licensing requirements on such contracts.see.the department also contracts for support services to assist disadvantaged business enterprises with bookkeeping and accounting,taxes,marketing,bidding,negotiation,and other aspects of entrepreneurial development.
indeed,rowe identifies no viable alternatives that north carolina has failed to consider and adopt.notably,the state has undertaken most of the alternatives identified by the federal department of the treasury in its regulations governing the federal dbe program.see b see also contracting,illinois,cir upholding the constitutionality of a program that,like this one,use d nearly all of the methods described in b to maximize the portion of the goal that will be achieved through means.we thus conclude that the state gave serious good faith consideration to alternatives prior to adopting the challenged statutory scheme.
despite these efforts,the study demonstrated that disparities continue to exist in the utilization of african american and native american subcontractors in highway construction subcontracting.these persistent disparities indicate the necessity of a remedy.see contractors ass i,at upholding against summary judgment an ordinance that was enacted only after alternatives proved insufficient to improve minority participation in city contracting.
as to the duration of the statutory scheme,the district court found two facts particularly compelling in establishing that it was narrowly tailored the statute provisions setting a specific expiration date and requiring a new disparity study every years.rowe,d at discussing.b,e.we agree.the program inherent time limit and provisions requiring regular reevaluation ensure that it is carefully designed to endure only until the discriminatory impact has been eliminated.slater,at quoting united states paradise,
the state has also demonstrated that the program participation goals are related to the percentage of minority subcontractors in the relevant markets in the state.see.the department has taken concrete steps to ensure that these goals accurately reflect the availability of businesses on a basis.first,the department generates a report detailing the type of work that it anticipates subcontractors will perform on a particular project.next,a commit tee consults its database of certified minority contractors in the relevant geographic area capable of performing those types of work.consulting the report,the database,and its own members experience,the commit tee then sets a participation goal.notably,this process does not mechanically require minority participation in fact,between july and february,the commit tee set a goal of zero percent minority participation on approximately percent of projects.
rowe contends that the department does not do enough to evaluate the relative qualifications of minority businesses and whether or not they are willing and able to perform services on particular projects.however,rowe neither explains how the careful process currently in place falls short nor offers a viable alternative method.see sherbrooke turf,at concrete works,at.
as the district court recognized,the flexibility of the statutory scheme is also a significant indicator of narrow tailoring.the program contemplates a waiver of goals when prime contractors make good faith efforts to meet those goals.see admin.code.good faith efforts essentially require only that the prime contractor solicit and consider bids from minorities.the state does not require or expect the prime contractor to accept any bid from an unqualified bidder,or any bid that is not the lowest bid.moreover,prime contractors can bank any excess minority participation for use against future goals over the following two years.given the lenient standard and flexibility of the good faith requirement,it comes as little surprise that as of july,only of good faith rowe had failed to demonstrate good faith efforts.
with respect to the burden imposed by the program,rowe offers two arguments in support of its contention that the program places a substantial burden on prime contractors.
first,rowe contends that the program creates onerous solicitation and requirements.however,at trial,rowe president testified that the company secretaries run the solicitation program with no need for additional employees dedicated to the task.
second,rowe maintains that complying with goals forces it to subcontract millions of dollars of work that it could perform itself for less money.but rowe offered no evidence to support this claim.the state,on the other hand,offered evidence from the study that prime contractors need not subcontract work they can.
lastly,rowe contends that the statutory scheme is overinclusive.by its own terms,however,the statute expressly limits relief to those racial or ethnicity classifications that have been subjected to discrimination in the relevant marketplace and that have been adversely affected in their ability to obtain contracts with the department.c.in tailoring the remedy in this way,the general assembly did not random ly inclu de racial groups that,as a practical matter,may never have suffered from discrimination in the construction industry.croson,at.rather,the statute contemplates participation goals only for those groups shown to have suffered discrimination.as such,north carolina statute differs from measures that have failed narrow tailoring for overinclusiveness.see,associated contractors of ohio,drabik,cir by lumping together the groups of african americans,native americans,hispanics,and asian americans,the challenged statute may well provide preference where there has been no discrimination.
in sum,we have considered the relevant factors and conclude that the statutory scheme is narrowly tailored to achieve the state compelling interest in remedying discrimination in subcontracting against african american and native american subcontractors.
we turn next to the question of whether the state statutory scheme with respect to women survives intermediate scrutiny.
the study disparity analysis demonstrated that,unlike businesses,businesses won far more than their expected share of subcontracting dollars during the study period.in other words,prime contractors substantially over utilized women subcontractors on public road construction projects.moreover,mgt calculated the over utilization of women subcontractors as statistically significant at a percent confidence level.
nevertheless,the district court found discrimination against businesses in the public sector.the court based its conclusion on evidence that women won subcontracts that were,on average,worth of the value of subcontracts won by nonminority males.rowe,d at.the state also offered evidence that prime contractors awards to women subcontractors in the public sector declined significantly during the program suspension.this evidence,although probative of discrimination,can not overcome far more compelling evidence from the study demonstrating prime contractors more recent,statistically significant overutilization of businesses in the public sector.in short,the evidence as a whole does not evince the exceedingly persuasive justification the supreme court requires.see united states virginia.
perhaps recognizing this,the state relies heavily on data from the study demonstrating that prime contractors significantly underutilized women subcontractors in the general construction industry statewide and in the charlotte area.however,because the study provided analysis on the disparity figures to calculate statistical significance,we can not determine whether this private underutilization was the result of mere chance.eng g contractors,at.
nor did the state present evidence indicating the extent to which businesses competing on road targets of the remedial for subcontracts in the general construction industry.this evidentiary gap is troubling because prime contractors overutilize women subcontractors in the public sector.thus,businesses may well seek less work.
the state also failed to present any anecdotal evidence indicating that women subcontractors successfully bidding on state contracts faced discrimination.see.troopers,at warning against inferring discrimination from statistics alone coral,at relying on a lengthy affidavit from a woman business owner describing her success in winning public dollars,but her failure in contracting.missing,too,is any evidence that prime contractors that discriminate against women subcontractors in the private sector nevertheless win contracts.concrete works,at relying on anecdotal evidence that general contractors that used minority and women subcontractors on public projects refused to use them on private projects 
moreover,the state failed even to establish the amount of overlap between general construction and road construction subcontracting.although road construction involves some of the same subcontracting work as general construction,the dearth of evidence as to the correlation between public road construction subcontracting and private general construction subcontracting severely limits the private data probative value in this case.
finally,the anecdotal evidence that the state did present falls short of justifying the program gender participation goals.for example,although percent of women respondents agreed that an exclusive network exists in the construction industry,only percent believed that the network excluded their firms.by contrast,percent of african american respondents and percent of native american respondents agreed such a network exists,and percent of african american respondents and percent of native american respondents believed that they,themselves,had been excluded.further,while a majority of african american and native american respondents believed that prime contractors held them to higher standards than nonminority males,only percent of women respondents held this view.
in short,with respect to the gender participation goals,the state can not overcome the strong evidence of overutilization in the public sector.the proffered data fails to establish discrimination in the particular field in question.see ensley branch,at.further,the anecdotal evidence indicates that most women subcontractors in north carolina do not experience discrimination.accordingly,we conclude that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to support the program current inclusion of women subcontractors in setting participation goals.
to summarize,north carolina has put forth strong evidence that discrimination against african american and native american subcontractors continues to limit their participation on highway construction contracts.the state has a compelling interest,indeed an absolute duty,to remedy this injustice,affecting as it does the distribution of public funds.see croson,at kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment a s tate has the power to eradicate racial discrimination and its effects in both the public and private sectors,and the absolute duty to do so where those wrongs were caused intentionally by the state itself.
the state has enacted a narrowly tailored response to this problem that addresses discrimination while respecting the virtues of the free market.thus,unlike the city of richmond unconstitutional program in croson,north carolina statutory scheme does not mandate that specific percentages of subcontracting dollars always be apportioned to minority groups or women.rather,the statute prohibits the department from setting participation goals rigidly.bl.instead,such goals must be consistent with availability of minority and women subcontractors.contractors ass ii,at finding that city ordinance mandating goals for minority and business participation,based on percentage of minorities and women in the general population,was not narrowly tailored.and if the realities of the marketplace prevent a prime contractor from meeting these goals,the state waives them on a showing of good faith efforts to solicit and consider bids from minority and women subcontractors.only in the rarest of cases has a prime contractor failed to demonstrate good faith efforts to solicit minority or women subcontractors.
moreover,as amended in,section does not authorize the department to set participation goals unless the most recent disparity study,which must be conducted at least every years,demonstrates a strong basis in evidence of ongoing effects of past or present discrimination that prevents or limits disadvantaged minority and women subcontractors from participating in transportation contracts at a level which would have existed absent such discrimination.b croson,at faulting richmond program for random ly inclu ding racial groups that may never have suffered from discrimination in the construction industry rothe ii,at finding statute with percent goal of minority participation unconstitutional on its face because it was not supported by strong basis in evidence.
thus,the north carolina general assembly has crafted legislation that withstands constitutional scrutiny.in light of the statutory scheme flexibility and responsiveness to the realities of the marketplace,rowe has failed to establish that no set of circumstances exists under which section would be valid.salerno,at.indeed,given the state strong evidence of discrimination against african american and native american subcontractors in subcontracting,the state application of the statute to these groups is certainly constitutional.thus,rowe has failed to shoulder its heavy burden in challenging the facial validity of section.id.
however,because the state has failed to justify its application of the statutory scheme to women,asian american,and hispanic american subcontractors,we can not find those applications constitutional when some applications of a statute are constitutional,but others are not,the supreme court has explained that courts should strive,if feasible and consistent with the legislature intent,to enjoin only the unconstitutional applications of a statute while leaving other applications in force.ayotte planned parenthood of new,contractors ass i,at severing unconstitutional subsections of challenged statute,rather than striking down entire statute for overinclusiveness.
this course is entirely appropriate here.under controlling north carolina law,it seems clear that the remaining applications of the legislation can stand on their own,and that the general assembly would have enacted the remainder absent the offending portion.state webb,internal quotation marks omitted.applying the challenged statute only to african american and native american subcontractors fulfills the statute purpose of remedying the ongoing effects of past or present discrimination in transportation contracts.b.we are satisfied that the general assembly would choose to maintain the application of the statute to remedy discrimination against any minority that continues to suffer it.mindful that a court can not use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature,ayotte,at internal quotation marks omitted,we will respect the will of the people of north carolina and their elected leaders.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court with regard to the facial validity of the statute,and with regard to its application to african american and native american subcontractors.we reverse the district court judgment insofar as it upholds the constitutionality of section as applied to women,asian american,and hispanic american subcontractors.we remand to the district court to fashion an appropriate remedy consistent with this opinion.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded 
with genuine admiration for the care with which the majority opinion addresses the principal i concur in much of what is remain troubled by contextual issues that the majority has not addressed and that indicate an effort by north carolina to maintain a broad program to assure minority representation and diversity in public contracting,regardless of whether actual discrimination exists.
when we decide cases involving and government programs,we must remain especially vigilant in recalling that such programs are presumptively unconstitutional,in violation of the equal protection clause.see shaw reno.moreover,to approve or programs simply to further a policy of diversity in public contracting perpetuates,not eliminates,discrimination.only when there is clear evidence of actual discrimination should we approve a state government or considerations,and only then when the program is designed to remedy the discrimination.
it is noteworthy that the north carolina program in this case was created without any evidence of discrimination.rather,it was initiated in the with a quota system that was the product of policies designed to spread public contracting among minorities and women simply for the purpose of racial and gender representation.the state only undertook to determine whether actual discrimination existed in public contracting when city of richmond croson,made clear that north carolina program was constitutionally infirm.as a result,north carolina has never,indeed,never will opportunity to determine whether discrimination existed in public contracting absent the program effects on the market.and even after concluding that discrimination did in fact exist,the state reinstituted the exact same quotas that it had previously used.
to be sure,the program has changed over time,but even the immediate past version of the north carolina statute required that quotas be satisfied through the participation of a broad array of ethnic peoples,such as portuguese americans,asian americans,american indians,and alaskan natives,regardless of whether evidence of discrimination against those groups existed.
in its current form,the north carolina statute creating the program provides little to no guidance regarding how it is to be implemented,leaving an unnerving amount of discretion to a small number of department of transportation administrators.the current statute uses the disparity study as a predicate to justify and remedial efforts and directs the department of transportation to commission future studies to determine whether future remedial efforts are necessary.specifically,the statute requires the north carolina department of transportation to establish annual aspirational goals,not mandatory goals,that shall not be applied rigidly on specific contracts or projects.
but the statute does not provide any range nor give any criteria for these goals.instead,it authorizes the department to act based solely on the department own interpretation of the study and future studies that the department itself must commission.as a result,department administrators,not state legislators,are those responsible for determining which groups qualify as minorities,and they are statutorily authorized to make that determination when a group has been subjected to discrimination in the relevant marketplace and has been adversely affected in its ability to obtain contracts with the department.id.c emphasis added.these administrators are also given the power to determine,in their sole discretion,adequate levels of representation in obtaining public contracts for each minority group.
after the department,in its discretion,adopts aspirational goals,it is given the additional authority to decide whether prime contractors have made good faith efforts to meet the aspirational goals,which in themselves are not to be applied rigidly.
the result is an amorphous exhortation to favor minorities and women in public contracting.i question how it can be concluded that actual discrimination is being addressed and,if so,whether the means used can be sufficiently narrowly tailored so as to comply with the constitution.i take little comfort from the fact that the only meaningful oversight of this process has been review by the federal courts following years of litigation.while the majority in this case thoroughly scrutinizes whether the implementation of this program is genuinely aimed at fighting actual discrimination in state contracting,the fact that such review is necessary demonstrates that the state and its administrators have few if any standards by which they ensure that their program complies with constitutional requirements.
our holding in this case is prime evidence of the problem.we conclude that the state officials who used the study to justify favoring asian americans,hispanic americans,and women had insufficient evidence of discrimination to do so.that finding hardly instills confidence in the state continued application of ad hoc standards purportedly designed to remedy actual discrimination.
moreover,the arbitrariness of the entire north carolina structure for determining when to consider race and gender is displayed by the weakness of the statistical data on which north carolina officials have been willing to rely.several examples demonstrate this.
first,as noted by the majority,the data in the study regarding contracts awarded by the department division offices is statistically invalid.while the majority of contract dollars were handed out on contracts from the central office,the contracts represented approximately of the total value of state contracts.the program affords privileges to women and minorities in bidding on such contracts,despite the fact that no evidence whatsoever indicates that these contracts were awarded in a disparate manner.
second,the state asserts that a decrease in subcontracts going to and enterprises during a period when the program was suspended indicates that,absent preferences for minorities and women,discrimination would take hold.but the significance,if any,in the drop in the utilization of minorities and women during suspension of the program is a classic problem.if the underlying market for contracting in north carolina was discriminatory prior to implementation of the program,then the drop in utilization during suspension of the program may have reflected the fact that the program had helped remedy discrimination.if,on the other hand,the underlying market was nondiscriminatory,then the drop in utilization merely reflected the removal of the unfair competitive advantage given to minorities and women.see states paving.state dep t of,cir.
we can not resolve this question because no evidence exists regarding whether disparities existed at the time the program first began.it might be surmised that fewer and businesses will receive subcontracts on department projects if the program is suspended.but it can not be determined whether this change would reflect a return to a fair,competitive status quo or a discriminatory marketplace.moreover,regardless of how we interpret the drop in utilization during the period of the program suspension,it is rather bold,and perhaps even invalid,to assume that the market will react to suspension of the program in the same manner that it did years ago.
in addition,even if we had reason to believe that the drop in utilization during suspension of the program indicated potential discrimination in the marketplace in the early,it still could not justify the continued use of and policies.affirmative action is only appropriate to remedy past or ongoing discrimination,not to stave off discrimination that might hypothetically occur in the future.see hayes state law enforcement officers ass n,cir e ven when race can be taken into account to attain a balanced work force,racial classifications may not be employed to maintain a balanced work force emphasis in original.should intentional discrimination appear without this program,future remedial efforts could become appropriate.but we should not ratify the government use of race in perpetuity based on mere concern that such a result might occur.were we to do so,we would send the terrible message that our society has been and always will be divided by race,that racial hostility is an inevitable consequence of a heterogeneous society,and that government can not escape classifying its people by the color of their skin.
third,as the majority rightly points out,the evidence regarding state subcontracting practices indicates that women are grossly over utilized.the state nonetheless contends that women too must be benefited by affirmative action.to justify this aspiration,the state relies on evidence of purported discrimination in the private building construction industry without demonstrating how that evidence justifies a need for affirmative action in awarding public contracts from the department of transportation.because this evidence comes from a wholly dissimilar contracting market,it is inappropriate to rely on it to draw inferences regarding department contracting.moreover,the evidence from the private building sector is at best mixed and therefore fails to justify affording privileges to women.
fourth,when considering only valid statistical that are actually tied to contracts awarded by the division central evidence fails to justify the sweep of preferential privileges afforded to each minority group and women in the program.while each of the minority groups were shown to be underutilized in terms of subcontract dollars relative to their market share,only african americans were underutilized at a statistically significant level.croson,at,inference of discrimination justifying remedial affirmative action may only be drawn by evidence of gross and significant disparity.the majority recognizes that native americans were underutilized at a confidence level of approximately,a result that is not,in most conventional statistical analyses,considered statistically significant.similarly,the regression analysis concluding that firm experience,capacity,and the like were not responsible for the shortfall in contract dollars supported a finding that the disparities were a result of race and not other factors only with respect to african americans.in other words,with regards to native with asian americans and hispanic study could not conclude with confidence that the shortfall in contract dollars was not due to mere chance,a lack of firm capacity,or some other explanation.
the department,perhaps recognizing these infirmities,chose to fill the gaps in its data regarding public contracting by relying on inapplicable and therefore invalid data from the private sector.this demonstrates the structural weakness of the entire program.it is indeed disquieting that the state believes that such a flimsy approach can justify governmental decisionmaking based on race and gender.the majority wisely rejects the state approach and properly holds the state to the burden of demonstrating a strong basis in evidence leading to an inference of discrimination in department subcontracting.croson,at.but the fact that north carolina has come to federal court and unrepentantly relied on,in some cases,completely to support its conjecture that discrimination is persistent in state contracting might well lead us to conclude that the state is now more interested in seeking a post hoc justification for a program designed to engineer proportional race and gender representation,regardless of discrimination,than in conducting a,inquiry into whether remedial efforts are necessary.
i do not doubt that north carolina program was conceived with the benign motive of preventing discrimination in public contracting.but its approach of making contracting decisions in favor of minorities and women,based on the flimsiest of evidence,runs the risk of actually creating and perpetuating discrimination.
while i would be more inclined to strike down the entire program as a violation of the equal protection clause,i am willing to allow,as the majority does,north carolina the opportunity to review and adjust its program in light of what we have written.
accordingly,i concur in the judgment.
i concur fully in the majority opinion in
