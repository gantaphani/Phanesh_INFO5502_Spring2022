background 
this dispute stems from a contract to design,install and maintain a telecommunication system the project for the naval weapons center in china lake,california.in,the navy issued a request for proposal rfp for the project.the project was to take place in two phases an implementation phase,during which the telecommunication system would be designed and installed and a maintenance and administration phase.during the implementation phase,the contractor would first prepare a station design plan sdp.after the sdp was approved by the navy,the contractor would install the system.thereafter,cutover the time when the new telecommunication system replaced the old one and implementation would occur.if certain performance goals were met,system acceptance would occur days after cutover.
the dispute here involves one aspect of the contract relating to the implementation phase.when the rfp issued,the navy did not know the exact quantities of certain types of equipment that it would need.this equipment was listed under contract line item number clin.offerors were instructed to provide fixed unit prices for items under clin.the navy would then multiply the unit prices by its best estimate of quantity to arrive at a bid for the project.the rfp stated that the total price for clin shall be redetermined based on the quantity of equipment actually installed,pursuant to the approved sdp.at.thus,the amount of equipment included under clin in the original offer was to be adjusted to reflect the actual amount of equipment installed according to the sdp,and the final price was to be adjusted accordingly.the rfp asked potential offerors to quote prices for the implementation phase under four different methods of purchase straight purchase,lease to ownership lto,lease with option to purchase,and straight lease.
casi submitted an offer in accordance with the rfp and was awarded the contract for the project in september.the navy opted to purchase the implementation phase of the contract at the lto price of to be paid in monthly installments.under the lto option,the navy installment payments included an interest component.
casi prepared its initial sdp in january of.it was approved by the navy a few months later.soon after,the parties executed several price modifications that increased the tentative lto price for the implementation phase to.this new tentative lto price was based on quantity estimates for several clin items.the parties recognized that a number of these quantity estimates were significantly higher than the actual amount of equipment that would be installed under the approved sdp.in january casi requested the navy to reduce the lto price to reflect these overestimates.in april and may of casi performed an audit to ascertain the amounts of equipment actually installed and submitted a letter to the navy,recommending that the lto price be adjusted downward to million.the parties met in may to modify the lto price but were unable to agree to a modification at that time.thereafter,the navy issued a unilateral modification that,among other things,stated that the lto price for the implementation phase remained at approximately million.cutover occurred on april,and system acceptance occurred on may.
in order to fund its expenditures during the implementation phase,casi obtained a loan from its parent corporation.the full balance of this loan was due upon system acceptance.however,under the project contract,casi would only begin to receive installment payments for the implementation after system acceptance.to repay the obligation to its parent corporation on system acceptance,casi sought to obtain a loan under which it would assign the navy installment payments to the lender.while the navy at no time directed casi to obtain financing,it refused to make payments to the lender unless the invoices exactly matched the official contract price of approximately million.casi concluded that it could obtain financing only if it borrowed the full amount of the existing contract price.casi borrowed a principal of approximately million,an amount equivalent to the may contract price of approximately million,once interest over the lto term was added in.the approximately million that was borrowed exceeded the principal amount of the equipment actually purchased under the sdp.the excess borrowed funds were placed in an account.the interest rate on the deposited amount was far lower than the cost of borrowing from the lender.
after system acceptance,the navy began making monthly payments of about approximately of the official contract price of approximately million to casi lender.this continued until october when the navy finally issued a unilateral modification reducing the lto price to,a net decrease of approximately million curiously,casi,which had earlier insisted that the navy reduce the contract price,objected that the lto reconciliation was erroneous,and the navy had no authority to unilaterally reduce the contract value.contel,slip op.at.at this time the navy had made installment payments.after making another installment payment in november and a partial payment in december,the navy concluded that it had repaid the entire adjusted contract price and ceased making installment payments.following the navy refusal to pay the remaining installment payments,the lender demanded payment from casi.casi negotiated a new payment schedule with the lender,which required it to pay the lender an additional,representing interest owed on the funds borrowed in excess of the final contract price,less the interest casi earned from the deposit of these funds prior to the determination of the final contract price.
on february,casi submitted a certified claim to the contracting officer co for,which as it explained represented the additional interest costs it suffered as a result of the navy failure to reconcile the lto price in.in a final decision dated march,the co denied this claim because there was no agreement for reimbursement of any costs incurred by casi for financing and h ow a contractor finances its efforts is not the government concern.at.the co also blamed the delay in finalizing the lto price on casi failure to promptly provide an accurate accounting of the equipment installed.at.further,the co determined that the navy had actually overpaid casi by and demanded repayment in this amount.
several months later,casi submitted a second certified claim that asserted alternative theor ies of recovery.at.specifically,casi argued that the lto price should not have been adjusted downward because it was set at a fixed price of approximately million,regardless of the quantities of equipment installed.casi also urged that it was entitled to the administrative costs and attorney fees it incurred as a result of the navy wrongful cessation of payments to the lender.at.both of these theories were also rejected,and casi appealed the denial of both certified claims to the asbca.
on june,the asbca issued a decision in favor of casi on its first certified claim.the board held that the navy had a duty to reconcile the lto price no later than system acceptance and its refusal without a valid excuse to do so was a breach of its duty to cooperate and a breach of contract.contel,slip op.at citations omitted.it rejected the navy arguments that various unresolved obstacles prevented it from reconciling the lto price by system acceptance,because it found that reconciliation,reduction of the lto price based upon the quantity of equipment actually installed,could have been accomplished based on the information in the sdp and that casi was eager to complete the reconciliation.id.at.
the board further held that the rule did not bar recovery on the first certified claim,which represented the additional interest costs casi suffered as a result of the navy failure to promptly reconcile the lto price.the asbca recognized that generally the rule bars the recovery of interest on delayed or defaulted money payments from the government,but that the rule can be waived by including a provision in a government contract for the payment of interest that is affirmative,clear cut,and unambiguous.contel,slip op.at quoting united states point hotel.according to the board,the rule had been waived in this case because t he payment of interest was an integral part of the parties contract.id.this was evidenced by the intentional inclusion of a component for interest in the required monthly installment payments.id.because the payment of interest was required by the contract itself,the asbca held that the rule did not bar recovery on casi first certified claim having decided that casi was entitled to recover on its first certified claim,the asbca remanded to the co for a determination of quantum.
the board dismissed as duplicative the alternative theories of recovery presented in casi second certified claim.it explained that the second certified claim did not present new claims,but merely present ed an alternate method of measuring casi claimed damages and supplement ed the first certified claim to specifically identify certain costs allegedly incurred in repairing its financial relations when the navy ceased making the payments called for by the payment schedule.id.at.
the navy appealed the asbca decision on casi first certified claim.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review legal conclusions of the asbca without deference.rumsfeld applied,applied companies.the interpretation of a contract by the asbca is a question of law that is reviewed without deference on appeal.metric constructors aeronautics and space.the board findings of fact are accepted unless they are fraudulent,or arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.hamm assocs.england.
we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear this case.casi contends that the decision of the asbca was not final because it decided only entitlement and did not reach quantum.we disagree.
although a refers to an appeal from a final decision,our cases have repeatedly held that the concept of finality in this context is a flexible concept.brownlee dyncorp,dyncorp.under section a,t he relevant inquiry in determining finality is the scope of the contracting officer decision,for this determines the extent of the contractor right of appeal and the board jurisdiction.id.quoting dewey elecs.united states.in cases where the contracting officer had not yet reached issues of quantum and thus,only entitlement was before the board,we have repeatedly found the board decision on entitlement final and within our jurisdiction under section a.see,at applied,at dewey,at.as we noted in applied companies,where the contracting officer decided only entitlement and the board thereafter decided entitlement and remanded to the parties regarding quantum,the board decision was final and thus appealable.at.
in this case,we have jurisdiction under section a because the scope of the co decision was limited to the question of entitlement.casi argues that the co decided quantum because,in addition to rejecting casi claims,the co determined that the navy had overpaid casi in the amount of.however,the navy overpayment claim against casi was separate from casi claim for damages against the navy because the co determined that casi was not entitled to damages,the co never determined the quantum required by casi claims.the asbca recognized the limited scope of the co decision.it stated that o nly entitlement is before the board and remanded to the parties to negotiate quantum.contel,slip op.at.thus,we conclude that the asbca decision was a final decision on the issue of entitlement.there is jurisdiction under section a to hear the navy appeal 
on the merits,the navy argues that casi is seeking interest damages that are barred by the rule.the rule bars the award of interest damages on a claim against the united states.library of congress shaw,d shaw.the appellant contends that the asbca erred by inferring a waiver of that rule.we agree with the navy that the rule is applicable here and has not been waived.
casi urges that the rule does not apply because t he interest casi seeks is not interest on a substantive claim,but the cost of money that the government agreed to pay in order to defer payment.br.of appellee at.
the rule is an aspect of the basic rule of sovereign immunity.see shaw,at.see also smith principi.it has been construed to apply broadly to claims for interest.in shaw the supreme court explained that 
t he force of the rule can not be avoided simply by devising a new name for an old institution t he character or nature of interest can not be changed by calling it damages,loss,earned increment,just compensation,discount,offset,or penalty,or any other term,because it is still interest and the rule applies to it.
shaw,at.quoting united states mescalero apache tribe,alteration in original.the rule has been held not only to bar the recovery of interest on substantive claims against the government,see,smith,at,but also interest costs incurred on money borrowed as a result of the government breach or delay in payment,see,hedin constr.united states,see also komatsu united states,ramsey united states,myerle united states.for example,in hedin,our predecessor court held that,like interest on substantive claims against the government,i nterest paid on bank loans made because of financial stringency resulting from a breach by the government of a contract between it and the borrower is not recoverable.at.the court noted that had the plaintiff used his own money and so lost the interest which it might have earned for him,the claim would not have differed in principle.id.quoting myerle.at.
so too,the rule is applicable to casi claim.casi claim states that the claimed amount represents the interest on funds which casi urged the navy to prepay in the spring of.at.in other words,casi is seeking to recover the interest it paid on the extra money it was forced to borrow as a result of the navy delay in reconciling the lto price.in the absence of a waiver,the rule bars the recovery of such interest damages against the government.see,hedin,at komatsu.at ramsey.at myerle.at.
in the alternative,casi argues that the rule has been waived by provision of its contract with the navy.the rule can be waived only by specific provision by contract or statute,or express consent by congress.shaw,at.internal quotation and alterations omitted see also united states point hotel.stating that a provision requiring the government to pay interest must be affirmative,and unambiguous.while there is no argument that the rule was waived by statute,casi argues the navy waived the rule because the lto price under the contract included an interest component.we disagree.
the claim here is not for the interest component of the lto price,which the navy has already paid.instead,casi claims it is entitled to the additional amount of interest owed to the bank as a result of its financing.br.of appellee at.the inclusion of the interest component in the lto price is not an affirmative,and unambiguous agreement to pay for additional interest accrued on a loan as the result of the navy breach.see,at.to the contrary,the contract is silent as to the method by which casi was to fund the project.
the asbca found that the navy insist ed that the amount borrowed reflect the current lto contract amount and that casi decision to proceed as it did by borrowing more money than it knew it was actually due was a reasonable response.contel,slip op.at.the basis for these findings is less than clear.casi does not explain how the navy insistence on the rendering of invoices corresponding to the may contract price compelled casi to borrow more money than it knew it would ultimately be paid under the contract.however,even assuming that the board findings were correct,
