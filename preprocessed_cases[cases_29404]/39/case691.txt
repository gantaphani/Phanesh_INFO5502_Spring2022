this appeal concerns a claim for damages for the breach of an alleged contract between the united states department of the interior federal government and the state of california for the sale of federal land located in california.us ecology asserts that it is entitled to recover as a beneficiary under the alleged contract.the trial court,however,held on summary judgment that no contract had been formed.the government agrees,and also argues that us ecology lacks standing to appeal.we do not reach the issues of contract formation and standing to appeal,however,because we hold that us ecology failed to raise a genuine issue as to whether the federal government intended for any third as us have rights under the alleged contract,and therefore we must affirm.
background 
in,the california department of health services cdhs began planning for the development of a radioactive waste llrw disposal facility in california.california law required that the facility be built upon land owned by the state.us ecology has constructed and operated such facilities throughout the united states.llrw includes waste that has been exposed to nuclear radiation,such as certain types of medical and industrial waste.cdhs is the agency of the state of california responsible under california law for managing the disposal of llrw under california law,the operator of the planned llrw facility must first be licensed by cdhs.see cal.health safety code.once cdhs has determined that a license applicant will likely satisfy the eligibility requirements for a license it designates that applicant as the.cal.health safety code a.in,cdhs identified us ecology as its for the llrw facility.cdhs did not actually grant the license to us ecology until september,after the alleged formation and breach of the contract at issue.
in january,the federal government and the state of california agreed to terms for the sale of a parcel of acres of federal land in the ward valley region of california the site,and us ecology paid the purchase price of to the federal government on behalf of the state of california.on january,secretary of the interior manuel lujan issued an internal memorandum to document his decision to sell the site to california.on january,secretary lujan issued a record of decision rod informing the public that the federal government had decided to sell the site to california.the issuance of an rod was the penultimate step in the sale process,the final never execution and issuance of the land patent,which would have passed title to the site to california.governor bruce babbitt then succeeded secretary lujan at the department of the interior.on february,secretary babbitt rescinded the january rod.the federal government refunded us ecology payment,and refused further requests by the state of california to transfer ownership of the site.
on january,us ecology brought suit against the federal government in the united states court of federal claims under the tucker act,a.us ecology subsequently joined cdhs as a plaintiff.us ecology sought damages as a beneficiary under a contract allegedly formed in january between the federal government and cdhs for the sale of the site.the contract,it argued,was manifest from secretary lujan january memorandum,the rod,and the payment.us ecology claimed damages included million in costs incurred in preparation for the for environmental studies required by the federal government.us ecology also claimed lost profits,profits it would have earned if the land had been transferred and us ecology had been licensed and had built and operated an llrw disposal facility.
the court of federal claims granted summary judgment to the federal government,holding that its contracting authority had been divested by the entry of a temporary restraining order tro on january,in a separate action in district court brought by environmentalists under the endangered species act to prevent the sale.us ecology,united states,slip op.at.march.
us ecology appeals the judgment,although cdhs does not.we have exclusive jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.as noted,the trial court jurisdiction was grounded in the tucker act.we heard oral argument on february.because us ecology failed to submit evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue as to its alleged rights as a beneficiary under the alleged contract,the united states is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and the summary judgment in favor of the federal government is affirmed.
ii.analysis 
we review the grant of summary judgment by the court of federal claims as we do any grant of summary judgment,de novo.costain coal,united states.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.thus,summary judgment is proper only when no reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
the federal government asserts that us ecology lacks standing to appeal because,even assuming that there is a contract,us ecology is not a beneficiary.we agree that the issues of standing and beneficiary status are intertwined.we hold that us ecology has no rights under the alleged contract.therefore,the summary judgment must be affirmed,even assuming standing is otherwise established.
beneficiary rights 
us ecology can prevail on appeal only if it shows that there is in dispute a genuine issue of material fact as to its status as a beneficiary with rights under the alleged contract.us ecology argues that the alleged contract between california and the federal government created enforceable rights in us ecology as a beneficiary.as evidence that the federal government intended for it to benefit from the alleged contract,us ecology relies upon the cooperative course of dealings amongst itself,california,and the federal government that resulted in the alleged contract.it is undisputed that us ecology worked cooperatively with the federal government and cdhs to perform the expensive environmental testing of the site required under federal law.however,neither federal law nor the department of the interior required that the tests be performed and paid for by us ecology.cdhs and the chose that arrangement independently.us ecology also points to the undisputed facts that the federal government was aware that us ecology was cdhs and that us ecology paid the purchase price for the site on behalf of california.once again,the federal government did not require that us ecology pay the purchase price.
us ecology also relies upon a memorandum of agreement between the federal government and us ecology,dated april,in which us ecology agreed to reimburse the federal government for its costs associated with the proposed sale of the site.this agreement states that it was made pursuant to,which allows the federal government to charge applicants for the reasonable costs associated with the processing of a federal land transaction.us ecology asserts that applicants refers to us ecology and that this is evidence that the federal government deemed it to be the real party in interest,and therefore an intended beneficiary.this assertion,however,is contradicted by the agreement itself,which does not refer to us ecology as the applicant,but instead specifically states that the california state lands commission is the applicant for the land sale.
us ecology also relies upon secretary lujan internal memorandum of january,the rod,and the draft land patent for the site as evidence that the sole purpose of the land sale was to allow us ecology to develop the planned llrw disposal facility on the site.us ecology also relies upon an affidavit by secretary lujan in which he states that g iven the public importance of the ward valley project and the fact that development of such a facility was required by federal laws interior had decided to support california efforts by conveying suitable land for the project.in his affidavit,however,secretary lujan refers to us ecology only as cdhs contractor,and none of his statem
