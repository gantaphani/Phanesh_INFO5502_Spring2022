opinion of the court 
this appeal arises from a sentence and a order of restitution imposed on appellant barbara lessner following her pleas of guilty to counts of wire fraud,defense procurement fraud,and obstruction of justice.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
factual and procedural background 
from until,lessner was a procurement contracting officer,team leader,at the defense supply center in philadelphia dscp.the dscp is one of several field offices of the defense logistics agency dla,a federal agency whose mission is to procure supplies for the military.as a warranted contracting officer with authority to sign contracts on behalf of the dla,lessner oversaw a team of nine buyers in a group responsible for awarding contracts of less than for the purchase of biomedical and hospital equipment.
the dscp competitive bid process is highly regulated.upon receiving a request for supplies,dscp personnel solicit quotes from contractors and compare those quotes against prices in federal supply schedule price lists and on the medical electronic catalog system ecat if the dscp can not obtain a quote lower than the price listed in the federal supply schedule,it must use the federal supply schedule contract.similarly,if all quotes exceed the price listed on ecat,the dscp must obtain the product from the ecat distributor.when the lowest bid has been identified,the warranted contracting officer will sign a contract and fax it to the winning distributor.
authority to award dla contracts is limited to warranted contracting officers,such as lessner.buyers lack authority to sign contracts that commit government funds,but are otherwise fully engaged in the procurement process.as the supervisor of nine buyers,lessner personally received all requests for supplies and distributed them among her buyers.the buyers then solicited bids by telephone,documented the quotes,and reported their findings to lessner.lessner completed the process by reviewing the buyers research and signing contracts.
in august,at a bar in king of prussia,pennsylvania,lessner met and struck up a conversation with another patron named scott watanyar.lessner told watanyar about her job at the dscp,and watanyar told her that he worked for a small distributor of electronics equipment,pamir electronics corporation pamir,which was owned by his mother.pamir did not manufacture any of the products it sold,and watanyar had no previous experience with federal government contracts.nonetheless,he told lessner,he would like the opportunity to do contract work for the department of defense.
that same month,lessner told her team of buyers about pamir.she identified watanyar as pamir point of contact and urged her buyers to use him.none of the buyers had previously heard of pamir.they quickly noticed,however,that lessner was engaging in whispered conversations with someone from pamir,perhaps watanyar,and observed that she was unusually involved in and knowledgeable about the details of pamir transactions.
in september,one of lessner buyers,noticed that lessner had awarded contracts to pamir even though it had not tendered the lowest bid and despite the fact that the products could have been obtained at a lower price if purchased directly from the manufacturers.reported the pamir contracts to dscp supervisors and began to question lessner as to why pamir was being awarded the contracts.lessner,in response,stopped distributing work to for a period of time.meanwhile,she continued to award contracts to pamir,forging signature on contract folders when,in fact,had done no work on those contracts.
on may,special agents from the defense criminal investigative service dcis obtained copies of all pamir contracts from dscp files.between august and april,pamir was awarded contracts having a total value of approximately million.dcis investigators confirmed that contracts were consistently awarded to pamir when it was not offering the lowest price.a analysis performed on of the contracts revealed that pamir,with lessner approval,overcharged the government by.
the dcis investigation revealed a pattern of contracts awarded to pamir for products that lessner knew or should have known were available at lower prices from the manufacturers.among those contracts were contracts for products manufactured by,a regular distributor to the dscp whose prices were significantly lower than those offered by pamir contracts for a product manufactured by brenner metal products corporation that the dscp could have obtained for less than half of pamir price contracts for products manufactured by nonin metal,that the dscp could have obtained at a lower price from government marketing international,nonin authorized distributor,who advertised its lower price on the federal supply schedule price list contracts for products manufactured by allied healthcare products,whose lower price for eight of those contracts was featured on the federal supply schedule price list and two contracts for products manufactured by kendro laboratory products,a company historically willing to quote directly to the government at established,lower government prices.as a procurement contracting officer,lessner was knowledgeable about the federal supply schedule price list and was responsible for identifying a distributor past pricing history.in at least one instance,when brenner metal president phoned lessner to point out that the dscp could realize significant savings by ordering directly from brenner metal,lessner reportedly stated,you receive enough government contracts,do look over my shoulder.
in july,lessner supervisor reviewed the pamir files and confirmed that lessner had awarded contracts to pamir for products that she could have purchased at lower prices on ecat.one such award came just days after that same supervisor had advised lessner that the product in question was available through ecat.
on august,agents from the dcis and the fbi executed a warrant authorizing the seizure from pamir offices of documents and computer files relating to department of defense contracts.the search revealed that lessner had,on several occasions,faxed documents to watanyar describing the prices that pamir competitors were bidding for certain products.some of the documents bore handwritten notes from lessner to watanyar specifying the price he should bid to receive a particular contract,or advising him to submit a lower bid.lessner also sent watanyar copies of the federal supply schedule price list,which showed the prices of competing suppliers.
lessner buyers subsequently reviewed dscp files for pamir contracts.they discovered that,while each of the pamir files appeared to bear the signature of the buyer who purportedly worked on the contract,lessner had in fact forged the buyers signatures on of the files.for several of the remaining files,lessner had simply presented the file to the buyer with pamir quote and instructed the buyer to designate pamir as the winning bidder.
for each of the pamir contracts,funds were wired from a united states government account in columbus,ohio,to pamir bank account in exton,pennsylvania,via the federal reserve bank federal automated clearing house in atlanta,georgia.lessner was able to circumvent the more stringent procedures governing the award of contracts worth more than by improperly awarding multiple contracts to pamir on the same day for the same item.she also placed fraudulent justifications in some of the files to conceal the fact that the items in question could be obtained elsewhere at lower cost.
on august,the same day that agents conducted their search of pamir offices,dcis special agents interviewed lessner at work.they escorted her to her workstation,advised her that they were about to conduct a lawful and authorized search,and instructed her to remove only personal items from her work space.as she was gathering her personal effects,agents saw lessner throw a current united states government appointment book in the trash can.she also removed a stack of files from a locked file cabinet and placed them on her desk.the agents then escorted her off the dscp compound.
as she was leaving,the agents saw lessner place a call on her cell phone.when they returned to her workstation to conduct their search,they found two of lessner buyers at her desk.although both buyers denied having received a call from lessner asking them to remove items from her desk,one of the buyers,cynthia verderame,was not truthful.as it turned out,lessner had in fact called verderame and instructed her to remove a folder from lessner desk and destroy it,adding that they are accusing me of doing something wrong.verderame retrieved the folder as requested,handed it to a fellow employee,and instructed that employee to place it in the trunk of verderame car.later that evening,verderame reviewed the folder,which contained copies of lessner emails,faxes,handwritten notes,and customer letters,and tore the contents into pieces.verderame subsequently pled guilty to one count of destruction and removal of property to prevent seizure.
during the august,interview and in subsequent interviews,lessner attempted to conceal the extent of her relationship with watanyar.initially,she denied having met watanyar or knowing him in a personal capacity,and denied knowing how he came to do business with the dscp.after agents escorted her from the dcis compound,however,they discovered watanyar home address in the appointment book that lessner had discarded.at a subsequent interview,lessner again denied having met watanyar or providing contract information to him.when agents then confronted her with documents they had recovered in their searches,she claimed to have met watanyar once,but denied a personal relationship.during a november interview,lessner admitted that she sent bid information to promote a business,but again denied any personal relationship.when shown phone records evidencing nearly calls between her and watanyar,including calls to and from her home and personal cell phone,she admitted a personal friendship,but denied any romantic involvement.agents independently learned that lessner and watanyar had gone out socially on several occasions.
on april,a federal grand jury returned a indictment charging lessner with ten counts of wire fraud,in violation of eight counts of defense procurement fraud,in violation of a and e two counts of destruction of records in a federal investigation,in violation of and one count of destruction and removal of property to prevent seizure,in violation of a.on september,lessner pled guilty to all counts.
defense counsel thereafter moved for a downward departure under based on lessner diminished capacity.at the december,hearing on the motion,lessner proffered expert testimony that she suffered from major depressive disorder at the time of the offenses.she also cited anxiety resulting from her husband heart attack and the september terrorist attacks.the government,through its own expert witness,conceded that lessner suffered from present depression as a result of the criminal proceedings,but maintained that she did not exhibit any symptoms of mental illness at the time of her offenses which,we note,were well underway both before the heart attack and september.the district court also heard testimony from a dcis special agent and several of lessner.it subsequently denied the motion.
at the december,sentencing hearing,the district court found,as had the presentence report psr,that lessner total offense level was,which included a enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to.the court denied lessner request for a reduction in the offense level for acceptance of responsibility under,finding that her case was not among the class of extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both and may apply.finding a criminal history category of i,and noting the advisory guidelines range of to months,the court imposed a sentence of months incarceration,followed by three years of supervised release.the court also ordered mandatory restitution of and a mandatory special assessment of.this appeal followed.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a and.
ii.discussion 
lessner raises numerous issues on appeal,four of which were not raised before the district court.we will discuss each of the issues in turn.
whether the district court committed plain error when it accepted lessner guilty plea 
lessner argues that the district court should not have accepted her guilty plea before questioning her on her statements to the court that she was under the care of mental health professionals and taking pills a day.at.because no contemporaneous objection was raised,we review the adequacy of the plea colloquy for plain error.fed.b united states vonn,d.
plain error exists only when an error was committed that was plain,and that affected the defendant substantial rights.united states stevens,cir.even then,the decision to correct the error is discretionary.united states campbell,cir.a court of appeals should exercise its discretion only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.stevens,at quoting united states olano,d.
by entering a plea of guilty,a criminal defendant waives his or her constitutional rights to be tried by a jury,to confront his or her accusers,and to exercise the privilege against.parke raley,d.like all waivers of constitutional rights,a guilty plea must be made voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently,with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.bradshaw stumpf,d quoting brady united states,d.a district court commits reversible error by accepting a defendant guilty plea without creating a record to show that the plea was knowing and voluntary.boykin alabama,d.
rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure sets forth the standards governing the acceptance of guilty pleas.it does not,in itself,embody a constitutional directive.see united states timmreck,d noting that a violation of rule is neither constitutional nor jurisdictional.rather,it is designed to assist the district judge in making the constitutionally required determination that a defendant guilty plea is truly voluntary,and in producing a complete record at the time the plea is entered of the factors relevant to this voluntariness determination.mccarthy united states,d.a district court may not accept a plea of guilty without first personally addressing the defendant,under oath and in open court,and ascertaining that the plea is voluntary.b.the court must also ascertain that the defendant understands the rights that he or she is waiving by pleading guilty,and that there is a factual basis for the plea.b.even if a court deviates from these requirements,the error is harmless if it does not affect substantial rights.h.
at the hearing,defense counsel advised the district court that his client was presently seeing three professionals.in response to the court questioning,lessner testified that she was seeing glass once a week miriam adler twice a week and pierce once every two weeks.at.the court then inquired whether lessner was taking any medication,prompting the following exchange 
pills a day.
and what type of pills are they 
i taking lexapro,buspar,ativan,ambien and lorazepam.
and did you take any of these medications this morning 
i took two.
q.what two did you take 
two ativan.and what if any well let me ask you this way.does the taking of this medication affect your ability to understand and appreciate what is taking place in this courtroom this morning 
a.it just puts me in perspective,i understand.
q.when you say,puts you in perspective 
calms me down.
q.so that you can deal with the circumstances 
yes,your honor.
very well.are you presently under the influence of any drugs or medication or alcoholic beverage of any kind other than the two that you have indicated that you have taken this morning 
id.at.the standard rule plea colloquy followed,at the conclusion of which the court found that lessner was fully competent and capable of entering an informed plea and that her guilty plea was a knowing and voluntary plea supported by an independent basis in fact containing each of the essential elements of the offense.id.at.
lessner argues that the district court made only a limited and superficial inquiry into the medications that she was taking while failing to ascertain their dosages or whether she had taken any of them the prior day,week or month.lessner br.she urges us to take judicial notice of the significance and possible effects of her medications id,and contends that the court accepted a answer when it inquired whether she could understand and appreciate the proceedings.the government maintains that the court questioning was sufficient to establish the knowing,intelligent,and voluntary nature of the guilty plea.
having carefully reviewed the transcript of the plea colloquy,we conclude that the district court developed an adequate record to satisfy not only the procedural requirements of rule,but also the constitutional requirement that a guilty plea be knowing,voluntary,and intelligent.the court inquired into the medications that lessner was taking and those she had taken that morning.it asked whether the medications she had taken that morning affected her ability to understand the proceedings,and posed several questions to elicit further information.it also inquired whether lessner was presently under the influence of any other medications or controlled substances.we are satisfied that lessner answers to those questions were responsive.we are likewise satisfied,as was the court,that lessner conduct and demeanor throughout the hearing amply demonstrated the voluntariness of her plea.
the cases on which lessner relies to the contrary are unavailing.in united states cole,cir,the defendant testified at his hearing that he had some drugs last night,but the district court,seemingly unfazed by this revelation,inquired only whether the defendant understood what the court had said.id.at see also id.at finding the record ambiguous as to whether the district court even noted the defendant admission of recent drug use.had the court specifically inquired into the defendant drug use,it would have learned that the defendant had ingested of heroin and of cocaine between the previous evening and that morning.id.at.under such circumstances,we held,the court owed a duty of further inquiry,and the absence of such inquiry precluded a finding that the defendant guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.id.at.here,however,the court did inquire into the medications that lessner had taken on the day of the hearing,as well as their effect on her ability to understand the proceedings.where a district court has made such an inquiry,the sufficiency of which is later contested,cole provides little guidance.
lessner also cites the court of appeals for the first circuit decision in united states,cir,an opinion purporting to follow cole.in,a defendant with a known history of drug use,depression,and attempted suicide advised the court at the hearing that he had taken ativan,halcion,and restoril within the past hours.the court then asked,ativan,is that a drug to control your nerves or something,and the defendant responded,yes,sir.no further inquiry was made into the defendant medication the court merely asked whether the defendant understood the proceedings and the maximum penalty that he faced,and whether counsel were satisfied that the defendant was competent to plead guilty.the court of appeals held that 
the judge did not inquire what dosages of ativan,halcion and restoril parra had ingested and what effects,if any,such medications might be likely to have on parra.the judge,though plainly making a substantial inquiry,did not probe deeply enough.we join the third circuit in cole,and hold that the judge was obligated by rule to ask further questions.
id.at footnote omitted.in a footnote,the court observed that the obligation of further inquiry was enhanced by parra recital in a prior hearing of a history of drug use,depression and attempted suicide.id.concluding that rule had been violated,the court reversed and remanded for findings on whether the error was harmless.
is distinguishable both as to the severity of the defendant history of mental illness and the brevity of the court inquiry.there,just one week before the hearing,the court held a competency hearing at which the defendant testified to his drug use,depression,and attempted that enhanced the court duty of inquiry under rule.yet at the hearing,the court made only passing inquiry into the purpose of just one of the three prescription medications that the defendant admitted to having taken in the previous hours,while failing to inquire whether any of the medications impaired the defendant ability to understand the implications of his guilty plea.
here,by comparison,lessner advised the district court that she began seeking counseling for mental illness only after she committed the offenses,and did not report any history of more serious conditions,such as drug abuse or attempted suicide at.see united states stewart,cir distinguishing cole where nothing about drug abuse was brought to the attention of the trial judge.the court ascertained that she was only under the influence of two ativans at the time of the hearing,and that that medication did not impair her ability to understand the proceedings see united states morrisette,cir distinguishing on the ground that the district court in that case failed to make any inquiry into whether the medication affected the defendant ability to comprehend united states,cir the critical question is whether the they have a capacity to impair the defendant ability to in fact done so on this occasion.lessner clearly demonstrated her understanding of the proceedings throughout the hearing,to the satisfaction of both the court and defense counsel.see at.we find,therefore,that the court sufficiently discharged its duty under rule to inquire into lessner capacity to enter a knowing and voluntary plea and,in fact,found that she did just that.
whether the district court committed plain error by finding an adequate factual basis for lessner pleas of guilty to the obstruction charges 
lessner argues,next,that the district court erred in accepting her guilty pleas to the obstruction charges because there was not an adequate factual basis for the pleas.as she did not raise this argument before the district court,we review for plain error.
lessner pled guilty to counts and of the indictment,charging her with obstruction of justice in violation of,the provision of the act of.the plain language of the statute requires the defendant to have destroyed evidence knowingly and with the intent to impede an investigation or case see united states wortman,cir.count related to lessner disposal of the appointment book containing watanyar home address count,which also charged aiding and abetting under,related to lessner cell phone call to verderame.
at the rule hearing,after reciting the elements of,the district court questioned lessner as follows 
my next question would normally be and is at this particular point in time,did you commit these offenses,these two counts,counts and 
now,i hear encouragement from the back,i do know if that is your mother or your sister or some relative or friend,whatever the case may be,i want your response,not theirs.
a.in my day planner,i had everybody number and address in there.when i was being walked out,i just threw it in the trash because i knew i was not coming back.i did realize that his watanyar number was in there either.
my question to you,is did you commit this offense.
i put it in the trash can.
at.the court subsequently asked whether lessner and her counsel had reviewed the government plea memorandum.defense counsel responded that he reviewed the memorandum with his client,and that e verything there is correct.id.at.the court then asked lessner whether you likewise will stipulate to facts that are contained in the guilty plea memorandum that is stated by the government as to what they would be prepared to prove against you if this matter were to proceed to trial,and lessner responded,yes,sir.id.she then entered her pleas of guilty.
lessner argues,with regard to count,that her express disclaimer of a critical element of the crime precluded the district court from accepting her guilty plea.rule b requires a district court,before entering judgment on a guilty plea,to determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.b.a district court need not,however,be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of a defendant guilt to accept a plea of guilty it need only find sufficient evidence in the record as a whole to justify a conclusion of guilt.united states cefaratti,cir.see generally north carolina alford,d permitting court to accept defendant guilty plea over protestations of innocence.the court may make that inquiry by looking to the defendant own admissions,the government proffer of evidence,the presentence report,or whatever means is appropriate in a specific long as the factual basis is put on the record.cefaratti,at quoting united states smith,cir see also united states trott,cir indeed,an otherwise valid guilty plea may be properly accepted even if the defendant during the colloquy denies factual guilt,so long as a factual basis is adequately provided by other sources.thus,there is no violation of rule where a district court finds a factual basis for the guilty plea from the evidence in the record,notwithstanding the defendant protestation of factual innocence.see united states king,cir finding no violation of rule under such circumstances.
there was more than sufficient evidence of lessner guilt to permit the district court to accept her guilty plea to count even were we to assume that she disavowed an intent to impede the dcis investigation.lessner stipulated that dcis special agents advised her she was under investigation and was to remove only personal items from her desk.she falsely denied knowing watanyar while contemporaneously discarding the appointment book containing his home address.although she also denied knowing that watanyar information was in the book,she had no trouble recalling that everybody number and address was in there.at.from the record before it,the court could and did find a factual basis for the plea.id.at expressly finding an independent basis in fact containing each of the essential elements of the offense.lessner rule challenge to her guilty plea on count,accordingly,fails.
lessner challenge to the district court acceptance of her guilty plea to count also fails.lessner entered a guilty plea to count,but asserted that she did ask anyone to destroy anything.at.even if that assertion were correct which,according to verderame,it was not,it did not constitute a disavowal of an essential element of the crime.lessner admission to calling verderame and asking her to remove a folder from her desk,even if not to destroy the folder,was an admission to knowingly conceal ing documents.this admission,coupled with lessner stipulation to the facts contained in the guilty plea memorandum and other facts of record,provided an adequate factual basis to justify the court acceptance of her guilty plea to count.
lessner also challenges the factual basis of her guilty plea to count,charging her with destruction or removal of property to prevent seizure in violation of a and as does count,count relates to lessner cell phone call to verderame that resulted in the removal and destruction of the folder from lessner desk.conviction under a requires the intent to prevent seizure,gasho united states,cir,and lessner contends that there was neither a search warrant nor circumstances providing her with notice that the folder in question was subject to imminent seizure.
there is ample evidence in the record that when lessner asked verderame to remove the folder from her desk,she knew that it could and probably would be immediately seized.again,she stipulated that dcis special agents informed her that they were about to perform what she concedes was a lawful and authorized search,and that she was to remove only personal items from her workstation.she further stipulated to removing a stack of pamir files from a locked filing cabinet and placing them on her desk before being escorted off the dscp compound,an act fully consistent with the expectation of an imminent search or seizure.she then called verderame and asked her to remove a folder from her desk,supplying context to this request by adding that they are accusing me of doing something wrong.acting at lessner behest,verderame removed the folder,lied to investigators about doing so,and destroyed it later that evening.there was a sufficient factual basis for lessner guilty plea to count.
whether the district court erred by failing to grant a reduction in the offense level for acceptance of responsibility 
the district court,following the recommendation of the psr,applied a upward adjustment,pursuant to,for the obstruction of justice charged in counts through.lessner does not contest this adjustment.the court denied,however,lessner request for a reduction in the offense level for acceptance of responsibility under.lessner contests this denial.we review factual findings underlying the denial of a sentencing guidelines reduction for acceptance of responsibility for clear error,and reverse only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states boone,cir united states felton,cir.
section a of the guidelines provides that a district court may grant a reduction in the offense level i f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense an additional reduction is available under subsection b if certain conditions are met.the a reduction contemplates a defendant truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense s of conviction,and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under relevant conduct.cmt.a.a defendant who falsely denies,or frivolously contests,relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.id.entry of a guilty plea will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility,although it will not entitle the defendant to an adjustment as a matter of right.id.cmt.see also united states mcdowell,cir stating that sentencing court must consider the totality of the situation when determining acceptance of responsibility.of significance here,c onduct resulting in an enhancement under obstructing or impeding the administration of justice ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.there may,however,be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both and may apply.cmt.the sentencing court findings in this regard flow from its unique position to evaluate a defendant acceptance of responsibility and are entitled to great deference on review.id.cmt.
at the december,sentencing hearing,following extensive testimony and argument,the district court denied the adjustment,finding that lessner had failed to demonstrate the existence of an extraordinary case warranting adjustments under both and.at.lessner contends that this was error.citing cases from the courts of appeals for the sixth and ninth circuits,she posits that when the obstruction is limited to the very early stages of a criminal proceeding,and a defendant subsequently accepts responsibility,the case is extraordinary within the meaning of application note.see united states gregory,cir united states hopper,cir.
one,albeit important,flaw in lessner argument is that her obstructive conduct continued well beyond her actions on august.two weeks after asking verderame to remove the folder from her desk,lessner called verderame to confirm that she had done so.there is also evidence that as late as november,lessner continued to mislead investigators about the extent of her relationship with watanyar.moreover,she made no efforts to inform authorities of the nature of the information contained in the folder that verderame destroyed,and concealed key information from her own mental health expert.
but apart from whether and how long her obstructive conduct continued,even at sentencing lessner admitted,at most,to having made a mistake and failed to demonstrate much if any acceptance of personal responsibility for her actions.
the witness i thought it was going to be something good i would be doing.i did think it was a criminal act.believe me,i never did anything wrong in my whole life,and i never intended to do anything to myself or hurt anybody like these girls.
the court why would you tell your friend to destroy the documents if you did know it was a criminal offense 
the witness they told me i was going to industries were blind,and it was the agent.i was devastated.i went into shock when she showed me the badge.i did think it was a criminal act.i did not.if i did,i would have resigned and left,believe me.i not a bad person.
at.when the court pointed out that lessner made a number of mistakes,a number of contracts,she deflected blame by portraying herself as a victim of circumstances,even though those circumstances arose only after she began her fraudulent activities.
the witness i was under stress.we had.i was trying to get the work out.i was not thinking clear.i was not thinking clear,believe me.if i was,i would be sitting here before you,sir.i would not be sitting here before you if i was thinking clear and putting myself through this at a perfect time of my life.i did mean to hurt anybody.i did think it was a criminal act,believe me.i would do something like this.i would do it 
id.at.y ou have an explanation for everything that comes down,the court responded,b ut it still does justify or explain away your criminal conduct.id.at.lessner repeatedly refer to her conduct as a mistake while refusing to admit that she harmed anyone other than herself.
the witness i did kill anybody or hurt anybody.i hurt myself.i hurt myself.i did want to hurt anyone else,believe me.i would have done that.i would have done that.i do want to not the kind of person that hurts somebody.i always try to do the best for somebody,and this just destroyed my life.it has destroyed my life,believe me.it live through a peep hole.i do even want to go out of the house.i do want to do anything 
the court lessner,why did you think about that before you committed these offenses 
the witness i did not think it was a criminal act.believe me,believe me.i know it is.i know it was.i was just rushing.i was under stress.i was worried about him.when he got sick,my whole life was ruined.
the court why is it that when you were rushing and under stress,it only related to this one person,this one contractor,this one person that was 
the witness we had so much work at our office at that time.he was sending confirmations that the items were shipped and was making my job a little easier.i did not think i was doing something wrong.i was getting confirmations.you know,that all.i did mean to hurt anyone.i did.i would never want to go through this again.please forgive me.please,please forgive me.i beg of you.i beg of you.please,please.
id.at id.at describing harm to lessner staff.the court also noted lessner apparent lack of contrition at sentencing.id.at.
lessner ongoing denial of conduct for which the district court previously found a factual basis,and her invocation of the september attacks and her husband december heart attack as justification for fraudulent acts that began in august,are inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.see cmt.a.according great deference to the court finding that this is not an extraordinary case,id.cmt.nn,it is absolutely clear that no error was made.
whether the restitution order was improper for lack of findings 
the district court ordered restitution of,with due within six months of the imposition of sentence,another due within twelve months of the imposition of sentence,and the balance due in monthly installments upon lessner release from custody.noting the psr observation that she lacked the ability to also pay a fine,lessner argues that the court erred by failing to explore her financial circumstances on the record before ordering restitution.although she suggests that she raised this issue in her p leas for consideration of a factors lessner br,the record shows no contemporaneous objection to any failure to make findings see at.we,therefore,review for plain error.united states diaz,cir.
under,full restitution is mandatory when an identifiable victim has suffered pecuniary loss and the defendant is convicted of an offense against property under title,including an offense committed by fraud or deceit.a,c see also a.where there has been an award of full restitution,f requires the sentencing court to specify in the restitution order the manner in which,and the schedule according to which,the restitution is to be paid,with reference to the financial resources and other assets of the defendant,including whether any of these assets are jointly controlled projected earnings and other income of the defendant and any financial obligations of the defendant,including obligations to dependents.f.we have held that a district court commits plain error when,having ordered full restitution,it fails to state on the record the manner and schedule of payments after taking into account the defendant financial resources.united states coates,cir.the district court obligation to comply with f may not be delegated to the probation office.id.at.
here,unlike coates,the district court specified a payment schedule in its restitution order 
y ou shall pay a lump sum payment of at least within six months of the date of the imposition of the sentence,and another lump sum payment of at least within months of the imposition of this sentence.after you released from custody,you are to pay the remaining restitution in monthly installments of to the united states defense logistics agency.
at.the court did not,however,explicitly state on the record that it had considered lessner financial situation.we must decide whether this omission constitutes plain error.
the plain error that we found in coates was at least as much a consequence of the district court failure to specify a payment schedule as it was of the court failure to state that it had considered the defendant financial situation.coates,at holding that the district court committed plain error by failing to satisfy the requirements under f and implicitly delegating responsibility to fix restitution payments to the probation office.in coates,we noted that when ordering full restitution,the district court is required to consider the financial resources,projected earnings,and financial obligations of the defendant.at.we did not expressly hold,however,that a district court must do so on the record,and we do not so hold now.rather,we hold that where,as here,the record evidences a court consideration of the defendant financial without express requirements of f are satisfied.see united states jones,cir holding same.see also app.at ordering restitution payments totaling exactly of the psr unchallenged calculation of lessner net worth.united states pruden,cir examining record where district court did not explain the basis for imposing special condition of supervised release united states warren,cir stating that in the absence of express findings on the record,the imposition of a special condition of probation may be affirmed if the record contains a sufficient evidentiary basis supporting the condition.
but even if we were to find that the district court committed plain error by failing to make the express findings lessner suggests it was required to make,there is no error here that seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.stevens,at quoting olano,at.the record is clear that lessner has the ability to make the restitution payments.the psr,to which she did not object,lists assets which include in cash,life insurance,stocks,and money owing in jewelry and art and in real estate holdings,including three rental properties and a vacation home.although the psr also reflects liabilities of,lessner net worth of exceeds the combined payments of.the record also reflects that lessner and her husband have a monthly income of,far exceeding the monthly restitution payment that she must make upon her release from prison.
