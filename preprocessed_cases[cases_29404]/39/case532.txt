the armed services board of contract appeals denied grumman aerospace corporation grumman superior knowledge claim against the united states air force air force.in re grumman aerospace,cch march,aff on,cch june.the board also denied grumman any damages under the jury verdict method on of its sustained claims.in re grumman aerospace,cch february.because the board correctly denied grumman superior knowledge claim and use of the jury verdict method for damages,this court affirms.
in the early,the air force sought to modernize the avionics avionics modernization program or amp for its fleet of aircraft.in,the air force began this project by awarding general dynamics corporation gdc a contract to modernize the avionics of one model within the fleet,namely the amp.the air force also decided to offer another amp contract for the e and models e amp.the competition for the e amp ran concurrently with the amp project.in re grumman aerospace,cch at march,aff on,cch june.
on june,the air force announced the e amp procurement in the commerce business daily cbd.in that announcement,the cbd advised potential offerors about the availability of data 
government will provide a library of available data.additionally,required data for interface shall be the responsibility of the contractor via associate and subcontractor agreements.previous performance of this task was by general dynamics fort worth division for the aircraft.data from that acquisition will not be available at time of proposal preparation or award.emphasis added 
id.after the cbd announcement but before release of the request for proposal rfp,grumman e amp proposal manager attended two dinner meetings on the amp procurement.at the first dinner meeting,grumman manager sought assurances about the fairness of the e amp procurement.at the second dinner meeting,the manager obtained general information about problems with the ongoing gdc amp contract.id.
on january,the air force issued the e amp rfp.in the rfp,the air force identified the data for the preparation of proposals 
competition data library 
avionics modernization program competition data library has been established sic and is being maintained at logistics center.this library contains limited sic engineering and technical data,and will be maintained from rfp release until contract award.the competition data library also referred to as data library will be provided to the successful offeror at contract award.
b.this library contains the following categories of data 
e and engineering drawings 
e and aircraft technical orders 
e and system commodity technical orders 
e and tctos 
amp group b drawings and specifications 
computer program software specifications 
aircraft configuration status records 
other data required to define the aircraft or its system.
c.this library will be complete,to the best of the air force ability,at rfp release.all data that is in the library will be available to all competing contractors on an equal time,reservation basis.data which is not available through the data library will not be provided by the government to any contractor.any data added to the library after rfp release will be entered into a log including a description of the data,identification number and the date received.every two weeks a copy of the log describing the new data will be provided to each of the bidders.new data will be considered additive older revisions will be maintained throughout the period of operation of the library.
id.furthermore,the rfp included clause,in pertinent part 
government provided 
a.the government in no way warrants the data contained in the amp data library.the government will not reimburse the contractor for any cost incurred as a result of using data provided in the data library or allow a schedule slippage due to defects in the data provided.
id.at.according to the record,grumman fully understood that the air force gave no warranties about the data in the library.
in february,grumman circulated an internal memorandum to its proposal team.the internal memorandum also referred to clause 
section information obtained from the data library is not warranted due to the fact that the design is not frozen.this data is to be used at the bidders sic own risk.emphasis added 
on may,grumman and gdc,the only two bidders,submitted their proposals for the e amp contract.grumman approach depended to some extent upon the use of the operational flight program ofp code and data under development for the ongoing gdc contract.although the rfp directed each offeror to provide,as part of its proposal,a list of required government furnished property gfp,grumman did not list any ofp software from the concurrent contract.in other words,grumman did not notify the air force that it expected to receive data from the gdc project.
after receipt of grumman proposal,the air force issued the following inquiry to grumman 
para of the sow statement of work refers to data for gfp to be used during development.any such data required by the offeror must be identified as part of their proposal.request you provide a list of any data to be provided by the government which is in addition to that contained in the amp competition data library and the dates the data is required by.
id.at.thereafter,grumman requested,inter alia,paper copies of source code within days of award.however,the air force replied to grumman request as follows the government is reviewing that list.if the data is available,it will be provided.note regardless of the availability of the data,the requirement of the rfp,sow and sss system segment specification will not be affected.id.
grumman and the air force met on august,about the pending initial proposal.during this meeting,the air force informed grumman of possible significant mistakes in its proposal.the mistakes dealt with cost and pricing of engineering hours.on october,grumman and general dynamics each submitted a best and final offer bafo for the e amp contract.in december,the air force awarded the contract to grumman with an effective date of january.under the contract,grumman was to design,manufacture,and furnish kits to upgrade the avionics.id.
in early february,the air force conducted a conference.during this conference,the air force informed grumman about forthcoming data 
data.the government intends to be as helpful as possible in ensuring that adequate data is available.however,the rfp clearly stated that the data to be provided by the government was limited to the contents of the competition library.additional data must be obtained via the appropriate sub or associate contractors.
id.at.thereafter,the air force held a system design review from march to march.at the review,grumman indicated its concerns about receiving common software from the gdc amp contract.in response,the air force sent grumman magnetic tape copies of the gdc amp source code and specification information.however,in a letter accompanying the magnetic tape copies,the air force contracting officer cautioned grumman that the air force did not warrant this information 
the above data is being provided to grumman as a supplement to the information required to accomplish contract tasks.it is grumman responsibility to evaluate this data and determine its applicability.the government is not responsible for the accuracy of this data and under no circumstances should the data be interpreted as direction for the technical design.in particular,the software being provided is suitable for familiarization purposes only it contains numerous known errors.as soon as updated versions are available,they will be provided.it should be remembered that the source code baseline for the e amp consists of those ofps that are in effect at the conclusion of flight testing.
after the review session and this letter from the air force,grumman submitted a computer program development plan for air force approval on april.this plan suggested that the contract obligated the air force to provide data by a specific date.the air force sent a letter,dated june,to grumman concerning this plan.the air force contracting officer disapproved grumman plan and denied any obligation to supply dat
