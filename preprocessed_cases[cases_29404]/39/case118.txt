facts of wilkinson offense conduct relevant to the issues on appeal.
desc,a logistics agency of the united states department of defense,is responsible for procuring and posts,camps,and stations pc s aviation fuel supply contracts to service united states military and civilian activities throughout the world.in carrying out this responsibility,desc conducts a full and open,competitive procurement process with respect to each contract.competing offerors submit initial bids by a given date,which bids are then reviewed by desc.subsequently,competing offerors are permitted to submit best and final bids by a given date.to ensure fairness in the bidding process,competing offerors are not permitted to share initial or best and final bid information.
wilkinson convictions in this case stem from his criminal activities with respect to three aviation fuel supply contracts awarded by contracts and one pc s contract.in general,a single desc solicitation will contain line items for numerous airports within a broad geographical area,but offerors are not required to submit an offer with respect to each airport.rather,each airport may be awarded as a separate contract or,where a single offeror is awarded multiple airports from the same solicitation,a single contract for all such locations is awarded.desc awards pc s contracts for delivery of aviation fuel into authorized storage facilities at destinations world wide.
prior to desc issuances of the three bid solicitations involved in this case,wilkinson and christopher cartwright cartwright had far east russia aircraft services feras and aerocontrol,aerocontrol.the pair served as managing of each company,are citizens of the united states,and,at all times relevant to this case,resided in the czech republic.for ease of reference,we will treat feras and aerocontrol as a single entity and refer to it as.
beginning in february,wilkinson and cartwright entered into a consultancy agreement the consultancy agreement with matthew bittenbender bittenbender,an employee of direct competitor avcard,llc avcard,whereby bittenbender would secretively feed them avcard confidential bid information for various and pc s aviation fuel solicitations in exchange for money bittenbender had easy access to such information,because one of his primary job responsibilities for avcard was to prepare avcard bid packages for submission to desc.the consultancy agreement provided that,with respect to every location that bid would win through the aid of bittenbender,wilkinson would pay bittenbender a flat fee,plus ten percent commission on the profits.with respect to any pc s aviation fuel contract that would win through the aid of bittenbender,the consultancy agreement provided that wilkinson would pay bittenbender a percentage of the fuel sales.
desc issued the first bid solicitation at issue in february bid solicitation one.bid solicitation one pertained to aviation fuel supply with respect to airports throughout asia and eastern europe.after an amendment changed the initial due date,desc required initial bids to be submitted on april,and required best and final bids with respect to some airports to be submitted on or around the first week of august.ultimately,desc awarded aviation fuel supply contracts for seven locations under bid solicitation one.
the second bid solicitation at issue was issued in may,when desc a bid solicitation for an aviation fuel supply contract with respect to an airport in baku,azerbaijan bid solicitation two.desc awarded the corresponding contract to on or around may.
on or about june,desc issued the third bid solicitation at for a pc s aviation fuel supply contract with respect to bagram air field,afghanistan bid solicitation three.desc originally required initial bids to be submitted by july,but subsequently postponed the deadline to march.best and final bids were due by july.on august,desc awarded the corresponding contract to a company unaffiliated with named red star.had withdrawn from the bidding process prior to the final award.
with respect to bid solicitations one,two,and three,bittenbender fed wilkinson confidential information regarding avcard participation in the bidding process.wilkinson knowingly and willfully accepted such information with the intent to gain unfair advantages for in the respective bidding processes 
sentencing.
upon accepting wilkinson guilty plea to counts i,ii,and iii,the district court ordered the united states probation office to prepare a presentence report the psr for wilkinson.the psr submitted in response specified a base offense level of under the united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,ussg or the guidelines see ussg a an level enhancement on the basis that the loss in this case was at least,see id.b j a level enhancement because a substantial part of wilkinson offense conduct was committed from outside the united states,see id.b b a level reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a and an additional level reduction for acceptance of responsibility,in anticipation of a motion by the government to that effect,as agreed upon in the plea agreement,see id.b.all of this resulted in a total offense level of.when combined with wilkinson criminal history category of i,an offense level of produced an advisory guidelines sentencing range of to months imprisonment.additionally,the psr stated that,pursuant to c,wilkinson was eligible for not less than nor more than years probation.however,the psr also stated that because the applicable advisory guidelines sentencing range was in zone d of the sentencing table,wilkinson was actually ineligible for probation.see ussg,comment.ussg f.
wilkinson was originally scheduled to be sentenced on october.ultimately,he was sentenced on november,following a sentencing hearing.prior to such hearing,on october,the government submitted its initial sentencing memorandum to the district court,requesting that the district court sentence wilkinson to months imprisonment,the low end of the advisory guidelines sentencing range recommended in the psr.with respect to restitution due avcard under the mvra,the government submitted that avcard was due for its loss of bittenbender honest services and the balance for its losses from desc contracts not awarded to it because of wilkinson offense conduct with respect to restitution due desc under the mvra,the government submitted that desc was due for loss to desc from administrative costs in resoliciting and reawarding the contracts tainted by wilkinson offense conduct for loss to desc from higher spot fuel purchases and for loss to desc from higher contract prices on the reawarded contracts.the government sentencing memoranda had three attachments in the form of tables that pertained to the government actual pecuniary loss calculations with respect to desc.table was entitled loss to desc in administrative costs.table was entitled loss to desc from higher spot prices.table was entitled loss to desc from higher contract prices.
on october,wilkinson submitted his initial sentencing memorandum to the district court,seeking a sentence to be no greater than that to be given cartwright,who was already scheduled to be and was sentenced just nine days later on october.by the time wilkinson submitted his response to the government initial sentencing memorandum on november,wilkinson took the position that his advisory guidelines sentencing range should be to months imprisonment,based on an intended loss to avcard of,and that he should nonetheless receive the same sentence as did cartwright of years probation and hours of community service.wilkinson also took the position that avcard had sustained no actual pecuniary loss as the result of his offense conduct,reasoning that avcard estimated profit of with respect to the locations on which bid against avcard and won was entirely offset by avcard profits on untainted contracts awarded to it because of wilkinson offense conduct.of specific relevance to the issues on appeal,wilkinson took the position that desc had suffered no actual pecuniary loss as the result of his offense conduct and,therefore,desc was due no restitution under the mvra.according to wilkinson,desc did not sustain an actual pecuniary loss because,rebidding the contracts awarded to did not involve additional overtime or other avoidable costs attributable solely to the offense conduct.
wilkinson sentencing hearing lasted two days,november,with the primary focus on calculating avcard intended and actual losses the hearing only secondarily focused on issues with regard to desc actual losses.while desc actual losses are the primary subject of the present appeal,avcard losses,either intended or actual,are not at issue.
in support of its loss figures for desc,the government offered the live testimony of charles untiet untiet,who holds a in economics from stanford university he also testified that he has quite a bit of experience in the petroleum industry.untiet calculated desc actual loss from wilkinson offense conduct at,comprising three components of loss desc administrative costs of in preparing new bid solicitation packages for the contracts tainted by wilkinson offense conduct and in evaluating and reawarding untainted contracts desc costs of in procuring fuel on the open market using spot purchases between the time it cancelled the tainted contracts and the time it obtained untainted replacement contracts and,representing the difference in costs to desc between the tainted contracts and the untainted replacement contracts.untiet prepared tables,and,which were attached to the government initial sentencing memorandum.each table corresponded to one of the three components of desc loss identified by untiet.
with respect to the administrative costs to resolicit and reaward the untainted contracts,untiet testified that he obtained the information to create the table,labor costs from a personnel person at the desc.with respect to creating the table regarding spot fuel costs,untiet testified 
i got data on spot fuel sales from the desc.i asked them for each spot fuel sale record.what was the date,what was the quantity.what was the spot fuel price the desc paid.and what would have been the tainted contract price had it still been enforced.
in response to an immediate question by the government,untiet testified that the data that he obtained from desc was on actual spot liftings at each of these locations.with respect to creating the table regarding the increased costs to desc resulting from the difference in price for aviation fuel under the tainted contracts versus the untainted contracts,untiet consulted published pricing indexes and the contracts themselves.out of the eight untainted contracts,untiet concluded that desc paid more for aviation fuel under seven as compared to the tainted contracts.untiet also testified that desc resolicited and reawarded the contracts that had been tainted by wilkinson offense conduct,because desc has a policy not to deal with criminals whenever possible.at no time did the government produce,through untiet or otherwise,any of the underlying data on which untiet relied in order to perform his loss calculations or create tables,and.
at the sentencing hearing,wilkinson challenged the government proposed loss figures for desc on three basic grounds.first,glenn meyers meyers,a in economics from columbia university,testified in support of wilkinson position that desc suffered no actual pecuniary loss.according to meyers,untiet miscalculated desc increased fuel costs under the untainted contracts by assuming,unrealistically,that avcard would have performed under the contracts,but at prices.second,wilkinson argued the government had provided no documentary evidence to support its total loss figure.for example,with respect to the government loss figure regarding desc fuel purchases on the spot market,wilkinson pointed out that the government had not offered any proof,such as invoices,that desc had actually purchased aviation fuel on the spot market for airport locations that were the subject of the tainted contracts.for a second example,wilkinson contended that desc suffered no actual pecuniary loss in resoliciting bids for the tainted contracts,because desc employees are salaried,and there is no evidence that such employees performed overtime in order to carry out the resolicitations.
in rebuttal,the government contended that its expert witness testified that he reviewed all the underlying data from desc,including the actual liftings,including the hourly wage reports,and these various things to make his calculations,and that he presented a series of graphs that represented his conclusions as to loss.that evidence.see also government desc has the data,it provided it to untiet,he testified to the court.same thing as to the administrative calculations.additionally,the government argued that application note a v ii to ussg expressly permitted it to count as loss the monetary compensation that desc paid its employees for their time in resoliciting bids for the tainted contracts regardless of whether those employees performed such work during overtime hours.see ussg,comment.a v ii procurement fraud the case of a procurement fraud,such as a fraud affecting a defense contract award,reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative costs to the government and other participants of repeating or correcting the procurement action affected.
after considering the parties opposing positions on the actual pecuniary loss suffered by desc as the result of wilkinson offense conduct,the district court stated,in relevant part 
having heard the testimony from expert witnesses yesterday on both sides,and argument this morning,all of that has helped me to reach a conclusion with regard to an appropriate guideline loss calculation.i have to say that i found both of the expert witnesses to be knowledgeable,both to be credible,which is unusual when you have such diverging opinions about things.but i believe that each one of them presented their calculations and their opinions straight forwardly and as honestly as any fact finder could hope for.what i come away convinced of is that with respect to the economic issues that are involved in considering loss valuations in this particular matter,the complexities and the variables are uniquely difficult to analyze and evaluate in a meaningful way.
to support its proposed loss figures,of course,the government must satisfy me that those figures are proven by a preponderance of the evidence.that in my view,having heard a
