this is a breach of contract case.see united states winstar,d.the court of federal claims held that prior to any breach by the government,appellant admiral financial corporation anticipatorily breached the contract.the court of federal claims further held that,even if admiral did not anticipatorily breach the contract,admiral could not recover because it was not harmed by the government breach.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
two prior court of federal claims decisions in this case set forth the facts in detail.see admiral fin.united states.admiral fin.united states.we include here only those facts necessary for our decision.
in february,william lee popham contacted the federal home loan bank board bank board to discuss acquiring a failing savings and loan institution,or thrift.in exchange for acquiring ownership,popham offered to contribute assets to the thrift,including real estate,equity in a tax sale certificate business,marketable securities,and cash.the bank board suggested haven federal savings loan as a candidate for acquisition.in april,popham formed admiral financial for the purpose of acquiring haven.in august,admiral and haven entered into an acquisition agreement under which admiral agreed to contribute million in real estate and cash in order to bring haven into compliance with the bank board minimum capital requirements.the agreement was conditioned on the bank board giving admiral certain forbearances in connection with the regulatory oversight of haven.
in september,admiral applied for bank board approval of its merger with haven.after several iterations,the bank board deemed the application complete in february of.the bank board issued a resolution in april formally approving the merger.the resolution incorporated a business plan under which admiral agreed to liquidate the contributed real estate according to a schedule.the resolution also contemplated that the bank board would treat haven negative net worth as goodwill,an asset,rather than as a liability.haven initially recorded nearly million of goodwill based on its negative net worth.in may,additional terms were incorporated by letter into the resolution,including the bank board agreement to allow the goodwill to be amortized over a period of years using the method of depreciation.
in june,the bank board and admiral executed a regulatory capital agreement rcma.the rcma bound admiral to maintain a certain level of capital in haven,and it obligated admiral to make up any capital shortfall.the agreement provided that if haven capital fell below the level specified in the rcma,admiral would have days to infuse enough capital into haven to make up the shortfall.if admiral failed to make up the shortfall,it would be in default.
things did not go well for haven after its acquisition by admiral.in march,haven sold a portion of the contributed real estate at substantially below the appraised value that had been accepted by the bank board.in addition,the equity interest in a business that admiral had contributed to haven and had valued at million turned out to be valueless.by the end of march,haven was out of regulatory capital compliance by approximately.pursuant to the rcma,admiral was obligated within days to infuse enough capital into haven to make up the shortfall.admiral did not do so.instead,haven financial condition further deteriorated,resulting in a shortfall of approximately million by june.on july,the bank board provided admiral with an official notice of default.
according to the rcma,admiral was entitled to days from the date of the default notice to cure the default.on august,the bank board removed popham from his role as haven executive vice president and chief financial officer,but allowed him to remain a member of the haven board of directors at no compensation.on august,nearly a month into the day cure period,congress enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act,stat.firrea,which limited admiral ability to count haven goodwill as an asset and to amortize it over a lengthy time period.firrea,however,did not take effect until december,and as of september,haven was more than million out of compliance under the accounting methods.
in march,the office of thrift supervision ots,the bank board successor under firrea,placed haven in receivership.at that time,haven was more than million out of regulatory capital compliance under firrea.it was approximately million out of compliance under accounting methods.
in,admiral filed suit against the government,alleging,inter alia,that the enactment of firrea resulted in a breach by the government of its contract with admiral.the court of federal claims agreed,ruling on summary judgment that admiral and the bank board had an enforceable contract that the government had breached when it enacted firrea.admiral fin.united states.admiral i.after a trial,however,the court of federal claims held that admiral had anticipatorily breached the contract before the enactment of firrea,and hence the government was not liable for damages.admiral fin.united states.admiral iii.in particular,the trial court concluded that popham repeated disavowals of any intention to infuse capital constituted the effective rejection of any intention to honor the rcma before the notice and cure time expired,and that admiral did not have the capacity,irrespective of firrea,to revive its investment in haven.id.at.according to the trial court,admiral thus repudiated the contract prior to the enactment of firrea.id.the government accepted that repudiation,the trial court concluded,when the bank board removed popham from haven and took other measures that effectively stripped admiral of control over the management of the assets it invested in the thrift.id.
the court held that even if admiral did not anticipatorily breach the contract,admiral could not recover damages for the government breach because firrea did not cause it any injury.at.the court found that the plethora of evidence showed that the thrift was in such dire straits that it was failing under capital requirements.the failed capitalization plan,overvalued real estate holdings,and lack of a financial commitment by the initial investors contributed to the thrift decline and led ultimately and independent of the supervisory forbearance to its seizure.id.at.
the government argues that by the terms of its contract admiral assumed the risk of the regulatory changes brought about by firrea and that the enactment of firrea therefore did not breach the government contractual obligations.the government did not prevail on that argument in the trial court,but it advances the argument here as an alternative ground for affirmance.
in a section entitled miscellaneous provisions,the rcma included clause vi d,which provided as follows 
all references to regulations of the board or the fslic used in this agreement shall include any successor regulation thereto,it being expressly understood that subsequent amendments to such regulations may be made and that such amendments may increase or decrease the acquirors obligation under this agreement.
on its face,clause vi d contemplated that the government might alter the regulations governing the supervision of thrifts such as haven by agreeing to the clause,admiral acknowledged that its obligations might change if the regulatory regime changed.
in guaranty financial services,ryan,cir,the eleventh circuit found that an identical clause in the rcma at issue in that case shifted to the acquirer the risk of a regulatory change of the kind effected by firrea and the regulations promulgated pursuant to firrea.the court explained that the clause unmistakably warn ed guaranty that its obligations under the contract may be increased by subsequent regulation.id.the court held that the agencies,at the same time they made that promise of regulatory forbearances,also unambiguously warned guaranty that the rules might later change to guaranty detriment,and that b y signing the contract,guaranty took that chance,in effect wagering the chance that the rules would be changed against the potential return if they were not.id.the court analysis in guaranty,if applied in this case,would lead to the conclusion that admiral assumed the risk of a regulatory change such as the one brought about by firrea,and that the enactment of firrea and the promulgation of regulations pursuant to that statute did not constitute a breach of the government contractual obligations.
admiral asserts that guaranty is not binding on this court.while that is true,we accord great weight to the decisions of our sister circuits when the same or similar issues come before us,and we do not create conflicts among the circuits without strong cause.energy united states.
although recognizing that guaranty is contrary to its position in this case,admiral contends that this court decision in castle united states,disposed of any precedential force that guaranty financial may ever have had in this circuit concerning such a contract clause.according to admiral,castle construed language similar to the language in clause vi d in admiral contract as not shifting the risk of regulatory change to the acquirer.
we do not agree with admiral reading of our decision in castle.the court in castle addressed a takings claim made by a party that acquired a thrift with a promise of regulatory forbearances similar to those at issue in this case.at.the acquirer alleged that the enactment of firrea constituted a taking of its contract with the government.id.at.the court in castle disagreed and ruled that t he based takings claim fails because even assuming it was breached,the alleged contract did not create a reasonable expectation that the government would cease regulating the thrift industry,or any particular thrift therein.id.at.to support the conclusion that regulatory changes were common in the banking industry,the court referred to a clause in the contract similar to clause vi d in this case.id.the court then held that the government was not liable for a taking of the acquirer contract because the enactment of firrea had not deprived the plaintiffs of any remedy they previously had,including a cause of action for damages.id.
although the castle court ruled that the plaintiff retained the full range of remedies associated with any contractual property right they possessed,at,the court did not address what rights that full range of remedies included.in particular,the court did not address whether the contract shifted the risk of regulatory change onto the acquirer.castle did no more than state that,since firrea did not result in a taking of the acquirer contract,the acquirer could still pursue relief pursuant to that contract.thus,the passage in castle cited by admiral does not address whether the purported clause shifted the risk of regulatory change to admiral.to the contrary,the castle court expressly decline d to reach the issue of the government liability under the contract.id.at.castle therefore does not compel a result different from that reached in guaranty with respect to the issue.
the trial court in this case agreed with admiral and ruled that admiral did not assume the risk of the regulatory changes brought about by firrea.see admiral i.at.the court reasoned that interpreting the rcma to shift the risk of such regulatory changes to admiral would mean that admiral had bargained away any ability to enforce the government promises,which would result in no promise at all,thus rendering the contract illusory.id.at.for that reason,the court interpreted the provision as anticipating potential changes in the level of capital that thrifts must maintain,or perhaps some other aspect of regulatory compliance,but declined to interpret that provision as exposing admiral to the risk of sweeping changes in the bargained for method by which capital is accounted for by the bank board.id.at emphasis in original.
we disagree with the trial court analysis on this point.clause vi d does not contain any qualifications of the sort to which the trial court referred.the clause states that the government might make changes to the regulations that could increase admiral obligation under the contract.it does not limit those changes to increasing or decreasing the level of capital that thrifts must maintain,as opposed to changing the accounting methods the bank board requires.and as for the trial court concern that the government interpretation of the clause would render the contract illusory,the government reservation of the right to change the extent of its performance as to some of its promises does not render the contract illusory as long as the government has otherwise given consideration,as is plainly the case here.restatement second of contracts the fact that part of what is bargained for would not have been consideration if that part alone had been bargained for does not prevent the whole from being consideration.
the trial court relied on sterling savings united states,and southern california federal savings loan ass united states,as support for the proposition that the purported clause should not be interpreted to shift the risk of regulatory change from the government to the private party.admiral i.at.the contract at issue in sterling included language similar to the language of clause vi d in admiral contract.the sterling court read guaranty as not holding that the purported clause mandated that the risk of regulatory change was shifted to the plaintiffs.instead,the court in sterling ruled that the clause meant that the acquirer could be required to comply with regulations regarding maintenance of capital levels,payment of dividends,and reporting of deviations from the business plan,but that the clause did not alter the government obligation to allow the plaintiff to treat supervisory goodwill as an asset and amortize it over the period set forth in the contract.at.
we do not believe guaranty can be distinguished in that manner.the court in guaranty found that the language in question altered the government obligations with respect to the regulatory capital and amortization issues and shifted to guaranty the risk of firrea regulatory change with respect to those issues.the guaranty court interpret ed the contract to mean that guaranty had the right to treat its goodwill as regulatory capital and amortize it over a year period for so long as the statutes and regulations governing the area remained as they were when the agreement was signed.guaranty,at.
in the other case on which the trial court relied,southern california federal savings loan ass united states,the language of the purported clause was significantly different from the language of the clause at issue here.the clause at issue in southern california merely stated that the acquirer was obligated to maintain capital in compliance with existing or future regulations.at.the court in southern california held that,while the clause at issue in that case bound the acquirer to follow the regulations,it did not preclude a finding of breach by the government if the regulations changed.id.at.thus,the provision stated the obvious that the acquirer was bound by the law without providing for any shift of risk in the event of a change in the law.
language similar to that in the southern california contract was included in the contract at issue in california federal bank united states.the court in california federal bank,like the court in the southern california case,held that the contract language before it was sufficiently similar to the contract language at issue in united states winstar,d,to be governed by the supreme court conclusion that such language does not shift the risk of regulatory change to the acquirer.at.the language of clause vi d,on the other hand,is far more explicit with respect to the issue of regulatory change and makes clear that admiral obligations may increase or decrease under successor regulations.
the plurality opinion in winstar addressed contract language similar to the language of the contracts in southern california and california federal bank as follows 
the government also cites a provision requiring statesman to comply in all material respects with all applicable statutes,regulations,orders of,and restrictions imposed by the united states or by any agency of the united
