after a federal criminal investigation into corruption within maryland prince george county public schools pgcs,its chief executive officer,andre hornsby,was convicted of several counts of fraud,tampering with evidence,and obstruction of justice.at the heart of these convictions is hornsby involvement in securing two public contracts for school products and services.on appeal,hornsby raises a number of claims of error for the following reasons,we reverse the convictions of fraud and affirm the convictions of tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice.we vacate the sentences and remand the case for on the tampering and obstruction convictions.
this case arises from hornsby involvement in the consummation of two public contracts for school supplies and services,only one of which is at issue on appeal under this contract,pgcs purchased educational supplies and technology from the company leapfrog schoolhouse.
the leapfrog contract 
in may,hornsby suggested that pgcs establish a summer program for kindergarten students and use leapfrog products for the program.pgcs instructional technology chief contacted leapfrog maryland sales representative,debora adam,and requested a proposal for the summer program.adam sent pgcs a written proposal for leapfrog products worth approximately.pgcs did not act on the proposal.
on june,hornsby held an executive council meeting to discuss using one million dollars of unspent funds toward purchasing leapfrog products for the school district.the estimated cost of installing leapfrog products in classrooms was.wesley watts,the chief information officer for pgcs,forwarded the estimate to hornsby and told hornsby that he preferred to have eugene thornton,the director of purchasing for pgcs,speak with leapfrog regarding the purchase.hornsby watts indicating that he could get the same result for far less money.
the following day,hornsby met with his sienna owens,who was a leapfrog sales representative,and discussed pgcs interest in purchasing leapfrog products.although owens sales territory was exclusively in the state of virginia,she agreed to inquire about the purchase of the leapfrog products for pgcs classrooms for a cost of around.on june,owens hornsby with a proposal of the costs for the products.in turn,hornsby provided thornton with the substance of owens but deleted all references to owens.
the next day,owens bill davis,leapfrog director of sales for the northeast region,a final copy of the pgcs proposal.because adam was the maryland sales representative and typically would receive the commission for the pgcs sale,owens asked davis for adam most recent total in sales so that she could compute a commission share structure between herself and adam.on june,owens hornsby,requesting that he call davis to discuss the purchase order.that same day,hornsby spoke with davis and agreed to the purchase order he further told davis that owens had done a good job in positioning and selling leapfrog products to pgcs.later,pgcs issued a purchase order to leapfrog and paid the company for the products.
during this time,adam and owens agreed to split the commission from the pgcs contract.owens share of the commission amounted to.having received her share,owens testified that she gave hornsby a s a thank you for helping me with this deal and for helping me.it was the first time i had received a significant commission in connection with the help that he had given me,so it was a thank you gesture.
the federal investigation 
on october,the baltimore sun published an article that questioned hornsby and owens relationship and their involvement with the leapfrog contract.shortly after the newspaper probe,hornsby instructed watts to destroy any tapes of his pgcs.following this instruction,the pgcs specialists began to erase these tapes however,one specialist saved certain tapes containing hornsby and turned them over to the fbi after government agents executed a search warrant at the school system.
a day after the baltimore sun article,the fbi and the attorney office initiated an investigation into the leapfrog contract.as part of its investigation,the fbi instructed cynthia joffrion,an employee of hornsby private consulting business,to inform hornsby that her husband received a subpoena for hornsby computer files that were in her possession.on february,joffrion informed hornsby of the subpoena and that she possessed his computer containing information regarding the contract.hornsby instructed joffrion to get the computer out of there totally.supp.
this was not the first occasion that hornsby instructed joffrion to conceal evidence during a criminal investigation.four years earlier,hornsby was the subject of a new york state criminal investigation into his conduct as superintendent of the yonkers public schools in westchester county,new york,and an alleged theft of school computers.during this investigation,hornsby instructed joffrion,then a yonkers public school employee,to ship several computers to his relatives homes.during recorded phone conversations between hornsby and joffrion,hornsby encouraged joffrion to lie to the government about her knowledge of the theft.he also encouraged her to burn any paper that was connected with the computers.
hornsby also contacted owens during the leapfrog investigation.on one occasion,hornsby sent his daughter to travel to miami,florida,to meet with owens and instruct her to stick to the story.his daughter also gave owens a prepaid phone to use to communicate with hornsby.before owens was set to testify before the grand jury,hornsby called owens and told her not to cooperate with the investigation against him.the following day,owens testified before the grand jury,which returned the first indictment against hornsby.
pgcs board of education investigation 
after the release of the newspaper article,beatrice tignor,the chair of the prince george county board of education,called hornsby to ask him about the leapfrog contract and the allegations made within the article.hornsby told tignor that the allegations were untrue and that owens did not have a role in the contract.
under the belief that owens played no role in the leapfrog contract,tignor wrote to the board of education ethics panel asking the panel to examine two inquiries whether a conflict of interest existed when the school system purchased leapfrog products given that hornsby,as ceo,maintained a relationship with owens who did not do business with pgcs and did not handle the pgcs leapfrog purchase and whether hornsby was required to disclose his personal relationship with owens to pgcs when she did not work for leapfrog at the time his financial disclosure form was submitted.
both inquiries were based on board policies that governed hornsby as an employee of pgcs.pgcs policy governs conflict s of interest and prohibits employees from participating on behalf of the school system in any matter that would,to their knowledge,have a direct financial impact,as distinguished from the public generally,on them,their spouse,domestic partner,or immediate family member,or a business entity with which they are affiliated.another policy governed school official financial disclosures.the policy required an official to file an annual statement with the ethics panel disclosing any interest or employment that would constitute a conflict of interest and require disqualification from working on behalf of the school system,and to disclose any gifts received from any person having a contract with the school system,or seeking to do business with the school system.
although hornsby received a copy of the inquiries,he did not correct tignor mistaken belief that owens had nothing to do with the leapfrog contract.he later represented in his financial disclosure statement that he had not received any income from a person or business that was a party to an existing contract with the school system.
a month later,the panel answered both inquiries.in its opinion,there was no conflict of interest arising from the leapfrog contract,and further,hornsby was not legally required to disclose his personal relationship at the time of his financial disclosure statement,although he may have been required to do so under another ethical policy.
on january,the board hired the huron consulting company to investigate any ethical violations with respect to the leapfrog contract.as part of its investigation,huron interviewed hornsby with his lawyer present.hornsby stated that he had known owens for three years,that their current relationship was a friendship,and that she had lived with him when she was hired by leapfrog.he denied knowing that owens had any role in pgcs leapfrog contract.hornsby stated that he had not disclosed to pgcs his relationship with owens at the time of the leapfrog purchase because he believed it was not required by board policy.
on august,a grand jury returned an indictment against hornsby for twelve counts of wire fraud in violation of and and three tampering and obstruction counts in violation of b and.the jury trial began on october,and after days,the district court declared a mistrial.
on april,a second grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging hornsby with eighteen counts of fraud in violation of,and,two counts of witness and evidence tampering in violation of b,and one count of obstruction of justice in violation of.
the second jury trial began on june.at the close of the government,hornsby moved for judgment of acquittal on all counts.the district court denied the motion.the jury returned a guilty verdict on three counts of fraud counts,and.the jury further found hornsby guilty of two counts of witness and evidence tampering counts and and one count of obstruction of justice count.the jury found hornsby not guilty on one count of fraud count and one count of witness tampering count.the jury could not reach verdicts on the remaining counts.the district court sentenced hornsby to months imprisonment for all convictions to be served concurrently.
hornsby challenges his convictions for fraud,witness and evidence tampering,and obstruction of justice on several grounds.we first address whether the district court erroneous jury instruction on fraud requires the reversal of hornsby convictions.we then address arguments challenging the district court rulings with respect to the tampering and obstruction counts.
hornsby contends that his convictions for wire fraud must be reversed.he reasons that the jury instruction,the superseding indictment,and the government put forth a theory of guilt for fraud that has been disapproved by the supreme court in skilling united states,d.in skilling,the supreme court addressed the scope of the fraud statute,and held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague when properly interpreted to criminalize only fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived.id.at.it reasoned,construing the statute to extend beyond that core meaning would encounter a vagueness shoal,id.at,and thus rejected the government contention that also applied to cases cases where the employee has not disclosed a conflicting financial interest to the employer,id.at.
in light of skilling,the government concedes that the district court erred when it instructed the jury that it could convict hornsby for fraud based on a conflict of interest.it contends,however,that because hornsby did not raise this exact ground as an objection to the jury instruction,we must review the instruction for plain error.
we disagree.pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure d,hornsby timely objected to the jury instruction and adequately raised an issue with the theory of guilt for fraud.before the jury retired,hornsby counsel objected to the jury instruction and asserted that,as part of his objection,he was adopting and incorporating with specificity arguments made within his motion for judgment of acquittal.
the day before,hornsby counsel moved for judgment of acquittal and raised a challenge to the theory of guilt for fraud presented in the superseding indictment and the government.hornsby counsel asserted that the fifth amendment due process clause prohibit s a defendant from being held criminally liable in circumstances where the conduct was not clearly forbidden and we believe that the whole ethics thing is unconstitutionally vague.hornsby counsel then requested that the district court either grant the motion for judgment of acquittal or alternatively redact those portions of the allegations relating to anything pertinent to a conflict of interest or ethics panel misrepresentations or omissions.the district court denied the motion.
because hornsby timely objected to the instruction and took issue with the theory of guilt by reference to his rule motion,we find his objection preserved.united states ebersole,cir a claim of instructional error may alternatively be preserved by an objection in a directed verdict motion made pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure,before the jury retires.thus,we review the jury instruction for harmless error.skilling.at hedgpeth pulido,d per curiam finding review applies to an instructional error arising in the context of multiple theories of guilt.
in the instant case,the jury found hornsby guilty of three out of the eighteen fraud counts.all three counts are based on communications from owens to hornsby as part of their negotiations to secure the leapfrog contract with pgcs.because the findings of guilt were returned on a general verdict,we can not discern whether the jury relied on a conflict of interest in reaching its decision.see united states black,cir b ecause the jury returned a general verdict on the fraud counts,we can not be absolutely certain that it found the defendants guilty of pecuniary fraud as well as,or instead of,fraud.therefore,we must view the jury instruction in light of the evidence presented at trial to determine whether the erroneous instruction is harmless.united states hairston,cir.
we begin with the language of the instruction.the instruction charged that the jury need not consider whether hornsby received a financial benefit from a third party as part of the scheme or artifice to defraud pgcs and the board of education.the instruction read in part 
when an official fails to disclose a personal interest in a matter over which that official has power,the public is deprived of its right either to disinterested decision making or to full disclosure as to the official potential motivation behind an official act while an undisclosed financial benefit from such decision making may constitute a personal interest and such a personal interest as i described,a financial benefit need not be demonstrated in the case.that is they need not show that the individual benefited financially from the failure to render honest services.
it further charged the jury that a public official duty and honesty includes the duty to disclose and not conceal facts known to the official,such as a personal conflict of interest,id.emphasis added,and that the failure to disclose information may also constitute a fraudulent representation if the defendant was under a duty to make such a disclosure.based on this language,we can not ignore that the theory was interwoven throughout the district court fraud instruction to the jury.united states riley,cir.
what is more,the government argued and presented strong evidence to support the theory throughout its.the evidence showed that at the time the email communications were made,hornsby did not disclose to pgcs his conversations with owens to secure the leapfrog contract.indeed,hornsby acted to conceal the conflict by deleting all references to owens when he provided the director of purchasing with the substance of the communications.further,during pgcs investigation into hornsby involvement with the leapfrog contract,hornsby did not disclose his knowledge of owens involvement and denied that he had a direct role in the negotiations.
additionally,in its closing argument after the district court erroneous jury instruction,the government stated that one of the most important jury instructions in this case is the judge instruction on the definition of a scheme or artifice to defraud.the government continued 
he the judge told you that a public official owes citizens a duty to govern honestly,to govern impartially,must disclose and not conceal important facts about the conduct of the government affairs such as a personal conflict of interest.he told you that public officials may not deprive the public of its right either to disinterested itself or to a full disclosure as to the official potential motivation behind an official act.you ca have a conflict of interest and you ca conceal a conflict of interest.he told you it is not necessary to prove a personal benefit or a financial benefit to the public official,that the scheme is a crime regardless of whether it succeeds or it fails.
simply put,the defendant crime in this case is fraudulently participating in decisions where his business partner and his girlfriend had a stake and concealing it from the board,tignor,the ethics panel and huron,the board outside forensic auditors.
the government did present evidence that hornsby received a gift from owens as a thank you for helping her with the leapfrog contract.while a reasonable jury could infer from this evidence that hornsby scheme to defraud was all along a scheme with owens to receive a kickback from the leapfrog contract,we can not say with fair assurance that the jury convicted hornsby on this basis alone.taylor.union,cir.
in light of this evidence and the general verdict,we can not conclude that the erroneous jury instruction was harmless.accordingly,we reverse hornsby convictions of fraud 
hornsby raises six independent arguments that challenge his tampering and obstruction convictions.we address each argument in turn 
hornsby contends that the district court decision to admit evidence regarding his past conduct violated federal rule of evidence b.as stated before,this evidence involved hornsby attempt to obstruct a new york state criminal investigation into his alleged official misconduct.
we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.united states aramony,cir.
under rule b,other crimes,wrongs,or acts may be excluded if the evidence is admitted to prove the defendant bad character.however,this evidence is admissible for other purposes,including proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident united states queen,cir quoting.b.this circuit applies a test to determine the admissibility of prior acts under rule b.the party moving for its admission must show the evidence is relevant to an issue other than character is necessary in the sense that it is probative of an essential claim or an element of the offense is reliable and carries probative value that does not substantially outweigh its prejudicial nature.id.at.we also have explained that an additional protection against the pitfalls the r ule protects against,may be provided by a limiting jury instruction explaining the purpose for admitting evidence of prior acts.id.
with respect to the first and second prongs,the government presented this evidence in order to prove the element of intent.see queen,at.prior acts that are similar in nature to the charged acts have particular probative value in showing the person state of mind because the prior doing of other similar acts is useful as reducing the possibility that the act in question was done with innocent intent.queen,at quoting wigmore on evidence,chadbourn footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.here,the evidence underlying hornsby conduct with respect to the state investigation was similar to the evidence supporting the federal tampering counts.during the state investigation,hornsby tried to persuade joffrion to burn paperwork and conceal computers related to the alleged theft of yonkers public schools computers.likewise,during the federal investigation,hornsby instructed joffrion to conceal a computer.
this evidence was also reliable.the evidence consisted of an audio recording of hornsby and joffrion communications.hornsby argues that the audio recording was unreliable because the recording was uncorroborated and could be taken out of context.under prong three,e vidence is reliable and should be submitted to the fact finder unless it is so preposterous that it could not be believed by a rational and properly instructed juror.aramony,at quoting united states bailey,cir.an audio recording of hornsby telling joffrion to burn documents and conceal computers in the midst of a state criminal investigation is not so preposterous and unbelievable to make it unreliable.further,corroborating evidence to support the evidence is not required.united states hernandez,cir.
finally,the probative value of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.again,hornsby argues that the audio recording could be taken out of context and thus be unfairly prejudicial.the mere assertion that the recording could be taken out of context does not tip the scale in favor of the prejudice outweighing the probative value,particularly when there is no indication that the evidence would lead the jury to irrational behavior when considering the other evidence.united states masters,cir.further,we disagree with hornsby that the period between his prior acts and his charged conduct renders his prior acts tenuous and remote,and thus inadmissible,hernandez,at quoting united states cole,cir internal quotation marks omitted,particularly given the similarity between the prior and charged acts.notably,the district court instructed the jury that its consideration of this evidence was confined to hornsby intent with respect to the tampering and obstruction counts.thus,we find that the district court did not err in admitting this evidence.
next,hornsby contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for severance of the tampering and obstruction counts from the fraud counts.
we review a district court denial of a motion for severance for abuse of discretion.united states lighty,cir.
under federal rule of criminal procedure a,an indictment may charge a defendant in separate counts with or more offenses if the offenses charged are of the same or similar character,or are based on the same act or transaction,or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.however,a district court may sever the offenses charged if the joinder of the offenses appears to prejudice the party.a.
where offenses are properly joined under rule a,severance of the offenses is rare.united states cardwell,cir it is not enough for the defendant to show that severance offers him a better chance of acquittal.quoting united states reavis,cir.a district court should grant a severance under rule only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.id.quoting zafiro united states,d.we will not reverse a district court denial of a motion to sever unless there is a showing of clear prejudice.united states branch,cir.
here,hornsby has not shown clear prejudice in the joinder of these counts.these counts are all related to the same series of events hornsby involvement with the leapfrog contract and the subsequent investigations.as a result,joinder under rule a was appropriate.see united states mir,cir joinder of related charges is permitted to avoid needless duplication of judicial proceedings.
hornsby third argument is that the district court erred when it denied his motion in limine to suppress statements he made to joffrion who at that time was an undercover government informant.hornsby states that his counsel sent a letter to the government dated november,asserting hornsby constitutional rights as well as his desire not to have any contact with government agents.he contends that the government blatantly disregarded these rights by instructing joffrion to speak with him and in doing so violated his fifth,sixth,and fourteenth amendment rights.
