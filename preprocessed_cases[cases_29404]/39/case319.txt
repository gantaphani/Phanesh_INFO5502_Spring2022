relator john king,appeals the dismissal of this qui tam action brought under the false claims act act.the qui tam provisions of the act permit private individuals to sue on behalf of the united states those persons or entities who allegedly have presented false or fraudulent claims to the federal government as one of its jurisdictional hurdles,the act prohibits suits based on publicly disclosed information unless the relator or person suing is an original source of the information.e a.the principal issue presented is whether the relator king qualifies as an original source under e b.agreeing with the district court determination that the plaintiff can not show he meets the requirements for an original source,we affirm the district court judgment dismissing this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
as part of his residency training program at oklahoma state university college of osteopathic medicine,king was employed as a resident physician in orthopedic surgery at the defendant hillcrest health center,hillcrest from may of until his termination in march of.in march of,king filed a federal action,king hillcrest health center,et,king i,asserting claims for relief under federal civil rights statutes and state law.he alleged in part that he was terminated in retaliation for reporting that the defendants were committing medicare medicaid fraud.the parties to king i settled that suit in january,and it was dismissed with prejudice in february of.
while king i was pending,king filed this qui tam action under seal on february,alleging that the defendants had conspired to submit and had submitted false or fraudulent claims for medical services and procedures billed under medicare medicaid.the united states declined to intervene,and the district court in june of ordered the complaint unsealed and served.the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiff first amended complaint arguing,inter alia that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because king i constituted a public disclosure of information and king did not qualify as an original source of the information,and that the dismissal with prejudice of king i bars this action under the doctrine of res judicata.besides opposing the defendants motions,the plaintiff moved for leave to file a second amended complaint.
district court order dismissing on res judicata grounds 
considering first the challenge to its subject matter jurisdiction,the district court found the proposed second amended complaint to have sufficiently alleged that king had direct and independent knowledge of the defendants fraudulent schemes and had gained this knowledge from his own efforts and personal observations.a plaintiff claiming to be an original source also must allege that he voluntarily provided the relevant information to the federal government prior to filing the qui tam suit.with respect to this pleading requirement,the district court concluded 
because the defendants have not contested king allegation that he did voluntarily provide the information prior to filing this lawsuit,the court finds for purposes of rule b that king has sufficiently alleged that he is an original source of the information and that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over his claims.
ii.at.turning away the subject matter jurisdiction challenge,the district court granted the motions to dismiss on res judicata grounds finding an identity of causes of action in king i and the qui tam suit.the district court also denied king motion to amend on futility grounds.
first rule e motion and amicus curiae brief 
king filed a rule e motion asking the court to reconsider its res judicata analysis.in response,the united states of america united states filed an amicus curiae brief concurring with the relator position on the res judicata issue and notifying the district court that it has no record of the relator providing any information to the government on which the allegations in the qui tam are based at any time prior to february,the date the complaint was filed.ii.at.the district court promptly followed up with a brief order saying it had reviewed the united states amicus curiae brief and giving the parties an additional eight days to file responses,if they so choose,to the arguments,authorities and statements contained therein.ii.at.
in the additional time provided by the district court,the defendants filed their response on february,and king filed none.the defendants addressed not only the res judicata arguments but the government statement that king had not provided it with information before filing the qui tam complaint.the defendants pointed out that the district court had been misled by the allegation in king proposed second amended complaint that he had provided the government with a statement of all material evidence and information when he filed his original qui tam complaint.while the district court had characterized and denied their prior facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction,the defendants maintained the government filing suggested facts showing the lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the defendants called on the court to consider the government brief in dismissing this action pursuant to.h.prior to the district court second dismissal order filed seven days later,king did not seek leave to file a reply or supplemental brief.
district court second dismissal order 
on february,the district court vacated its prior order of dismissal on res judicata grounds and dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court held 
the defendants contested only the timeliness of king disclosure of information to the government in connection with king i.the defendants did not contest the timeliness of the disclosure the qui tam action,and the court found king had sufficiently alleged for purposes of the pending motions to dismiss that he was an original source of the information,and that the court therefore had subject matter jurisdiction over his claims.
the united states has now advised the court and opposing counsel in its amicus curiae brief that it has no record of king providing any information about the allegations giving rise to this lawsuit prior to february,the date the original complaint was filed.in light of the government clarification about king actions,the court concludes that reconsideration of its order is necessary to the extent the court now finds king did not provide the information on which the allegations in the qui tam action are based prior to filing the fca action.king therefore does not qualify as an original source,and,consequently,this action is barred,spectrum,at fca specifically bars all qui tam actions based on publicly disclosed information unless person bringing action was original source of information.
ii.at.relying on.h,the district court based its jurisdictional ruling on the suggested facts stated in the government amicus curiae brief rather than the allegation appearing in king proposed second amended complaint or the statement in king memorandum of law filed on november,that he had provided detailed information organized in notebooks to the attorney in oklahoma city and to the department of justice prior to filing this action.ii.at.
