petitioner carol briley is an archivist,at the national archives and records administration agency harry truman library library in independence,missouri.she claims that the agency declined to upgrade her position and that her duties were improperly reduced in retaliation for engaging in protected whistleblowing activities.the merit systems protection board board rejected briley claim,finding that briley had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies,that the agency did not take or fail to take a personnel action,and that in any event,the agency had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions regarding briley even absent her protected whistleblowing activities.we hold that petitioner has exhausted her administrative remedies,that briley change in duties which resulted from the library restructuring did not constitute a personnel action,and that substantial evidence supports the board determination that the agency would not have reclassified briley position as a or created and promoted her to a new position even absent her protected whistleblowing activities.we therefore affirm.
the basic facts of this dispute are set forth in the page opinion of the administrative judge,and the administrative judge findings are summarized below.
petitioner briley began work at the truman library on march,in a archival position.she was promoted to archivist in.as the result of the settlement of a equal employment opportunity eeo sexual harassment complaint against george curtis,her supervisor,the agency promoted briley to a archivist position.one year after settling her sexual harassment complaint,the agency promoted her to.
following the settlement,briley began to take part in the declassification work of the truman library.in,raymond geselbracht joined the library as the supervisory archivist and became briley supervisor.curtis then became her supervisor.also by,briley had responsibility for functioning of the library declassification program.
briley alleges that beginning in may and continuing through may,she made separate disclosures protected under the whistleblower protection act.see b.the substance of these claimed disclosures apparently remained largely the same during this period.half of the alleged disclosures concerned the access of another employee,dennis bilger,to classified documents and his compliance with applicable regulations.the parties agree that briley made a protected disclosure on may,when she informed geselbracht that bilger had left collections containing classified information in open areas of the library.the rest of the alleged disclosures concerned security issues with the library vault.the parties agree that briley made a protected disclosure when,on or before may,she reported to geselbracht,curtis,and others that contract security guards could disable the library vault alarm.
briley alleges that her protected disclosures resulted in three adverse personnel actions.first,she alleges that in retaliation for her protected disclosures,the vast majority of her duties were taken from her on march,and that the agency subsequently failed to restore her original duties to her.second,she alleges that the agency retaliated against her by failing to reclassify her position from to.third,she alleges that in retaliation for her protected disclosures,the agency failed to create a new nonsupervisory archivist position and promote her to it.
the agency alleged personnel actions took place in the context of briley longstanding efforts to win promotion to.in,not long after assuming bilger declassification responsibilities,briley began talking to geselbracht about a promotion to.geselbracht encouraged briley to seek a promotion by obtaining a position at another presidential library large enough to warrant a archivist with expertise in declassification,and he reminded her that the truman library declassification program was old and small.briley,however,wanted a promotion to without leaving the truman library.
in,briley continued to seek a promotion to.she believed that she was performing work and that her position should be reclassified as a position.she continued to complain to geselbracht about her classification.
briley arranged a meeting with curtis for december.she told curtis that she wanted to be a.curtis told her that he would contact the office of presidential libraries and seek a determination of whether or not her position needed reclassification.there is some dispute over the rest of what transpired at the meeting.briley claims that curtis told her that he supported her request for a promotion.in contrast,curtis claims that he never promised briley a promotion.he also asserts that briley told him her job was so stressful that she did not want to continue declassification work unless she received a promotion to.
after her meeting with curtis,briley also spoke with geselbracht and told him that curtis had promised her a promotion.like curtis,geselbracht stated that briley told him that she did not want to continue working on declassification unless she was promoted.geselbracht interpreted this statement as an ultimatum,and he regretted not having an effective for briley.the administrative judge relied upon the testimony of curtis and geselbracht in finding that briley had declined to continue declassification work unless she was promoted.
geselbracht,who says he was concerned that the library declassification program was at risk,contacted the assistant director of the eisenhower library,who explained to geselbracht that the eisenhower library used a team approach to declassification,with archives technicians doing a substantial portion of the work.geselbracht devised such a team approach for the library.he submitted his plan on march,and curtis approved the plan on march.according to geselbracht,one purpose of the plan was to assign a portion of briley declassification work to archive technicians,freeing briley for more substantial archivist duties.he also hoped that the program would become less dependent on any one person.furthermore,the plan would be more flexible it could expand or contract to meet current needs of the declassification program.
on march,geselbracht informed briley and other staff members of the restructuring plan.in his meeting with briley,geselbracht told her that there was no existing plan to promote her to.according to geselbracht,he told her she was to focus on certain more substantive archival work.according to briley,geselbracht told her that she was to be removed from her position.the administrative judge,however,found that briley retained an important role in the new declassification team,and that briley refused to perform at least one duty assigned to her training another employee to assist with declassification.
on may,briley filed a grievance with benedict zobrist,the library director,asking to restore her previous duties and be converted to.although she did not immediately claim that she had lost all of her duties,she later claimed that geselbracht had taken away of her duties.on june,briley met with her union representative and zobrist,curtis,and geselbracht to discuss her grievance.on june,in response to briley concerns about her duties being taken away,geselbracht issued to briley a memorandum outlining her duties under the new plan.
on july,in response to a request from zobrist,supervisory position management specialist jerry pirtle,the chief of the agency personnel classification program,issued an advisory opinion concluding that briley position was and remained properly graded as a,based on standards issued by the office of personnel management.on august,zobrist denied briley grievance.he informed briley that her work did not warrant reclassification to and that the restructuring was consistent with principles of good management,as well as briley grade.
on september,briley filed a request for corrective action with the office of special counsel osc.she asserted,inter alia,that in retaliation for her making certain disclosures that library management engaged in improper activities,the agency had downgraded her job responsibilities and refused to reclassify her position at the level.
on january,following the osc failure to take timely action on her whistleblower claim,briley filed an appeal with the merit systems protection board.on october,the administrative judge issued an initial decision.the administrative judge found that briley had made protected disclosures that geselbracht and curtis had knowledge of the disclosures that the disclosures were a contributing factor in two personnel actions the restructuring of briley duties and the agency failure to promote her and that the agency had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that absent briley protected disclosures,geselbracht and curtis would have restructured briley duties and failed to promote briley to.the administrative judge granted briley request for corrective action.
on december,after the agency petitioned the board to review the administrative judge decision,briley filed an additional request for corrective action with the osc.briley second osc request was more comprehensive than her first.while briley first osc letter reported only disclosures she made commencing in april of,briley second osc letter reported disclosures from through.briley sought thereby to insulate herself from the agency charges that she had not properly exhausted her remedies before the osc.
on july,the board granted the agency petition for review,vacated the administrative judge initial decision,and remanded.first,the board held that the administrative judge failed to make sufficient factual findings and analyze whether briley disclosures were protected.second,the board directed the administrative judge to further consider,in light of its opinion,whether briley change in duties or the agency failure to promote her constituted a personnel action.third,the board noted that briley initial osc complaint was limited to certain of briley disclosures and that the administrative judge had erred in not restricting his analysis to those disclosures.the administrative judge decision had been issued on october,prior to briley december,letter to osc,which reported pre disclosures.the board also instructed the administrative judge to consider anew whether briley had established that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in any personnel actions and whether the agency showed by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions in the absence of any protected disclosures.
on remand,the case was assigned to a different administrative judge,who held a hearing on february,march,and may.on october,the administrative judge issued an initial decision and ruled in favor of the agency,dismissing briley appeal for lack of jurisdiction.the judge held that briley had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies,that the agency did not take or fail to take a personnel action,and that,in any event,the agency had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions regarding briley even absent her protected whistleblowing activities.on june,the board denied briley petition for review,and briley subsequently filed a timely appeal with this court.
large portions of the briefs in this case are directed to retrying factual issues decided against briley by the board,but that is not our function.pursuant to c,we must uphold the board decision unless we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.see dep t of justice.in addition,the board credibility determinations are virtually unreviewable on appeal.rogers dep t of defense dependents.
under a,an employee is required to seek corrective action from the special counsel before seeking corrective action from the board.the board jurisdiction is limited to issues raised before the osc.see ellison merit.prot.an employee must inform the special counsel of the precise ground of his charge of whistleblowing and must give the office of special counsel sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might have led to corrective action.ward merit.prot,quoting knollenberg merit.prot.briley bears the burden of showing that she sought corrective action from the osc and that she exhausted her remedies there.see serrao merit.prot.
in a footnote,the board held that briley had failed to demonstrate that she had requested corrective action from the osc.see initial decision,briley archives and records,no,at,initial decision.the government urges that we affirm on this ground.we decline to do so,as we find that briley complied with the requirement that she seek corrective action from the osc.
on september,briley filed with the osc a complaint alleging that the agency downgraded her job responsibilities in retaliation for complaints she made commencing in april of and refused to reclassify her as a.in addition,on december,briley filed a second complaint with the osc.this complaint stated that from to,briley had made allegations concerning security issues with the library vault,bilger retention of his security clearance,and vault access by persons who lacked proper clearance.the board found these disclosures overly vague and that briley therefore had not properly exhausted her remedies before the osc.however,the board chose to address briley new and more specific complaints directly because requiring briley to exhaust her remedies would result only in further delay.initial decision at.
we disagree with the board analysis of briley allegations to the osc.briley in fact informed the osc of the grounds for her charge of whistleblowing that she had made allegations concerning both whether bilger complied with security regulations and whether his security clearance should have been removed and also whether the library vault complied with rules and regulations.she alleged that the agency had retaliated against her by reassigning her duties and refusing to reclassify her as a.we recognize that in her hearing before the administrative judge,briley gave a more detailed account of her whistleblowing activities than she did in her letters to the osc.however,briley letters to the osc nevertheless contain the core of briley retaliation claim.they gave the osc sufficient basis to pursue an investigation,and they therefore satisfy briley obligation to seek corrective action and exhaust her remedies before the osc.
the cases cited by the government do not support its contention that briley failed to exhaust her remedies before the osc.for example,in mintzmyer dep t of the interior,the appellant alleged a set of retaliatory actions before the board that she had not specified before the osc.here,in contrast,briley informed the osc of the basis for her retaliation claim she then added further detail to her claim before the board.in doing so,briley complied with the requirement that she seek corrective action from the osc.
to establish a prima facie case of retaliation for whistleblowing activity,an employee must show both that she engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a disclosure protected under.b and that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action.see e,b.if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation for whistleblowing,corrective action must be ordered unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.e carr social sec.
a protected disclosure is a disclosure which an employee reasonably believes evidences i a violation of any law,rule,or regulation,or ii gross mismanagement,a gross waste of funds,an abuse of authority,or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.b.before the board,briley asserted that she made separate protected disclosures.the first disclosures dealt with issues regarding bilger the last disclosures dealt with vault security.the board found,and the government does not dispute,that the appellant engaged in at least two instances of whistleblowing activity.first,on may,briley disclosed to geselbracht that bilger left collections containing classi
