background 
the facts central to this appeal are discussed below.for additional background,all the facts of this case are explained in great detail in two thorough and opinions from the court of federal claims.barrett refining united states.barrett.
barrett entered into four contracts with the defense fuel supply center,now called the defense energy support center,that are relevant to the present appeal.barrett.at.all four contracts were for the delivery of military jet fuel.each contract contained a base price and the government price adjustment clause.barrett qualified as a small disadvantaged business sdb that,in accordance with an elaborate system of sdb preference factors,affected the base price of these contracts.id.at.
in a separate and earlier action,the government standard price adjustment clause was held to be unenforceable because it failed to comply with the federal acquisition regulations.mapco alaska petroleum,united states,fed.cl.as a result,barrett filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking damages after both parties had fully performed the contracts.in its first decision,the court of federal claims determined that only the price adjustment clause was invalid and that barrett had a claim under quantum valebant entitling it to receive at least fair market value for each of the four contracts.barrett.at.the court of federal claims then directed the parties to develop,jointly if possible,a fair market valuation.id.at.
the parties did not agree on a valuation.barrett.at.therefore,in its second decision,the court of federal claims determined an appropriate methodology.id.at.using that methodology,the court found that barrett had received fair market value on all but one of the contracts,and it awarded barrett the difference between the fair market value and the payment received on that single contract.id.at.the court also dismissed,for failure to state a claim,the government counterclaims that the amounts that the government paid in excess of fair market value on the other three contracts should either be refunded to the government or be used to offset barrett award.id.

standard of review 
this court reviews legal conclusions from the court of federal claims de novo,and reviews factual findings for clear error.alger united states.the supreme court has stated that a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states united states gypsum.
this court reviews discretionary decisions from the court of federal claims,such as the selection of a method of determining fair market value,for an abuse of discretion.seravalli united states,stating,in an appeal from the united states claims court,that trial courts necessarily must have considerable discretion to select the method of valuation that is most appropriate in the light of the facts of the particular case.in reviewing another court of federal claims decision,this court has stated that a n abuse of discretion is found when the court decision is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary or fanciful the decision is based on an erroneous construction of the law the trial court factual findings are clearly erroneous or the record contains no evidence upon which the district court rationally could have based its decision.air land forwarders,united states.
barrett quantum valebant claima.
the government first raises the threshold question of whether the court of federal claims had jurisdiction to consider barrett claim for quantum valebant relief the government suggests that barrett claim relies on an contract and correctly points out that the court of federal claims has no jurisdiction over such contracts.however,the court does have jurisdiction over contracts.united states mitchell,d stating that the tucker act does not reach claims based on contracts implied in law,as opposed to those implied in fact city of cincinnati united states.therefore,the court of federal claims had jurisdiction because the quantum valebant relief was based on an contract.see northrop grumman united states,fed.cl,analyzing whether there was an contract meriting quantum valebant relief.
in the present case,the court of federal claims found that o nce the unauthorized price escalation clause is struck out,the express contract simply incorporates an promise by the government to pay at least fair market value for the fuel delivered by barrett under the contract.barrett,fed.cl.at.we find no basis to conclude that the court of federal claims clearly erred in treating barrett claim as being premised on an contract and agree that the court properly exercised jurisdiction over barrett claim.
the government is,at least implicitly,also challenging the court finding of an contract.that question,to which we now turn,goes not to jurisdiction,but to whether barrett has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.city of cincinnati,at.
the supreme court has defined an contract as an agreement founded upon a meeting of minds,which,although not embodied in an express contract,is inferred,as a fact,from conduct of the parties showing,in the light of the surrounding circumstances,their tacit understanding.balt.ohio united states.cities serv.gas united states,quoting baltimore ohio trauma serv.group united states,city of cincinnati,at.
given that the price escalation clause was unauthorized and unenforceable we agree with the court of federal claims implicit legal conclusion that there was no longer any express clause covering price escalation,and thus,nothing to preclude an agreement on that term.we also agree with the court of federal claims factual finding of a promise by the government to pay at least fair market value.barrett.at.indeed the government concedes in its opening brief that the parties would have agreed upon a clause providing for the payment of the market price.accordingly,we find no reason to conclude that the court of federal claims factual findings regarding the parties intent to provide for fair consideration of pricing is clearly erroneous.
this court has previously identified four requirements of an contract mutuality of intent to contract consideration lack of ambiguity in offer and acceptance and actual authority in the government representative to bind the government.city of cincinnati,at.the first three requirements are clearly met in light of the court finding,which we have upheld,that the government intended to pay at least fair market value,and in light of the undisputed performance of the contract by both parties.regarding the fourth requirement,there can be no dispute,and the parties raise none,that the government agent had the authority to bind the government to a contract paying at least fair market value.thus,we agree with the court of federal claims legal conclusion that there was an promise to pay fair market value and,thus,an contract.it follows that barrett has stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.
we now address the merits of the court of federal claims decision to provide barrett quantum valebant relief based on the contract.the government presents three challenges.first,the government asserts that the court of federal claims did not provide quantum valebant relief,but rather reformed the contract,or at least utilized a reformation approach.second,the government objects to the failure to utilize a compa
