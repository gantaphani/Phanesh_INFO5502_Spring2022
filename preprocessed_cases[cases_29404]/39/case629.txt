discussion 
whether the court of federal claims properly dismissed core concepts complaint for lack of jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.boyle united states.
the tucker act confers upon the court of federal claims jurisdiction with respect to claims against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states.a.the jurisdictional grant of the tucker act is limited,however,by the general requirement that judgments awarded against the government be paid out of appropriated funds.furash united states,plaza,united states,see also except as provided by the contract disputes act of,every final judgment rendered by the united states court of federal claims against the united states shall be paid out of any general appropriation therefor.thus,absent some specific jurisdictional provision to the contrary,the court of federal claims generally lacks jurisdiction over actions in which appropriated funds can not be obligated furash,at,at.
however,we have interpreted that jurisdictional requirement to mean that,when an issue arises under the funds doctrine,the court of federal claims must exercise jurisdiction absent a clear expression by congress that it intended to separate the agency from general federal revenues.furash,at.to establish jurisdiction,the plaintiff need not show that appropriated funds have actually been used for the agency activities,but that under the agency authorizing legislation congress could appropriate funds if necessary.id.quoting,at.in other words,tucker act jurisdiction exists unless there is a firm indication by congress that it intended to absolve the appropriated funds of the united states from liability for acts of the agency.id.quoting,at.
on appeal,core concepts argues that the court of federal claims erred in dismissing its complaint for lack of jurisdiction and contends that fpi is not a nafi for several reasons.first,it argues that fpi operating fund,the prison industries fund,is considered to be an appropriation under the special funds as appropriation principle.core concepts cites decisions of the comptroller general as establishing that the prison industries fund is a continuing appropriation and that fpi is therefore not a nafi.in that vein,core concepts asserts that aaron,in which the court of federal claims held fpi to be a nafi outside the jurisdictional grant of the tucker act,was wrongly decided.second,core concepts argues that the prison industries fund originally derived from appropriated funds and that congress has not provided the requisite firm indication that appropriated funds were to be absolved from liability for fpi actions.third,core concepts asserts that all revolving funds,including the prison industries fund,are appropriations in view of c and c as well as the appropriations clause,const.art.i,cl.finally,core concepts maintains that tucker act jurisdiction exists because under the cda any judgment against the government would have to be paid from the permanent indefinite judgment fund and then reimbursed by fpi.
the government responds that the court of federal claims properly dismissed core concepts complaint for lack of jurisdiction.the government argues that fpi is a nafi because,among other things,it functions as a corporation and does not receive any appropriations.citing aaron,the government maintains that fpi enabling statute,which segregates fpi monetary assets from the treasury general fund and does not authorize the appropriation of general receipts to fpi account,provides the necessary firm indication that congress intended to absolve appropriated funds from liability for fpi actions.the government further argues that the comptroller general position that all revolving funds are appropriated funds is an overstatement and should be rejected by this court.in addition,the government contends that the appropriations clause of the constitution is simply a restriction on the executive branch disbursing authority and does not distinguish between appropriated and funds held by the government.finally,the government argues that c and c are of dubious relevance to the tucker act and are expressly qualified as applying only in the appropriate context.
we agree with the government that the court of federal claims properly dismissed core concepts complaint for lack of jurisdiction under the funds doctrine.to begin with,fpi does not operate with appropriated funds.it is a corporation whose funds are derived primarily from its product sales,and it receives no congressional appropriations.aaron.at see also el sheikh united states,nafis are federal government entities whose monies do not come from congressional appropriation but rather primarily from their own activities,services,and product sales.second alteration in original citation omitted.core concepts points out that,although fpi is,the prison industries fund was derived from appropriated funds.indeed,the prison industries fund initially comprised funds transferred from the prison industries working capital fund,which itself was derived in part from appropriations made in and to support programs at the atlanta and leavenworth prisons.donation under j of surplus personal prop.of fed.prison,comp,wl.however,fpi repaid its initial funding soon after its inception in and has never received any appropriations from congress since that time.id.at.although appropriations were made to fpi predecessors,that fact is of no consequence to our analysis under the funds doctrine it says nothing of congress intentions concerning the funding of fpi operations,which we discuss below,and it fails to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of obligating appropriated funds to pay judgments against the government.
