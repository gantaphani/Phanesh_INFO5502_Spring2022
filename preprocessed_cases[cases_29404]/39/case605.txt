this case presents two significant issues.the first is whether the appeal by les brownlee,acting secretary of the army,army to this court concerning the board june,entitlement decision is timely.we hold that it is.the mere fact that the government could have appealed the board june,entitlement decision does not prohibit the government from raising entitlement issues in an appeal from the board subsequent quantum decision.
on the merits,the question is whether the armed services board of contract appeals board correctly awarded as allowable contract costs a part of the contractor legal fees incurred in defending against criminal charges brought by the united states.the board assumed that federal acquisition regulation far b,b,made unallowable criminal defense costs incurred by a government contractor in a proceeding in which one of its employees was convicted of criminal conduct.however,the board held the regulation invalid on the ground that it was contrary to the statute and that the statute allowed partial cost recovery.we conclude that the regulation disallows recovery of the contractor costs incurred in a proceeding in which an employee is convicted that the regulation is valid because the statute does not mandate a contrary result and that such defense costs are accordingly not allowable.
background 
in,the army awarded dyncorp a contract for base support services at fort irwin,california.the contract included far,pursuant to which the government was required to pay the contractor costs in amounts determined to be allowable by the contracting officer in accordance with subpart of the far in effect on the date of this contract.app.at.subpart deals with the allowability of costs accrued under contracts between the government and commercial organizations.among other things,the subpart includes far,which disallows the recovery by a contractor of costs related to certain legal proceedings.the government contends that the regulation disallows legal defense costs in a proceeding in which one of the contractor employees is convicted of a criminal offense.the contractor disputes the government interpretation of the regulation and urges that,if it is so construed,the regulation is invalid because it is contrary to the statute.the background of the present controversy is as follows.
in,the army criminal investigation division began investigating allegations of criminal activity by dyncorp and its employees relating to dyncorp performance of the contract.the allegations included fraud involving documentation related to vehicle maintenance fraudulent use of government gasoline credit cards and recording of false data by larry marcum,the branch manager for dyncorp maintenance branch.in accordance with the law of state of dyncorp bylaws,dyncorp paid the costs of its defense and the defense of its employees.the united states declined to prosecute the contractor,but it charged marcum in a information.the information alleged that marcum input into a government accounting system estimated hours,which represented the average time among all work centers using the government accounting system for performing a particular scheduled service,rather than the actual work hours his employees had expended.app.at.marcum subsequently entered into a plea agreement with the government in which he pled guilty to a charge of unauthorized access to a government computer in violation of a.no criminal or civil actions were filed against dyncorp as a result of the investigations.
on january,dyncorp submitted a certified claim to the army seeking reimbursement of the costs it incurred in connection with the criminal investigation.dyncorp excluded from its claim the fees charged by the lawyers who conducted marcum defense.the army contracting officer denied the claim on march,and dyncorp appealed the decision to the board on april.on june,the board rendered a decision on entitlement,holding that dyncorp could recover a portion of its defense costs.dyncorp,asbca,cch entitlement decision,at.the board accepted,arguendo,the government argument that far b barred recovery of defense costs for a proceeding in which only the contractor agent or employee,not the contractor itself,was convicted.however,the board found that,so construed,the regulation was inconsistent with,as amended by the major fraud act of.id.the board found that the regulation was thus an unenforceable mere nullity.id.quoting manhattan equip.comm r.the board remanded the case for negotiation of quantum.id.at.the army did not appeal that decision to this court.on may,the army stipulated to the amount of dyncorp fees,and the board entered final judgment in dyncorp favor on may.dyncorp,asbca,available at wl.the army then filed a notice of appeal in this court on september.
discussion 
at the outset,we must resolve a challenge to our jurisdiction.the contractor contends that the government appeal challenging the board june,decision as to entitlement is untimely because the government could have appealed earlier from the board june,decision,and having failed to appeal earlier,the government present appeal on the issue of entitlement is time barred.we agree with the first proposition,but disagree with the second.we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider the issue of entitlement.
this court has exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of an agency board of contract appeals pursuant to section g of the contract disputes act of.a.although the statute requires that the board decision be final,we have held that the concept of finality in this context is more flexible than,for example,the rigid district court concept of finality required by.dewey elecs.united states,dewey see also rumsfeld applied.cert.denied.ed d.the relevant inquiry in determining finality in appeals pursuant to section a is the scope of the contracting officer decision,for this determines the extent of the contractor right of appeal and the board jurisdiction.dewey,at see also applied,at.in dewey and applied,the board had only entitlement issues before it because the contracting officer had not considered quantum issues.dewey,at applied,at.similarly,the only issue resolved by the contracting officer in this case at the time of the board june,decision was the issue of entitlement.the board reversal of that determination by the contracting officer was therefore a final judgment for purposes of this court review.applied,at s ince the contracting officer did not decide quantum,but decided only entitlement,the board decision on entitlement is final and appealable to this court.dewey,at.thus,the government could have appealed from the june,board decision at the time it was rendered.
the government argues,however,that its decision not to appeal the earlier board decision does not render the present appeal as to entitlement time barred.we agree.the statutory language authorizing an appeal from a final judgment does not address the consequences of a failure to appeal from that final judgment.as dyncorp admitted at oral argument,we have not previously decided this question.cases such as dewey and applied,while permitting appeals from entitlement decisions,neither hold nor suggest that appeals are required before the question of quantum is resolved.allowing the aggrieved party to wait for a truly final judgment before appealing furthers the purposes of both the contract disputes act of cda,stat,and the doctrine of finality.a contrary rule would force the government or the contractor to appeal each and every board entitlement decision that was appealable under our flexible final judgment approach or lose the right to appeal those issues when the case was truly final in the section sense.requiring appeals under such circumstances would compel premature appeals that might in fact be mooted if the parties awaited a judgment concerning quantum,thus wasting the parties and this court resources.
a similar issue arises in connection with the final judgment rule appearing in section of the judicial code,which governs review of judgments by writ of certiorari to the supreme court.in that context,the supreme court has adopted a flexible final judgment rule,just as we have in board of contract appeals decisions under the cda.in cox broadcasting cohn,d,the supreme court set out four categories of cases in which the court has treated a decision on a federal issue as a final judgment for the purposes of and has taken jurisdiction without awaiting the completion of the additional proceedings anticipated in the lower state courts.id.at.in subsequent cases under section,the supreme court has repeatedly assumed that awaiting the conclusion of such additional proceedings does not render the request for review untimely.see,time,firestone,d deciding the case on the merits despite the petitioner failure to appeal from an earlier,final state court judgment 
so too,our sister circuits have permitted parties to wait for a final judgment,rather than requiring the parties to take an interlocutory appeal where interlocutory appeals are permitted by for example,victor talking machine george,cir,cert.denied,held 
a party,feeling himself aggrieved by an interlocutory decree,is given the right to appeal without awaiting a final decree pursuant to now a,upon condition that he take his appeal within thirty days.the statute,however,does not require an aggrieved party to take such an appeal in order to protect his rights,and,where it is not taken,does not impair or abridge in any way the previously existing right upon appeal from the final decree to challenge the validity of the prior interlocutory decree.the aggrieved party may,therefore,await the final determination of the case and upon appeal therefrom raise all questions involved in the case we conclude that upon this appeal from the final decree we have jurisdiction to review the question of the defendant liability as well as the questions raised by the accounting.
id.at emphasis added see also charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed collecting cases from other circuits.other courts have applied the same rule in the context of,which is the predecessor statute of c,pursuant to which this court has exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a judgment in a civil action for patent infringement which is final except for an accounting.see,bingham pump edwards,cir,cert.denied.applying the rule of victor talking machine in this context see also wright,supra,at failure to take an interlocutory appeal permitted by the statute does not foreclose review on appeal from a final judgment of the questions that might have been raised by earlier appeal.
accordingly,we conclude that the government appeal is not time barred and that we have jurisdiction.we proceed to the merits.
we review the board decisions interpreting statutes and regulations without deference,general delaney.in this case,we conclude that the board has seriously misread the governing statutory provisions.
at least since,the far has barred the recovery of legal fees as a cost under government contracts if those fees were incurred in defense of a fraud proceeding that resulted in a conviction.see establishing the federal acquisition regulation,codified as amended at b the following regulation remained in place until 
costs incurred in connection with defense of any criminal investigation,grand jury proceeding or prosecution brought by the government against a contractor,its agent or employee,are unallowable when the charges,which are the subject of the investigation,proceedings,or prosecution,involve fraud on the part of the contractor,its agent or employee,as defined below,and result in conviction including conviction entered on a plea of nolo contendere,judgment against the contractor,its agent or employees,or decision to debar or suspend,or are resolved by consent or compromise.

congress subsequently passed the defense procurement improvement act of act,stat,which limited certain costs that could be recovered against the government.the scope of the act proved controversial.congress was strongly in favor of stating as a matter of public policy that certain costs would not be allowable on government contracts,but it was concerned that an absolute statutory prohibition on certain categories of costs might be unworkable.conf,at,reprinted in.therefore,congress did not deal broadly with cost allowability,but it specifically barred the recovery of ten classes of costs under covered contracts,including 
c osts incurred in defense of any civil or criminal fraud proceeding or similar proceeding including filing of any false certification brought by the united states where the contractor is found liable or has pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of fraud or similar proceeding including filing of a false certification.
act a,stat.at codified at e c emphases added.congress further directed the secretary of defense shall prescribe regulations to implement this section.such regulations may establish appropriate definitions,exclusions,limitations,and qualifications,stat.at codified as amended at e.congress also directed the secretary of defense to prescribe regulations to define in detail and in specific terms those costs which are unallowable,in whole or in part,under covered contracts,stat.at codified as amended at f.pursuant to the act,the earlier regulation was continued in the following modified,but substantially similar,form covering proceedings leading to the conviction of either the contractor or its employees 
costs incurred in connection with defense of any criminal investigation,grand jury proceeding,or prosecution brought by the government against a contractor,its agents or employees,are unallowable when the charges,which are the subject of the investigation,proceedings,or prosecution,involve fraud or similar offenses including filing of a false certification on the part of the contractor,its agents or employees,and result in conviction including conviction entered on a plea of nolo contendere,judgment against the contractor,its agents or employees,or decision to debar or suspend,or are resolved by consent or compromise.
federal acquisition circular,emphases added codified as amended at b 
the next notable development was the enactment of the major fraud act of act,stat.among other things,the act broadened the statutory grounds for cost disallowance in two respects by disallowing criminal defense costs in all types of proceedings not just those involving fraud where there was a conviction and by limiting but not completely barring cost recovery where there was no conviction.these changes are reflected in the language of the act.
first,the act amended section,disallowing c osts incurred by a contractor in connection with any criminal,civil,or administrative proceeding commenced by the united states or a state,to the extent provided in subsection k.act b a,stat.at adding subsection e n codified as amended at e o.subsection k provides in pertinent part 
k except as otherwise provided in this subsection allowing,inter alia,otherwise disallowable costs to the extent provided by an agreement between the contractor and the united states,costs incurred by a contractor in connection with any criminal,civil,or administrative proceeding commenced by the united states or a state are not allowable as reimbursable costs under a covered contract if the proceeding a relates to a violation of,or failure to comply with,a federal or state statute or regulation,and b results in a disposition described in paragraph.
a disposition referred to in paragraph b is any of the following 
a in the case of a criminal proceeding,a conviction including a conviction pursuant to a plea of nolo contendere by reason of the violation or failure referred to in paragraph.
id.b,stat.at codified as amended at k emphases added.
second,when costs were not disallowed by subsection k,the act allowed the contractor to recover criminal defense costs equal to eighty percent of the costs it incurred,but only if the costs were otherwise allowable under the regulations 
a except as provided in subparagraph c,costs incurred by a contractor in connection with a criminal,civil,or administrative proceeding commenced by the united states or a state in connection with a covered contract may be allowed as reimbursable costs under the contract if such costs are not disallowable under paragraph,but only to the extent provided in subparagraph b.
b i the amount of the costs allowable under subparagraph a in any case may not exceed the amount equal to percent of the amount of the costs incurred,to the extent that such costs are determined to be otherwise allowable and allocable under the single procurement regulation issued pursuant to section a of the office of federal procurement policy act a,far.
c in the case of a proceeding referred to in subparagraph a,contractor costs otherwise allowable as reimbursable costs under this paragraph are not allowable if i such proceeding involves the same contractor misconduct alleged as the basis of another criminal,civil,or administrative proceeding,and ii the costs of such other proceeding are not allowable under paragraph.
stat.at codified as amended at k emphases added.
as a result of the act,the regulations were amended in,federal acquisition circular,and minor cosmetic changes were made to subsection b in,federal acquisition circular.thus,the regulation incorporated into the contract provided 
costs incurred in connection with any proceeding brought by a federal,state,local or foreign government for violation of,or a failure to comply with,law or regulation by the contractor including its agents or employees are unallowable if the result is i n a criminal proceeding,a conviction.
b emphasis added 
the contractor here admits that its employee was convicted of a criminal offense,but it asserts that the legal fees incurred by the contractor are allowable.it makes two arguments that far b should be construed to be inapplicable when only the employee,but not the contractor,was convicted and that if the regulation is construed to cover defense costs involving proceedings resulting in employee convictions,the regulation is invalid in view of the act,which makes the costs allowable in part.
the board did not adopt the contractor proposed interpretation of the regulation,and we conclude that the interpretation is incorrect.the regulation disallows c osts incurred in connection with any criminal proceeding brought by the federal government for violation of,or a failure to comply with,law or regulation by the contractor including its agents or employees if a conviction results.b emphasis added.in essence,the regulation defines the term contractor to include both the contractor and its employees.indeed,the predecessor regulations clearly applied to employee proceedings the original regulation disallowed criminal defense costs where charges brought by the government against a contractor,its agent or employee,involve fraud on the part of the contractor,its agent or employee,and result in conviction.at.the regulation remained largely the same after the act,disallowing criminal defense costs where charges brought by the government against a contractor,its agents or employees,involve fraud or similar offenses including filing of a false certification on the part of the contractor,its agents or employees,and result in conviction.at.nothing in the history of the regulation subsequent to the act indicates any intent to narrow the regulation scope.see.at.at.
thus,we conclude that the regulation disallows costs incurred in the unsuccessful defense of criminal proceedings where an employee is convicted,even if the contractor is not.furthermore,contrary to the contractor contention,the regulation does not simply disallow the costs of defending the employee which the contractor excluded from its claim it disallows all costs of the proceeding,including the costs of defending the contractor,even though the contractor itself was not convicted.
this then requires us to reach the contractor alternate claim that the regulation is invalid when so construed.the board agreed with the contractor,concluding that the regulation was invalid in light of the act because the plain language of the act compels the allowance of the contractor costs.the board theory was that the statute disallows criminal defense costs only if the contractor itself is convicted and that subsection k provides that other criminal defense costs may be allowed,but only to the extent of percent of the amount of the costs incurred.k a b.the board is incorrect for each of two reasons.
first,the statute is ambiguous.indeed,although the contractor notes that subsection k a does not include the word employees,it does not include the word contractor,either.instead,it merely requires a conviction.k a.the contractor concedes that the subsection does not expressly provide who must be convicted for purposes of cost disallowance.cont.br.at.so too,the board agreed that these provisions are not explicit regarding whether contractor wrongdoing is necessary for costs to be unallowable,or whether conviction of an employee will also bar recovery of proceeding costs.entitlement decision at.on its face,the statutory language is ambiguous.contrary to the contractor contention,nothing in the remainder of the act or its legislative history resolves that ambiguity in favor of the contractor limited interpretation.
the reference in subsection k c to contractor misconduct does not suggest that only contractor convictions are covered by subsection k a or that the subsection can not be construed to include employees within the term contractor.so too,nothing in the legislative history is particularly informative.the act included criminal provisions which penalized fraud by contractors.a,stat.at codified as amended at.the contractor points to senate report,which states 
the committee did not attempt to modify or establish new principles regarding respondeat superior and other forms of vicarious liability in criminal prosecutions.in order for the corporation to be liable for a crime involving a mental element,it is necessary to prove that the agent acted within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority and with the intent to benefit the corporation.
at,reprinted in at emphasis added.as best we can understand this argument,the contractor contends that,by disallowing the contractor costs in proceedings in which only the employee is convicted,the regulation is somehow imposing respondeat superior liability on the contractor for acts of the employee.but that premise is not sustainable.there is nothing in the regulation that imposes liability on the contractor for the acts of its agents.rather,the regulation merely disallows certain contractor costs.see b.
in addition,the contractor relies on the following statement by senator grassley in support of his amendment adding what became subsection k to the act 
in summary,the amendment provides that legal proceeding costs are unallowable in any criminal,civil or administrative proceeding brought by the federal or state government that results in a conviction,civil liability,the imposition of a fine or other monetary penalty,a suspension or debarment,or other similar result evidencing a violation or failure to comply on the part of the contractor.
cong.rec.emphasis added.the contractor argues that this statement referring to contractor violations manifests an intent to limit the disallowance provisions to situations in which the contractor itself was convicted.however,grassley never defined what he meant by contractor and never used the word employee in his remarks,see id.at,so there is no reason to believe that he intended to draw such a distinction between the contractor and its employees.furthermore,grassley amendment was crafted to expand contractor cost disallowance,not to limit it.see,id.at under current practices,there no incentive for contractors to keep an eye on costs or keep a careful eye on what lawyers bill them in government fraud cases.after this amendment,there will be.id.at explaining that the amendment was designed to avoid t he anomalous result that the same government that prosecutes the fraud case pays the cost of the defense by the contractor lawyers.thus,grassley statement does not support the contractor reasoning.
indeed,if the legislative history shows anything,it shows knowledge and approval of the existing regulatory approach of not cover
