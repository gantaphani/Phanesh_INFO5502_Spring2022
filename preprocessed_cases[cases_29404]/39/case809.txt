after the trial court overruled their demurrers to the complaint of real party in interest civic partners stockton,llc civic,petitioners the city of stockton the city and the redevelopment agency of the city of stockton the redevelopment agency initiated this original proceeding for writ of mandate seeking to compel the trial court to sustain the demurrers.the city and the redevelopment agency contend civic complaint is barred by civic failure to present a claim under the government claims act,et before filing suit.we agree and shall grant the requested relief.
facts and procedural history 
because this proceeding follows an order overruling demurrers to the most recent complaint filed by civic,we summarize and accept as true all material allegations of that complaint.hensler city of glendale cal th,fn,d,shoemaker myers cal d.
civic and the redevelopment agency entered into two contracts,the first for rehabilitation of the hotel stockton the hotel and the second for development of a cinema near the hotel.
in may,the city entered into a lease with civic for square feet on the upper floors of the hotel.however,three months later,the city repudiated the lease.in a meeting with civic and several others,mark lewis,the city manager and executive director of the redevelopment agency,stated that the c ity would not go forward with the lease,and he demanded that civic agree to replace the lease with another use of the upper floors of the hotel,or the c ity would not participate further in civic development.without the lease,or a viable alternative use,civic could not finance renovation of the hotel and,without the hotel,civic could not finance the cinema.
lewis offered civic an alternative to use the upper floors of the hotel for senior housing.this alternative made it impossible for civic to meet milestones and dates for performance of the hotel development agreement.the hotel interior had to be redesigned and the space had to be financeable through government grants and income tax credits,application for which would take time.civic agreed to the change to mitigate its damages from the city breach of the lease.civic spent many months turning the hotel from c ity offices to senior residential housing.the c ity intervened in this process.the c ity manager would permit civic to apply only for four percent tax credits instead of the maximum nine percent credits.the nine percent credits were more financeable than four percent credits,but carried a different tenant mix.thus,civic had to design the project for four percent credits,had to make it credit worthy despite the lower subsidy in tax credits,and had to produce plans to be used in applying to the state agency in charge of selecting the recipient developers of the credits.
by the end of,civic had completed the tax and financing analysis,plans,and other work necessary to prepare the application for tax credits in the march competition.this process cost civic several hundred thousand dollars.
in january,lewis informed civic that the redevelopment agency had decided to allow cyrus youssefi and his company,cfy development,to take over renovation of the upper floors of the hotel,the senior housing plan and the tax credit application.civic immediately began discussions with steve pinkerton,the redevelopment agency director of housing and development,and jim rinehart,the redevelopment agency manager of housing and development,on how the redevelopment agency intended to protect civic from the damages from this breach of the hotel development agreement and the prior breach of the lease and the hotel development agreement.pinkerton and rinehart agreed that to avoid damaging civic further by the breach,the redevelopment agency owed civic and would repay civic investment and overhead to develop the hotel and would assure civic that the hotel development agreement would not be undermined further 
in order to obtain tax credits,an application had to be submitted by march.to facilitate this application,the redevelopment agency requested that civic turn over the plans it had created on the hotel.on february,civic sent pinkerton a letter indicating its willingness to turn over the plans subject to the understanding that the plans can only be used by the redevelopment agency,the city or others subject to an agreement between the redevelopment agency and civic regarding the future renovation of the hotel,including the reimbursement of costs incurred by civic to date.that same day,rinehart signed the letter for pinkerton,agreeing to its terms.
in a subsequent discussion on march,pinkerton agreed that the redevelopment agency recognized certain specific amounts due to or on behalf of civic and certain necessary acts to cure to the extent possible the outstanding breach of the hotel development agreement.civic followed this discussion with a memorandum sent to pinkerton the same day setting forth various terms of civic understanding with the redevelopment agency,including that the city would assume a loan to civic,the city would reimburse civic for hotel expenditures after december,and cfy development,would lease the first floor of the hotel to civic for years.pinkerton never questioned or disavowed this memorandum.
civic had paid its architect over to prepare the plans for the hotel by the time they were turned over to the city and the redevelopment agency.the redevelopment agency personnel assured civic that the plans would not be given to youssefi unless the redevelopment agency provided civic with assurances that civic interests would be protected.the redevelopment agency also agreed to assume civic obligation on the loan.
on march,the redevelopment agency entered into a new hotel development agreement with another of cyrus youssefi companies,hotel stockton investors.this effectively repudiated the hotel development agreement with civic.the city and the redevelopment agency also turned over civic plans to youssefi.the redevelopment agency did not pay civic for the cost of preparing the plans.the redevelopment agency also did not take over civic obligation on the loan.
in connection with the cinema development agreement,civic obtained a lease of the new cinemas from kirkorian premiere theatres.the city and the redevelopment agency approved the lease.however,some time thereafter,the city began to induce kirkorian to deal directly with the city or the redevelopment agency to become a tenant of the redevelopment agency rather than civic.the city or the redevelopment agency later entered into a lease with another theater chain.the redevelopment agency eventually terminated the cinema development agreement with civic in order to enter into a new agreement with another developer.
civic filed suit against the city,the agency,cyrus youssefi,hotel stockton investors,and cfy development.after various demurrers were sustained,civic filed a second amended complaint.it alleges five causes of action breach of the lease by the city breach of the hotel development agreement by the redevelopment agency breach of the cinema development agreement by the redevelopment agency intentional interference with the development agreements by the city and intentional interference with the development agreements by youssefi and his companies.
the city and the redevelopment agency collectively petitioners filed a against civic alleging,among other things,that civic breached the two development agreements and the lease.
petitioners filed demurrers and a motion to strike the second amended complaint,asserting civic failed to allege compliance with the claims presentation requirement for suits against governmental entities.the trial court overruled the demurrers,concluding the claims presentation requirements do not apply to actions based on contract.the court also denied the motion to strike.
discussion 
ithe government claims act 
petitioners contend the trial court erred in overruling their demurrers to the second amended complaint.they argue civic claims are subject to the claim filing requirement of the government claims act,et further undesignated section references are to the government code and the complaint fails to allege compliance with that requirement.we agree.
the government claims act establishes the bases and conditions under which claims against state and local public entities may be pursued.section states a there shall be presented in accordance with chapter commencing with section and chapter commencing with section of this part all claims for money or damages against the state a valid claim must contain,among other things,the name and address of the claimant,t he date,place and other circumstances of the occurrence or transaction which give rise to the claim asserted,a general description of the indebtedness,obligation,injury,damage or loss incurred so far as it may be known at the time of presentation of the claim,and the amount claimed.a claim alleging death or injury to person or personal property or growing crops must be presented within six months of accrual of a cause of action.all other claims must be presented within one year of accrual.
the claim filing requirement of the government claims act has several purposes to provide the public entity with sufficient information to allow it to make a thorough investigation of the matter to facilitate settlement of meritorious claims to enable the public entity to engage in fiscal planning and to avoid similar liability in the future.trafficschoolonline,clarke th,d.
n o suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented until a written claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the board,or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board.f ailure to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement subjects a claim against a public entity to a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action.state of california superior court cal th,d.
express contract claims 
the second amended complaint contains four causes of action against the city or the redevelopment agency three alleging breach of express contracts,to wit,the hotel development agreement,the cinema development agreement,and the lease,and one alleging intentional interference with the lease.in each claim,civic seeks monetary damages.
in overruling petitioners demurrers,the trial court stated the contention that civic has failed to allege compliance with the govt.tort claims act,and therefore can not state a cause of action,is overruled.section expressly provides that nothing in the tort claims act affects liability based on contract.morrill state cal d.the case cited by defendants,state of california superior court bodde cal th,d,is factually distinguishable,as it involves the alleged misdiagnosis of a prisoner lung cancer and failure to provide medical care,not breach of contract.
civic contends the trial court was correct in overruling the demurrers because t he california supreme court has suggested that section of the government code exempts contracts from the claims feature in section.civic cites as support longshore county of ventura cal d.
the reliance of civic and the trial court on section and the two cited cases is misplaced.it is undisputed the government claims act applies to actions based on torts.see,turner state of california d.crow state of california d.thus,the trial court clearly erred in overruling demurrers to the fourth cause of action for intentional interference with contract.
in addition,despite the often used references to the tort claims act or the government tort claims act,it is generally recognized that the claim presentation requirement of the government claims act et applies to causes of action alleging breach of express contract.see hart county of alameda th,d baines pickwick city of los angeles th,d alliance financial city and county of san francisco th,d alliance financial crow state of california,supra,d at.loehr ventura county community college dist.d.section requires presentation of a claim for any cause of action against the state f or money or damages on express contract,subd.a.legislative history suggests an intent to apply the claim presentation requirement of the government claims act to all types of claims for money damages.as explained by the court of appeal in alliance financial prior to,government code section provided that parties wishing to institute a suit on any claim against the county whether founded upon contract,express or implied,or upon any act or omission of the county first were required to present the claim to the county governing board of supervisors.in,following a study conducted under the direction of professor van alstyne,the law revision commission determined that because of the large number and variety of claims statutes then existing under california law,the law of this state governing the presentation of claims against governmental entities is unduly complex,inconsistent,ambiguous and difficult to find,that it is productive of much litigation and that it often results in the barring of just claims.recommendation and study relating to the presentation of claims against public entities cal.law revision com.the commission recommended a complete overhaul of the claims statutes.as a result of professor van alstyne study and the commission recommendation,the legislature repealed at least statutes providing separate claims procedures for various local entities,replacing them with a single,uniform law set forth at government code former section et.see recommendation relating to sovereign immunity cal.law revision com.
one of the problems identified by professor van alstyne was that the various claims statutes were wildly inconsistent as to the type of action they were intended to govern.professor van alstyne noted that government code former section,mentioned above,exemplified the broadest form of claims statute.other statutes were drawn more narrowly,and have been construed correspondingly.provisions which require presentation of all claims for damages,for example,do not apply to claims for money due on contract but do embrace breach of contract claims and all types of claims founded in tort whether intentional or negligent on the other hand,a claims provision which is expressly or impliedly limited to claims for money precludes the necessity of presenting a claim as a prerequisite to injunctive or declaratory relief,but does embrace all forms of monetary demands including pension claims and all types of tort and contract claims.recommendation and study relating to the presentation of claims against public entities cal.law revision com,fns.omitted.with the adoption of the uniform law,government code former section was repealed.in place of it and of the various other repealed claims statutes,the legislature adopted government code former section,providing that,with certain carefully specified exceptions,no suit for money or damages may be brought against a local public entity until a written claim therefor has been presented to the entity in conformity with the provisions of this article and has been rejected in whole or in part.section was repealed in and replaced,in part,with government code section.in light of the language of government code former section,and of professor van alstyne comments,there can be no doubt but that the legislature intended the claims presentation statutes to apply not only to tort claims,but also to claims for breach of contract and claims for money due under a contract.in short,unless specifically excepted,any action for money or damages,whether sounding in tort,contract or some other theory,may not be maintained until a claim has been filed with the relevant public entity and either the public entity acts on it or it is deemed to have been denied by operation of law.alliance financial,supra,th at,d.
section,on which the trial court and civic place so much reliance,reads nothing in this part affects liability based on contract or the right to obtain relief other than money or damages against a public entity or public employee.in morrill state,supra,cal d at pages,the state high court concluded section precludes a claim of immunity under the government claims act for actions based on breach of contract.in longshore county of ventura,supra,cal d at page,the court likewise concluded the sovereign immunity shield provided by the government claims act does not apply to actions based on contract.
while section may provide an exemption from the immunity provisions of the government claims act for actions based on breach of contract,this exemption does not extend to the claim presentation requirement of section et.loehr ventura county community college,supra,d at.the part to which section refers is part,dealing with liability of public entities.section says part does not limit the liability of governmental entities for breach of contract.however,the claim presentation requirement is found in part.thus,civic was required to present a claim to petitioners before asserting any of the causes of action in the second amended complaint.
implied contract 
apparently recognizing the weakness of its position,civic attempts to recast the second amended complaint as one seeking equitable relief based on an implied contract or.civic argues the government claims act does not apply to actions based on implied contract.
in minsky city of los angeles cal d,the complaint alleged police had taken from an arrestee and,upon disposition of the case,wrongfully transferred it to the policeman and fireman pension fund.a claim was filed for return of the money but was rejected as untimely.a complaint was then filed for in damages.the superior court sustained demurrers to the complaint based on failure to submit a timely claim.id.at.the supreme court reversed.
the supreme court concluded that,despite the fact the plaintiff was seeking money damages,the nature of the suit was for the return of property,and such suit does not fall within the scope of the government claims act.minsky city of los angeles,supra,cal d at.the court explained w e find that the government in effect occupies the position of a bailee when it seizes from an arrestee property that is not shown to be contraband.citation.the arrestee retains his right to eventual specific recovery,whether he seeks to regain tangible property like an automobile,ring,wallet or camera,or whether he seeks to recover a specific sum of money which,under general constructive trust principles,is traceable to property within the possession of the defendant.citations.although the instant complaint does not expressly seek specific recovery of the money in question,it does contain a general prayer for any such relief as the court may deem just and proper,and under established california authority,the facts alleged by the complaint are sufficient to support a claim for specific recovery of the sums seized and allegedly wrongfully withheld from plaintiff.citation.as such,we hold that noncompliance with the claims statutes erects no bar to the instant action.id.at.
civic contends the amended complaint alleged a claim in declaratory relief for restitution based on the unjust enrichment of the redevelopment agency and youssefi.civic argues the trial court erroneously sustained demurrers to the amended complaint based on federal copyright law and thereby precluded civic from asserting claims based on implied contract.
assuming civic is correct that a claim based on restitution of,for example,the hotel development plans,or for unjust enrichment is not barred by the government claims act,this avails civic nothing.the second amended complaint alleges breach of three express contracts.the fact that the amended complaint may have alleged breach of implied contract is of no moment,as that complaint is not before us for consideration.the only matter at issue here is whether the trial court erred in overruling demurrers to the second amended complaint.
civic contends petitioners are estopped to rely on the government claims act.civic argues petitioners did not raise the government claims act in their initial demurrers.according to civic,i f they had,the time to file a claim would not yet have run.however,civic cites nothing to suggest petitioners were required to raise the government claims act at the earliest possible time.furthermore,the claim that civic now says it would have filed related to their allegation that the agreements set forth in the february and march correspondence had been violated.while alluded to in the second amended complaint,civic did not pursue a cause of action based upon those alleged violations.
substantial compliance 
civic contends it substantially complied with the claim filing requirement of the government claims act by virtue of the february letter and the march memorandum and,therefore,petitioners are estopped to rely on the act.
the government claims act requires only substantial compliance with the claims presentation requirement.schaefer dixon associates santa ana watershed project authority th,d.in city of san jose superior court cal d,the state high court adopted a test for determining whether there has been substantial compliance with the government claims act is there some compliance with all of the statutory requirements and,if so,is this compliance sufficient to constitute substantial compliance id.at.
here,civic does not even argue the purported notices in the february and march documents provided some compliance with all of the requirements of section.the february letter was addressed to pinkerton and read following up the discussions that occurred this week regarding the hotel stockton,we will be glad to provide you with a reproducible set of the latest hotel plans.these are the plans that were the basis for the bid number from raymond.construction and are approximately a construction set.
provision of the plans is subject to the following understanding.first,the plans are the property of civic partners.second,the plans can only be used by the redevelopment agency,city or others subject to an agreement between the agency and civic partners regarding the future renovation of the hotel including reimbursement of costs to date,as well as a cooperative agreement between the agency and civic partners regarding other components of the channel head project including the cinema and b m building.
by signing below you will be agreeing with these understandings.upon return of this letter with the appropriate agency signature,we will work to get the plans to you as quickly as possible.they are in my office in modesto and could either be or sent overnight.
if you have any questions,please give me a call.
the march memorandum is a list of general terms of a supplemental agreement between the city and civic.it specifies,among other things,that the city will assume the loan,the city will reimburse civic for expenditures after december,civic will be leased ground floor space in the hotel for years,and the city will partially reimburse civic for cinema design costs.
these documents say nothing about the date,place and other circumstances of the occurrence,subd.c,a general description of the indebtedness,obligation,injury,damage or loss incurred,subd.d,or the amount claimed,subd.f.there was no substantial compliance.
claim as presented 
a claim that does not amount to substantial compliance may nevertheless qualify as a claim as presented.section reads if in the opinion of the board or the person designated by it a claim as presented fails to comply substantially with the requirements of sections and,the board or the person may,at any time within days after the claim is presented,give written notice of its insufficiency,stating with particularity the defects or omissions therein a claim as presented is a claim that is defective in that it fails to comply substantially with government code sections and,but nonetheless puts the public entity on notice that the claimant is attempting to file a valid claim and that litigation will result if it is not paid or otherwise resolved.a claim as presented triggers a duty on the part of the governmental entity to notify the claimant of the defects or omissions in the claim.a failure to notify the claimant of the deficiencies in a claim as presented waives any defense as to its sufficiency.alliance financial,supra,th at,d see any defense as to the sufficiency of the claim based upon a d
