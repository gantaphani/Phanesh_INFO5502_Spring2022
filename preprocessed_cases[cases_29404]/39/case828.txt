this action arises from one of our nation newest problems of public policy the question of where to dispose of low level radioactive waste llrw.new york united states,d.in,the state department of health services department selected plaintiff ecology,ecology to develop and operate california first llrw storage facility.ecology and state officials thereafter identified a location for the facility,known as ward valley,and completed favorable environmental reviews for that site.but the facility has yet to be built.
ecology places the blame on the state failure to acquire the ward valley site from the federal government.claiming that it spent millions of dollars in development costs in reliance on the state promise to use its best efforts to acquire the ward valley site,ecology sued the state,the department,the department director,diana bonta,and governor gray davis,alleging breach of contract and promissory estoppel causes of action,and seeking a writ of mandate directing the state to take the necessary steps to acquire the ward valley site.the trial court sustained defendants demurrer without leave to amend.we conclude ecology has alleged a promissory estoppel claim,and reverse the judgment as to that cause of action and the related declaratory relief claim.we affirm the judgment in all other respects 
because this appeal follows the sustaining of a demurrer,we draw our facts from those pleaded in the complaint and those of which we may take judicial notice.moore conliffe cal th,d.we additionally rely on several federal and state court decisions that have extensively discussed the factual and legal background relating to the present dispute.see fort mojave indian tribe department of health services th,d california radioactive materials management forum department of health services th,d,disapproved on other grounds in carmel valley fire protection dist.state of california cal th,fn,d,us ecology,united states department of the interior california department of health services babbitt d.
our society increasingly generates llrw from numerous sources,including hospitals,research institutions,and consumer industries.new york united states,supra,at.because this waste must be isolated from humans for long periods of time,often for hundreds of years,most states would understandably prefer that a storage facility be placed outside their geographic borders.id.at.in the late,there were only three llrw storage facilities in the country washington,nevada and south carolina and those facilities were in the process of closing or were threatening to close.id.at.
in,the united states congress responded to this crisis by enacting the radioactive waste policy act,authorizing states to enter into regional compacts that may restrict their disposal facilities to waste generated within member states.pub,stat.et new york united states,supra,at.by,only three approved regional compacts had operational disposal facilities,leaving the states that had not entered into one of these compacts with no assured outlet for their llrw.new york united states,supra,at.to deal with this problem,congress enacted supplemental legislation requiring the three existing disposal sites to continue accepting llrw through,but permitting approved regional compacts to exclude the waste generated outside each region after.ibid.
in,the california legislature first responded to the federal mandate by enacting urgency legislation directing the department to develop an llrw management plan that would include plans for storage,the establishment of siting criteria,and the reduction of the amount and toxicity of waste produced.stats,ch.see health.the legislation authorized the department to establish and operate,or contract for the establishment and operation of,interim llrw storage facilities.stats,ch.
the next year,the legislature added to the statutory scheme by addressing storage needs.this new legislation required the department to first promulgate regulations for the selection of a private company that would serve as a licensed llrw operator.within three months of the adoption of those regulations,interested parties must file a statement of capabilities and notice of intention to file an application for a license to receive radioactive materials,subd.a.within days,the department director was required to select one of the applicants to serve as a,subd.b.if there were no qualified applicants,the state resources agency was required to directly assume the costs and responsibility for establishing and operating the state llrw disposal facility.if the department selected a,the department was authorized to charge an annual fee and to require the applicant to post a bond of up to one million dollars to guarantee that the person will carry out the activities connected with completing the license application and obtaining the license,subd.f.by enacting this legislation,the legislature sought to assure the safe management of llrw and permit and encourage the expeditious establishment and operation by the private sector of a llrw disposal facility stats,ch.
in april,the department promulgated the required regulations,tit,et in,the department selected ecology as the.ecology formally accepted the designation in december,and agreed to be responsible for developing the llrw facility under the department oversight.california department of health services babbitt,supra,d at.ecology thereafter posted the required million in securities to guarantee performance of its duties,and agreed to pay the required annual fee of,tit.ecology paid that fee each year between and.the department used these fees to perform supporting technical studies and to monitor expenses incurred by ecology.
in,california entered into a regional compact with arizona,north dakota,and south dakota for the construction and operation of an llrw disposal facility southwestern compact.fort mojave indian tribe department of health services,supra,th at,d.the california legislature and the united states congress ratified this compact the terms of the compact are part of the health and safety code,a.the southwestern compact obligates the host state to c ause a regional disposal facility to be developed on a timely basis and e nsure the protection and preservation of public health and safety in the siting,design,development,licensing,and care of the facility,subd.e.california agreed to be the host state for the first years of the southwestern compact existence,subd.c.
ecology thereafter engaged in an intensive and costly search for an environmentally suitable llrw disposal facility site.by march,ecology had identified two sites.the primary site was located on land in the mojave desert known as ward valley.the secondary site was also located on land known as silurian valley.the department,which was extensively involved in the site selection process,concurred in the designation of both sites.see california radioactive materials management forum department of health services,supra,th at,d.because state law requires the facility to be located on either federal or state land,and federal policy requires the facility to be on land,the california state lands commission lands commission submitted an application to the federal government,seeking to preserve the ward valley silurian valley sites for the state acquisition.
ecology then began collecting detailed environmental information about the ward valley site for the license application and related environmental studies under the california environmental quality act and the national environmental protection act.ecology entered into contracts with the state and federal governments agreeing to reimburse governmental agencies for costs associated with preparation of the environmental impact report eir,environmental impact statement eis,and site acquisition documents.
in august,the department and ecology executed a memorandum of understanding mou pertaining to their relationship.as will be detailed in the discussion section below,the mou recorded certain mutual understandings regarding each party obligations concerning the development of the llrw disposal facility and ecology ultimate recovery of its costs.of particular relevance,the department agreed the state will use its best efforts to assure the timely transfer of the relevant site from the federal government to the state so as not to delay the issuance of the license pursuant to the proposed schedule of facility development milestones contained in exhibit consistent with applicable regulations,the department also agreed ecology would be entitled to recover all of its development costs through the rates charged to customers when the facility was in operation.see,tit.
induced by the department promises and assurances contained in the mou,in september ecology submitted to the department an,project application,including extensive environmental data and analysis and safety evaluations respecting the ward valley site.
in april,the department and the bureau of land management blm issued a final joint.see california department of health services babbitt,supra,d at fort mojave indian tribe department of health services,supra,th at,d.the report concluded the ward valley site was the preferred location for the llrw storage facility,and the facility would result in no significant adverse environmental impacts.california department of health services babbitt,supra,d at.
in july,the department issued a draft license to ecology for public review,subd.a.
at about this same time,governor davis,who was then a member of the lands commission,began to publicly oppose california efforts to establish a regional llrw disposal facility within its territory the ward valley llrw disposal facility.ecology alleges that because of respondent davis s opposition to the establishment of a llrw disposal facility within california,the lands commission withdrew its application to acquire the ward valley site.
in july,the department filed an application with the blm to purchase the ward valley site through an alternate the federal land policy management act direct sale provisions.a.
in january,then united states interior secretary manuel lujan announced his intent to issue a record of decision approving the department application for direct sale of the ward valley site to california.california of health services babbitt,supra,d at.opponents of the ward valley llrw immediately filed a federal district court action seeking a declaration that the proposed transfer was invalid because it violated the endangered species act.ibid.the district court granted a temporary restraining order,enjoined the secretary from transferring any ward valley land,and scheduled a hearing on the preliminary injunction.ibid.
secretary lujan thereafter issued the record of decision approving the direct sale of the ward valley site to california.california department of health services babbitt,supra,d at.two additional groups of plaintiffs then filed lawsuits seeking to prevent the proposed sale and development of the ward valley site.ibid.shortly thereafter,the clinton administration took office.in february,newly appointed interior secretary bruce babbitt rescinded former secretary lujan record of decision,and withdrew approval of the sale of the ward valley site to california.ibid.
nine months later,in september,the department licensed the ward valley llrw disposal facility,certified the project final environmental impact report,and issued ecology a license to operate the facility.see fort mojave indian tribe department of health services,supra,th at,d.
in october,a california court of appeal rejected legal challenges filed by project opponents to the ward valley license and to the adequacy of the related eir and eis.see fort mojave indian tribe department of health services,supra,th at,d.
in january,the department petitioned for a writ of mandate in federal district court asking the court to compel secretary babbitt to perform his alleged ministerial duty to convey the ward valley site to california,and alleging that secretary babbitt reversal of former secretary lujan record of decision was arbitrary and capricious under the federal administrative procedures act the babbitt action.california department of health services babbitt,supra,d at.three weeks later,ecology filed an action asserting substantially similar claims.the federal court consolidated the two cases.ibid.the court later granted summary judgment in favor of secretary babbitt,determining that babbitt had a discernible and reasonable basis for his decision to rescind former secretary lujan record of decision.id.at.
in january,governor davis became governor of california.ecology alleges that governor davis entered office with a design to repudiate the state commitment to establish the ward valley llrw disposal facility,to shun ecology and to abrogate the state legal duty to cause the timely establishment of a regional llrw disposal facility with in its territory.
in may,ecology filed a notice of appeal in the babbitt action.ecology requested that the department also appeal the decision,but the department refused to appeal 
the next month,governor davis appointed richard atkinson,president of the university of california system,to chair an advisory group charged with proposing solutions to the state llrw disposal problems and alternatives to the ward valley llrw disposal facility the atkinson group.ecology alleges the atkinson group was specifically instructed by governor davis or by his senior staff not to consider the ward valley site,or any other specific disposal site,as a solution for california llrw disposal problems and that the atkinson group will be used by the davis administration as a pretext for not complying with its statutory and contractual obligations to establish the ward valley llrw disposal facility.
in november,the blm denied the state direct sale application to purchase the ward valley site.blm denial was allegedly based in material part on blm determination that california no longer intended to establish the ward valley llrw disposal facility,and blm denial was without prejudice to submit another application to purchase the ward valley site.
in november through january,governor davis and california resources agency secretary allegedly made statements in news media interviews that the ward valley project was a dead issue and that the state intended to continue shipping at least of the llrw generated within california to locations outside of the state.governor davis did not propose any appropriations for the llrw disposal program in the state budget,and all department personnel previously assigned to the program have been reassigned.
ecology alleges that it satisfactorily completed its duties as the state and satisfactorily performed its duties as the state licensee.ecology further alleges it has incurred more than million in development costs,including interest on project loans and lost profits,in connection with the ward valley llrw disposal facility.
based on the foregoing alleged facts,ecology asserted five causes of action breach of an express written contract breach of an implied in fact contract promissory estoppel writ of mandate requesting the court to direct governor davis and director bonta to take such action as is reasonably calculated to cause the establishment of the ward valley llrw disposal facility on a timely basis and declaratory relief.defendants filed a demurrer as to each cause of action.the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing a judgment after a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,we review the pleading de novo and must assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded by the plaintiff.we disregard allegations that are contrary to the law or to a fact that may be judicially noticed,or that are contradicted by the express terms of an exhibit incorporated in the complaint.freeman san diego of realtors th,fn,d.regardless of the label attached to the cause of action,we must examine the complaint factual allegations to determine whether they state a cause of action.cochran cochran th,d.we must reverse if the alleged facts show entitlement to relief under any possible legal theory.id.at,d.
we apply these principles to determine whether ecology has stated a cause of action on theories of breach of express or implied contract promissory estoppel and failure to perform a ministerial duty.
ii.breach of express and implied contract causes of action 
ecology breach of express and implied contract claims are based primarily on the august mou,which is attached to ecology complaint and was signed by ecology president and the department llrw program manager.
the mou initially describes the history of ecology role and then states the state and ecology have each undertaken a number of actions and ecology has incurred considerable expense to date in connection with the development of the llrw facility.a number of rights and obligations exist between the state and ecology.recognizing this as well as ecology need to obtain certain written assurances from the state in order to obtain financing,the california legislature recently directed the department to enter into appropriate written agreements with ecology in order to reduce the cost of project financing and to further expedite attainment of the goals established under senate bill.this memorandum responds to that directive by recording certain mutual understandings between ecology and the state concerning the development of the facility and the repayment of debt obligations incurred for the development of the facility.this memorandum is not,however,intended as a complete statement of all rights,obligations or agreements which may exist between ecology and the state,except as to the specific matters contained herein.
the mou then sets forth each party agreements with respect to the llrw disposal facility.
ecology agreed to maintain the promised schedule as set forth in its application,as amended from time to time with approval of the department and agreed that its failure to maintain the promised schedule may result in forfeiture of the securities posted in lieu of the performance bond,unless the failure is the result of an act of god or a departmentally caused delay,or unless ecology can provide assurance that any delay will be remedied without jeopardizing the overall project schedule.
the department made numerous promises.
first,the department agreed that ecology would be the sole llrw facility operator in the state,stating a ssuming satisfactory completion of its duties as license designee ecology will become the llrw disposal facility licensee in the state,and will,assuming satisfactory performance of its duties as licensee,remain the sole llrw disposal facility licensee in the state for the duration of the period of operation of the facility.
second,the department agreed the state would use its best efforts to maintain the schedule as set forth in exhibit c,and would use its best efforts to assure the timely transfer of the relevant site from the federal government to the state so as not to delay the issuance of the license pursuant to the proposed schedule of facility development milestones contained in exhibit title to the facility site will be held by the state.
third,the department agreed to enter into a ground lease,pursuant to which ecology will receive an exclusive leasehold interest in the site that authorizes it to conduct radioactive waste disposal operations there pursuant to the conditions and requirements of the license.
fourth,the department agreed the rate schedule would permit ecology to recover all reasonable costs incurred in developing and operating the facility,including the costs of all reasonable activities of ecology in its capacity as license designee plus the return factor specified by ecology in its application to the department.the mou states that the rate schedule is intended to provide the mechanism for recovery of costs including any debt obligations properly incurred in relationship to development of the facility and that ecology will be entitled to recover such costs through the rate schedule whether or not it continues to be license designee or licensee.
ecology alleges defendants breached repudiated these express promises.specifically,ecology alleges defendants violated the mou by advanc ing a scientifically baseless and pretextual refusal to pursue establishment of the ward valley llrw disposal facility abandoning the state efforts to establish a regional llrw disposal facility within california refus ing to support ecology efforts to compel the united states to transfer the ward valley site to the state of california and refus ing to deal with ecology 
b.the mou was not supported by adequate consideration 
defendants maintain the mou can not be the basis for a breach of express or implied contract claim because it lacks consideration,contending the mou adds nothing to ecology statutory obligations as a and licensee.we agree.
a promise is not enforceable unless consideration was given in exchange for the promise.passante mcwilliam th,d.a promise to perform a preexisting legal duty is not supported by consideration.bailey breetwor d.
ecology made a single promise in the mou that it would maintain the promised schedule set forth in its application and,if it did not,it would be subject to forfeiture of its performance bond.however,ecology was already bound to perform these obligations on this same schedule or forfeit its performance bonds,tit.the mou language was identical to the governing regulations that provide the performance bond shall be forfeited upon f ailure to maintain the promised schedule and such failure is not the result of an act of god or departmentally caused delay and the license designee can not provide assurance that this delay will be remedied without jeopardizing the overall project schedule,tit.
ecology argues that its promise was supported by consideration because it agreed to continue paying its annual license fee to perform as the state licensee beyond the term of its performance guarantee.italics added.however,ecology never made this promise in the mou,nor was this promise alleged in the complaint.we similarly reject ecology argument that its promise not to exercise its right to withdraw from the development project constituted fresh consideration to show the mou is an enforceable contract.the mou does not contain ecology promise that it would not withdraw from the project.rather,the mou merely reaffirms the governing regulations that if ecology withdraws from the project without a justifiable excuse it would forfeit its million securities guarantee.
ecology additionally argues there was consideration for its promises because the mou should be viewed as memorializing the contract that arose when department selected ecology as the.this argument fails because the initial license relationship between department and ecology did not create contractual duties.a license merely permits an entity to pursue a regulated activity,and has none of the elements of a contract.rosenblatt cal.bd.of pharmacy d,see mountain medical,city of colorado springs.in selecting ecology as a,the department granted ecology permission to pursue the development of an llrw,but it made no express or implied promises regarding its own role in the siting process.for similar reasons,we reject ecology argument that when it received the license it was provided with a franchise that gave rise to contractual and property rights or that a public works contract was created.under the statutory scheme,ecology status as a did not give rise to any enforceable contractual or property rights on behalf of ecology,and ecology attempts to recharacterize the relationship as a franchise or a public works contract are unavailing.
to the extent ecology alternatively seeks to base its breach of contract actions on a june letter received from the department program manager,don womeldorf,this letter is not actionable.the mou contained an integration clause with respect to the specific matters contained herein.italics added.because womeldorf statements concern the same matters addressed in the mou,they can not add to or modify the later agreement.see chaknova th,d.
we additionally reject ecology argument that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to permit it to amend the complaint to state a breach of contract based on a september lease agreement between ecology and the department.ecology submitted a copy of this lease with its opposition to the demurrer.a condition precedent to the enforceability of the lease is that the state shall have acquired,and shall be holding,fee simple absolute title to the ward valley site.ecology admits this condition was never satisfied.
we conclude the absence of consideration establishes that ecology can not state a breach of an express or implied contract cause of action based on the mou,and that ecology has failed to state a contract cause of action based on any other alleged oral or written agreement.
iii.promissory estoppel 
the lack of consideration to support the promises made in the mou is not fatal to ecology promissory estoppel claim.as our supreme court recently stated,p romissory estoppel is a doctrine which employs equitable principles to satisfy the requirement that consideration must be given in exchange for the promise sought to be enforced.citation.wilson los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,d,wilson.promissory estoppel was developed to do rough justice when a party lacking contractual protection relied on another promise to its detriment.id.at,d.a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise citations.id.at,d.
these principles apply to claims against the government,particularly where the application of the doctrine would further public policies and prevent injustice.see wilson,supra,cal th,d,hilltop properties state of california d.in wilson,a contractor which was the low bidder on a project proved at trial that the city wrongfully failed to award it the contract.wilson,supra,cal th at,d.the california supreme court held that although the contractor could not state a breach of contract action against the city,it was entitled to recover bid preparation costs under a promissory estoppel theory.id.at,d.the court noted that the city represented that it would award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder,the contractor relied on this representation,and the city thereafter violated its promise.id.at,d,see also hilltop properties state of california,supra,d.holding plaintiff stated a promissory estoppel cause of action against the state based on allegations that it detrimentally relied on a promise by state officials to buy certain real property.
in this case,ecology alleged facts that fit within the classic model of a promissory estoppel claim.these facts include the following the department made promises in the mou that it would use its best efforts to acquire property from the federal government for use as an llrw disposal facility the department should reasonably have expected these promises to induce action on the part of ecology ecology did in fact detrimentally rely on the promises by spending millions of dollars to develop the facility in anticipation of the land transfer and the department violated its promises by abandoning its efforts to acquire the ward valley site from the federal government and there was no justifiable basis for this abandonment.these facts,if true,would support a determination that an injustice would occur if the doctrine were not applied.see hilltop properties state of california,supra,d at.
defendants nonetheless argue the court properly sustained their demurrer on this claim because the department had no statutory authority to make the alleged promises enforcement of the alleged promises would be contrary to public policy and the allegations establish as a matter of law that the department fully complied with its alleged promises.as explained below,we find each of these arguments to be without merit.
statutory authority 
to be valid,administrative action must be within the scope of authority conferred by the enabling statutes.citation.terhune superior court th,d.although the courts accord great weight to the interpretation of the scope of an enabling statute by officials charged with the statute administration,final responsibility for interpretation of the law rests with courts.id.at,d.if the court determines that a challenged administrative action was not authorized by or is inconsistent with acts of the legislature,that action is void.ibid.
these rules apply to the power of an administrative agency to enter into a legally binding contract or to make enforceable promises.see air quality products,state of california d.air quality products.no contractual or promissory estoppel liability may be assessed against a state agency if the contract or promises were not statutorily or constitutionally authorized.id.at.but the legislature need not expressly give an agency the power to make enforceable promises.administrative officials may exercise such additional powers as are necessary for the due and efficient administration of powers expressly granted by statute,or as may fairly be implied from the statute granting the powers.calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d.thus,an administrative agency has the power to contract on a particular matter if this power may be fairly implied from the general statutory scheme.see youngman nevada irrigation dist.cal d,dickey raisin proration zone cal d,city and county of san francisco state of california d.
the relevant llrw statutory provisions do not expressly provide the department with the authority to make legally binding promises to the llrw but we conclude the statutory scheme as a whole reflects that the legislature intended to provide the department with the authority to do so.
in seeking to establish an llrw waste facility in california,the legislature identified the department as the lead agency responsible for ensuring the facility would be built and operational,and mandated that the facility be operated on government owned land,subd.a.the legislature directed the department to select a qualified private entity that would bear all of the costs and obligations of developing and operating this facility.see.although the legislature provided for a publicly financed option if a qualified private entity could not be found,it expressly stated its intent was to permit and encourage the private sector to establish and operate the llrw facility.stats,ch.given the economic,legal,and political complexities in establishing california first llrw facility,and the fact that the selected entity would be required to pay substantial regulatory fees and development costs during the interim stage,the legislature obviously understood the would bear an enormous risk,and could require some level of assurance that the government would comply with the obligations that were solely within its power to accomplish.
because of the unique nature of the relationship between the department and the and the fact the private entity was wholly dependent on the government good faith in complying with its necessary obligations to recover any of the licensee costs,it is reasonable to infer the legislature intended to provide the department with the authority to make binding promises to the as a necessary part of the department supervisory powers.the department obligation to supervise the private entity development of the llrw disposal facility necessarily implied powers to make assurances designed to reduce facility development costs,ensure a competent and financially sound private developer,and ensure the facility was timely established.the express statutory objective of the expeditious establishment and operation by the private sector of a llrw disposal facility would be undermined if the agency charged with the responsibility for meeting this goal did not have the power to promise to use its best efforts to comply with its own obligations,particularly the obligation to acquire suitable property for the site.see stats,ch.
in support of its arguments that the department did not have the statutory authority to make binding promises to its,defendants rely exclusively on air quality products,supra,d.in air quality products,an administrative agency the state air resources board approved an exhaust emissions control device developed by the plaintiff,but then approved a similar,but less expensive device produced by a competitor.id.at.the agency told the plaintiff that it would require installation of its device in percent of cars if the plaintiff met several specific requirements.id.at.the plaintiff allegedly met each of the agency requirements and,reasonably relying on the agency inducements,produced devices at a cost of million.ibid.the agency thereafter changed its requirements and repudiated the representations made to the plaintiff,rendering the product unmarketable.ibid.the air quality products court held that even if the complaint adequately alleged the elements of an implied contract or promissory estoppel,the plaintiff could not recover because the agency had no express or implied constitutional or statutory authority to enter into an enforceable contract with the plaintiff.id.at.
this case is distinguishable because in air quality products there was no reasonable basis for finding an implied statutory authority to make the alleged promises.in that case,the alleged promise to a single manufacturer would have undermined the statutory objective of promoting competition among emission control device manufacturers.air quality products,supra,d at.here,the alleged the department use its best efforts to acquire a site for ecology operation of an llrw not only consistent with the applicable laws,but it is a necessary premise of ensuring the private development of an llrw disposal facility on government owned land.
the air quality products court holding was also based on its view that statutory references to contracting in other portions of the statute suggested that had the legislature intended the board to have the general contractual authority argued for,the statute would expressly so provide.air quality products,supra,d at.this principle is inapplicable here.section authorizes the department to establish and operate,or contract for the establishment and operation,of one or more radioactive waste interim storage facilities for the exclusive use of persons located in california italics added.this authority was necessary because the legislature did not create a licensing procedure for the development of an interim llrw storage facility.given the difference in legislative schemes,it is not reasonable to infer the legislature specific provision for the department to contract for needs means that it necessarily intended to exclude this authority in the context.
we reject defendants additional argument that the fact there was a license relationship between the department and ecology demonstrates the legislature did not intend to authorize the creation of additional contractual obligations between the two parties.although the relationship between the parties was governed by a regulatory license,this does not logically or legally show the legislature specifically intended to preclude any other form of relationship.we further reject defendants contention that the alleged promise is inconsistent with the department ability to carry out the provisions of the compact,since it contractually restricts the department options in deciding where to locate a llrw disposal site.at the time the mou was executed,the parties were considering the ward valley and silurian valley sites,and the department promised to use its best efforts to assure the timely transfer of the relevant site.ecology alleges the department breached its promise to use its best efforts to locate an appropriate llrw facility site.this promise did not bind the department to a particular location.
we are also unpersuaded by defendants reliance on the provisions authorizing the department to revoke,suspend or restrict the llrw license.see,subd.a,subd.a.defendants argue the existence of this authority is inconsistent with ecology assertions that the department was statutorily authorized to enter into a binding contract with ecology.we disagree.the mou expressly conditions ecology continued status as a and licensee on its satisfactory completion of its duties as license designee and satisfactory performance of its duties as licensee,and reaffirms that nothing in this memorandum shall be construed as abrogating or diminishing the department exercise of its delegated police powers in the licensing or other regulation of the facility.
public policy does not defeat the complaint at the pleading stage 
defendants alternatively contend the promissory estoppel cause of action must fail because it seeks to assert an estoppel against a government entity that would be contrary to public policy.
promissory estoppel may not be invoked against a governmental body where it would operate to defeat the effective operation of a policy adopted to protect the public.citation.wilson,supra,cal th at,d.defendants argue that enforcing a promise to take all steps necessary to acquire title to the ward valley site from the united states,regardless of any difficulties of acquiring such a site due to federal environmental and safety concerns would be contrary to the state duty to act in the public interest and would contravene its police power.
although we agree with defendants that contracting away the state ability to take action to protect its citizens by way of promissory estoppel would violate public policy,that is not what ecology has alleged.ecology has alleged the state failed to acquire the ward valley site or any other appropriate site solely because of political considerations rather than environmental or safety concerns.assuming,as we must for purposes of a demurrer,that this allegation is true,enforcement of the state promise would not necessarily violate public policy.
c.the complaint adequately alleged a violation of the mou 
defendants next contend the causes of action including promissory estoppel fail because the complaint does not adequately allege a violation of the mou.
first,defendants argue the department did not violate its promise to use its best efforts to acquire a suitable site because that promise was limited in duration.defendants rely on the portion of the mou stating,w hether ward valley or silurian valley is ultimately acquired,the state will use its best efforts to assure the timely transfer of the relevant site from the federal government to the state so as not to delay the issuance of the license pursuant to the proposed schedule of facility development milestones contained in exhibit italics added.exhibit c states that it contains the project schedule represent ing the original proposed schedule included in ecology license application as amended from time to time with the concurrence of the department and ecology.the schedule projects that the ward valley site will be transferred to california in late,and ecology would begin disposal operations in spring.
the exhibit c schedule does not conclusively show ecology can not prove the department breached its promise to use its best efforts to acquire an llrw disposal facility.the timeline represents the parties proposed schedule and does not state or suggest that the parties are relieved of their obligations if outside circumstances render it necessary to extend the time schedule for land transfers and operation of the facility.further,the mou expressly contemplates that the timeline was subject to amendment from time to time.
defendants alternatively argue that even assuming the mou is valid and the best efforts language is still applicable,the allegations show the department did in fact use its best efforts to acquire the ward valley site.in support,defendants direct us to the allegations that the state unsuccessfully sued the federal government to obtain the ward valley site after secretary babbitt refused to allow its conveyance and the facts showing there was substantial public opposition to the ward valley location.although these alleged facts are certainly relevant to the best efforts issue,they are insufficient to establish department entitlement to prevail on its best efforts argument at the pleading stage.
the question whether a defendant used its best efforts under the circumstances is generally a factual issue.see gilmo
