these are four consolidated cases on appeal from the judgment of the district court sustaining regulations of the national park service governing concession contracts in the national park system.many of the issues are tied to the history of the national park system and the functions concessioners perform in the operation of the parks.
the history begins with the discovery of old faithful and the other natural wonders of what is now yellowstone national park.in,congress withdrew the land at the headwaters of the yellowstone river from settlement,occupancy,or sale,thus creating the first national park in the united states.act of,ch,stat.see also aubrey haines,yellowstone national park its exploration and establishment.not everyone had been enthusiastic about the plan to create yellowstone national park.a local newspaper editorial worried that the effect of this measure will be to keep the country a wilderness,and shut out,for many years,the travel that would seek that curious region if good roads were opened through it and hotels built therein.haines,supra,at quoting the helena daily herald of.in the final legislation,congress responded by authorizing the secretary of the interior to lease portions of the park for the erection of buildings for the accommodation of visitors.stat.

during its first thirty years,the park service followed internal regulations and policies governing concessioners and their obligations to park visitors and to the national park lands.the government also offered financial inducements to private contractors to convince them to provide and operate facilities in what were often remote locations.see park concession policy hearings before the subcomm.on national parks of the house comm.on interior and insular affairs,cong.hereinafter park concession policy hearings letter from john carver,assistant secretary of the interior.

the first issue centers on the act repeal of the statutory preferential right of renewal in of the act.the act provided that,except for small contracts and outfitter and guide services,the secretary shall not grant a concessioner a preferential right to renew a concessions contract.a savings clause in the act,a,states repeal of the act shall not affect the validity of any concessions contract or permit entered into under such act,but the provisions of this title shall apply to any such contract or permit except to the extent such provisions are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any such contract or permit,a,stat.
the park service interpreted the repealing and the savings clauses in the following narrative regulation 
what is the effect of the act repeal of the act preference in renewal 
a section of the act required the secretary to give existing satisfactory concessioners a preference in the renewal termed a renewal preference in the rest of this section of its concession contract or permit.section of the act repealed this statutory renewal preference as of november.it is the final decision of the director,subject to the right of appeal set forth in paragraph b of this section,that holders of act concession contracts are not entitled to be given a renewal preference with respect to such contracts although they may otherwise qualify for a right of preference regarding such contracts under sections and of the act as implemented in this part.however,if a concessioner holds an existing act concession contract and the contract makes express reference to a renewal preference,the concessioner may appeal to the director for recognition of a renewal preference.
b such appeal must be in writing and be received by the director no later than thirty days after the issuance of a prospectus for a concession contract under this part for which the concessioner asserts a renewal preference.the director must make a decision on the appeal prior to the proposal submission date specified in the prospectus.where applicable,the director will give notice of this appeal to all potential offerors that requested a prospectus.the director may delegate consideration of such appeals only to a deputy or associate director.the deciding official must prepare a written decision on the appeal,taking into account the content of the appeal and other available information.
c if the appeal results in a determination by the director that the act concession contract in question makes express reference to a renewal preference under section of the act,the act repeal of section of the act was inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the concession contract,and that the holder of the concession contract in these circumstances is entitled to a renewal preference by operation of law,the director will permit the concessioner to exercise a renewal preference for the contract subject to and in accordance with the otherwise applicable right of preference terms and conditions of this part,including,without limitation,the requirement for submission of a responsive proposal pursuant to the terms of an applicable prospectus.the director,similarly,will permit any holder of a act concession contract that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final order is entitled to a renewal preference,for any reason,to exercise a right of preference in accordance with the otherwise applicable requirements of this part,including,without limitation,the requirement for submission of a responsive proposal pursuant to the terms of an applicable prospectus.
the park service thus will not recognize a preferential right of renewal for concessioners whose contracts are expiring,unless the contract expressly so provides.see.at.in the language of the savings clause of a,without such contractual terms and conditions it would not be inconsistent as the park service sees refuse to allow a preferential right of renewal.
a typical concession contract runs for or years.report of the task force on national park service concessions,supra,at.one of the plaintiffs,amfac resorts,had a contract for the grand canyon.a right of renewal for contracts is therefore a matter of great interest to those holding these contracts.the concessioners say that the renewal provision of the act represented an entrenched policy that the policy was incorporated by law as an unwritten term in every concession contract signed between and and that the park service regulation violates of the act the savings clause because it allows a preferential right of renewal only if contracts before the act expressly so state.
the concessioners argument in favor of an implied right of renewal initially rests on the christian doctrine,named after christian assocs.united states.as they explain it,the doctrine requires that longstanding and agency policies,such as the park service entrenched policy of granting concessioners renewal rights in exchange for concessioner investments,form a mandatory part of all government contracts.brief for appellants at.
the federal circuit has,on occasion,concluded that certain statutory or regulatory provisions may become part of a government contract even though the contract does not contain language to that effect.see amoroso constr.united states,general engineering machine works.
our court has never adopted the federal circuit christian doctrine.even if we did so,it would boot the concessioners nothing.in describing the doctrine,they have omitted a crucial element.the federal circuit does not hold that significant or important federal policies form part of government contracts even where absent from those contracts explicit text.brief for appellants at.if that were the law,congressional power to make adjustments in legislation would be greatly constricted.statutory provisions would live on as part of contracts well after their repeal or modification.this is why,as the supreme court put it in dodge board of education,there is a presumption that a law is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the legislature shall ordain otherwise.to this the court added in passenger atchison,topeka santa fe,d hereinafter atchison policies,unlike contracts,are inherently subject to revision and repeal,and to construe laws as contracts when the obligation is not clearly and unequivocally expressed would be to limit drastically the essential powers of a legislative body.it is true,as the concessioners point out,that the holding of atchison was that a statute did not itself create a contract.reply brief for appellants at.but it is not true that the case is therefore irrelevant.id.the court reasoning applies equally to claims,such as the concessioners,that a statute here the act created a contractual obligation in all contracts executed before its repeal.see general motors romein,d.
one element of the christian doctrine,the element missing from the concessioners statement of the law,saves it from contradicting this line of supreme court authority.according to the federal circuit,it is not enough that the legislative or regulatory provision is important or significant assuming one could make such rankings.to constitute a contractual obligation even though not written in the contract,the provision must be a mandatory contract clause,a clause the as in christian,at,the to be included in contracts.thus,a mandatory contract clause that expresses a significant or deeply ingrained strand of public procurement policy is considered to be included in a contract by operation of law.amoroso constr.united states,at.and the christian doctrine applies to mandatory contract clauses which express a significant or deeply ingrained strand of public procurement policy.general engineering machine works,at.
the renewal provision contained in of the act was by no stretch a mandatory contract term.the secretary contracting authority was derived from a different part of the act,which authorized the secretary to include in contracts such terms and conditions as,in his judgment,are required to assure the concessioner of adequate protection against loss of investment resulting from discretionary acts,policies,or decisions of the secretary occurring after the contract has become effective,stat.section of the act was of another sort.it stated that the secretary shall giv e preference in the renewal of contracts or permits,stat.rather than leaving the matter to individual negotiations,required the secretary to grant a right of renewal to all concessioners,regardless of the terms of their individual concession contracts.the provision thus constituted legislation which merely declares a state policy,and directs a subordinate body to carry it into effect.dodge bd.of,at.at.we agree with the district court that if meant that the secretary had to insert a preferential right of renewal clause in all concession contracts,one would have expected a direction,or at least an authorization,to this effect.d at.there is none.
it is possible that some parties nevertheless insisted on having a right of renewal written into their contracts and that the secretary yielded.possible,but not likely.the concessioners have identified no such contract and the park service is aware of none.at.the service concession contract,in effect from to,contained no clause.see.at.the regulation under the act nevertheless allows for the possibility and,in compliance with the saving clause,states that if a concession contract contains an express right of renewal the secretary will honor it.c.
apart from the christian doctrine,each of the concessioners maintains that the park service regulation is facially invalid because it denies altogether the possibility of implied contractual rights in individual cases and prevents any concessioner in a future proceeding from offering specific evidence of a and upon contractual renewal right.if even one concessioner has such evidence,the regulations denying those rights are unlawful.brief for appellants at.in other words,although the regulation is valid as applied to dozens of concession contracts,it is invalid because of the possibility that one concessioner might have an is,an right of renewal.the argument,aimed at the validity of the regulation on its face,does not accurately state the law.
in united states salerno,d,the supreme court stated 
a facial challenge to a legislative act is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.the fact that the statute might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid,since we have not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the first amendment.
justice stevens believes that only the second sentence of the salerno excerpt states the governing principle for facial challenges.he and justice scalia have debated whether the first sentence from has become known as the instead controlling.see city of chicago morales,d plurality opinion by stevens,joined by justices souter and ginsburg id.at.at scalia,dissenting.see also anderson edwards,d santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d rehnquist,joined by justices scalia and thomas,dissenting.for our part,we have invoked salerno test to reject facial constitutional challenges.see,james madison,by hecht ludwig,chemical waste,epa,steffan perry,en banc.
the facial attack on is not,of course,on the basis that the regulation is unconstitutional.the claim is that conflicts with of the act.in national mining ass army corps of engineers,we declined to adopt the salerno test in a comparable case,stating that the supreme court has never adopted a no set of circumstances test to assess the validity of a regulation challenged as facially incompatible with governing statutory law.
our examination of supreme court precedent in national mining apparently overlooked reno flores,d.there a class of alien juveniles,arrested on suspicion of being deportable and then detained pending deportation hearings,claimed that a regulation preventing their release except to close relatives violated the due process clause and conflicted with the underlying statute.the court,speaking through justice scalia,described the case as involving only a facial challenge to the regulation and then held as follows to prevail in such a facial challenge,respondents must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the regulation would be valid.united states salerno,d.that is true as to both the constitutional challenges,see schall martin,d,and the statutory challenge,see ins national center for immigrants rights,d hereinafter ncir.at.at.see public lands council babbitt,cir applying the reno flores formulation to a statutory challenge to a regulation.pharmaceutical research mfrs.concannon,cir applying salerno in a preemption case.see also marc isserles,overcoming overbreadth facial challenges and the valid rule requirement,am.
when an intervening supreme court decision alters the law of the circuit,a panel of our court must follow the court decision in all later cases.see,mckesson islamic republic of iran,national treasury employees union flra.but here the supreme court decision was not intervening it was rendered before national mining.whether despite reno flores,national mining therefore must stand as circuit law unless and until the full court overrules it is a question unnecessary for us to answer.see lashawn barry,en banc.national mining dealt only with the formulation of salerno.it did not mention ncir,the opinion cited in reno flores for the proposition that salerno applied to statutory challenges.justice stevens,writing for the court in ncir,held that the regulation may be invalid as applied in some cases,however,does not mean that the regulation is facially invalid because it is without statutory authority.at.at.ncir,without citing salerno,echoed in a setting the sentence in salerno following the test the fact that the statute might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid,at.at.see janklow planned parenthood,d memorandum of stevens,on denial of certiorari.
either test adopted from salerno in reno flores,or the less strict ncir pose potential problems for judicial review of agency regulations,especially in this circuit.lacking a rulemaking record containing evidence relating to the rule application to a particular entity,petitioners ordinarily mount only facial attacks,often on the ground that the agency product conflicts with the statute.in such cases,the consequence of upholding the regulation because it is not invalid in all its applications reno flores,or because it is invalid in only some of its applications ncir,may be that petitioners would have to make their challenge in another circuit and in another setting,in defense of an enforcement action for instance.some of the statutes governing jurisdiction prescribe a specific time period for judicial review of regulations,restrict venue to our circuit,and may prohibit review outside the time period,except in limited circumstances.see,clean air act,b comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,a adamo wrecking united states,d united states ethyl,cir frederick davis,judicial review of rulemaking new patterns and new problems,duke.although one court has held that the clean air act,b,deprived it of jurisdiction to review epa regulations when they are applied,see potomac power epa,cir,we have ruled that preclusion must be explicit for review to be barred in an enforcement action,see indep.cmty.bankers of am.bd.of governors of fed.reserve,and that even express preclusion may not operate when the issue would have been unripe during the period of statutory review.see clean air implementation project epa.perhaps the congressional intent reflected in judicial review provisions such as b of the clean air act may also demand adjustments in the reno flores or ncir test for reviewing facial attacks on regulations,assuming the tests are not constitutionally compelled.see city of chicago morales,at.at scalia,dissenting.
whatever the outcome in such cases,the situation here is not comparable.our circuit does not have exclusive jurisdiction over park service regulations,and judicial review is not confined to a particular time period.nothing would preclude a concessioner from bringing an action for a declaratory judgment that the regulation,as applied to the concessioner,deprives it of a contractual right in violation of the savings clause.in fact,one of the consolidated actions in the district court was such a suit.amfac complaint alleged that its contract for the grand canyon was about to expire,that the contract contained an implied preferential right of renewal arising from the circumstances of the formation of the contract,that the park service regulation denied the existence of such an implied term,and that the regulation as applied to amfac therefore violated of the act.although may be valid on its face,this would not necessarily doom amfac challenge.
with this in mind,we return to the concessioners assertion that if even one concessioner has evidence showing an implied right of renewal,the regulations denying those rights are unlawful.brief for appellants at.we do not need to choose between reno flores or ncir to dispose of that contention.not even first amendment overbreadth embodies a far more difficult standard for laws to satisfy than the one the court formulated in render a law facially invalid because of the prospect of a single invalid application.an overbreadth attack will succeed only if the legislation is substantially is,only if the law reaches a substantial number of impermissible applications.new york ferber,d.that there might be one invalid application is therefore far from enough to make the regulation unlawful under any of the standards we have mentioned.
perhaps recognizing as much,the concessioners assert that some contracts might as a factual matter include the renewal right as a term,a possibility despite obstacles posed by the parol evidence rule and perhaps statutes of fraud they think is enough to render the regulation unlawful.brief for appellants at.but far more is demanded before a regulation may be declared facially invalid.under reno flores,must of course be sustained on its face because there are circumstances in which applying the regulation would not be inconsistent with of the act.the regulation requirement of an express contract term,for instance,properly eliminates claims of an implied renewal right based on the christian doctrine alone.even under the more relaxed standard of ncir,it is not enough that some contracts might as a factual matter contain an implied renewal right.to repeat,that the regulation may be invalid as applied in some cases,however,does not mean that the regulation is facially invalid because it is without statutory authority.ncir,at.at.we therefore reject the concessioners facial attack on.
in reaching this result we have followed a course different than that of the district court.we should explain why.the district court thought the lawfulness of the defendants regulations turns on whether the plaintiffs each have a contractual right to preference renewal.d at.with this we agree.we also our discussion of the christian doctrine the district court conclusion that the act did not itself confer a contractual renewal right on the concessioners.id.at.as to the concessioners allegations that they had an contract embodying their right of renewal,the court rejected these claims on the basis that the administrative record provides no indication that the parties had the mutual understanding that the contract contained the renewal terms.id.at.the court must have had in mind all existing concession contracts,not just one.the court added that the administrative record is wholly devoid of information suggesting that the park service intended the renewal term to be part of the contract.id.but that is entirely understandable in light of the fact that the park service proposed rule dealing with rights of renewal did not contain the restriction requiring the renewal right to be spelled out as an express term.see concessions contracts,at proposed june.the concessioners thus had no reason to submit evidence of implied renewal rights in each of their contracts,assuming this sort of evidence would have been allowed in the rulemaking proceeding or could have been mustered.moreover,the park service never indicated that its final regulation rested on the district court rationale.see sec chenery.after denying that the right could be inferred from the act,the park service explained that an implied renewal right is inconsistent with the express terms of almost all current nps concession contracts.at.most contracts,according to the park service,contained a provision along these lines 
this contract or permit and the administration of it by the secretary shall be subject to the laws of congress governing the area and rules,regulations and policies whether now in force or hereafter enacted or promulgated.
id.but that begs the question the concessioners posed here and in the rulemaking,see comments of the national park hospitality ass at.the savings clause of the act is one of the laws of congress to which this contractual provision refers.if a concessioner has an implied right of renewal in a contract,the savings clause preserves it.the park service does not deny the possibility of an implied contractual is,an unwritten government contracts.see willard boyd,iii robert huffman,the treatment of and contracts and promissory estoppel in the united states claims court,cath.michael walch,note,dealing with a uncle implied contracts with federal government agencies,stan.the district court,quoting hercules,united states,d,summarized the law on the subject an contract requires a meeting of the minds,which may be inferred from the conduct of the parties showing,in light of the surrounding circumstances,their tacit understanding.the concessioners alleged that there have been such meetings of the mind,at least in some instances.nonetheless,we agree with the district court that the regulation is facially valid.as we explained earlier,the possibility that one or some concessioners had an renewal right is not a sufficient basis for holding of the regulations invalid on its face.
this still leaves the allegations in amfac complaint that was inconsistent with the savings clause of the act as applied to amfac concession contract for the grand canyon.complaint of amfac resorts at.amfac entered into that contract in.the contract expired on december,after the district court judgment.amfac turned out to be the only offeror and so the government argues that its challenge to the regulation is moot amfac can have no preference for the park service to consider when there are no other offerors.brief for appellees at.even if amfac eventually won the grand canyon contract,a subject about which we are not informed,we do not believe its challenge would necessarily be moot.amfac argues that because threw its alleged implied renewal right in doubt,it was forced to bid more generously for the grand canyon contract than it otherwise would have.reply brief for appellants at.if this assertion can be proven,see lujan defenders of wildlife,d,then amfac continues to suffer an injury and the case is not moot.see scheduled airlines traffic offices dep t of.
amfac can succeed in its claim that the regulation is invalid to its grand canyon contract only if it can prove the essential the regulation,in contradiction to the savings clause of the act,deprived it of a contractual right.amfac therefore should be allowed to adduce proof of its alleged implied right of renewal and should be permitted reasonable discovery to this end.the district court refused to allow any discovery on the ground that judicial review of the regulation must be confined to the administrative record,except in limited circumstances not presented here.d at.see am.bankers ass credit union,esch yeutter.we said in american bankers,with respect to a claim that a regulation conflicted with a statute,that the court did not even need the administrative record to determine the validity of the regulation.at.but we were speaking there of a facial attack on the regulation.we agree with the district court denial of discovery to that extent.amfac claim is another matter.its evidence of an implied renewal right would not be presented to show what the park service did or did not consider in promulgating of the regulations.it would be presented instead to show that the regulation would deprive it of a contractual right in contravention of the savings clause in the act.in this respect,the evidence amfac proposes to adduce is akin to proof of its injury.those challenging agency action must establish that they have standing and to do this,they must prove that the action causes injury to them.lujan,at.at.they are not confined to the administrative record.far from it.beyond the pleading stage,they must support their claim of injury with evidence.id.so here.in mounting an challenge to a regulation,whether in defense of an enforcement action or as here in an action for a declaratory judgment,the party making the challenge,in most instances evidence outside the administrative record to show why its particular circumstances render the regulation unlawful.
we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on amfac challenge to the prospectus for concessions at the grand canyon national park.in doing so,we recognize that one of the claims of another plaintiff,hamilton stores,might be construed as an as applied challenge similar to that of amfac.complaint of hamilton stores,at.but the concessioners brief presents no argument to this effect in fact,neither the concessioners brief nor their reply brief even mentions this portion of the hamilton stores complaint.we thus view the claim,which the district court rejected,as having been waived on appeal.see,doe dist.of columbia,per curiam.
the act,as did the act,recognized that the united states owns all capital improvements constructed on federal land within the national park system.d.nonetheless,the act gave concessioners a leasehold surrender interest in any capital improvement the concessioner constructs pursuant to a concession contract.a.the act defines capital improvement as a structure,fixture,or nonremovable equipment provided by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract.e.when the concession contract expires or is terminated,the incumbent is entitled to receive from its successor or the government the value of this interest.c.the amount of each concessioner leasehold surrender interest or,as the parties call it,equal to the initial value construction cost of the capital improvement,increased or decreased by a percentage measured by the consumer price index,less depreciation.a.if the expiring concession contract is renewed,the concessioner lsi carries over.b.
the are unhappy with the park service regulations implementing these and other lsi provisions of the act.they say that capital improvement is a technical accounting term that all companies,as a matter of financial reporting,tax accounting,and sound business practice use to distinguish upgrades to facilities from ordinary repair and maintenance costs.brief for appellants at.for support they cite an affidavit from an accountant submitted by amfac in the district court.but the district court refused to consider,in this facial challenge,affidavits not submitted as part of the administrative record,d at,and so shall we.concessioners have not attempted to show why affidavits outside the agency record should be considered.see steven stark sarah wald,setting no records the failed attempt to limit the record in review of administrative action,admin.still,we may acknowledge the standard accounting definition of capital expenditure that extends the useful life of the asset or increases the asset value,and is not repair and maintenance.whether an expenditure fits within the first category and thus must be depreciated or amortized,or the other category and thus must be expensed,often calls for difficult,judgments.see glenn welsch charles zlatkovich,intermediate accounting ed gary schugart,et,survey of accounting ed glenn welsch daniel short,fundamentals of financial accounting ed.as to tax accounting,which the concessioners invoke without any citation to the law,we think this is entirely beside the point.the tax code states that no deduction shall be allowed for a ny amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property or estate.in practice,there is a decided tilt to capitalizing many items because deductions are,as the supreme court put it in indopco,commissioner,d,strictly construed.that rule of interpretation,of course,has no bearing on whether a particular expenditure by a concessioner should be treated as an addition to its lsi.besides,we do not understand what the concessioners see as the problem here.the regulation of the park service repeats,word for word,the statute definition of capital improvement.compare e with.to the extent the concessioners are claiming that it was incumbent upon the park service to add a gloss to the statutory definition,a gloss drawn from accounting standards,they are mistaken,as the district court held.see d at.while agencies may have leeway in interpreting the statutes they administer,there is no rule of law compelling them to embellish what congress has enacted.
the concessioners also complain about of the regulations,and the repair and maintenance reserve in the park service standard concession contract.at.section provides that concessioners do not earn lsi for repair and maintenance of real property improvements unless a repair and maintenance project is a major rehabilitation.major rehabilitation is defined in as a comprehensive rehabilitation project the construction cost of which exceeds fifty percent of the value of the structure.the phrase repair and maintenance is not defined,in the regulations or in the act.the standard concession contract requires concessioners to establish a reserve fund for repairs and maintenance projects,which may include repair or replacement of foundations,building frames,window frames,sheathing,subfloors,drainage,rehabilitation of building systems such as electrical,plumbing,heating and air conditioning,roof replacement and similar projects.at.
the concessioners object that allows lsi only for projects costing more than of a structure replacement costs.what types of projects they do not say.if the project is a capital improvement it is added to the lsi no matter what the cost of construction.see d at.if the project is for repair and maintenance it does not qualify,as even the concessioners agree.the regulation with the question whether an outlay that would otherwise be considered an expenditure for repair and maintenance should constitute a capital improvement because,for instance,the repairs are so extensive.how a particular project should be classified will depend greatly on the particular facts,as it does even in tax cases.see indopco,at.at.nonetheless,the parties quarrel about hypothetical projects.the park service says that if a concessioner replaced a damaged dry wall or a rotted beam in a building these would not qualify as capital improvements and thus would not be included in the concessioner lsi.brief for appellees at.at.the concessioners argue that the cost of replacing a hotel brick fireplace would be included.d at.replacement of a foundation,according to the concessioners,also would clearly be a capital improvement according to the park service it would not qualify because a foundation is merely a component of a structure,rather than a structure,fixture or nonremoveable equipment.compare brief for appellants at with brief for appellees at.this last dispute arises because the repair and maintenance reserve clause in the standard contract mentions foundations.but all the clause says is that repair and maintenance may include repair or replacement of foundations.at.
the district court,after considering these arguments and others,thought it could not give a definitive answer to the issues thus posed.echoing reno flores,at.at,and ncir,at.at,without citing the cases,the court ruled as follows the court can not say that the regulation,on its face,will be unlawful in its every application.thus,this challenge to the regulation must fail.d at.the court was referring only to the concessioners attack on the repair and maintenance reserve clause but we think its reasoning applies equally to the rule in.it is entirely possible that a project calling for repairs to a roof,the replacement of floor boards,the renovation of wiring and plumbing,and so forth would not ordinarily qualify as a capital improvement.yet if the total cost of the repair project exceeded of the value of the structure it would be added to the lsi.see.in that circumstance a concessioner would have no cause for complaint.on the other hand,if the rehabilitation project satisfied the statutory and regulatory definition of a capital improvement it would be unlawful for the park service to invoke and refuse to treat the expenditure as an addition to the concessioner lsi.we do not suggest that the park service would do anything of the sort.see.at.our point is that on the face of the regulations,the most we can imagine is that in some on how the park service administers the lsi may be a conflict with the statute.that is not a sufficient basis for holding the regulations unlawful on their face,for the reasons given in part of this opinion.
the concessioners have two other problems with the lsi regulations.the first relates to a and the valuation of lsi each concessioner leasehold surrender interest is equal to the initial value construction cost of the capital improvement,increased or decreased by a percentage measured by the consumer price index,less depreciation.the implementing regulation,defines construction cost as the total of the incurred eligible direct and indirect costs necessary for constructing or installing the capital improvement eligible direct and indirect costs are costs in amounts no higher than those prevailing in the locality of the project,id.it is this locality limitation to which the concessioners object.projects in national parks,they tell us,are almost always more expensive to construct than similar private projects in nearby localities,and congress could not reasonably have intended that concessioners swallow such costs without lsi credit,a point the park service does not dispute.brief for appellants at.but as the park service points out,the concessioners argument assumes that locality means outside the national park.the regulations do not so state and we see no basis for indulging in that assumption.it may be that the park service particular interpretation regarding a particular project in a particular national park could unreasonably limit the valuation of a concessioner lsi.but that is no reason to hold that the regulation conflicts with the statute or that it is arbitrary.if a concessioner has its own construction company,as some apparently do,nothing in the act requires the park service to accept whatever amount the concessioner decides to charge itself for the construction work.see.at.like the district court,we therefore sustain the regulation.
the concessioners remaining problem with the lsi regulations deals with a if the concessioner makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest,the cost of such additional capital improvement shall be added to the then current value of the concessioner leasehold surrender interest.their claim is that of the regulations conflicts with this provision.the regulation states 
a concessioner that replaces an existing fixture in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest with a new fixture will increase its leasehold surrender interest by the amount of the construction cost of the replacement fixture less the construction cost of the replaced fixture.
this regulation is unlawful,according to the concessioners,because there is nothing in the statute allowing subtractions from a concessioner lsi.they also believe the calculations required by the regulation would be an administrative nuisance.in the grand canyon concession,for instance,there are about structures with many thousands of fixtures.
the district court sustained the regulation for reasons given by the park service,reasons we also find persuasive.without the regulation,concessioners would receive a windfall every time they removed a fixture and replaced it with a new one 
if a concessioner with a leasehold surrender interest in the hotel were to replace the hotel furnace once every five years for years,the plaintiffs proposed accounting would be to increase the leasehold surrender interest three separate times by the cost of the furnace.under this approach,the concessioner would hold a leasehold surrender interest equal to four furnaces,even though the hotel would only contain one.
d at.as to the concessioners textual argument,it is true that the statute speaks only of additions not subtractions.but under the regulation the calculation is of net additions to difference between the cost of the new fixture and the discarded one.when concessioners replace fixtures for a greater cost,their lsi will increase.the regulation deals with how much the increase should be.the statute,which speaks in terms of additions not replacements,does not address that subject.we therefore reject the concessioners argument that of the regulations is inconsistent with a.we reject as well their argument that the regulation is unreasonable.the park service policy of avoiding the windfalls that would result without the regulation is reason enough to sustain,despite the administrative burdens it may generate.
the concessioners claim the park service wrongly excluded concessions contracts from coverage under the contract disputes act,et.see.at.
enacted in,the contract disputes act provides an alternative forum for government contract disputes.rather than seeking judicial relief in the court of federal claims,a contractor may appeal decisions by a contracting official to an administrative board within that agency.the board decision may be appealed to the court of appeals for the federal circuit.g.
section of the regulations states that concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of the contract disputes act.with this we agree.the act applies to any express or implied contract for the procurement of property,services or construction.a.a procurement contract,the park service reasoned,is a contract for which the government bargains for,and pays for,and receives goods and services.at.concession contracts are not of that sort.their function is not to procure services or goods for the government.instead,as the park service put it,concession contracts authorize third parties to provide services to park area visitors.id.while the park service does not administer the contract disputes act,and thus may not have interpretative authority over its provisions,its reasoning finds support not only in the terms of that statute but also in the national parks omnibus management act of,under which the park service may enter into concession contracts to authorize a person,corporation or other entity to provide accommodations,facilities and services to visitors to national parks.the committee reports accompanying the act also concluded that concession contracts do not constitute contracts for the procurement of goods and services for the benefit of the government or otherwise,at,at,a position the park service had reached earlier with respect to concession contracts under the act.see,concessions contracts and permits,at,reiterating that the park service has never considered concessions contracts a type of federal procurement contract.the court of federal claims,considering the nature of concession contracts,also concluded that this arrangement does not constitute a procurement,but is a grant of a permit to operate a business.yrt servs.united states,fed.cl.the decision rested,in part,on the fact that the government is not committing to pay out government funds or incur any monetary liability.id.
as against this analysis,the concessioners cite several decisions of the interior department board of contract appeals ibca,a body created by interior department regulations,see a et.the ibca has held that the contract disputes act applies to concession contracts.see,appeal of watch hill concession,ibca,wl appeal of park concessions,ibca,wl.but the decisions of this body on any question of law shall not be final or conclusive.b.and the ibca rationale for determining that concession contracts are procurement contracts is flawed.in its first opinion to consider the issue,the ibca acknowledged that the contract disputes act does not cover all contracts but then assumed that the act does apply unless coverage is explicitly foreclosed.see appeal of r r,ibca,wl,at.nothing in the act suggests such a sweeping presumption.another ibca opinion states that if any benefit can be traced to the government,then the contract disputes act must apply.appeal of park concessions,ibca,wl,at.the primary purpose of concessions contracts is to permit visitors to enjoy national parks in a manner consistent with preservation of the parks.that the government receives monetary compensation or incidental benefits from the concessioners performance is not enough to sweep these contracts into the ambit of the contract disputes act.
the concessioners last complaint deals with the portion of the new regulations designed to deal with transactions involving corporate concessioners see.at.one of the regulations states 
the concessioner may not assign,sell,convey,grant,contract for,or otherwise transfer such transactions collectively referred to as assignments for purposes of this part,without the prior written approval of the director,any of the following 
a any concession contract 
c any controlling interest in a concessioner or concession contract 
a c.a similar regulation prohibits,without prior approval,any encumbrance of a controlling interest in a concessioner.c.in the concessioners view,th
