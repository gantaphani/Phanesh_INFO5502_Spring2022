in,serco was awarded a million,contract by the department of defense,navy space and naval warfare systems command spawar to provide project management,engineering design,and installation support services for a range of government projects the naval electronic surveillance systems ness contract was a type of contract that provides for an indefinite quantity,within stated limits,of supplies or services during a fixed period.a.pursuant to the ness contract,spawar submitted individual delivery orders to serco that detailed the specific work serco was to perform.
in,the department of homeland security,customs and border protection dhs entered into an interagency contract with spawar to upgrade the wireless communications systems situated along the united border.this project became known as the advanced wireless systems spectrum relocation project aws project.the contract required spawar to implement a cost and progress tracking system known as an earned value management system evms,a project management tool that effectively integrates the project scope of work with cost,schedule and performance elements for optimum project planning and control.
spawar,in turn,subcontracted with serco to purchase the necessary equipment,perform upgrades,and provide project management services for the aws project.because these services were covered under the ness contract,spawar issued delivery orders and to serco under the ness contract detailing the work that serco was to perform on the aws project delivery orders and provided for different periods of performance from september to january,but were nearly identical in all other respects.each delivery order contained a statement of work sow that required serco to provide project management and cost reports to spawar,including evm reports,in accordance with the attached cdrls contract data requirements lists.the attached cdrls specified contractor serco format acceptable.create reports using ms office applications.
serco employees manually recorded their hours on serco internal accounting system using a single charge code for all tasks they performed on the aws project.serco then compiled the time entries into microsoft ms excel spreadsheets to create monthly cost reports that it sent to spawar.in january,serco informed spawar that it could not automate its accounting system or accommodate the thousands of aws project task that spawar used in the reports it sent to dhs under its interagency contract.spawar advised serco that it would accept serco monthly cost reports on ms excel spreadsheets using information that serco employees tracked and compiled manually.spawar also advised that dhs was aware of serco cost tracking format and had approved it.
serco hired kelly as an evm analyst in october to monitor serco performance on the aws project and identify any cost or schedule overruns.in april,kelly informed dhs that serco monthly cost reports were unreliable because they tracked costs manually and with a single charge code in violation of the guidelines in the american national standards industries alliance standard.kelly also informed dhs that serco was falsifying its monthly reports to make its actual costs match the expected budget for the aws project.that same month,dhs and spawar determined that evm reports were no longer necessary or for the aws project.spawar directed serco to reduce the number of evm analysts working on the aws project.kelly supervisors at serco,unaware of his recent report to dhs,terminated kelly in may.following his termination,kelly position no longer existed at serco.
kelly filed suit against serco as a qui tam relator under the fca,asserting the following claims for relief submitting false claims for payment in violation of the fca under a theory of implied false certification,making false records material to a false or fraudulent claim in violation of the fca,conspiring to violate the fca,retention of overpayments in violation of the fca,and unlawful termination in violation of public policy under california common law 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of serco on all of kelly claims.the district court also denied as moot serco motion to strike the opinion and deposition testimony of kelly expert,kevin martin,on whether serco compliance with was incorporated by reference into the delivery orders and whether serco internal system was capable of complying with.this timely appeal followed.

kelly principal contention on appeal is that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment on his fca claim alleging that serco submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment under an implied false certification theory of liability.see a a.the fca qui tam provision permits a private person known as a relator to bring a civil action on behalf of the united states against any individual or company who has knowingly presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the united states.id.b see id.a a imposing civil liability on any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval the fca encourages insiders to disclose fraud by awarding successful qui tam plaintiffs a portion of any judgment,plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs.id.d.
under the implied false certification theory advanced by kelly,a defendant act of submitting a claim for payment impliedly certifies compliance with all conditions of payment.universal health,united states ex rel.escobar.the district court determined that it is only possible for a claimant to implicitly certify compliance with a law,rule,or regulation if there is a relevant statute,rule,regulation,or contract in place that conditions payment of the claim on compliance with that underlying law,rule or regulation.it therefore analyzed whether any statute,regulation,or contractual provision conditioned serco right to payment on its compliance with.
the federal acquisition regulation far provides that government contracts that require a contractor to use an evms must include a form clause stating that the evms shall comply with.c,a.similarly,the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars provides that government contracts valued at million or more must include a form clause stating that the contractor shall use an evms that complies with.id,b.it is undisputed here that the ness contract and delivery orders and do not contain or incorporate by reference the far or dfars form clauses requiring compliance with.
instead,the ness contract incorporated the form clause in,which provides that t he government shall pay the contractor serco,upon the submission of proper invoices or vouchers,the prices stipulated in this contract for supplies delivered and accepted or services rendered and accepted.although the delivery orders referenced under a list of applicable documents,significantly both orders provided that,i n the event of a conflict between the text of the delivery order and the applicable document cited herein,the text of the delivery order should take precedence.the orders terms required serco to deliver its project management reports in accordance with the attached cdrls,which provided that serco own format and its use of microsoft office applications including excel spreadsheets to create the reports were acceptable.
in granting summary judgment for serco,the district court concluded that kelly implied false certification claim failed as a matter of law because there is no regulation that expressly conditions payment for the vouchers on serco compliance with ansi,and neither the ness contract nor the delivery orders require d compliance with ansi as a condition of payment by the government.it further held that,at best,any implied contractual requirement in the delivery orders that conditions serco payment on compliance with is not a false claim,but a breach of contract.
kelly argues on appeal that the district court applied the wrong legal standard by analyzing whether the underlying regulations or delivery orders expressly conditioned serco payment on its compliance with.the proper analysis,kelly argues,is whether serco failure to disclose that its data was falsified and that its evm reports did not comply with was material to the government payment decision.
at the time of the district court ruling,federal circuits were split on whether an implied false certification theory under the fca requires that payment be expressly conditioned on a defendant compliance with a statutory,regulatory,or contractual requirement.see united states ex rel.kelly serco,civ.wqh rbb,wl,at cal.recently,however,the supreme court clarified the circumstances supporting fca liability under an implied false certification theory.escobar,at.
in escobar,the supreme court rejected the contention that a government contract or regulation must expressly designate a requirement as a condition of payment in order to trigger liability under the theory of implied certification.id.the court reasoned that concerns about fair notice and liability can be effectively addressed through strict enforcement of the act materiality and scienter requirements,which are rigorous.id.at quoting united states science applications int l,cir.saic instead,the supreme court held 
false claims act liability for failing to disclose violations of legal requirements does not turn upon whether those requirements were expressly designated as conditions of payment.defendants can be liable for violating requirements even if they were not expressly designated as conditions of payment.conversely,even when a requirement is expressly designated a condition of payment,not every violation of such a requirement gives rise to liability.what matters is not the label the government attaches to a requirement,but whether the defendant knowingly violated a requirement that the defendant knows is material to the government payment decision.
the court further held that the implied certification theory can be a basis for liability,at least where two conditions are satisfied first,the claim does not merely request payment,but also makes specific representations about the goods or services provided and second,the defendant failure to disclose noncompliance with material statutory,regulatory,or contractual requirements makes those representations misleading,representations that state the truth only so far as it goes,while omitting critical qualifying information.id.at emphasis added.
kelly argues that serco compliance with was an implied condition of its right to payment under delivery orders and because the delivery orders required serco to deliver evm reports,is the only industry standard for evm reporting,and the delivery orders referenced under applicable documents.thus,kelly contends,serco submission of its public vouchers for the delivery orders constituted an implied false certification that its deliverables met guidelines and were not falsified.
even assuming that serco compliance with was a condition of payment for its work under delivery orders and,kelly implied false certification claim nonetheless fails as a matter of law.first,there is no evidence that serco public vouchers made any specific representations about serco performance.see escobar,at.serco submitted public vouchers totaling over million to the department of defense for its work under delivery orders and.each voucher was submitted on standard form and provided the period of performance,total costs incurred during that period,and serco fee applicable to that work.each voucher also included a continuation sheet listing the dollar amounts for serco costs for labor,travel,and materials.serco additionally submitted backup documentation for each voucher,which included its internal proj
