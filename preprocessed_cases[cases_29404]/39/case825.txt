this case involves the retroactive reclassification of local government employees from miscellaneous to firefighter,a safety membership which earns better pension benefits.see,subd.c,further undesignated section references are to this code.
we agree with the trial court that the employees in this case were firefighters as defined by statute.we also agree with the trial court view it was bound by one of our prior decisions to conclude the employees were entitled to no relief because of a statute of limitations purportedly applicable to reclassification of employees subject to the public employees retirement law perl.et auto equity sales,superior court cal d.the trial court exercised its right to explain why it believed our prior opinion was incorrect.see people musante d.conc.opn.of gardner.we agree with the trial judge that our prior opinion was in error.accordingly,we shall reverse with directions.
background 
the public employees retirement law,et establishes a retirement system for certain state and local government employees.pers was enacted to effect economy and efficiency in the public service by providing a means whereby employees who became superannuated or otherwise incapacitated may,without hardship or prejudice,be replaced by more capable employees,and to that end provide a retirement system consisting of retirement compensation and death benefits.city employees become members of pers when their employing city elects,via contract with the pers board,to have them covered by pers.citations.under pers,a city employee who is a member of the system may be classified as either local miscellaneous citation or local safety citation,depending on the nature of the principal tasks and duties of the employee position.the distinction between the two classifications is important,as local safety members receive superior retirement benefits compared to those received by local miscellaneous members.city of huntington beach board of administration cal th,d,fn.omitted.
in,the city of oakland city contracted with the california public employees retirement system pers to expand its pers membership to include local safety members.the city operates the oakland fire department.a city agency,the port of oakland,operates oakland international airport.as a condition of federal aviation regulations,the airport operated a unit of employees called airport servicemen servicemen,who were classified as local miscellaneous members.in,based on certain duties they perform,the servicemen,through their labor organization,sought to be reclassified as safety members,especially for the purposes of this appeal,as local firefighters.see.if successful,this application shall entitle the servicemen to better pension benefits.the city opposed the request for reclassification.pursuant to a memorandum of understanding mou,the position was abolished in and existing incumbents either transferred into the oakland fire department or into a new classification.
the city employed servicemen since.
it appears the mou and the reclassification application were inspired by a february labor arbitration decision confirmed by the alameda county superior court which concluded the city failed to provide necessary safety equipment and training to the servicemen.the award concluded that by virtue of their duties and federal aviation regulations,the servicemen were safety employees.based in part on this award,the servicemen filed an application for reclassification in august.
the city at first opposed the application on only first,because the servicemen were not part of the oakland fire department,they were not firefighters second,because they did not fight fires except occasionally,they were not firefighters.
pers opposed the application,but only in part.pers agreed with the servicemen that an employee did not have to be called a firefighter,nor work for a fire department in order to be a firefighter as defined by statute.pers urged the servicemen were not firefighters,at least not before,when they spent a lot of time fueling aircraft.pers argued after the fueling duties were abandoned,it appears that the principal duties of this position constituted active firefighting,and that since they had no other principal duties,they can be deemed to be in a de facto fire department which makes them eligible for coverage as local firefighter members of calpers under section for that period.
a administrative hearing took place.
in a closing brief,the city raised some new issues first,prior requests for reclassification had not been appealed to the pers board second,any reclassification could not be retroactive beyond the date of a telephonic denial of reclassification and third,reclassification could not apply to labor performed before,due to the mistake statute,as well as a statute limiting actions for payments into and out of the pers fund.
in january,an administrative law judge alj concluded the servicemen were entitled to calpers local firefighter safety status under section,retroactive to july.
the alj addressed timeliness issues as follows 
the city suggests that the right of airport servicemen to retroactive adjustment of their benefits is limited.this is because they earlier petitioned calpers for safety status and were denied.no appeal was taken of these earlier decisions.it is argued that local is foreclosed from challenging pers previous decisions since it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies in prior proceedings.nicholson lucas th d los angeles county employee association v.county of los angeles d.hittle santa barbara county employees retirement cal d.
while there may have been separate inquiries by individual airport servicemen in the past,some retired,local application for safety status was not formally made until august.an inquiry to calpers made by an attorney on behalf of retired airport servicemen would not preclude the instant application for change in status.
nicholson is inapplicable to these facts,and both the los angeles county and hittle decisions can be distinguished.in the former case,petitions for writ of mandate were dismissed on the ground that the employees had not exhausted administrative remedies prior to seeking relief in the courts.here,neither airport servicemen nor local have sought judicial review.hittle found that there was no failure to exhaust administrative remedies where the notice to the employee informing him of his rights was ambiguous and uninformative.local suggests that here,in the absence of a formal decision and notice of appeal rights,airport servicemen are not precluded from seeking reclassification to local firefighter status because of earlier inquiries.local is not precluded from applying for reclassification in these proceedings.
the city further argues that this action is subject to a statute of limitation because it essentially seeks to enforce a statutory duty to obtain relief on ground of mistake.
the statute of limitations contained in government code section b applies to erroneous payments into or out of the retirement fund,not to reclassifications.the three year statute of limitations in the code of civil procedure is also inapplicable.government code section a provides that calpers obligations to its members continue throughout their respective memberships and its obligations to retired members continue throughout the lives of the retired members,and thereafter until all obligations to their respective beneficiaries,if any,have been discharged.to the extent that the two statutes conflict,the more specific language in the retirement statute should govern.calpers also notes that section is a substantive statute creating an ongoing duty to properly discharge its obligations.the procedural statute of limitations does not appear to override this duty.
airport servicemen are not entitled to prospective safety status classification.as a result of the reorganization,this position will no longer exist.incumbents will be given a choice of applying as firefighters,or assuming a newly developed position entitled airport operations specialist.those becoming firefighters will be entitled to pers safety status.airport operations specialists will have no basis for claiming pers safety status.after review of all the evidence and legal arguments,and by reason of the foregoing discussion,it is determined that airport servicemen are entitled to calpers local firefighter safety status under section,retroactive to july.underscoring in original,fn.omitted.
the city urged the pers board to reject the alj decision.in part,the city urged 
the airport servicemen classification has existed at the oakland airport since july.pers safety status was first available in the city of oakland in.in the twenty years since then,calpers has consistently excluded airport servicemen from safety status,despite three separate opportunities after to review this status.during that entire period,the port of oakland has made retirement contributions on behalf of airport servicemen in reliance on calpers determination of miscellaneous status.
adoption of the proposed decision would create an enormous unfunded liability.the actual cost to the port of such a drastic change in interpretation is likely to be huge,with employees in this classification at the time of hearing,and twenty years of history.ironically,this new liability would be created by the very agency upon whose original and repeated determinations the port relied in funding only miscellaneous retirement status.even more daunting is the potential cost of a new interpretation,not limited to airport fire personnel,but extended to the numerous other employees who perform the task of law enforcement or firefighting,but who do work in an established police,fire,or public safety department,or any of the other identified departments set forth in the various statutes.if this change is to be implemented,it should be implemented legislatively,and prospectively,rather than by adjudicative action,retroactively.
in april,after a pers board member used a quacks like a duck analogy to show it is more important to be a firefighter than to be called a firefighter,the pers board adopted the alj written decision as its own decision.
the city filed a petition for writ of mandate to overturn the pers board decision,contesting whether the servicemen qualified as firefighters,and whether a statute of limitations barred the relief they sought.
at argument in the trial court,the city offered yet another theory pers was free to reclassify the servicemen,but pers could not seek any money retroactive retirement contributions from the city to pay for it.pers argued that each contracting agency had a specific account within pers and pers had no other lawful way to fund a reclassification of the city employees than by exacting retroactive contributions from the city.the latter view accords with the mandate that pers remain actuarially sound.see valdes cory d.
in a frank exchange with counsel,and in his written ruling,the trial court agreed with the pers board,both as to the servicemen status as firefighters and as to their claim of entitlement to reclassification.however,the trial court felt bound by a statute of limitations holding in one of our prior opinions,discussed more fully below,with which the trial court disagreed.county of mono public employees retirement system th,d county of mono.based on county of mono,the trial court concluded reclassification was barred by a statute of limitations applicable to civil actions based on mistake.code civ,subd.d the mistake statute.the trial court found a inquiry by a union representative triggered this statute.we append the relevant text of the trial court ruling to this opinion.
the servicemen and pers appealed from the judgment granting the petition,and the city filed a protective.we reverse with directions.
discussion 
first we will discuss whether a statute of limitations bars the administrative reclassification proceeding in this case.next,we will discuss the merits of the application to reclassify the servicemen as firefighters.we find the trial court correctly concluded the pers board properly deemed the application to reclassify to be timely and the trial court correctly concluded the pers board properly found the application to reclassify the servicemen had merit.
the trial court found the mistake statute was triggered by telephone calls in regarding the duties the servicemen performed.
according to handwritten sheets of notepaper in the record,in some phone calls took place between a pers employee and persons representing the city and the servicemen the pers employee concluded that because the servicemen did not work for the oakland fire department,they were not firefighters.no written indicia of any formal action by pers appears in the administrative record.there is also a letter to an attorney,referring to prior contacts,stating servicemen do not qualify as firefighters and we give notice of your appeal rights,if you wish to litigate it.it is not clear from the face of the letter whom the attorney represented.the city implies he was representing all of the servicemen,but pers and the servicemen,pointing to other parts of the record,demonstrate he was representing four retired servicemen,at least some of whom had retired before the contract amendment extended safety coverage to city employees.in any event,the city did not allege the letter as a discovery fact in its mandamus petition,so the matter is not before us.we need not address whether the calls were enough to trigger the running of an ordinary civil statute of limitations,because we conclude no statute of limitations bars an administrative claim for reclassification.we observe the incident did not result in an administrative hearing,nor in civil litigation.
a public employee pension constitutes an element of compensation,and a vested contractual right to pension benefits accrues upon acceptance of employment.betts board of administration cal d.the contractual basis of a pension right is the exchange of an employee services for the pension right offered by the statute.claypool wilson th,d see board of administration wilson th,d.
the pers laws are to be interpreted in favor of the employee or beneficiary when a semantic ambiguity is presented by the statute at issue.city of sacramento public employees retirement system d.see,pearl workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,construing perl to preclude application of labor code limit on psychiatric disabilities for pers safety members.the pers board interpretation and application of the statutes is to be given great weight.city of sacramento public employees retirement system,supra,d at.see state bd.of equalization cal d.although pension legislation is to be construed liberally,this rule should not blindly be followed so as to eradicate the clear language and purpose of the statute and allow eligibility for those for whom it was obviously not intended.neeley board of retirement d.neeley.
the servicemen suggest the pers board decision is akin to a formal administrative interpretation and not merely the adjudication of this dispute.we disagree.see culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization cal d,agency position was not the equivalent of a regulation or ruling of general application but was merely its litigating position in this particular matter.we also reject the city efforts to invoke the pers board staff proposals as interpretive aids.
the pers board is governed by the california constitution and statutes.the california constitution formerly provided the pers board was to act with three,equal,criteria in mind providing member benefits minimizing employer contributions and defraying administrative costs.the california constitution now provides in relevant part 
notwithstanding any other provisions of law or this constitution to the contrary,the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall have plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the system,subject to all of the following 
a the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall have the sole and exclusive fiduciary responsibility over the assets of the public pension or retirement system.the retirement board shall also have sole and exclusive responsibility to administer the system in a manner that will assure prompt delivery of benefits and related services to the participants and their beneficiaries 
b the members of the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall discharge their duties with respect to the system solely in the interest of,and for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to,participants and their beneficiaries,minimizing employer contributions thereto,and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system.a retirement board duty to its participants and their beneficiaries shall take precedence over any other duty.cal,art.xvi,italics added.
the ballot pamphlet accompanying the italicized initiative language proposition evidences a bitter dispute regarding raids on the pers fund in an effort to shore up the state ailing fisc.ballot,analysis of leg.analyst and arguments regarding,see board of retirement santa barbara county grand jury th,d board of administration wilson,supra,th at,d.
the california constitution gives the pers board plenary authority over the pers system,which has expertise in making determinations about the classification of employees,among other subjects.pers has a fiduciary duty to provide timely and accurate information to its members.see in re application of smith march,pers prec.the duty to inform and deal fairly with members also requires that the information conveyed be complete and unambiguous see also boxx board of administration d.once local agency entered into pers contract,it,too,had duty to properly classify employee boxx.
misclassification occurs for various reasons.sometimes a single employee seeks reclassification,in re application of smith,supra,pers precedential decision.employee groups regularly seek reclassification,and may succeed by pers board action or by legislation.a statute,formerly provides that prior local miscellaneous service will be converted to local safety service if the employee works for the same agency,the prior miscellaneous position was reclassified as a safety position whether by statute or by pers ruling,and the employee has other safety position credit.see city of sacramento public employees retirement system th,fn,d.this reflects that reclassifications regularly occur.a reclassification means the individual members of the class must have their particular years of service under a particular class adjusted.this means such members,or their employers,or both,are asked to make increased contributions to pers to make up for the retirement contributions they should have been paying all along,in order to earn the more generous pension benefits.see campbell board of administration d.employees tried to avoid paying the higher contributions required by retroactive reclassification county of marin of firefighters marin county th,d not a pers case,but decided under similar law county of marin.
a pair of statutes provides the pers board power and obligation to fix mistakes.
section formerly sets out the board duties to correct different types of errors as follows 
a subject to subdivisions c and d,the board may,in its discretion and upon any terms it deems just,correct the errors or omissions of any active or retired member,if asked to do so no later than six months after discovery of the error.
b subject to subdivisions c and d,the board shall correct all actions taken as a result of errors or omissions of the university,any contracting agency,any state agency or department,or this system.
c the duty and power of the board to correct mistakes,as provided in this section,shall terminate upon the expiration of obligations of this system to the party seeking correction of the error or omission,as those obligations are defined by section.
d the party seeking correction of an error or omission pursuant to this section has the burden of presenting documentation or other evidence to the board establishing the right to correction pursuant to subdivisions a and b.
e corrections of errors or omissions pursuant to this section shall be such that the status,rights,and obligations of all parties described in subdivisions a and b are adjusted to be the same that they would have been if the act that would have been taken,but for the error or omission,was taken at the proper time.however,notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this section,corrections made pursuant to this section shall adjust the status,rights,and obligations of all parties described in subdivisions a and b as of the time that the correction actually takes place if the board finds any of the following 
that the correction can not be performed in a retroactive manner.
that even if the correction can be performed in a retroactive manner,the status,rights,and obligations of all of the parties described in subdivisions a and b can not be adjusted to be the same that they would have been if the error or omission had not occurred.
that the purposes of this part will not be effectuated if the correction is performed in a retroactive manner.
note that the statute just quoted expresses a preference for retroactive correction of errors,subd.e.
section formerly discusses time limits for making corrections,as follows 
a the obligations of this system to its members continue throughout their respective memberships,and the obligations of this system to and in respect to retired members continue throughout the lives of the respective retired members,and thereafter until all obligations to their respective beneficiaries under optional settlements have been discharged.the obligations of the state and contracting agencies to this system in respect to members employed by them,respectively,continue throughout the memberships of the respective members,and the obligations of the state and contracting agencies to this system in respect to retired members formerly employed by them,respectively,continue until all of the obligations of this system in respect to those retired members,respectively,have been discharged 
b for the purposes of payments into or out of the retirement fund for adjustment of errors or omissions,whether pursuant to section,or,or otherwise,the period of limitation of actions shall be three years,and shall be applied as follows 
in cases where this system makes an erroneous payment to a member or beneficiary,this system right to collect shall expire three years from the date of payment.
in cases where this system owes money to a member or beneficiary,the period of limitations shall not apply.
in cases where payment is erroneous because of the death of the retired member or beneficiary or because of the remarriage of the beneficiary,the period of limitation shall commence with the discovery of the erroneous payment.
c notwithstanding subdivision b,where any payment has been made as a result of fraudulent reports for compensation made,or caused to be made,by a member for his or her own benefit,the period of limitation shall be years and that period shall commence either from the date of payment or upon discovery of the fraudulent reporting,whichever date is later.
d the board shall determine the applicability of the period of limitations in any case,and its determination with respect to the running of any period of limitation shall be conclusive and binding for the purposes of correcting the error or omission.
we note the last part of this statute,subd.d provides that the pers board determination of which period of limitation applies,and regarding the running of any period of limitation shall be conclusive and binding for purposes of correcting the error or omission.italics added.however,the pers board does not contend the conclusive and binding determination precludes all judicial review.see board of retirement santa barbara county grand jury,supra,th at,d proposition removed the legislature authority to meddle in the board investment decisions and it established that the board primary obligation was to its members and beneficiaries.citation.proposition did not insulate pension boards from judicial oversight singh board of retirement th,d.
in the county of mono case,a group of local employees wanted to be reclassified as local safety members,as provided by mono county contract with pers.after concluding the employees met the applicable definition and were entitled to the enhanced benefits provided to local safety members,we held the mistake statute applied to reclassification proceedings although this did not bar reclassification on the facts.we pointed out pers had not passed on the statute of limitation question in that case,unlike in this case.th at,fn,d.we first stated this is not a case where pers owes money to a member or beneficiary,at least at this juncture and therefore the prior section which is now section,subdivision b did not apply instead,this is a case where pers seeks to reclassify employees as safety members and to retroactively assess mono and the employees the difference in contributions between miscellaneous and safety membership.county of mono,supra,th at,d.we then ruled since perl does not set forth a specific statute of limitations that applies here,pers claim for reclassification and retroactive contributions is governed by the general statute of limitation provisions set forth in the code of civil procedure.ibid.
county of mono,supra,th,d did not address proposition,and although it quoted the precursor to section,regarding the preference for retroactive corrections,it did not discuss that provision in the portion concluding the mistake statute applied.nor did it address whether a reclassification proceeding is a civil action,a critical omission.as we shall explain,we reject the view that the mistake statute applies to pers administrative reclassification proceedings.
in the administrative proceeding herein conducted before county of mono,was decided the city argued the statute limited the servicemen potential recovery to a three year period,but on appeal the city contends the statute of limitations cuts off any recovery.see county of mono,supra,th at,d mono is mixing the apple of statute of limitations with the orange of retroactive relief.the parties quarrel about the city ability to invoke county of mono but for the purposes of this appeal we assume it can do so,even though the pers board did not have the benefit of that decision in making its ruling.
although reclassification is not mentioned in these sections,a misclassification qualifies as an error within the statute providing the board shall correct all actions taken as a result of errors or omissions of any contracting agency or this system,subd.b.such an error ordinarily should be corrected retroactively,such that the status,rights,and obligations of all parties are adjusted to be the same that they would have been if the act that would have been taken,but for the error or omission,was taken at the proper time,subd.e.the pers board and the city obligations to pers members lasts throughout their memberships or their lifetimes if they have retired,subd.a.the california constitution charges that the board duty to its participants shall take precedence over any other duty.cal,art.xvi,b.
there is no requirement that a particular type of claim have a statute of limitation.in the code of civil procedure,the legislature has specified the limitations applicable to a wide variety of actions,and then to rebut the possible inference that actions not therein specifically described are to be regarded as exempt from limitations,it has specified a limitation upon an action for relief not hereinbefore provided for and where it has intended that an action shall be exempt from limitations,it has said so in clear and unmistakable language.bogart george porter cal.the legislature has provided,for example,that there is no period of limitations in actions to recover money deposited in a bank.code civ.such money belongs to the depositor,and the legislature could rationally conclude it should be recoverable regardless of the passage of time.
the pers board considered and rejected the city statute of limitation claims,as follows the city further argues that this action is subject to a statute of limitation because it essentially seeks to enforce a statutory duty to obtain relief on ground of mistake.the statute of limitations contained in government code section b applies to erroneous payments into or out of the retirement fund,not to reclassifications.the statute of limitations in the code of civil procedure is also inapplicable.government code section a provides that calpers obligations to its members continue throughout their respective memberships and its obligations to retired members continue throughout the lives of the retired members,and thereafter until all obligations to their respective beneficiaries,if any,have been discharged.to the extent that the two statutes conflict,the more specific language in the retirement statute should govern.calpers also notes that section is a substantive statute creating an ongoing duty to properly discharge its obligations.the procedural statute of limitations does not appear to override this duty.
given that the people,in the exercise of their reserved initiative powers vested plenary authority in the pers board in order to prevent state officials from using retirement funds improperly,and given that the legislature has vested the pers board with the explicit power to resolve statute of limitations questions,we believe the courts must defer to the pers board in such cases,absent some showing of an arbitrary,irrational,exercise of such power.as indicated above,misclassification was not the impetus for proposition.but the people nonetheless expressed the adamant view that the pers board,in matters falling within its purview,was to have a relatively unfettered hand to employ its institutional expertise,primarily on behalf of members.cal,art.xvi,b.
the pers board determination that reclassification was not subject to any statute of limitations because of its ongoing duty to its members is not arbitrary or irrational.the pers board decision advances the policy immanent in the california constitution,to ensure the rights of members and retirees to their full,earned,benefits.this is not a case where a retroactive reclassification would grant the servicemen more than what the statutes allow,if they meet the statutory definition of local firefighter which we later conclude they do.hudson posey d.public retirement benefits are wholly statutory in re henderson,pers precedential decision although retiree detrimentally relied on pers mistake in benefits amount,to find an estoppel here would be to allow calpers to unilaterally alter the statutory retirement benefit formula without benefit of enabling statutory authorization.
the legislature has expressed a preference for retroactive corrections.section,quoted above,provides the board shall correct all actions taken as a result of errors or omissions of any contracting agency,or this system,subd.b see rodie board of administration d.interpreting former broadly.a misclassification is covered by this section.section goes on to provide corrections shall be such that the status,rights,and obligations are adjusted to be the same that they would have been if the act that would have been taken,but for the error or omission,was taken at the proper time,unless the pers board finds retroactive correction can not be made,not all parties can be adjusted retroactively,or the purposes of this part will not be effectuated by retroactive correction,subd.e.the preference for retroactive corrections dovetails with our discussion above.
boxx,supra,d,addressed a similar problem consistent with our analysis.after concluding boxx should have been classified as a safety member,the court required the contract to be amended to cover boxx,relying on former section,now section.boxx,supra,d at.while there was no obligation to enter into the contract with pers,once the contracting agency did,and once it included boxx as a member in pers,it became part of respondent employment contract.citation.inherent in this contract is the duty on the contracting agency part and pers part to properly classify respondent.as in crumpler board of admin.employee retirement system,supra,d at.the contracting agency was estopped from not correcting its contract with pers,if a correction was necessary.concomitantly with the estoppel applicable to the contracting agency,pers likewise is estopped to deny coverage.as crumpler states the relationship between the city and the board is such that estoppel of the city is binding on the board.an estoppel binds not only the immediate parties to the transaction but those in privity with them.id.at.hence,under section,the action required was to properly classify respondent so that the duties he performed would be covered under pers to give him its maximum coverage.this accomplishes the purpose of contracting with pers.id.at.
the city argues the preference set out in section,which allows prospective corrections in certain cases,evinces the legislative recognition that notwithstanding the lifelong obligations that calpers has to member employees and beneficiaries,there will be circumstances when retroactive adjustment is simply not warranted at all.this section authorizes courts to conclude,as did this court in county of mono,supra,th,d,that calpers lifelong obligations to its members must and do give way in cases such as this one,when a retroactive correction can not be made due the bar of the statute of limitations,or when calpers fails to promptly correct classification errors.
the first sentence of the city argument is correct.the second sentence reflects a number of mistakes.first,section,subdivision e,confers on pers,not on courts,the duty to determine when corrections should be prospective.second,our opinion in county of mono,supra,th,d did not discuss section in the manner the city portrays.finally,the city is not trying to limit the servicemen to prospective relief indeed,the serviceman position no longer exists,it is trying to preclude them from receiving any relief.
we reject the city view accepted by county of mono that because classification mistakes are not specifically mentioned in the pers statutes pertaining to mistakes,courts should import the general mistake statute of limitations of the code of civil procedure.the trial court mentioned a couple of cases which reject application of the code of civil procedure statutes of limitations in administrative proceedings.robert kennedy medical center department of health services th,d recovery of overpayments made to a provider by offsets not controlled by civil statute of limitations little company of mary hospital belshe th,d statutes of limitations found in the code of civil procedure do not apply to administrative actions.in an earlier case,bernd eu d,we concluded an administrative disciplinary proceeding was not subject to the code of civil procedure statutes of limitation.we did not discuss these authorities in county of mono.we do now.
an action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,the redress or prevention of a wrong,or the punishment of a public offense.code civ.the word action as used in this title re statutes of limitation is to be construed,whenever it is necessary so to do,as including a special proceeding of a civil nature.an administrative proceeding is neither a civil action,nor a special proceeding of a civil nature,to the commencement of which the statute of limitations relates.such provision relates only to actions or special proceedings in courts,and not hearings before boards.citations.respondent board is not a court citation,even though it exercises a power judicial in its nature.bold board of medical examiners.although the bold case like bernd eu,supra,d.also involved disciplinary actions,we see no reason why an administrative proceeding which does not involve discipline is any more akin to a civil action or special proceeding of a civil nature.see french construction laborers pension trust d.the right to rescind by notice without judicial proceedings is not barred by the statute of limitations.statutes of limitation act as a bar to actions or proceedings in courts.
bernard witkin treatise states flatly the general and special statutes of limitation referring to actions and special proceedings are applicable only to judicial proceedings they do not apply to administrative proceedings.citations.limitation periods are,however,provided for in the acts governing some administrative proceedings.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,see cal.administrative hearing practice ed.initiating adjudicative action.the rule is not limited to disciplinary cases.see,cuadra millan cal th,d,wage claim triad data services,jackson,d supp.
in its brief the city appears to agree with this view contrary to local contention,moreover,the city does not claim that the statute of limitations barred the administrative proceedings.the city simply contends that ccp section d bars the remedy that necessarily flowed from the administrative reclassification recovery of public moneys from the city in the form of retroactive contributions.original italics.the city does not explain the purpose of an administrative proceeding which can not result in any relief.if the applicant proves a mistake was made,subd.d,the board shall correct the mistake,subd.b,and do so retroactively in most cases,subd.e.
the city urges people union oil cal d,union oil held that a claim for recovery of public moneys paid out through mistake is a civil claim which is subject to ccp section d.that case held at page that a civil action to recover overpayments of public funds was subject to the mistake statute formerly numbered code civ,subd.section formerly enables pers to adjust future contributions by the city in order to correct mistaken payments caused by the misclassification.this is one mechanism enabling pers to correct the mistake.but neither this enforcement mechanism nor the administrative hearing resulting in reclassification is a civil action,as was at issue in the union oil case.union oil was cited by county of marin,supra,th at pages,d,in support of extension of the mistake statute to cover claims for arrearages resulting from reclassifications under a county retirement law.county of marin was discussing a claim made in a civil action.that part of county of marin,in turn,was cited in county of mono,for the proposition that the mistake statute could bar the reclassification proceeding itself.th at,d.we respectfully decline to join in this apparent misapplication of union oil and county of marin.we decline to express any opinion about the application of the mistake statute,or any other statute of limitation,to a theoretical future civil action by pers to seek arrearages or otherwise judicially enforce the consequences of its reclassification decision.the alj decision,which was adopted by the board,did not require anyone to pay any money it merely reclassified the employees.that issue is not properly before this court.nor do we express any view on the scope or soundness of the decision in county of marin,which,as stated earlier,was not a pers case but arose under a different statutory scheme.
moreover,pers maintains that its remedy in no event would be a suit for public moneys paid out through mistake.instead,because contribution rates are set by law and because no contracting agency shall fail or refuse to pay the employers contribution required by this chapter,pers argues its remedy is writ of mandate to compel the performance of the statutory duty to pay the actuarially determined contributions rates.we express no view on the validity or timeliness of possible future legal actions pers might take to implement the reclassification decision.
the legislature has prescribed time limitations in some administrative cases.for example,a statute gives the labor commissioner the ability to establish time limitations the salutary purposes of such limitations citations are no less applicable to administrative proceedings for unpaid wages than they are to civil actions for the same relief.cuadra millan,supra,cal th at,d.
as relevant to the pers board,the legislature has prescribed a period in which the pers board may correct errors or omissions of any active or retired member,subd.a.for all other errors,the pers board duty to correct the mistake upon proof of the right to correction by the applicant does not terminate until the expiration of obligations of this system to the party seeking correction of the error or omission,which generally means throughout pers membership and through the lifetime of retired pers members,subd.c,subd.a.as stated above,such corrections should ordinarily be made retroactive,subd.e.
we agree with pers position,echoed by the servicemen,that this scheme evidences a legislative purpose of correcting system errors or omissions wherever possible,and city position would preclude implementing such intention.because a misclassification is a mistake not caused by the members,the pers board duty to correct it continues throughout their membership and the lifetime of retired members.by specifying that the pers board shall correct all actions taken as a result of errors or omissions of any contracting agency or this system,subd.b and providing such corrections should ordinarily be retroactive,the legislature has made it abundantly clear that there is no limitation period applicable to the administrative reclassification proceeding.had the legislature wanted to carve out classification mistakes from the general rule governing other mistakes by pers and contracting agencies,it could easily have done so.we should not supply a limitation period not contemplated by the legislature.see san antonio community college dist.public employment relations bd.d.a statute of limitations may not be created by judicial fiat.
the legislature has also set forth limitations regarding civil actions pertaining to matters within the pers board purview.actions to adjust mistakes resulting in payments into or out of the retirement fund are normally barred after three years,as with the general mistake statute,subd.b.however,even this limitation does not apply where this system owes money to a member or beneficiary,subd.b.actions to recoup money paid by the fraud of a member are generally barred after years,subd.c.these limitation periods for actions do not apply to administrative proceedings,for the reasons already explained.but they do demonstrate the legislature knows how to draft time limits applicable to specific types of cases when it wants to.again,we express no view on the timeliness of possible future civil actions by pers,as such issue is not presented by this appeal.
we make two caveats.
first,there are time limitations applicable to filing a petition for writ of mandate to overturn an administrative decision.see cal.administrative mandamus ed.statutes of limitations,ch.for example,a mandamus proceeding seeking proper classification of a teacher,pursuant to a statutory classification,is barred if brought beyond three years,the period in which to bring civil actions including a mandamus action for liability based on statutes.code civ,subd.a peralta federation of teachers peralta community college dist.cal d,ingram board of education d.those limitations are not germane here.
second,in some cases of delay,equity may bar an administrative proceeding,and the courts will apply notions of laches borrowed from the civil law.brown state personnel bd.d.in civil actions the defense of laches requires unreasonable delay plus either acquiescence in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.id.at.in some cases equity will borrow a closely analogous civil statute of limitations to apply in an administrative proceeding.where equity borrows a statute of limitations,it is to avoid unfairness due to delay by the public agency against whom laches was asserted.id.at.but see fahmy medical bd.of california th,fn,d in the years since brown was decided,the section of the opinion applying a statute of limitations to a laches defense in an administrative setting has never been followed,except by the same court.
the city does not head any argument based on laches on appeal,although laches is mentioned cursorily in one paragraph that does not explain how the city has been prejudiced.the failure to head an argument results in a waiver.cal.rules of court,rule a opdyk california horse racing bd.th,fn,d landa steinberg.the failure to provide an explicit prejudice analysis also results in a waiver.vaughn jonas cal d,paterno state of california th,d.elsewhere in its brief the city does claim the servicemen and union were dilatory,as follows 
in this case,calpers seeks retroactive contributions from the city for approximately airport servicemen for a to.calpers has yet to make a precise cost estimate,because it may still conduct an individual review to ensure that each airport serviceman qualifies for local safety status.calpers informally estimates that the cost to the city could be over million.the cost to any public employer for reclassifications involving numerous employees would be equally catastrophic and unfair.
in summary,the equities in this case all point in favor of the city and the trial court decision.calpers simply failed to investigate the information that it discovered in.the airport servicemen and local sat on their rights and duties for over seven years before filing a reclassification petition.appellants inaction caused an enormous unfunded liability,yet they demand that the city pay for their delay.this court decision in county of mono,however,protects public agencies from this unfair and irresponsible result.citations omitted.
the city did not argue laches before the pers board or the trial court.a party may not ordinarily raise a new theory on appeal.ernst searle cal.we are not obliged to consider an issue not properly briefed on appeal people gidney cal d,diamond springs lime american river constructors d,nor factual issues not litigated in the trial court see ward taggart cal d,richmond dart industries,d,nor issues not timely raised in an administrative proceeding harris transportation air resources board th,d see woods superior court cal d.laches in almost all cases raises factual issues regarding the cause of an asserted delay and the prejudice,vel non,therefrom.see brown state personnel,supra,d at.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity.no such factual issue has been properly presented in this case,as just explained.the servicemen have had no opportunity to refute the city belated and unsupported claims of prejudice before the trier of fact.therefore laches does not provide an independent basis for sustaining the judgment on appeal.fountain valley regional hospital medical center bonta th,d where statute of limitation is borrowed in an administrative proceeding,prejudice may be presumed,requiring other side to rebut presumption on facts.
moreover,although in extraordinary cases laches need not be pleaded southern counties gas eden,witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,such cases arise when the evidence reveals the elements of laches without dispute,in re marriage of dancy th,d.that is not this case for at least two reasons.first,as stated,the facts about the degree of prejudice were not litigated below.green board of dental examiners th,d.second,as stated,the city has not properly invoked laches on appeal.although the city does rely on the county of mono case,which borrowed the mistake statute of limitations for use in administrative reclassification proceedings,county of mono was not based on laches and did not discuss that doctrine.see county of mono,supra,th at,d.
we conclude it is inappropriate to import the mistake statute of limitations into an administrative reclassification proceeding.we decline to follow our prior decision in county of mono,to the extent it is inconsistent with these views.
the city blames pers for delaying correcting the mistake,causing an unfunded liability for the city.the great inequity is that unsuspecting employers have to foot the bill for mistakes that calpers makes.but it is the city,too,which misunderstood that the servicemen should have been treated as firefighters from the beginning,and thereby underfunded their retirement for years.see,subd.a obligations of contracting agencies to this system in respect to members continue throughout the memberships and the obligations of contracting agencies to this system in respect to retired members formerly employed by them continue until all of the obligations of this system in respect to those retired members have been discharged boxx,supra,d at.inherent in this contract is the duty on the local agency part and pers part to properly classify respondent.the city repeatedly blames pers for not fully investigating the classification issue in,and asserts application of a statute of limitations will encourage pers to be more diligent in the future.why is it more equitable that the aggrieved workers should pay the price for the alleged delay by pers the city,which had an equal duty to correctly classify employees,and which fought and continues to fight reclassification,is in a poor position to blame pers for not discovering and attempting to correct the mistake sooner.
the ballot pamphlet accompanying proposition warned the requirement that pension system boards give highest priority to providing benefits to members and their beneficiaries could result in higher costs to employers.see ballot,elect,analysis of leg.analyst.this weakens the city claim that retroactive reclassification unfairly harms local agencies by causing unexpected liabilities.instead it reflects a policy in favor of paying employees what they earned.that is not inherently unfair.johnson smith,d supp,we are not unmindful of the ancient adage that the laborer is worthy of his hire.
the california supreme court touched on a similar issue in robert kennedy medical center belshe cal th at pages,d,involving overpayment reimbursement procedures plaintiff acknowledges that,because the final reimbursement settlement generally will give rise to a provider liability for repayment of moneys,the department delay in reaching a final reimbursement settlement does not result in the withholding of moneys from the provider.instead,the provider generally will reap the benefit of the use of government funds to which the provider is not entitled.plaintiff maintains a provider nevertheless is prejudiced financially by the delay,because the uncertainty as to large contingent claims hampers financial planning necessary for successful business operations.that circumstance is a matter properly to be remedied by the legislature,however,and not by judicial fiat,in the absence of a time requirement established by the legislature governing the department final reimbursement determination.reclassification which downgrades a group of employees appears to be rare.see crumpler board of administration d.downgrade prospective only,fn.omitted.as with audits,reclassifications generally result in increased liability on the part of the employer,who presumably had the use of money that should have been funding the correct retirement benefits all along.while the reclassification decision here will apparently result in an unanticipated financial liability on the city part,the city has had the use of money it should have been expending towards the retirement system,and we see nothing in the applicable legislation which cuts off the city liability therefor.
we are not blind to the practical effect of the pers decision to retroactively reclassify at least some of the servicemen,perhaps as far back as.although exactly which servicemen will qualify for safety status and over what periods of time has yet to be determined and the financial implications have therefore not been calculated,the parties agree the decision will in time require the city to spend money it does not want to spend and did not anticipate having to spend.the city earnestly did not consider the servicemen equivalent to firefighters,which was a reasonable position,especially given the passage of time,albeit a mistaken position.yet,by entering into a contract with the pers system,and extending that contract to include safety members,the city bound itself to follow the applicable statutory definitions governing firefighters,and bound itself to abide by the lawful decisions of the pers board,including decisions to correct mistakes in classification of members.the pers decision is not a windfall for the servicemen,who stood ready to defend against some of the most horrible types of tragedies.it instead anticipates a day of fair reckoning for the city and its safety employees.
the city contends the servicemen never were employees of a fire department and never had principal duties that clearly fall within the scope of active firefighting.we disagree with both claims.
as relevant here,local firefighter means any officer or employee of a fire department of a contracting agency,except one whose principal duties are discussed later.
the city position is as follows it maintains a fire department called the oakland fire department.the servicemen are employed by the port of oakland.therefore,they are not employees of a fire department of the city.this argument assumes the legislature intended the label given by a local government to its subdivisions would control.we disagree.in our view,if it looks like a duck,walks like a duck,and sounds like a duck,it is a duck.people ex rel.lockyer pacific gaming technologies th,d see phillippe shapell industries cal d.
the legislature did not say an employee had to work for something called a fire department,only that he or she be employed by a fire department.we agree with the board that the use of the indefinite article a suggests that the legislature had no intention of limiting the term fire department to a single fire department where a contracting agency maintains more than one fire department.
if an entity is designed to act and does act like a fire department,it is a de facto fire department.see boxx,supra,d at.police departments could exist and law enforcement powers be exercised by organizations not named in a peace officer section labeling the individuals as members of a police department is not as important as whether they are engaged in active law enforcement,discussed in county of santa clara deputy sheriff cal th,d.this accords with the rule that a worker status should be determined based on duties actually performed.neeley,supra,d at,fn.
the pers board found as follows inquiry correctly focuses upon whether a firefighting unit was maintained by the contracting agency and whether or not it was engaged in active firefighting.the port of oakland has maintained a separate arff aircraft rescue and firefighting unit at the airport.the airport has issued airport servicemen cards identifying them as firefighters,emblazoned vehicles with oakland airport fire or oakland airport and have through numerous documents been represented or referred to as a or the fire department for oakland international airport.while such names are not determinative of whether they engaged in active firefighting,they are relevant to the determination of whether a separate and identifiable arff unit was maintained by the port of oakland.that is clearly the case here.oakland airport servicemen were part of a separate arff unit or fire department.we agree with the pers board.
this undermines the city point that the servicemen did not qualify for employment with the oakland fire department.they did not have to.
the city contends the boxx decision and the de facto department theory have been undermined by feliciano board of administration th,d.the passage relied on by the city does not change anything.the issue was the term safety officer,which was designed to cover contracting agencies which have a combined peace officer and firefighter department.the new term was added to the retirement laws to explicitly cover employees of those combined departments.feliciano quoted a letter to the governor,as follows current retirement law defines policeman and fireman in terms of employment with a police or fire department.however,some cities have a public safety department where an individual serves as both policeman and fireman.thus,the current definitions are technically deficient.id.at,d,italics omitted.apart from the impropriety of using a letter to the governor to construe a bill harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,fn,this passage does not help the city.it refers to the problem as a technicality.more importantly,the case had nothing to do with the de facto department issue.cases are not authority for propositions not considered.hart burnett cal.
we also observe that the pers board has previously applied the de facto doctrine in an unpublished decision involving the city park rangers.the city correctly observes this decision was not designated as a precedential decision and argues such unpublished decision is entitled to no weight.however,the california supreme court has recently concluded that an administrative decision,even if not designated as a precedential decision,properly informs as an administrative interpretation.styne stevens cal th,fn,d,the rules of court do not bar our citation of such unpublished decisions to demonstrate administrative construction.
the statutes creating and authorizing the public employees retirement system of which is a part do not define the term fire department.this is in marked distinction to the provisions of the government code establishing the classic police officers pension fund and firemen pension fund et which in its present form was enacted in.that act generally mandates contributions to a police relief pension fund and a firemen relief pension fund where a local agency has created such funds.see.
that pension fund,for police officers and firemen,is created by title local agencies division cities and counties part powers and duties common to cities and counties chapter police officers pension fund and firemen pension fund of the government code.section provides,unless the context otherwise requires,the definitions and general provisions set forth in this article govern the construction of this chapter.italics added.section provides,member also means any person duly appointed or selected and sworn as a member of the regularly constituted fire department if the local agency has established a firemen relief and pension fund pursuant to this chapter.italics added.section provides,department means regularly constituted fire department or regularly constituted police department.italics added.
where a statute,with reference to one subject,contains a given provision,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different intention existed.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.since the firemen pension fund contains a definitional section requiring a fire department to be regularly constituted,and since no comparable definition exists under the statutes defining the public employees retirement system,we may draw the inference that when section refers to a fire department the fire department need not be regularly constituted,as is the case under the firemen pension fund.put differently,the provisions of the firemen pension fund indicate that,if the legislature wishes to limit retirement benefits to a regularly constituted fire department,it knows how to do it.
finally,in some pers statutes the legislature conditions extension of enhanced safety status on an explicit election by a local agency.see city of sacramento public employees retirement system,supra,th at,d the amendment did not condition its application upon the election of the contracting agency nor had the section ever been so conditioned.by contrast,another section,added in the same enactment,does condition the extension of safety membership to harbor and port officers upon the election of the contracting agency schaeffer public employees retirement system d.if the legislature wanted to limit the ambit of firefighter to cases where a local agency explicitly wanted to extend enhanced benefits,it could easily have done so by inserting such limitation in the statute.
the city contends the servicemen can not be firefighters because their principal duties were not fighting fires.once the fact of what duties are performed is determined,whether those duties satisfy the statute is a legal question.neeley,supra,d at.crumpler board of administration,supra,d at.
the statute makes all members of a fire department firefighters except one whose principal duties are those of a telephone operator,clerk,stenographer,machinist,mechanic,or otherwise and whose functions do not clearly fall within the scope of active firefighting.the city does not explain how a serviceman duties fall within the named class or like occupations.the canon ejusdem generis applies here.we explained as much in a case construing a similar statute,labor code,which excluded coverage for employees of a county sheriff office whose principal duties are those of a telephone operator,clerk,stenographer,machinist,mechanic,or otherwise,and whose functions do not clearly come within the scope of active law enforcement service we said the county contends bailiffs fall under or otherwise because their functions do not clearly come within the scope of active law enforcement service.the term or otherwise is a relative term.when so used as a general phrase following the enumeration of particular things,such words are usually interpreted in a restricted sense as referring to things or matters of the same kind ejusdem generis as those specifically enumerated.citation.the question,then,is whether a bailiff is in the same class as support personnel of the sheriff office performing more routine tasks,such as telephone operators,clerks,stenographers,machinists,and mechanics.we find it is not.biggers workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the city does not explain how a serviceman falls within the general category of telephone operator,clerk,stenographer,machinist,mechanic,or otherwise as provided by section.
in any event,the city theory is that principal means frequent duties,not important duties.we disagree.
the primary dictionary definition of principal is first or highest in rank or importance that is at the head of all the rest of the greatest account or value foremost.oxford english dict,see webster new internat.dict.
we construed the phrase principal profession in a statute to mean the activity is one of the primary,main or leading professional endeavors of the candidate.consequently,involvement which is only nominal,pro forma,or titular in character does not meet the requirements of the statute.andal miller th,d.
the pers board found and the city does not contest,that the servicemen were prepared to respond to serious aircraft and airport fire emergencies,as required by federal aviation laws.because,fortunately,airport disasters are rare the city states the servicemen responded to three aircraft fires in over years,the servicemen had other subordinate duties to perform,instead of just sitting around waiting for a fire.
a few excerpts from the pers board decision illustrate the duties of airport servicemen 
airport servicemen have first response capability for emergency medical technician emt calls,both for customers and employees at the airport.in,over million passengers enplaned or deplaned at oakland international airport.citation.the airport complex employs nearly people,of which approximately are in jobs related to cargo.airport servicemen respond to emt calls over the acre airport consisting of two airfields 
significantly,airport servicemen must have first response capability for aircraft fire suppression and rescue.they are required by federal law to respond within three minutes of notice of an aircraft emergency and to have at least one firefighting vehicle in position to begin application of foam,dry chemical,or halon oakland fire department has the responsibility for providing only backup support for aircraft rescue and firefighting operations 
an airport serviceman job description dating back to december,and prepared by the oakland civil service board,provides that an airport serviceman r esponds to airport emergency alarms,performs fire suppression and rescue services,utilizing appropriate techniques and equipment.citation.the general statement of duties adds the scope of the work includes,security,fueling and airfield safety from these duty statements it is apparent that airport servicemen are intended to operate as an aircraft rescue and firefighting unit 
oakland international airport must satisfy certain federal regulations to obtain and maintain its license with the federal government.this in
