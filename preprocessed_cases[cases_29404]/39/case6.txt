the false claims act fca authorizes both the attorney general and private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or fraudulent payment claims to the united states,but it bars qui tam actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in,inter alia,a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office gao report,hearing,audit,or investigation.e a.here,federal contracts provided that two north carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding and that the federal government would shoulder most of the costs.respondent wilson,then an employee of a local government body involved in this effort,alerted local and federal officials about possible fraud.both the county and the state issued reports identifying potential irregularities in the contracts administration.subsequently,wilson filed a qui tam action,alleging,as relevant here,that petitioners,county conservation districts and local and federal officials,knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the fca.the district court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allegations publicly disclosed in the county and state reports,which it held were administrative reports under the fca public disclosure bar.in reversing,the fourth circuit concluded that only federal administrative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.
held the reference to administrative reports,audits,and investigations in e a encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources as well as federal sources.
a section e a specifies three categories of disclosures that can deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits.the language at issue is contained in the second category category.
b the fca plain text does not limit administrative to federal sources.because that term modifies report,hearing,audit,or investigation in a provision about the public disclosure of fraud on the united states,it is most naturally read to describe government agency activities.but since administrative is not itself modified by federal,there is no immediately apparent basis for excluding state and local agency activities from its ambit.the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis a word may be known by the company it keeps,russell motor car united states,does not support the fourth circuit more limited view.in category,administrative is sandwiched between the federal terms congressional and gao,but these items are too few and too disparate to qualify as a string of statutory terms,warren maine bd.of environmental protection,or items in a list,beecham united states,for noscitur a sociis purposes.furthermore,evaluating administrative within the public disclosure bar larger scheme,the court observes that category terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in category criminal,civil,or administrative hearing and category news media that are generally understood to include nonfederal sources and category contains the same term administrative that is at issue.even if category were best understood to refer to adjudicative proceedings and category to legislative or activities,state and local administrative sources of a character are presumably just as public,and just as likely to put the federal government on notice of a potential fraud,as state and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character.the fca overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.and the fact that state legislative sources are not included in e a carries no clear implications for the status of state administrative sources.
c the legislative record does not support an exclusively federal interpretation of administrative.the current e a was enacted to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits.how exactly the statute came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain,as significant substantive changes including the introduction of administrative in category were inserted without floor debate or other discussion,as technical amendments.though congress wanted to strengthen the government hand in fighting false claims,cook county united states ex rel.chandler,and encourage more qui tam suits,it also determined to bar a subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or downright harmful.the question here concerns that subset precise scope and on that matter,the record is all but opaque,leaving no evident legislative purpose to guide resolution of this discrete issue,united states bornstein.

justice stevens delivered the opinion of the court.
since its enactment during the civil war,the false claims act,has authorized both the attorney general and private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims for payment to the united states.the act now contains a provision barring qui tam actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in certain specified sources.e a.the question before us is whether the reference to administrative reports,audits,and investigations in that provision encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources as well as federal sources.we hold that it does 
in the united states department of agriculture usda entered into contracts with two counties in north carolina authorizing them to perform,or to hire others to perform,cleanup and repair work in areas that had suffered extensive flooding.the federal government agreed to shoulder percent of the contract costs.respondent karen wilson was at that time an employee of the graham county soil and conservation district,a government body that had been delegated partial responsibility for coordinating and performing the remediation effort.suspecting possible fraud in connection with this effort,wilson voiced her concerns to local officials in the summer of.she also sent a letter to,and had a meeting with,agents of the usda.
graham county officials began an investigation.an accounting firm hired by the county performed an audit and,in,issued a report audit report that identified several potential irregularities in the county administration of the contracts.shortly thereafter,the north carolina department of environment,health,and natural resources issued a report dehnr report identifying similar problems.the usda office of inspector general eventually issued a third report that contained additional findings.
in wilson filed this action,alleging that petitioners,the graham county and cherokee county soil and water conservation districts and a number of local and federal officials,violated the false claims act fca by knowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant to the contracts.she further alleged that petitioners retaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation of those false claims.following this court review of the statute of limitations applicable to wilson retaliation claim,graham county soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,the court of appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as time barred.on remand,the district court subsequently dismissed wilson qui tam action for lack of jurisdiction.app.to pet.for cert.the court found that wilson had failed to refute that her action was based upon allegations publicly disclosed in the audit report and the dehnr report,at.those reports,the district court determined,constituted administrative report s,audit s,or investigation s within the meaning of the fca public disclosure bar,e a.
the court of appeals reversed the judgment of the district court because the reports had been generated by state and local entities.o nly federal administrative reports,audits or investigations,the fourth circuit concluded,qualify as public disclosures under the fca.emphasis added.the circuits having divided over this issue we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.
we have examined the fca qui tam provisions in several recent opinions at issue in this case is the fca public disclosure bar,which deprives courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits when the relevant information has already entered the public domain through certain channels.the statute contains three categories of disclosures.following the example of the court of appeals,see,at,we have inserted arabic numerals to identify these categories 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office gao report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.e a footnote omitted.
this dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective administrative in the second category category whether it embraces only forums that are federal in nature,as respondent alleges,or whether it extends to disclosures made in state and local sources such as the dehnr report and the audit report,as petitioners allege.
in debating this question,petitioners have relied primarily on the statute text whereas respondent and the solicitor general,as her amicus,have relied heavily on considerations of history and policy.although there is some overlap among the three types of argument,it is useful to discuss them separately.we begin with the text.
the term administrative may,in various contexts,bear a range of related meanings,chandler judicial council of tenth circuit,harlan,concurring in denial of writ,pertaining to private bodies as well as to governmental bodies.when used to modify the nouns report,hearing,audit,or investigation,in the context of a statutory provision about the public disclosure of fraud on the united states,the term is most naturally read to describe the activities of governmental agencies.see black law dictionary ed.hereinafter black defining administration,i n public law,as the practical management and direction of the executive department and its agencies given that administrative is not itself modified by federal,there is no immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the activities of state and local agencies or their contractors from its ambit.as the court of appeals recognized,the statute by its express terms does not limit its reach to federal administrative reports or investigations.at.t here is nothing inherently federal about the word administrative,and congress did not define the term in the fca.at.
the court of appeals conclusion that administrative nevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its application of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.see,at.this maxim,literally translated as it is known by its associates,black,counsels lawyers reading statutes that a word may be known by the company it keeps,russell motor car united states.all participants in this litigation acknowledge that the terms congressional and gao are federal in nature congress is the legislative branch of the federal government and the gao is a federal agency relying on our opinions in warren maine bd.of environmental protection,and beecham united states,the court of appeals reasoned that the placement of administrative squarely in the middle of a list of obviously federal sources strongly suggests that administrative should likewise be restricted to federal administrative reports,hearings,audits,or investigations.at.in so holding,the court of appeals embraced what we might call the sandwich theory of the third circuit.both courts f ou nd it hard to believe that the drafters of this provision intended the word administrative to refer to both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched between modifiers which are unquestionably federal in character.ibid.quoting united states ex rel.dunleavy county of delaware.
we find this use of noscitur a sociis unpersuasive.a list of three items,each quite distinct from the other no matter how construed,is too short to be particularly illuminating.although this list may not be completely disjunctive,at it refers to congressional,administrative,or gao sources,e a,rather than congressional,or administrative,or gao sources neither is it completely harmonious.the substantive connection,or fit,between the terms congressional,administrative,and gao is not so tight or so as to demand that we rob any one of them of its independent and ordinary significance.reiter sonotone,see also russell,at that a word may be known by the company it keeps is not an invariable rule,for the word may have a character of its own not to be submerged by its association the adjectives in category are too few and too disparate to qualify as a string of statutory terms,warren,at,or items in a list,beecham,at,in the sense that we used those phrases in the cited cases 
more important,we need to evaluate administrative within the larger scheme of the public disclosure bar.both parties acknowledge,as they must,that s tatutory language has meaning only in context,graham county soil,at where they differ is in determining the relevant context.the sandwich theory presupposes that category is the only piece of e a that matters.we agree with petitioners,however,that all of the sources listed in e a provide interpretive guidance.all of these sources drive at the same end specifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose qui tam actions.in light of the public disclosure bar grammatical structure,it may be convenient and even clarifying to parse the list of sources into three categories.but it does not follow that we should treat these categories as islands unto themselves.courts have a duty to construe statutes,not isolated provisions.gustafson alloyd.
when we consider the entire text of the public disclosure bar,the case for limiting administrative to federal sources becomes significantly weaker.the news media referenced in category plainly have a broader sweep.the federal government funds certain media outlets,and certain private outlets have a national focus but no one contends that category is limited to these sources.there is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the criminal,civil,or administrative hearing s listed in category must be federal hearings of the numerous types of sources that serve a common function in e a,then,only two are distinctly federal in nature,while one the news media is distinctly nonfederal in nature.
if the court of appeals was correct that the term administrative encompasses state and local sources in category,see,at,it becomes even harder to see why the term would not do the same in category.see erlenbaugh united states,a legislative body generally uses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a given context respondent and the solicitor general assert that e a two references to administrative can be distinguished because category is best understood to refer to adjudicative proceedings,whereas category is best understood to refer to legislative or activities such as rulemaking,oversight,and investigations.see brief for respondent brief for united states as amicus curiae hereinafter brief for united states.yet even if this reading were correct,state and local administrative reports,hearings,audits,and investigations of a character are presumably just as public,and just as likely to put the federal government on notice of a potential fraud,as state and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character 
respondent and the solicitor general try to avoid this inference,and to turn a weakness into a strength,by further averring that the sources listed in category are themselves only federal.see brief for respondent brief for united states.no court has ever taken such a view of these sources.see,at citing cases from the third,fourth,fifth,ninth,and eleventh circuits and stating that t he courts have easily concluded that category applies to hearings sylvia,at,citing additional cases the arguments in favor of reading a federal limitation into category are supported,if at all,by legislative history and policy they find no support in the statute text.
moving from the narrow lens of the sandwich theory to a bird eye view,respondent and the solicitor general also maintain that the exclusively federal focus of the fca counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to encompass nonfederal sources.brief for respondent,brief for united states.the fca undoubtedly has a federal focus.but so does every other federal statute.and as respondent and the solicitor general elsewhere acknowledge,quite a few aspects of the fca,including a reference to administrative proceedings in l a and the reference to news media in e a itself,are not just federal.in any event,the federal focus of the statute,as a whole,does not shine light on the specific question whether the public disclosure bar extends to certain nonfederal contexts.it is the fact of public disclosure not federal government creation or receipt that is the touchstone of e a.
respondent and the solicitor general make one last argument grounded in the statutory text it would be anomalous,they say,for state and local administrative reports to count as public disclosures,when state legislative reports do not.see brief for respondent brief for united states.yet neither respondent nor the solicitor general disputes the contention of petitioners and their amici that,at the time the public disclosure bar was enacted in,congress rarely gave state legislatures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing federally funded programs.see brief for petitioners brief for national league of cities et as amici curiae.as in the instant case,the federal government was far more likely to enter into contracts with,and to provide moneys to,state and local executive agencies.whether or not state legislative sources should have been included in e a,their exclusion therefore carries no clear implications for the status of state administrative sources.
in sum,although the term administrative may be sandwiched in category between terms that are federal in nature,those terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases that have been generally understood to include nonfederal sources and one of those phrases,in category,contains the exact term that is the subject of our inquiry.these textual clues negate the force of the noscitur a sociis canon,as it was applied by the court of appeals we are not persuaded that the associates with which administrative keeps company in e a endow it with an exclusively federal character.
as originally enacted,the fca did not limit the sources from which a relator could acquire the information to bring a qui tam action.in united states ex rel.marcus hess,we upheld the relator recovery even though he had discovered the fraud by reading a federal criminal indictment a quintessential parasitic suit,at see,at even if,as the government suggests,the petitioner has contributed nothing to the discovery of this crime,he has contributed much to accomplishing one of the purposes for which the act was passed congress promptly reacted to that decision by amending the statute to preclude qui tam actions based upon evidence or information in the possession of the united states,or any agency,officer or employee thereof,at the time such suit was brought.act of,stat.codified at c ed.this amendment erected what came to be known as a government knowledge bar o nce the united states learned of a false claim,only the government could assert its rights under the fca against the false claimant.hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,internal quotation marks omitted.in the years that followed the amendment,the volume and efficacy of qui tam litigation dwindled.seeking the golden mean between adequate incentives for insiders with genuinely valuable information and discouragement of opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant information to contribute of their own,united states ex rel.springfield terminal quinn,cadc,congress overhauled the statute once again in to make the fca a more useful tool against fraud in modern times,cook county united states ex rel.chandler,quoting,hereinafter.
the present text of e was enacted in as part of this larger reform.congress apparently concluded that a total bar on qui tam actions based on information already in the government possession thwarted a significant number of potentially valuable claims.rather than simply repeal the government knowledge bar,however,congress replaced it with the public disclosure bar in an effort to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits such as the one in hess.how exactly e came to strike this balance in the way it did is a matter of considerable uncertainty.the house and senate judiciary committees each reported bills that contained very different public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in the statutes at large the senate bill,for example,did not include the words administrative,audit,or investigation in its version of category,nor did it contain an original source exception.see,at text of proposed e 
in respondent and her amici view,this background counsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of administrative for three separate reasons.first,the drafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that congress intended such a result.second,a major aim of the amendments was to limit the scope of the government knowledge bar,and c onstruing e a as limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers congress purpose to encourage more private enforcement suits.brief for united states quoting,at.third,whereas federal administrative proceedings can be presumed to provide the attorney general with a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an fca action based on revelations made therein,the attorney general is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in state proceedings.respondent and her amici further maintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal sources in category,as local governments would then be able to shield themselves from qui tam liability by discretely disclosing evidence of fraud in public reports 
these arguments are reasonable so far as they go,but they do not go very far.as many have observed,the drafting history of the public disclosure bar raises more questions than it answers significant substantive changes including the introduction of the term we are construing in this case were inserted without floor debate,as technical amendments.that the original senate bill mentioned only congressional and gao sources in category is therefore of little moment.neither the house nor the senate committee report explained why a federal limitation would be appropriate,and the subsequent addition of administrative sources to this category might be taken as a sign that such a limitation was rejected by the full chambers 
respondent and her amici place particular emphasis on a remark made by the lead sponsor of the senate bill,senator grassley.see brief for respondent brief for united states brief for american center for law and justice as amicus curiae brief for taxpayers against fraud education fund as amicus curiae.in a floor statement,grassley said that the term government in the definition of original source is meant to include any government source of disclosures cited in the public disclosure bar that is,government includes congress,the general accounting office,any executive or independent agency as well as all other governmental bodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.cong.rec.yet even if a single sentence by a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful weight,senator grassley remark merely begs the question before us.his formulation fails to indicate whether the other governmental bodies may be state or local bodies.it also turns on a term,government with a capital g,that does not appear in the codified version of the public disclosure bar,which congress subsequently revised in numerous respects prior to passage.
there is,in fact,only one item in the legislative record that squarely corroborates respondent reading of the statute a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the amendments to the attorney general in.see cong.rec.reproducing text of letter in which berman and grassley state we did intend,and any fair reading of the statute will confirm,that the disclosure must be in a federal criminal,civil or administrative hearing.disclosure in a state proceeding of any kind should not be a bar to a subsequent qui tam suit needless to say,this letter does not qualify as legislative history,given that it was written years after the amendments were enacted.it is consequently of scant or no value for our purposes 
we do not doubt that congress passed the amendments to the fca to strengthen the government hand in fighting false claims,cook county,at,and to encourage more private enforcement suits,at.it is equally beyond cavil,however,that congress passed the public disclosure bar to bar a subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or downright harmful.the question before us concerns the precise scope of that subset and on this matter,the record is all but opaque.while the absence of specific legislative history in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty to give faithful meaning to the language congress adopted in the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting the law in question,united states bornstein,there is no evident legislative purpose to guide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.
respondent and her amici likewise fail to prove their case that petitioners reading of the statute will lead to results that congress could not have intended.their argument rests on an empirical proposition while federal inquiries and their outcomes are readily available to department of justice doj attorneys,many state and local reports and investigations never come to the attention of federal authorities.brief for united states see also,at because the federal government is unlikely to learn about state and local investigations,a large number of fraudulent claims against the government would go unremedied without the financial incentives offered by the qui tam provisions of the fca this proposition is not implausible,but it is sheer conjecture.numerous federal investigations may be occurring at any given time,and doj attorneys may not reliably learn about their findings.doj attorneys may learn about quite a few state and local inquiries,especially when the inquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint program financed in part by federal dollars,such as the program at issue in this case just how accessible to the attorney general a typical state or local source will be,as compared to a federal source,is an open question.and it is not even the right question.the statutory touchstone,once again,is whether the allegations of fraud have been public ly disclos ed,e a,not whether they have landed on the desk of a doj lawyer.
respondent argument also gives insufficient weight to congress decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclosures from the news media.ibid.because there was no such bar prior to,the addition of the news media as a category forecloses the suggestion that the amendments implemented a intent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation.and since the news media include a large number of local newspapers and radio stations,this category likely describes a multitude of sources that would seldom come to the attention of the attorney general.
as for respondent and her amici concern that local governments will insulate themselves from qui tam liability through careful,low key disclosures of potential fraud,brief for american center for law and justice as amicus curiae,this argument rests not just on speculation but indeed on rather strained speculation.any such disclosure would not immunize the local government from fca liability in an action brought by the united states,see rockwell int l united states,and to the contrary it could tip off the attorney general that such an action might be fruitful.it seems to us that petitioners have the more view when they assert that,g iven the fact that the submission of a false claim to the united states subjects a defendant to criminal liability,fines,debarment,treble damages and attorneys fees,no rational entity would prepare a report that fraud with the sole purpose of cutting off qui tam actions.reply brief for petitioners see also united states ex rel.premo,the fear of disclosures is unfounded in general because it is unlikely that an agency trying to cover up its fraud would reveal the requisite allegations or transactions underlying the fraud in a public document 
our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that congress carefully preserved the rights of the most deserving qui tam plaintiffs those who qualify as original sources.notwithstanding public disclosure of the allegations made by a qui tam plaintiff,her case may go forward if she is an original source of the information.e a.it is therefore flat wrong to suggest that a finding for petitioners will in effect return us to the unduly restrictive government knowledge standard that prevailed prior to.brief for united states quoting dunleavy,at see brief for respondent asserting that petitioners construction would reimpose a form of the government knowledge bar capitalization omitted.today ruling merely confirms that disclosures made in one type of context a state or local report,audit,or investigation may trigger the public disclosure bar.it has no bearing on disclosures made in other contexts,and it leaves intact the ability of original sources to prosecute qui tam actions irrespective of the state of government knowledge.whether respondent can qualify as an original source,as that term is defined in e,is one of many issues that remain open on remand.
respondent and the solicitor general have given numerous reasons why they believe their reading of the fca moves it closer to the golden mean between an inadequate and an excessive scope for private enforcement.congress may well have endorsed those views in its recent amendment to the public disclosure bar.see,supra.with respect to the version of e a that is before us,however,we conclude that the term administrative in category is not limited to federal sources.
the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

the false claims act fca divests federal courts of jurisdiction to hear qui tam lawsuits based on allegations or transactions publicly disclosed in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office gao report,hearing,audit,or investigation,unless the qui tam relator is an original source of the information.e a footnote omitted.today,the court reads the phrase administrative report,hearing,audit,or investigation to encompass not only federal,but also state and local,government sources.in my view,the court misreads the statutory text and gives insufficient weight to contextual and historical evidence of congress purpose in enacting.i would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and hold that administrative in the provision refers only to federal government sources 
section e a sets forth three categories of public disclosure s that trigger the fca jurisdictional bar allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or gao report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media.like the majority,i have inserted arabic numerals and refer to the three phrases as categories.it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.fda brown williamson tobacco,quoting davis michigan of treasury.no party here disputes that congressional and gao refer only to federal government sources.ante,at,and nn.as the court acknowledges,ante,at,the word administrative is more capacious,potentially reaching not only federal,state,and local government sources but also disclosures by private entities.see,black law dictionary ed.defining administrative as pertain ing to administration,especially management,of the execution,application or conduct of persons or things 
like the court of appeals,i view congress choice of two clearly federal terms to bookend the federal term as a very strong contextual cue about the meaning of administrative.the maxim noscitur a sociis,while not an inescapable rule,is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the acts of congress.gutierrez ada,quoting jarecki searle.here,the immediate proximity of congressional and gao suggests that administrative should be read,like its neighbors,as referring to federal government sources.if congress had intended to include state or local government administrative materials,it could have said so,for instance by referring generically to governmental sources.see,at.
the court applies the logic that underlies the noscitur a sociis canon in concluding that administrative does not refer to private entities because of the meaning suggested by the slightly more distant neighbors report,hearing,audit,or investigation.see ante,at.i agree with the majority that administrative in this context does not reach private entities.but in my view,congressional and gao provide the better textual grounding for that conclusion.i see no reason why the administrati on of a private university,for instance,could not issue a report,order an audit or investigation,or conduct a hearing.nor,contrary to the majority suggestion,are private entities particularly those receiving federal funds or participating in federal programs incapable of making public disclosure s of fraud on the federal government.
despite its own implicit reliance on the canon,the court nevertheless rejects the court of appeals application of noscitur a sociis to interpret the three terms in category,concluding that a list of three items,each quite distinct from the other no matter how construed,is too short to be particularly illuminating.ante,at.the three terms in category,the court concludes,are too few and too disparate to justify invocation of noscitur a sociis.ante,at.we have not previously constrained the canon in this way,and i would not do so here.
to take just one example,in jarecki we construed the statutory term abnormal income,which the statute defined to include income resulting from exploration,discovery,or prospecting.at quoting a of the internal revenue code of.recognizing that the word d iscovery is usable in many contexts and with various shades of meaning,we observed that it gathers meaning from the words around it and concluded that t he three words in conjunction all describe activity in the oil and gas and mining industries.at.as a result,and in light of other contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,we held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera equipment did not give rise to abnormal income even if such inventions might otherwise be understood as discover ies.see,at.in my view,the three terms in category are no more distinct or disparate,ante,at,than the phrase at issue in jarecki,particularly given the expansive plain meaning of discovery.ante,at.here,application of the noscitur a sociis principle readily yields a common feature the sources at issue are federal in nature,not related to state or local governments or private entities.see third nat.bank in nashville impac limited,applying principle that words grouped in a list should be given related meaning where term injunction was sandwiched between two other words in the statutory phrase attachment,injunction,or execution 
the court draws additional support for its conclusion from reference to the provision larger scheme,ante,at,the sources enumerated in categories and.although the scope of category is not before us today and although this court has never addressed that question,the court believes that reading category as limited to federal government sources would be inconsistent with decisions of lower courts that have interpreted criminal,civil,or administrative hearing s in category to include both state and federal proceedings.there is no conflict,however,if both categories are read,as respondent and the solicitor general urge,as exclusively federal.see brief for respondent brief for united states as amicus curiae.even reading category more broadly,however,does not change the exclusively federal nature of congressional and gao,which undermines whatever inference might be drawn from taking the statutory terms in strict succession.treating the entirety of e a as an undifferentiated list of items gives short shrift to the syntactical choices congress made in offsetting each category with commas and prepositions,and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that modify different nouns.
finally,the court also views news media as distinctly nonfederal in nature.ante,at.but news media does not seem particularly illuminating in this context.as the court of appeals observed,although media sources may be national or local in scope,that distinction is not analogous to the difference between federal and state government sources,at.
in my view,the statutory context and legislative history are also less opaque,ante,at,and more supportive of the reading adopted by the court of appeals,than the majority today acknowledges.while the legislative record is concededly incomplete,it does provide reason to exercise caution before giving the statutory text its broadest possible meaning,to encompass not only federal,but also state and local,government sources.
three points are particularly salient.first,prior to the amendments,the government knowledge bar unquestionably referred only to information in the possession of the federal government even still,the bar was criticized as overly restrictive.a senate report on an initial version of the legislation,for instance,described the fca history and need for legislative reform,noting several restrictive court interpretations of the act which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.hereinafter.for instance,courts had applied the government knowledge bar even if the government makes no effort to investigate or take action after original allegations a re received.at citing united states ex rel.lapin international business machines,supp.haw.
second,there is more support than the court recognizes for the proposition that congress sought in the amendments to broaden the availability of qui tam relief.the senate report characterized the reform effort as intended to enhance the government ability to recover losses sustained as a result of fraud against the government and dwelt at length on the severe and growing problem of fraud in federal programs.at accord,evidence of fraud in government programs and procurement is on a steady rise the senate report also articulated a desire to encourage any individual knowing of government fraud to bring that information forward,and it identified as perhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective enforcement of antifraud laws a lack of resources on the part of federal enforcement agencies.at,
consistent with these expressed views,the enacted legislation was replete with provisions encouraging qui tam actions.by replacing the government knowledge bar with the current text of e a and including an exception for original source s,congress allowed private parties to sue even based on information already in the government possession.cook county united states ex rel.chandler.the amendments also established the right of qui tam relators to continue as a party to a suit after the government intervenes,c ed.increased the percentage of recovery available as an incentive for private suits,d and created a cause of action against employers who retaliate against qui tam relators,h 
to be sure,congress was also concerned in,as in,with guarding against purely opportunistic,parasitic qui tam relators.see,at describing history of parasitic suits and the amendments ante,at.lower courts have viewed the amendments as striking a balance between the twin goals of rejecting suits which the government is capable of pursuing itself,while promoting those which the government is not equipped to bring on its own.united states ex rel.springfield terminal quinn,cadc.but evidence that congress sought to balance two competing goals supports moderation in interpreting an arguably ambiguous statutory text,rather than woodenly reading the statutory language to its fullest possible extent.
third,the legislative record contains no hint of any intention to bar suits based on disclosures from state or local government sources.brief for united states as amicus curiae quoting united states ex rel.center of metro,westchester,supp,sdny.inclusion of state or local government sources would have constituted a significant departure from the federal government knowledge bar that had existed for four decades by.but neither the initial bills reported by the senate and house committees nor statements by individual members of congress about subsequent versions of the legislation suggest any consideration or debate about expanding the bar to apply to state or local government sources 
although these points do not definitively resolve the question presented today,to my mind they counsel against reading e a ed.so broadly as to disturb the balance congress evidently sought to achieve through the amendments.today decision risks such a result.the court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by all appearances more restrictive of qui tam suits than the regime.construing e a to encompass the thousands of state and local government administrative reports produced each year effectively imputes to the federal government knowledge of such sources,whether or not the government is aware of the information or in a position to act on it the solicitor general specifically warns that while information in federal administrative audits or investigations is readily available to attorneys at the department of justice,many state and local reports and investigations never come to the attention of federal authorities.brief for united states as amicus curiae.the court dismisses this concern as sheer conjecture,postulating that government lawyers may in fact learn about quite a few state or local reports and investigations,particularly in joint programs ante,at.perhaps so.but absent any concrete reason to believe otherwise,i would not so readily dismiss the formal representation of the executive branch entity with responsibility for,and practical experience in,litigating fca claims on behalf of the united states.
in sum,the statute plain text,evidence of congress intent to expand qui tam actions,and practical consequences of a more expansive interpretation together suggest category is most reasonably read to encompass federal,but not state or local,government sources 
for the reasons given above,i would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals,and respectfully dissent.
on march,the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act,pub,stat.section j of this legislation replaces the prior version of e with new language.the legislation makes no mention of retroactivity,which would be necessary for its application to pending cases given that it eliminates petitioners claimed defense to a qui tam suit.see hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer.throughout this opinion,we use the present tense in discussing the statute as it existed at the time this case was argued.

in jarecki searle,the court applied the noscitur a sociis maxim in construing a statutory provision that referred to i ncome resulting from exploration,discovery,or prospecting,at quoting a b of the internal revenue code of.justice sotomayor contends that the three terms in category are no more distinct or disparate than the phrase at issue in jarecki.post,at dissenting opinion citation omitted.we disagree.whether taken in isolation or in context,the phrase congressional,administrative,or gao is not as cohesive as the phrase exploration,discovery,or prospecting.that is one reason why noscitur a sociis proved illuminating in jarecki,and why it is less helpful in this case.on their face,the terms exploration,discovery,and prospecting all describe processes of searching,seeking,speculating the centrality of such activities to the oil and gas and mining industries gave a clue that it was those industries congress had in mind when it drafted the provision,at internal quotation marks omitted.the terms congressional,administrative,and gao do not share any comparable core of meaning or indeed any common feature at all,post,at apart from a governmental connotation.it takes the sandwich theory to graft a federal limitation onto administrative.

see,at indeed,the statute would seem to be inconsistent if it included state and local administrative hearings as sources of public disclosures in category and then,in the next breath,excluded state administrative reports as sources in re natural gas royalties qui tam litigation,supp,there is no reason to conclude that congress intended to limit administrative reports,audits,and investigations to federal actions,while simultaneously allowing all state and local civil litigation,state and local administrative hearings,and state and local news media to be treated as public disclosures.to interpret the statute so narrowly would have the anomalous result of allowing public disclosure status to the most obscure local news report and the most obscure state and local civil lawsuit or administrative hearing,but denying public disclosure status to a formal public report of a state government agency 
following the court of appeals,see,at,respondent asserts that only the ninth circuit,in ambulance,california,has explicitly considered and rejected the argument that category is limited to federal sources.brief for respondent.at least one other circuit,however,has done the same,see united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,and no lower court,as far as we are aware,has so much as suggested that an alternative construction might be viable.moreover,the third,fifth,and eleventh circuit cases cited by the court of appeals postdate ambulance and dunleavy,both of which put litigants and courts on notice of the possibility that e a might be limited to federal sources.
on its face,l a is silent as to whether it includes nonfederal proceedings.respondent and the solicitor general suggest that it does,though they fairly argue that this provision,relating to civil investigative demands,has little if any relevance to the case at hand.see brief for respondent,brief for united states.
the court of appeals repeatedly referred to the three categories in e a as clauses.see,at.were they in fact clauses rather than prepositional phrases,reliance on noscitur a sociis might have been supported by one of our earliest cases using that term,watson mercer,pet,reporter statement of the case,which suggested that different clauses of the same sentence should be presumed to embrace the subject matter of the sentence.the court of appeals mistaken reference to clauses is of course less significant than its failure to treat the public disclosure bar as an integrated whole.stevens,the shakespeare canon of statutory construction,emphasizing importance of reading provisions in their broader statutory context.

see,dunleavy,at congress gave us little specific guidance to determine the scope of public disclosure sources united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante,prudential ins,the bill that eventuated in the amendments underwent substantial revisions during its legislative path.this provides ample opportunity to search the legislative history and find some support somewhere for almost any construction of the many ambiguous terms in the final version at scirica,dissenting one difficulty in interpreting the amendments is that congress was never completely clear about what kind of parasitic suits it was attempting to avoid boese a,at the present section e was enacted without explanation by congress a,at to a pplicable legislative history explaining versions of e not adopted is of little help in deciphering this provision.because section e was drafted subsequent to the completion of the house and senate committee reports on the proposed false claims act amendments,those reports,which contained discussion of altogether different bars,can not be used in interpreting it.and the sponsors interpretations of the provision ultimately enacted are spare,often incorrect,and enough to provide some support for almost any construction of its many ambiguities 
justice sotomayor makes a valiant effort to unearth from the legislative history the balance congress evidently sought to achieve through the amendments.post,at.but her reconstruction of the history assigns little weight to the side of this balance preserved by the public disclosure bar the desire to minimize the potential for parasitic lawsuits by those who learn of the fraud through public channels and seek remuneration although they contributed nothing to the exposure of the fraud,united states ex rel.doe john doe.and her narrative contains no account of why category emerged in the form that it did.any such account would necessarily be an exercise in speculation,as the record is silent on the matter.in our view,neither the general trajectory of fca reform nor the specific statements made during the legislative process clearly point one way or the other on the question before us.
see consumer product safety comm gte sylvania,hamdan rumsfeld,see also hafter,at,refusing to credit the letter in interpreting the public disclosure bar.respondent and her amici additionally contend that the enactment of the program fraud civil remedies act of pfcra,stat.codified at et,shortly before the enactment of the fca amendments supports their reading of the latter.see brief for respondent brief for united states brief for taxpayers against fraud education fund as amicus curiae.yet while there is no question that the pfcra was designed to operate in tandem with the fca,stevens,at,or that the pfcra is addressed to federal administrative agencies,there is also no explicit evidence to suggest that congress intended to limit category reference to administrative sources to the same set of agencies.the fca public disclosure bar serves a distinct function not replicated in the pfcra the text of the public disclosure bar contains no reference to the pfcra and no member of congress,so far as we are aware,articulated any such intent.
in some instances,federal law dictates that state and local governments receiving federal funds perform an audit of their programs.see a b requiring nonfederal entities that expend federal awards above a certain amount to undergo a single audit in accordance with specified conditions brief for state of pennsylvania et as amici curiae discussing the single audit act of.it bears mention that,to the extent one is worried about federal government ignorance of state and local antifraud efforts,see post,at,today ruling may induce federal authorities to pay closer attention to such efforts going forward.
petitioners and their amici also counter with public policy arguments of their own.under the court of appeals reading of the statute,they allege,there is an increased likelihood that parasitic relators will beat more deserving relators to the courthouse,brief for petitioners,and that state and local governments will find their antifraud investigations impeded,or will decline to conduct such investigations in the first place,on account of opportunistic potential relators trolling state records and reports,available to the public,in search of a qui tam claim,brief for state of pennsylvania et as amici curiae.
