eastman kodak company appeals the decision of the armed services board of contract appeals,asbca,wl july,concluding that claimed pension costs were not allocable to government contracts.the board determined that the government was entitled to a refund of the reimbursed pension costs for the period through.because the board properly concluded that kodak claimed pension costs were not allocable to the cost objectives of its government contracts,we affirm.
background 
on november,kodak was awarded a contract for the performance of certain classified work for the department of defense.under the contract,it was required to comply with all of the cost accounting standards cas and cost principles in effect at the time of contract award and to measure,assign,and allocate its pension costs according to cas.the contract also included an administration of cas clause that required kodak to disclose any proposed voluntary change to a cost accounting practice within sixty days before the proposed change.armed services procurement regulation a.this clause also required kodak to agree to appropriate contract adjustments relating to its change in cost accounting practices.id.
during the performance of the contract,kodak maintained a qualifying pension plan,within the meaning of the internal revenue code,which allocated its annual pension expenses to the divisions that performed the awarded contract.in turn,the government reimbursed kodak for the allocable expenses.before,kodak used the frozen initial liability actuarial cost method to calculate its annual pension expenses for purposes of funding,financial reporting,and government contract allocation.the frozen initial liability actuarial method is a spread gain actuarial cost method that does not independently produce a value for a pension plan unfunded actuarial liability.effective january,kodak management concluded that the frozen initial liability method could lead to unnecessary pension plan contributions,and adopted the projected unit credit actuarial cost method to calculate pension expenses.however,it failed to disclose this change to the government.for pension plan funding purposes kodak continued to use the projected unit credit method,which is an immediate gain actuarial method that separately identifies a pension plan unfunded actuarial liability.the determination of a pension plan unfunded actuarial liability is essential to resolving the question of whether a pension plan is overfunded.
later in,kodak contributed to its pension plan,and deducted the entire amount for tax purposes,either in or as a to.using the projected credit method,kodak calculated its pension expenses for as,leaving a balance that was treated as a prepayment for future pension plan expenses.kodak admits that from that point forward it had no obligation to further fund the pension plan.however,it applied the prepayment amount to the pension costs for the period through.
in january of,kodak pension fund became overfunded due to gains in the stock market,favorable investments,and use of the projected unit credit actuarial cost method to calculate its annual pension expenses.from through,while the pension fund remained overfunded,the government continued to pay its share of the allocated pension costs as determined by kodak.after audits by the defense contract audit agency,the contracting officer made a determination that kodak was not in compliance with cas.on january,the contracting officer issued a final decision determining that kodak was indebted to the government for plus interest for changing its method of accounting pension costs without disclosing it to the government,with cas,and improper inclusion of pension costs that were not allocable to cost objectives for the period through.
discussion 
we will not disturb the factual findings of the board unless they are fraudulent,arbitrary,capricious,so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or unsupported by substantial evidence.b mcclure constructors,dalton.on questions of law,we review the board decisions de novo.b coast dalton.notwithstanding this lack of deference on questions of law,we accord the board legal determinations careful consideration because of its experience in construing government contracts.see ingalls shipbuilding,dalton,coast,at.
at issue here is the proper interpretation of two regulatory provisions incorporated into kodak contract with the government accounting standard for composition and measurement of pension cost,cas and adjustment and allocation of pension cost,cas.cas and were promulgated in and respectively,under the authority granted to the cost accounting standards board casb in the defense production act amendments of,stat,codified at.repealed hereinafter.the original casb was an agent of congress,independent of the executive branch,consisting of the comptroller general and four other members appointed by the comptroller general,a.
under the defense production act amendments of,casb was given authority to promulgate standards designed to achieve uniformity and consistency in the principles followed by defense contractors and subcontractors under federal contracts.id.g rice martin marietta.in addition to promulgating cost accounting standards,casb was authorized to make,promulgate,amend,and rescind rules and regulations for the implementation of standards,h.
our analysis begins with the language of the cas clauses.we also look to any guidance casb,the promulgating authority,has published to aid our interpretation.perry martin marietta.cas and its companion provision on pensions,cas,govern the determination,measurement,assignment,and allocation of pension costs to government contracts.allocation occurs when a sufficient nexus exists between incurred costs and the activities or cost objectives,contracts to which those costs are charged.proper allocation of costs by a contractor is important because it may be necessary for the contractor to allocate costs among several government contracts or between government and activities.cas and,as applied to unfunded retirement plans such as kodak retirement income plan,require pension plan costs to be assigned to the year in which such costs are incurred and allocated to contracts for that year,and prohibit assignment of such costs to any other year.
kodak argues that the board improperly interpreted cas c to permit a contractor to recover pension costs only in a year where there is a compellable liability to pay.it contends that this interpretation renders meaningless regulation language that permits allocation when liquidation is actually effected.kodak reads the regulation as entitling contractors to allocate pension costs when there is a valid liability,or when liquidation can be compelled,or when there is no valid liability but liquidation is effected.kodak agrees with the government that its pension plan costs for the period through,were not allocable to cost objectives because liquidation of its liability for pension costs was not compelled.however,it relies on the alternative requirement of cas c,which provides for the allocation of pension costs to cost objectives if liquidation of liability is effected in the period for which the pension costs were incurred.kodak contends that it has a liability for its pension costs because a portion of the prepayment balance,considered an asset,was transferred to the pension plan.it argues that these transfers from the corporation books to the pension plan were liquidated because the company was ultimately liable to the pensioners to pay pension plan costs.
the government responds that the board properly interpreted the language of cas c to require the existence of a valid liability that is liquidated as an essential prerequisite for allocability to government contracts.and,since kodak had no valid liability or obligation to make any contribution to its pension plan from through,when the plan was overfunded,it was barred from allocating the amounts contributed in those years to its cost objectives.the parties arguments are close to the solution on this point,but they both miss the mark.
cas requires,inter alia,government contractors with contrac
