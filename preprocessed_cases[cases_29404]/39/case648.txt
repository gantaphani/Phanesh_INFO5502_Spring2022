robert mudge appeals from the decision of the united states court of federal claims dismissing his complaint for lack of jurisdiction.mudge united states.because the court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case,we reverse the court dismissal and remand for further proceedings.because the court did not address the issue of whether the terms of mudge collective bargaining agreement cba independently deprived it of jurisdiction,we do not resolve that question on appeal.
background 
mudge was employed as a maintenance mechanic by the federal aviation administration faa.id.at.he was also a member of the professional airways systems specialists trade union union,and the terms of his employment were consequently governed in part by a cba between the union and the faa.id.at.mudge claim stems from his work transfers between nevada and alaska.initially,mudge was stationed in reno,nevada,but he voluntarily transferred to king station,alaska,in january,working there until march,at which time he returned to reno,where he worked until his retirement in december.id.at.mudge filed a grievance under the cba,claiming entitlement to back pay on two grounds.id.at.first,he sought a pay differential for the time he worked in alaska to account for the higher cost of living in that state.id.second,he sought pay retention for the time he worked in nevada after having worked in alaska,arguing that the faa had wrongly reduced his pay upon his return to nevada.id.the union elected not to pursue mudge pay retention claim and proceeded instead with only his pay differential claim pursuant to the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in the cba.id.the faa rejected that claim,however,and the union chose not to instigate arbitration id.dissatisfied with this result,mudge sought relief from the general accounting office gao and the merit systems protection board mspb.id.both the gao and the mspb rejected mudge claim,however,finding that they lacked authority to hear his case.id.mudge subsequently filed his pay differential claim in the court of federal claims.id.
the court dismissed mudge complaint on the ground that a,which is part of the civil service reform act csra,et,deprived the court of jurisdiction.that statutory paragraph and the subsequent paragraph read as follows 
a except as provided in paragraph of this subsection,any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances,including questions of arbitrability.except as provided in subsections d,e,and g of this section,the procedures shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.
any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.
a emphasis added.
it is undisputed that mudge pay differential claim constitutes a grievance within the meaning of the statute and that his cba does not exclude such grievances from the application of the negotiated procedures under a.similarly,neither party asserts that mudge claim is exempted from those procedures under d,e,or g,which allow a federal employee to resolve certain types of grievances through either negotiated procedures or alternative administrative,and sometimes judicial,procedures.see id.d giving federal employees affected by a prohibited personnel practice under b the choice of proceeding under either negotiated or statutory procedures e giving federal employees affected by employment actions covered under or the choice of proceeding under either negotiated or appellate procedures g giving whistleblowers the choice of proceeding under either negotiated procedures or certain administrative procedures enumerated therein.the only other exception to a exclusivity provision,subsection c,is also inapplicable as a result,the heart of the the court of federal claims has jurisdiction over a claim that falls within the scope of the negotiated grievance,as it did below,on the meaning of the term administrative in a.
prior to,the statute did not contain the term administrative.rather,a stated that the grievance procedures set forth in a cba would be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which f ell within its coverage.a emphasis added.in carter gibbs,en banc,cert.denied,carter goldberg,d,this court interpreted the language to preclude federal employees from resolving grievances covered by their cba in court.relying on the unambiguous text of unamended a,which stated that the procedures shall be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage,carter held that the statute limited the resolution of such grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in an employee cba.carter,at.like mudge,the appellants in carter did not contest that their claims,pay disputes under the fair labor standards act flsa,constituted grievances subject to the negotiated procedures.id.nor did they argue that subsections a,c,d,or e removed their claims from the application of those procedures.id.at.instead,appellants argued that they were exempt from a exclusivity provision because to hold otherwise would allow the csra to implicitly repeal their right to sue under the flsa.see id.at.in other words,appellants urged this court to read an additional exception into a,one that would allow them to bring their flsa claims in court despite the availability of administrative redress under their cba negotiated grievance procedures.see id.at.heeding the supreme court admonition to leave the architecture of the federal personnel system to congress,we declined to do so.id.at quoting volk hobson.
in,congress amended the csra by adding subsection g to.united states office of special counsel,merit systems protection board authorization,b,stat.codified in scattered sections of and.this subsection gives whistleblowers the choice of resolving their employment grievances through either the negotiated procedures contained in their cba or through certain administrative avenues enumerated in g.see g.concurrent with the creation of subsection g,congress made two changes to subsection a.first,congress amended a to refer to subsection g,c,stat.as such,a exclusivity provision now applies e xcept as provided in subsections d,e,and g.a emphasis added.second,and critically,congress added the contested term administrative to a,c,stat.in other words,it added the term administrative to the phrase shall be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances previously construed in carter.congress styled both of these changes to a as technical and conforming amendments.id.
nothing else in the direct legislative history of the amendments informs the meaning of the term administrative or congress intent in adding the word to a,the bill that ultimately amended a,passed the house without the term administrative,and the word was only added later as a floor amendment in the senate.see cong.rec.and.while the house subsequently adopted the senate amendment to the bill,see id,neither the house nor the senate provided a discussion or an explanation of the disputed term.as far as the amendments indirect history is concerned,two national treasury employees union nteu officials testified during the subcommittee hearings on that congress should overrule carter by clarifying that while negotiated grievance procedures constitute a federal employee exclusive administrative remedy,they do not foreclose access to available judicial remedies.see to reauthorize the office of special counsel and to make amendments to the whistleblower protection act hearing on before the subcomm.on the civil servs.of the house comm.on post office civil,cong.statements of tim hannapel,assistant counsel in the office of general counsel,nteu,and robert tobias,president,nteu.additionally,a house committee report accompanying a different bill,that failed to pass either the house of representatives or the senate stated that the addition of administrative to would clarify that t he grievance procedure was never intended to deprive employees of access to the courts and thereby correct the decision in carter.federal employee fairness act of,pt,at see also id.at pt,at stating that the proposed addition of the word administrative to would clarify that section is not intended to limit judicial remedies otherwise provided by law.
in the proceedings below,the court of federal claims rejected mudge argument that the nteu testimony and the committee report accompanying the other bill,evidenced a congressional intent to overrule carter gibbs.instead,the court concluded that the absence of any demonstrated connection between the cited hearing testimony and the legislative intent that mudge sought to attribute to it reinforced the fact that the change to a was a technical one not meant to substantively alter the law set forth in carter.see mudge.at.the court also rejected mudge argument that the word administrative should be given its plain meaning,distinct from the meaning of judicial.id.at.instead,the court undertook a broader approach to statutory interpretation,concluding that mudge construction would render a superfluous,id.at,and disrupt the primacy and exclusivity of the collective bargaining agreement grievance procedure as the method for resolving employee grievances,id.at.according to the court,the addition of the word administrative simply clarified that the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in a federal employee cba constitute the employee only avenue of redress except in those cases where explicitly offers a choice of administrative remedies,as it does in subsections d,e,and g.id.
mudge appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
the court of federal claims decision to grant the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is a matter of law,which this court reviews de novo.see muniz united states.the underlying issue,a question of statutory interpretation,is also subject to de novo review on appeal.see strickland united.
this case is not the only one in which the court of federal claims has confronted the question of whether the amendments to the csra effectively overruled carter by allowing federal employees to seek a judicial remedy for grievances that are subject to their cba negotiated procedures.instead,our decision today benefits from the analysis of five other opinions in which the court of federal claims has addressed precisely this issue in two of these cases,the court came to the same conclusion as in mudge,holding that notwithstanding congress inclusion of the term administrative,a continues to deprive the courts of jurisdiction of grievances that fall within the scope of a cba negotiated procedures and therefore affirming carter viability after the amendments.see united states.united states.in the remaining three cases,however,the court came to the opposite conclusion,holding that the amendments to the csra overruled carter by establishing a federal employee right to bring an action in court despite the availability of a remedy under his or her cba.see bailey united states,fed.cl.abbott united states,fed.cl.abramson united states,fed.cl.because this is a contested matter with compelling and arguments on both sides,we find it helpful to begin with a brief overview of the reasoning set forth in these cases.
like mudge,and held that the addition of the word administrative to a did not affect the applicability of carter to plaintiffs case.see,fed.cl.at,fed.cl.at.thus in these two cases,the court dismissed plaintiffs claims for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that those claims were covered by the terms of the plaintiffs cbas,fed.cl.at,fed.cl.at.like mudge,both and rejected plaintiffs reliance on the plain language of the statute in favor of the general congressional preference for the exclusivity of collectively bargained grievance procedures expressed in the csra.as the court stated in,t his court can not agree that obeisance to the dictionary definition of the word administrative to the exclusion of other considerations justifies departure from a legislative scheme grounded on the premise that collectively bargained grievance procedures are the preferred method of dispute resolution for unionized federal employees.at.similarly,the court held that t he plaintiff proposed reading of administrative would significantly undermine congress strong preference for settling disputes through collective bargaining agreements.if congress wishes to overturn carter gibbs,in other words,it would require more than a one word technical and conforming amendment to make that clear.at.in this respect,reiterated the mudge court unwillingness to conclude that congress would fundamentally alter the balance of remedies set forth in the csra through the enactment of a technical and conforming amendment.see mudge.at.although did not focus on the technical nature of the amendments,it did find that plaintiffs proposed interpretation of amended a would invert the statutory favor enjoyed by employees whose grievances fall within subsections d,e,and g by limiting them to a single remedy while providing employees with both negotiated and judicial recourse.at.
finally,neither the nor the court was swayed by plaintiffs reliance on the legislative history.as did mudge,and both found that congress silence as to the intended effect of the addition of the word administrative to a counseled against reading the amendments as overturning carter.as the court stated in,t he total absence of direct legislative history for the year in which the amendments did pass caution s against reading into it the drastic changes plaintiffs propose to the law as announced in carter gibbs.at.see also.at if congress intended such a drastic change to the current scheme,it is inconceivable that the legislative record would not reflect some discussion or debate of that change.
in bailey,abbott,and abramson,the court of federal claims came to the opposite conclusion.these three cases held that congress effectively overruled carter when it added the word administrative to a and that the csra therefore no longer forecloses judicial review of employment grievances that are included within a cba negotiated grievance procedures.see bailey.at abbott.at abramson.at.in all three cases,the court began with the language of the statute itself,finding the plain meaning of the term administrative to be distinct from the word judicial.see bailey.at abbott.at abramson.at.in abbott and abramson,this distinction led the court to conclude that congress limited a exclusivity provision to the administrative arena when it added the word administrative to that subsection and that the csra consequently no longer bars a federal employee from seeking judicial relief in court.see abbott.at abramson.at.
the bailey court,however,concluded that the plain language of the statute did not entirely dispose of the issue.see.at.instead,bailey addressed the government argument that congress added the term administrative to a simply to clarify that unless an employee is authorized to pursue one of the administrative remedies set forth in subsection g,the negotiated grievance procedures remain the only available remedial channel.see id.the bailey court rejected this interpretation of a on the ground that it read the word administrative out of the statute.id.at.the court also found it improbable that congress would add clarifying language to a statute that this court had previously held to be unambiguous in carter.id.see also abramson.at carter gibbs had already previously found the unamended text of section to be unambiguous.if it was already clear and serving its intended purpose,congress would change it only to effect a different result.internal citations omitted.additionally,the bailey court rejected the government arguments that congress would not establish a federal employee right to judicial review by means of a technical and conforming amendment and that plaintiffs interpretation of the statute would render a superfluous.see.at.
finally,all three cases addressed the parties reliance on the legislative history.in abbott and abramson,the court concluded that the legislative history was not compelling because it failed to provide the sort of extraordinary showing of contrary intentions necessary to justify a departure from the unambiguous statutory language.abramson,fed.cl.at quoting garcia united states,d see also abbott,fed.cl.at.in bailey,the court determined that this history was relevant inasmuch as it reinforced the plain meaning of the statute text.see.at.
we conclude that congress addition of the word administrative to a established a federal employee right to seek a judicial remedy for employment grievances subject to the negotiated procedures contained in his or her cba.to the extent that carter held otherwise,the court based its decision on the language of the statute as it read prior to the amendments and that decision is therefore no longer applicable.accordingly,we reverse the court of federal claim dismissal of mudge claim for lack of jurisdiction and remand for further proceedings.
as a preliminary matter,we note that our decision in dunklebarger merit systems protection board,does not dictate a different result.in both and,the court of federal claims relied on dunklebarger to dismiss the plaintiffs claims for lack of jurisdiction.see,fed.cl.at,fed.cl.at.additionally,the government argues on appeal that dunklebarger demonstrates this court adherence to carter even after the amendments to the csra.dunklebarger,however,did not address the significance of the addition of the word administrative to a.rather,it focused on the text of a to conclude that a federal employee is generally not allowed to choose between negotiated grievance procedures and an appeal to the mspb even when his or her cba purports to permit such a choice.see dunklebarger,at.as such,dunklebarger is not dispositive of mudge appeal,which we address in detail below.
it is beyond debate that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute.see hughes aircraft jacobson,d as in any case of statutory construction,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.internal quotation omitted blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d the starting point of every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.weddel sec y of dep t of health human,under the traditional rule of statutory interpretation,courts must look first to intrinsic evidence of intent,the textual language alone.accordingly,we begin our inquiry with the text of the csra itself.section a directs that,with a few enumerated exceptions,the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in a federal employee cba are to be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances that fall within the cba coverage.a emphasis added.because the statute does not define the word administrative,see,we presume that congress intended to give that term its ordinarily understood meaning,see asgrow seed winterboer,d when terms used in a statute are undefined,we give them their ordinary meaning.internal citation omitted.in ascertaining the common meaning of an undefined statutory term,the court may refer to the dictionary.see koyo seiko united states,a dictionary is an appropriate source for gleaning ordinary meaning.consulting black law dictionary,we find the meaning of administrative to be distinguished from such functions and acts as are judicial.black law dictionary ed see also carter,at noting the distinction between the administrative and judicial arenas.the plain language of a as amended is therefore clear while a limits the administrative resolution of a federal employee grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in his or her cba,the text of the statute does not restrict an employee right to seek a judicial remedy for such grievances.
on appeal,the government urges this court to construe amended a contrary to this clear meaning.the government makes several arguments in support of its position.first,the government argues that the actual meaning of a amended text is different from that stated above.according to the government,congress addition of the word administrative to the phrase exclusive administrative procedures did not limit a exclusivity provision to the administrative realm.instead,the government asserts,the presence of the word administrative simply clarifies that unless an aggrieved employee falls within the narrowly defined class of employees covered by new subsection g,that employee is limited to the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in his or her cba.the court of federal claims explicitly adopted this interpretation below,holding that the word administrative does no more than make plain that the negotiated grievance procedure is the employee only remedy,except where explicitly offers a choice of other administrative remedies.mudge.at.
as mudge correctly responds,however,there was no need for congress to clarify a in this fashion.as we held in carter,the unamended language of a prior to congress inclusion of the term administrative in was unambiguous and clearly provided that the negotiated grievance procedures set out in the collective bargaining agreement would be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.at internal citation omitted.moreover,subsections d and e,neither of which was amended in,already permitted certain employees to choose between negotiated and administrative procedures in much the same way as subsection g whistleblower provisions later would.see id.at subsections d and e give employees a choice of resolving certain specified types of disputes either through the negotiated grievance procedures or through alternative administrative channels.the addition of subsection g therefore did not,in our view,require congress to make any clarifying amendments to a,and the government interpretation impermissibly reads the word administrative out of the subsection.in construing the csra as amended,this court must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of the statute.united states menasche.quoting inhabitants of montclair township ramsdell.we consequently reject the government construction of a and interpret that subsection to mean what it says.except as provided elsewhere in the statute,the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in a federal employee cba constitute the exclusive administrative,but not judicial,procedures for resolving grievances that fall within its scope.
second,the government argues that congress did not intend to substantively change a when it added the word administrative to that subsection because it did so via a technical and conforming amendment.relying on the supreme court decision in director of revenue of missouri cobank acb,d,and echoing the court of federal claim reasoning in mudge,the government argues that congress did not intend to alter the balance of remedies set forth in the csra in a section entitled technical and conforming amendments.see mudge.at declining to assign substantive content to a statutory term that was introduced simply as a technical amendment.as the supreme court stated in united states,d,however,a statute is a statute,whatever its label.moreover,the court decision in cobank is distinguishable from the instant case.cobank held that congress did not intend to immunize certain banks from state taxation by passing a technical and conforming amendment deleting two sentences from of the farm credit act of,et.see cobank,at.according to the court,t he more logical interpretation of the amendment to was that congress merely deleted language that had become superfluous.id.at.unlike the amendment at issue in cobank,however,the amendment to a did not involve the deletion of superfluous language but rather the affirmative addition of statutory text.furthermore,congress addition of this text does not provide two logical interpretation s of the statute from which this court can choose.id.following example,therefore,we appl y the usual tools of statutory construction to all relevant amendments to the csra,regardless of their title,at.
third,the government urges us to construe a contrary to its plain language on the ground that the legislative history surrounding the amendments does not demonstrate that congress intended to establish a federal employee right to seek judicial relief for grievances covered by his or her cba by adding the word administr
