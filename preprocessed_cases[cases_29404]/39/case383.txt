appellant united states government appeals the decision of the united states court of federal claims claims court finding that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction under the tucker act,b,to resolve the instant action filed by jay hymas,doing business as dosmen farms.hymas united states,fed.cl.the government also contests the claims court collateral finding that the united states department of the interior fish and wildlife service the service violated various federal procurement laws and the administrative procedure act the apa when it entered into cooperative farming agreements cfas with individual farmers to grow crops on public lands in the umatilla national wildlife refuge umatilla refuge and the mcnary national wildlife refuge mcnary refuge.id.at.we vacate the claims court decision and remand with instructions to dismiss hymas case.
background 
beginning in the,the service entered into cfas with farmers to manage public lands in the national wildlife refuge system for the conservation of migratory birds and wildlife,including at the umatilla and mcnary refuges in the pacific northwest see id.at.most cfas share identical terms,through which the service permits a cooperator to farm specific parcels of public land with specific crops that benefit the wildlife.see,reproducing several cfas.no payment occurs for the performance of the cfas instead,cooperators typically retain percent of the crop yield for their efforts.the remaining percent is left to feed migratory birds and other wildlife.the service continues its involvement once cooperators begin to perform the cfas,advising on decisions related to crop selection farming methods pesticide and fertilizer use and crop harvest.
in the,the service issued cropland management plans for the umatilla and mcnary refuges.the plans call for tenure arrangements through which c ooperators are selected in accordance with refuge manual guidelines and are issued a three year cfa.cfas were normally intended to be agreements because the service determined that c ooperators should be given a interest in the stewardship of the soil.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
hymas,through his business dosmen farms,sought to secure a cfa with the service in and.a resident of kennewick,washington,hymas lived approximately miles as the crow flies from the mcnary refuge and miles from the umatilla refuge.when hymas expressed his interest in a cfa to the service,he indicated that he had not participated in a national wildlife refuge cooperative farming program,nor was he a former landowner or tenant of acquired lands.according to the service,hymas also indicated that he farmed the local vicinity but did not provide any location information to verify these activities.
the service considered hymas,but ultimately selected other cooperators.in,the service awarded four cfas with terms and two cfas with multiyear terms.see,cfas with term,cfas with terms.in,the service awarded four cfas with terms that covered the same parcels of land subject to the expired cfas awarded in.the service did not use formal procurement procedures or solicit full and open competition before it awarded the and cfas rather,it relied upon its priority selection system that gave preference to previous cooperators with a successful record of farming designated areas within the refuge.selection decision memos selection decision memos.because hymas did not live adjacent to the refuges and had not previously farmed refuge lands,the service did not select him for a cfa.see also,citing other reasons.
hymas filed a bid protest in the claims court in april,alleging that the service violated various federal procurement laws and the apa by not soliciting full and open competition for the cfas.hymas,fed.cl.at.hymas amended complaint alleges that 
the service use of a bidding process for the cfas violated the competition in contract act the cica,a now a count i the federal grant and cooperative agreement act the fgcaa,u.and count ii and was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,and contrary to law under the apa count iii.
id.at.hymas filed a motion for judgment on the administrative record,and the government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a cross motion for judgment upon the administrative record.id.
in july,the claims court denied the government motion to dismiss,finding that it had subject matter jurisdiction over hymas claims.id.at.the claims court held that the cica,rather than the fgcaa,contains the operative definition of procurement for purposes of determining jurisdiction under the tucker act.id.at.the claims court applied the cica definition to the facts of the case and held that,because the service used the cfas at issue to obtain the services of to feed migratory birds and wildlife on the refuges,that activity amounted to a procurement,such that it had tucker act jurisdiction to entertain hymas challenge.id.at.
turning to the merits,the claims court determined that the service violated the cica by not using formal procurement procedures to obtain full and open competition.id.at.the claims court found that neither the fish and wildlife coordination act of the act,stat.codified as amended at,nor the national wildlife refuge system administration act,stat.codified as amended at h the act,nor the national wildlife refuge system volunteer and community partnership enhancement act of,stat.codified as amended at,the act authorize the service to enter into cooperative agreements like the cfas or exempt the service from complying with the cica.id.at.it also held that the service priority selection system violated the fgcaa.id.at.consequently,the claims court permanently enjoined the service from entering into any cfas or other contractual vehicles concerning the mcnary and umatilla national wildlife refuges for the farming season or thereafter,unless and until the selection process and award s comply with the cica,fgcaa,and the apa.id.at.it also ordered the service to terminate the six cfas awarded in and at the conclusion of the farming season.id.at.the claims court entered judgment accordingly.

a federal court must satisfy itself of its jurisdiction over the subject matter before it considers the merits of a case.ruhrgas ag marathon oil,see ex parte mccardle,without jurisdiction,the court can not proceed at all in any cause.jurisdiction is power to declare the law,and when it ceases to exist,the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.a decision from the claims court on the scope of its jurisdiction presents a question of law that we review without deference.see sra int l,united states.the party seeking to invoke the claims court jurisdiction must establish that jurisdiction exists by a preponderance of the evidence.taylor united states.w e review the claims court findings of fact relating to jurisdictional issues for clear error.john sand gravel united states.although,for purposes of jurisdiction,we typically assume as true all facts alleged in a complaint,where the factual basis for the court subject matter jurisdiction is challenged,only uncontroverted factual allegations are accepted as true.cedars sinai med.ctr.watkins.
ii.the claims court lacked subject matter jurisdiction 
t he united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.united states testan,quoting united states sherwood.consistent with this principle,the tucker act confers limited jurisdiction on the claims court to adjudicate claims against the united states.brown united states.in relevant part,the tucker act states that the claims court may render judgment 
on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.b emphasis added.commonly known as bid protest jurisdiction,this court has found that this provision speaks exclusively to procurement solicitations and contracts.res.conservation,llc united states,emphasis added see id.at discussing the statutory text and legislative history of b.
as is occasionally necessary in deciding the parameters of bid protest jurisdiction,we must answer certain foundational questions that necessarily will impart whether the court has jurisdiction over the issues raised.see,mudge united states,reviewing underlying statutory issues to determine whether the claims court properly dismissed suit see also in re teles ag informationstechnologien,same.specifically,we must first decide whether the service has statutory authority to enter into cooperative agreements.if it does not,then the service could only have negotiated procurement contracts subject to tucker act review.if it did have the authority,we must next decide whether the service properly construed the cfas as cooperative agreements,rather than procurement contracts.if we find that the service correctly concluded that the cfas are not procurement contracts,then we must resolve whether the claims court subject matter jurisdiction under the tucker act extends to cooperative agreements.we address each question in turn.
a.the service properly interpreted the relevant statutes to authorize the use of cfas 
we first must address whether the service properly interpreted the relevant statutes as authorizing it to negotiate cooperative agreements of the type represented by the cfas.we review an agency statutory interpretation using the framework established by chevron,natural resources defense council.the first prong requires the court to assess whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue if so,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if the statute does not answer the specific question,meaning that it is silent or ambiguous,then the court must discern whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at wilder merit.prot,f d.if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.chevron,at.such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at footnote omitted.
the claims court held that the,and acts do not exempt the cfas from what the cica demands.hymas,fed.cl.at.the government argues that the claims court failed to defer to the service permissible interpretation of these statutes as allowing the service to enter into cfas with individuals who are not volunteers.appellant br.we agree with the government.
the service permissibly construed the act 
in,congress passed an act to promote the conservation of wild life,fish,and game,and for other purposes,which authorized the service to provide expert assistance to and to cooperate with federal,state,and other agencies in increasing the supply of game and animals and fish,in combating diseases,and in developing a program of conservation and rehabilitation,stat,the act.congress amended the act in to authorize the service to provide assistance to,and cooperate with,federal,state,and public or private agencies and organizations in fulfilling its goals and to carry out other measures necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act.an act to promote the conservation of wildlife,fish,and game,and for other purposes,stat,the act emphasis added.importantly,congress also required that areas made available to the service shall be administered either directly,or pursuant to cooperative agreements entered into pursuant to the provisions of section.id,stat.at emphasis added.the amendment also expressly authorized the service to promulgate rules and regulations for the conservation,maintenance,and management of wildlife,resources thereof,and its habitat thereon.id.in,congress again amended the act act,stat.at.in so doing,it the provisions above in substantially identical form.id.these provisions remain unchanged.
because congress did not define the phrase public or private agencies and organizations in the act,the service invoked the express rulemaking authority of that act in,promulgating a regulation allowing the service to enter into cooperative agreements on a refuge with any person 
cooperative agreements with persons for crop cultivation,haying,grazing,or the harvest of vegetative products,including plantlife,growing with or without cultivation on wildlife refuge areas may be executed on a basis when such agreements are in aid of or benefit to the wildlife management of the area.
title wildlife revision and reorganization of title,dep t of interior,final rules emphases added codified at.the service defines a person as an individual,club,association,partnership,corporation,or private or public body.id.at codified at.these regulations remain unchanged.
the claims court rejected the government argument that,by authorizing the use of cooperative agreements rather than procurement contracts,the act which,in amending the act,retained the cooperative agreement provision of the act exempts the service cfas from the competitive bid requirements of the cica.enacted in,the cica established a general requirement that executive agencies obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures when conducting a procurement for property or services,stat.the cica originally did not include a definition of procurement,but in congress amended the act to define the term.an act to enact certain laws relating to public contracts as title,united states code,public contracts,stat.the cica now defines procurement as all stages of the process of acquiring property or services,beginning with the process for determining a need for property or services and ending with contract completion and closeout.
as an initial matter,the claims court found that the act could not have preempted the cica because congress passed the cica in,years after the act.hymas,fed.cl.at.the claims court reached the same conclusion with respect to the act,id.at,which provided that the service regulations shall continue in effect until modified or rescinded,act,g,stat.at.and it similarly found that the regulation,codified at,could not preempt the cica.hymas,fed.cl.at.
the claims court holdings resolve a conflict.no provision in the cica text indicates that congress meant to replace the cooperative agreements provision of the earlier enacted legislation or the regulation,stat.at.in addition,when congress amended the cica in,it intended to complement and clarify its earlier enactments on the same subject matter by providing a definition for procurement.see b,stat.at explaining that i n the codification of laws by this act,the intent is to conform to the understood policy,intent,and purpose of congress in the original enactments,with such amendments and corrections as will remove ambiguities,contradictions,and other imperfections.and nothing in the legislative history accompanying the cica and the amendment warrants a different conclusion.see generally,reprinted in,reprinted in.in the absence of any indication to the contrary in the statute or the legislative history,the claims court erred in holding the competitive bidding requirements of the cica apply to the cooperative agreements authorized by regulation pursuant to the and acts.see,united states fausto,i t can be strongly presumed that congress will specifically address language on the statute books that it wishes to change.
turning to the act text,the claims court found that it did not provide the service with the authority to enter into the cfas because the act governs only cooperative agreements between the service and other federal,state,and public or private agencies and organizations to coordinate conservation between these various organizations.hymas,fed.cl.at emphasis added quoting.because the cfas at issue were between the service and private farmers,rather public or private agencies or organizations,the claims court found the act inapplicable.hymas,fed.cl.at.it also determined that the phrase public or private agencies and organizations unambiguously describes the types of governmental and private entities that need to coordinate to conserve wildlife and that it has nothing to do with cooperative farming agreements between the service and private farmers.id.at.it also reasoned that coordination with private farmers does not make sense within the context of the statute.id.at.as a result,the claims court determined that the statute contained no gap that could fill.id.
we find ambiguity in the act reference to public or private agencies and organizations where the claims court did not its construction can not stand.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,p rior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.the statute does not define the phrase public or private agencies and organizations,so we give the terms their ordinary,established meaning,for which we may consult dictionaries.info.tech.applications united states.the definition of private includes belonging to or concerning an individual,person,company,or interest.private,webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged webster.organization involves an administrative and functional structure of an organization such as a business.organization,id.a business reflects a commercial enterprise carried on for profit and encompasses,among other structures,a sole proprietorship like hymas dosmen farms.business,black law dictionary ed.black law dictionary see id.defining sole proprietorship as a business in which one person owns all the assets,owes all the liabilities,and operates in his or her personal capacity see also hymas united states,docket at where hymas answered none as to whether any parent corporation or publicly held companies own ten percent or more of dosmen farms.these terms also have alternative definitions and conceivably could cover other entities.private,webster organization,see also business enterprises,black law dictionary describing different business structures.the existence of alternative dictionary definitions of a term indicates that the statute is open to interpretation.info,at internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.taken together,we find that the phrase public or private agencies and organizations contains ambiguity.

the claims court holdings do not support a different result.first,the claims court concluded that coordination between the service and private farmers make s no sense within the context of the statute,hymas,fed.cl.at,but that ipse dixit statement does not answer why the service could not coordinate conservation efforts with private farmers consistent with the act goals,just as it had for the past fifty years.second,it observed that did not expressly state that the service promulgated the regulation to interpret the phrase public or private agencies and organizations first set forth in section of the act codified at,hymas,fed.cl.at that finding overlooks the service citation in its rulemaking notice of,which in provided for cooperative agreements entered into pursuant to the provisions of.see final rules.at.third,the claims court relied upon the principle of ejusdem generis to find the phrase public or private agencies and organizations unambiguous hymas,fed.cl.at,but that canon comes into play only when there is some uncertainty as to the meaning of a particular clause in a statute,turkette,at,which the claims court did not find.in any event,the claims court should have deferred to the service regulation that permissibly construed the ambiguous statute.finally,that a different service regulation also contains the term cooperative agreement does not diminish the reasonableness of,and the claims court erred in concluding otherwise.hymas,fed.cl.at.instead,it confirms that the service broadly interpreted its cooperative agreement authority to encompass both the public and private spheres.see a using cooperative agreement in the definition of coordination area.
in sum,the service permissibly construed the act in filling a statutory gap and properly found that the act authorized it to negotiate cooperative agreements.as we explain in the next subsection,a separate statutory scheme the fish and wildlife act of,stat.fwa also permits the service to negotiate cooperative agreements.
the claims court construction conflicts with the act unambiguous terms and legislative history 
after it initially enacted the fwa in to rename the service,congress amended the fwa in in part to promote volunteer programs and community partnerships for the benefit of national wildlife refuges.act,stat.pursuant to that amendment,congress authorized the service to enter into cooperative agreement s with any partner organization,academic institution,or state or local government agency to carry out or more projects or programs for a refuge.id.at,d a,stat.at.in,congress clarif ied the service cooperative agreement authority,providing that 
the secretary of the interior may negotiate and enter into a cooperative agreement with a partner organization,academic institution,state or local government agency,or other person to implement one or more projects or programs for a refuge or complex of geographically related refuges in accordance with the purposes of this subsection and in compliance with the policies of other relevant authorities,regulations,and policy guidance.

the claims court found that neither the act nor the amendments provide the service with the authority to negotiate cooperative agreements like the cfas.it found the act text focuses on voluntary programs or community partnerships,not contractual arrangements whereby use public land to grow crops.hymas,fed.cl.at quoting act,stat.at.it examined the legislative history of the amendments and determined that congress intended the act and amendments to expand the service authority to hire more volunteers,not its authority to negotiate cooperative agreements under which cooperators receive compensation in kind.hymas,fed.cl.at examining,at,reprinted in.it also observed that the cfas could be considered projects and programs to promote the stewardship of resources of the refuge,but declined to adopt such a broad interpretation of the act because doing so would mean there was no meaningful limitation on the types of agreements that the service could enter into,pursuant to section d.id.at.finally,the claims court concluded that congress could have exempted the service from the cica when it enacted the amendments,but did not do so.id.at.
the claims court interpretation conflicts with the act plain text.first,the claims court incorrectly construed the act preamble to concern volunteer activities only.to the contrary,congress enacted the act to promote volunteer programs and for other purposes.act,stat.at.in any event,a preamble can not overcome the statute plain language.see dist.of columbia heller,i n america the settled principle of law is that the preamble can not control the enacting part of the statute in cases where the enacting part is expressed in clear,unambiguous terms.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the statute unambiguously permits the service to negotiate and enter into a cooperative agreement like the cfa with a person to implement a program that promote s the stewardship of resources of the refuge s through habitat maintenance,restoration,and improvement or support s the operation and maintenance of the refuge through constructing,operating,maintaining,or improving the facilities of the refuge s.d a,b i ii see,discussing purposes of the cfas.
the claims court reading of the legislative history is similarly problematic.when it passed the act,congress identified three broad purposes that included,among other goals,the facilitation of partnerships between the national wildlife refuge system and entities to promote public awareness of the resources of the system and public participation in the conservation of those resources and the encouragement of donations and other contributions by persons and organizations to the system.act,b,stat.at id.explicitly identifying volunteer activities as a separate goal.that congress later sought to enhance volunteer participation in does not mean that it did so at the expense of its earlier goals.see aectra refining,united states,f d,congress is presumed to enact legislation with knowledge of the law and a statute is presumed to be harmonious with existing law and judicial concepts.see also fausto,at i t can be strongly presumed that congress will specifically address language on the statute books that it wishes to change.
with respect to the claims court concerns about meaningful limitations to the service cooperative agreements authority,we find that exercise best left to the service.we have held that o ur duty is not to weigh the wisdom of,or to resolve any struggle between,competing views of the public interest,but rather to respect legitimate policy choices made by the agency in interpreting and applying the statute.suramerica de aleacionesx laminadas,united states.we decline to chart a different course today.
finally,the claims court assertion that congress could have exempted the service from the cica in but did not proffers a false choice.the service has the authority to negotiate cooperative agreements like the cfas should it choose to do so.we have held that such agreements need not comply with the cica in analogous circumstances.see cms contract mgmt.servs.hous.fin.agency,holding that agencies escape the requirements of federal procurement law under the cica when using a cooperative agreement.
taken together,the and acts,as amended,are independent sources that authorize the service to negotiate cooperative agreements like the cfas.the claims court erred in holding otherwise.
b.the service properly construed the cfas as cooperative agreements 
having determined that the statutory scheme permits the service to enter into cooperative agreements,we next must answer whether the service properly construed the cfas at issue as cooperative agreements,rather than procurement contracts.whether a contract is a procurement contract or a cooperative agreement is a question of law,which the court reviews de novo.id.at citing maint.eng rs united states.as we explain below,the service properly construed the instruments at issue as cooperative agreements.
various statutes address legal instruments under federal law.statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute.norfolk dredging united states,citing williams taylor.a court derives the plain meaning of the statute from its text and structure.id.quoting alexander sandoval.if the words are unambiguous,no further inquiry is usually required.camargo correa metais,united states,citation omitted see also.bank germain,c ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.in defining the plain meaning of a statute,courts must avoid add ing conditions to the applicability of a statute that do not appear in the provision text.norfolk dredging,at.
as previously observed,the claims court bid protest jurisdiction under b speaks exclusively to procurement solicitations and contracts.res.conservation,at emphasis added.because the tucker act does not define the term procurement in b,see id.at,the court has relied upon the definition of procurement in to determine whether a procurement has occurred pursuant to b.distributed,united states,citation omitted see also defining procurement to cover all stages of the process of acquiring property or services,beginning with the process for determining a need for property or services and ending with contract completion and closeout.
the definition of procurement in is not the only provision relevant to our inquiry,nor does a procurement contract encompass the entire universe of instruments at executive agencies disposal.in,congress passed the fgcaa in light of its findings that there was a need to distinguish f ederal assistance relationships from f ederal procurement relationships,as well as uncertainty as to the meaning of cooperative agreement.fgcaa,stat.at.in its current form,the fgcaa prescribe s criteria for executive agencies in selecting appropriate legal instruments to achieve a uniformity in their use by executive agencies b a clear definition of the relationships they reflect and c a better understanding of the responsibilities of the parties to them.congress intends the fgcaa to eliminate unnecessary administrative requirements on recipients of government awards by characterizing the relationship between executive agencies and contractors,states,local governments,and other recipients in acquiring property and services and in providing united states government assistance.id.to promote these goals,congress distinguished procurement contract s from cooperative agreements in the fgcaa.id.explaining when executive agencies shall use procurement contracts,explaining when executive agencies shall use cooperative agreements 
in particular,the fgcaa requires that a n executive agency shall use a procurement contract when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire by purchase,lease,or barter property or services for the direct benefit or use of the united states government.id.by contrast,a n executive agency shall use a cooperative agreement when the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the united states instead of acquiring by purchase,lease or barter property or services for the direct benefit or use of the united states government and substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the state,local government,or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.id.
pursuant to the authority delegated by congress,see id,the office of management and budget has explained that determinations of whether a program is principally one of procurement or assistance,and whether substantial federal involvement in performance will normally occur,are basic agency policy decisions and that congress intended the fgcaa to allow agencies flexibility to select the instrument that best suits each transaction.implementation of federal grant and cooperative agreement act of,office of mgmt.and budget.congress amended the fgcaa in without substantive change,an act to amend the federal grant and cooperative agreement act,stat,and its provisions remain unchanged.
the claims court decision misinterprets the law 
the claims court determined that the cfas constituted procurement contracts because in its view the service uses them to obtain the services of to feed migratory birds and wildlife on the refuges,which in its judgment is a procurement.hymas,fed.cl.at citing distributed,at res.conservation,at ramcor servs,united states.the claims court also determined that this court decision in cms supported its conclusion,finding that in cms 
the agreements were used to obtain services from,not to provide assistance to them.in this case,the intended beneficiaries are the migratory birds and wildlife on the refuges.the are intermediaries.the administrative record demonstrates that the service contracted with,not to benefit them financially,but to obtain their services to provide food for migratory birds and wildlife,in exchange for the farmers personal use of lands.the fact that may profit from this arrangement does not change their status as intermediaries.as such,the cooperative farming agreements in this case are procurements,subject to the tucker act.
id.at footnote and citations omitted.it concluded by observing that could not exempt the cfas from its tucker act jurisdiction because numerous circuit courts have found uniformly that no chevron deference is given because the task of determining a federal court jurisdiction falls to the court,not an agency.id.at brackets,internal quotation marks,and citation omitted.
the claims court holdings and hymas arguments rest in large part upon the faulty premise that the definition of cooperative agreement in the fgcaa is irrelevant and that.contains the only definition that courts may consult to determine whether a particular transaction constitutes a procurement and,consequently,whether the claims court has bid protest jurisdiction over a particular claim.see hymas,fed.cl.at appellee br.put another way,the claims court and hymas would have us look to as the sole source containing the relevant definitions of procurement and cooperative agreement.the statute text does not support that result,given that it speaks to procurement only.
what is more,the court did not hold in distributed solutions or in cms that courts must construe instruments pursuant to u.without regard to other relevant statutes to have done so would impose an additional condition not present in the statute text,see norfolk dredging,at,as well as offend the canon that courts should avoid constructions that would render statutory text superfluous.astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,see also.bank,at explaining that overlapping statutes may be given effect so long as there is no positive repugnancy between them.but see.com,united states,fed.cl,relying solely upon and declining to consider the fgcaa to determine jurisdiction.it also would mean that congress sub silentio imposed such a condition upon the courts,effectively hiding an elephant in a mousehole.whitman am.trucking ass ns.
our case law counsels against such a narrow approach.for example,the court in cms considered definitions in the fgcaa in determining that the instrument in question was a procurement contract,rather than a cooperative agreement.at.thus,because we must respect the concinnity between the separate yet interrelated statutes that congress has enacted,we decline to rely solely upon for our inquiry.see.bank,at.
the claims court construction also ignores the context in which congress enacted the definition of procurement in.congress legislated against the backdrop of the fgcaa when,in,it defined procurement in.congress is presumed to enact legislation with knowledge of the law and a statute is presumed to be harmonious with existing law and judicial concepts.aectra refining,at.congress presumably did not intend for the term procurement in to conflict with or otherwise override the definitions provided in the fgcaa,which it enacted to achieve uniformity and clarity in the area.see fgcaa,b,stat.at fausto,at i t can be strongly presumed that congress will specifically address language on the statute books that it wishes to change.
with these precepts in mind,we find that the service properly construed the cfas as cooperative agreements,rather than procurement contracts.under the fgcaa,whether an instrument reflects a procurement contract or a cooperative agreement turns upon the principal purpose of the relationship.if the service principally intended to transfer a thing of value to the private farmers to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the united states instead of acquiring by purchase,lease,or barter property or services for the direct benefit of or use of the united states government,then the instrument is a cooperative agreement.the service must also remain substantial ly involve d in the activity.id.
we find that the cfas meet this definition.first,the service principally intended the cfas to transfer a thing of value,the right to farm specific refuge lands and retain a share of the crop yield to carry out a public purpose authorized by law,to conserve wildlife on the refuges.indeed,the act provides that the service is authorized to provide assistance to,and cooperate with,public or private agencies and organizations in the development,protection,rearing,and stocking of all species of wildlife,resources thereof,and their habitat.likewise,the act authorizes the agency to negotiate and enter into a cooperative agreement with a person to implement one or more projects or programs for a refuge.d a.thus,there is no serious dispute that assisting private farmers to promote wildlife conservation is the sine qua non of the cfas.second,the service remains substantially involved in the activity,advising on decisions related to crop selection,farming methods,pesticide and fertilizer use,and crop harvest.
the cfas can not be construed as procurement contracts because the agency did not intend to acquire farming services for the direct benefit or use of the united states government.see defining procurement as encompassing all stages of the process of acquiring property or services.true,the cfas indirectly benefit the service since the private farmers activities advance the agency overall mission,but that is true for nearly all cooperative agreements.more importantly,the service does not directly benefit from the farming services provided pursuant to the cfas because it does not receive payment from the farmers pursuant to the agreements,see and r efuge crop shares are all used by wildlife in the field or retained by the farmers,such that t here are no excess crops for disposition by the service.and as counsel for the government explained,a traditional procurement would not provide the service with the flexibility needed to react to exigencies that regularly arise under the cropland management plans on the umatilla and mcnary refuges,such as decisions regarding what plants to crop,when to harvest them,and how to tend to them.see oral argument at.see also,describing decisions that arise under the plans and the need for flexibility in making them 
our decision in cms does not,as the claims court held,warrant a different conclusion.in cms,we found that the proper instrument is a procurement contract when a federal agency has created an intermediary relationship with a third party.at citation omitted.however,the court based that determination on its finding that the intermediary did not receiv e assistance from the federal agency,but rather provide d a service to another entity which is eligible for assistance.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the situation here is quite different.for example,the act authorizes the agency to provide assistance to,and cooperate with private farmers to promote wildlife conservation,emphasis added,and the cfas allow the service to provide assistance to those farmers in the form of permission to farm on the refuges and various crop management decisions to promote wildlife conservation.put another way,the service did not enter into the cfas to obtain a service from the farmers,but rather negotiated with them to provide assistance that would further the goals of the and acts

cooperative agreements are not subject to tucker act review 
with the foundational questions answered,the court must decide whether the tucker act confers jurisdiction on the claims court to hear hymas claims.our jurisprudence explains that the claims court jurisdiction under b exclusively concerns procurement solicitations and contracts,res.conservation,at,and that agencies escape the requirements of federal procurement law under the cica when using a cooperative agreement.cms,at see,distinguishing procurement contracts from cooperative agreements comsat sci,cir noting the distinction between procurement contracts and cooperative agreements under the fgcaa accord,at explaining that if an award changes from a procurement contract to a grant,it need not comport with federal procurement law.thus,because the service properly construed the cfas as cooperative agreements,the claims court must dismiss hymas action.ex parte mccardle,at without jurisdiction,the court can not proceed at all in any cause.

the remaining arguments are unpersuasive.accordingly,the court vacates the claims court judgment and remands for disposition consistent with this opinion,including the dissolution of the permanent injunction and the dismissal of hymas action.

in cms contract management services massachusetts housing finance agency,we emphasized that when the principal purpose of an agreement is to procure services of a third party to help an agency achieve its mission,the proper instrument under the federal grant and cooperative agreement act fgcaa is a procurement contract,cert.denied.the fgcaa instructs that executive agencies shall use a procurement contract when the statutory criterion is met,as it was in this case.see.here,the united states department of the interior fish and wildlife service the service used cooperative farming agreements cfas to obtain farming services so that migratory birds,which the service is obligated to protect,would be fed.the record shows that the service would have performed this task itself had it not contracted with farmers.based on this record,the principle purpose of the cfas was to acquire farming services to feed migratory birds,so the service was compelled to use a procurement contract,not a cooperative agreement,when entering into the cfas.yet,the majority defers to the service decision on whether to use a procurement contract or a cooperative agreement for the cfas.such an approach is incompatible with our decision in cms and departs from the plain language of the statute.i respectfully dissent.
we explained in cms that the fgcaa sets forth the type of legal instrument an executive agency must use when awarding a federal grant or contract.cms,at.moreover,we indicated in cms that w hether a contract is a procurement contract or a cooperative agreement is a question of law,which we review de novo.id.at citing maint.eng rs united states,determination of the type of contract is a matter of law not controlled by a label in the contract.in my view,cms is squarely on point with the facts of this case and controls the outcome.
in cms,we reviewed agreements that the department of housing and urban development hud had entered into with local public housing authorities for compliance with the fgcaa.cms,at.those agreements had the local housing authorities administer contract payments with housing project owners rather than hud,which had traditionally administered such payments.hud both provided the local housing authorities with funds for paying the project owners and paid the local housing authorities an operating fee for their services.hud characterized the agreements at issue as cooperative agreements.cms,joint app x at.
responding to protests filed by local housing authorities,we looked to the primary,or principal,purpose of the agreements,as commanded by the statutory text.see.we held that the primary purpose of the hud agreements is to procure the services of the local housing authorities to support hud staff and provide assistance to hud with the oversight and monitoring of section housing assistance.cms,at.citing the record,we explained that hud entered into the contracts with local housing authorities so that hud staff who would otherwise be responsible for administering payments to project owners could focus on other tasks.id.we recognized that by providing a service on behalf of hud,the local housing authorities had formed an intermediary relationship with hud,and concluded that,in the case of an intermediary relationship,the proper instrument is a procurement contract.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the claims court determined that the principal purpose of the cfas was to assist the service in fulfilling its mission to feed migratory birds 
in this case,the intended beneficiaries are the migratory birds and wildlife on the refuges.the are intermediaries.the administrative record demonstrates that the service contracted with,not to benefit them financially,but to obtain their services to provide food for migratory birds and wildlife,in exchange for the farmers personal use of lands.

the record confirms the claims court determination.in administering the national wildlife refuge system,the service has a mission to provide for the conservation of fish,wildlife,and plants,and their habitats within the system.a a.to fulfill its mission,the service is required to generate and comply with a comprehensive plan for managing the refuges under its control.e.the comprehensive plan the service established for the mcnary and umatilla refuges indicates that cropland farming management is a critical refuge operation in meeting purposes of the refuge,including purposes such as waterfowl management.further,the service cropland management plans explain that croplands on the refuges are primarily managed for the benefit of waterfowl.
with that mission in mind,the service contemplated three alternative options for cropland farming on the refuges.under the first option,the service staff would produce crops.specifically,all crop production would be conducted by refuge staff and all costs associated with farming water,seed,fertilizer,paid for with refuge funds.the two other options involved third parties,with the service contracting with farmers to cultivate the land and provide crops for the birds in exchange for either pay or,a
