background 
linda strumpf is an with offices in new canaan,connecticut.her husband,hal siegel,serves as her office manager.in november,strumpf brought a debt collection action in the superior court for the state of connecticut,judicial district of new haven,on behalf of american express travel related services company,against kropelnicki and her daughter,mila evanauskas.the plaintiff in that action sought to recover monetary damages of plus interest accrued since may,attorney fees in the amount of,costs of the suit,and other relief as may be appropriate.the damages sought represented the unpaid balance due on an american express credit card that was issued to evanauskas.although not named on the card,kropelnicki was a supplemental cardholder who was authorized to use it.on november,the action was commenced when kropelnicki and evanauskas were served with a summons and complaint with a return date of december,
on december,siegel received a telephone call from christopher licari,an attorney who represented kropelnicki and evanauskas.while both parties agree that siegel and licari discussed settlement possibilities,they disagree as to the remainder of the discussion.defendants allege that,in accordance with office policy,siegel advised licari to send a letter stating that he represented kropelnicki and evanauskas and informed licari that siegel would await such correspondence before noting in the file that kropelnicki and evanauskas were represented by counsel.defendants never received any correspondence from licari.
in his sworn affidavit,licari tells a different version of his conversation with siegel.he claims that he told siegel he had not yet filed an appearance in the case because he thought the case might be resolved without needing to appear,and that he asked siegel not to file a motion for default without letting licari know beforehand so that he would have the opportunity to speak with his clients.licari further claims that he gave siegel his telephone number,that he believed siegel would not advance the litigation without notifying him,and that siegel did not request written confirmation that licari represented kropelnicki and evanauskas.no attorney filed a notice of appearance in the action and kropelnicki did not file an answer or motion in response to the complaint.
defendants also claim that prior to the state court judgment they mailed to kropelnicki and evanauskas on august,a copy of their motion for default for failure to appear,proposed judgment,and proposed order for weekly payments.both kropelnicki and evanauskas deny that they ever received the moving papers.in any event,on august,a default judgment was entered against kropelnicki and evanauskas in the amount of.defendants allege that they mailed kropelnicki and evanauskas a copy of the judgment on august.the latter claims that they did not receive this document either.
kropelnicki claims instead that she first received notice of the advancement of the litigation in state court when she read a letter dated october,regarding a judgment that had been entered against evanauskas.the letter was addressed only to evanauskas but was mailed to her at kropelnicki address the letter stated as follows

in a motion dated december,kropelnicki and evanauskas requested that the state court open the default judgment,claiming that there was r easonable cause because other than the writ,summons and complaint,which did not contain a return date,they received no notice of any of the proceedings in this matter until strumpf october letter.in opposition papers dated january,defendants objected to the opening of the judgment.they argued that kropelnicki and evanauskas failed to respond to the initial papers,which admittedly were received,and that the summons and complaint did include a return date of december,as shown on the original filed with the court and the copy attached to defendants opposition papers.defendants also argued that the motion to open should be denied because kropelnicki and evanauskas failed to meet the requirements for opening a judgment under connecticut law 
by letter dated march,joanne faulkner,kropelnicki attorney in the present action,informed defendants that they had violated the fdcpa because strumpf letter of,was written to kropelnicki at a time when defendants knew that she was represented by an attorney.the letter stated that it was written to give strumpf the opportunity to settle the fdcpa violations by paying so i have it in hand by april,with an additional per week if not timely paid.strumpf replied in a letter dated april,that faulkner allegations were without merit and that if faulkner proceeded with such claims,strumpf would seek all remedies permitted by law.
on june,kropelnicki filed suit in the united states district court for the district of connecticut against the defendants claiming violations of the fdcpa,cccpa,and cutpa,and seeking compensatory and punitive damages,costs,reasonable attorney fees,and equitable remedies.kropelnicki complaint sets forth only the bare minimum required under the notice pleading standard applicable in federal courts.the complaint first sets out the statutory provisions kropelnicki claims that the defendants violated.as to the factual bases for her claims,she alleges only the following d efendants directly or indirectly communicated with the plaintiff or others on or after june,in connection with collection efforts with regard to kropelnicki alleged personal debt to american express travel related services company,i n the collection efforts,each defendant violated the fdcpa,inter alia,d,e,or f o n or after june,each defendant has engaged in acts and practices as to plaintiff in violation of the cccpa and e ach defendant has committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices within the meaning of the cutpa.
on august,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the defendants also moved for sanctions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in an effort to show that a set of facts existed that would state a claim,kropelnicki included in her opposition papers to defendants motion to dismiss a more detailed factual basis in support of the alleged violations of the fdcpa.on october,the district court granted the motion to dismiss and ordered kropelnicki to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed.in its ruling granting defendants motion to dismiss,the court apparently construed kropelnicki complaint,in accordance with the details set forth in her opposition papers,to allege that the defendants violated the fdcpa by suing her even though she was merely a supplemental credit card holder and was thus not liable for the debt contacting her after being informed that she was represented by an attorney sending her a threatening letter that misrepresented actions that could be taken against evanauskas to satisfy the judgment entered against her and proceeding to judgment despite their statement that they would not do so before contacting the attorney.
the court then addressed each of these four claims.the court rejected kropelnicki argument that the defendants violated the fdcpa by suing her to collect a debt for which she was not liable the court first noted that kropelnicki broad claim that the defendants violated the fdcpa in the collection efforts is too vague and conclusory to state a claim.the district court further stated that,in any event,pursuing a debt collection action does not violate the fdcpa because it does not involve the making of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt as prohibited by the fdcpa.this is so,the court explained,because a n allegation that a debt collector can not prove what the debt collector claimed is not equivalent to an allegation that the debt collector made a false,deceptive,or misleading representation.thus,the court dismissed any claims kropelnicki asserted in relation to the filing of the state court action.
the court then addressed kropelnicki two claims relating to the october letter.kropelnicki claimed that the letter violated the fdcpa because it was intentionally frightening,made false threats and misrepresentations,and it constituted improper contact with a represented party.although the letter was addressed only to evanauskas,kropelnicki argued that a person who reads a collection letter directed to another can make a claim under the fdcpa.the court disagreed,concluding that kropelnicki complaint alleges no facts indicating that she stood in her daughter shoes or had the authority to open and read her mail,and that a ccordingly,she lacks standing to claim that the letter was a violation of the fdcpa.thus,the court held that the letter could not constitute an improper communication with kropelnicki because the letter was not addressed to kropelnicki,and can not be viewed as communication with her.
finally,the district court addressed kropelnicki claim that the defendants misrepresentation to licari that they would not file a motion for default in the state court action or otherwise advance the litigation without first communicating with him violated the fdcpa the court rejected this argument,holding that there was no fdcpa violation because the alleged misrepresentation was not used to attempt to collect a debt,which is prohibited by the fdcpa,but rather was only made in connection with the attempt to collect a debt through legal action,which the court concluded was not prohibited by the fdcpa.the court also dismissed kropelnicki state law claims because she fail ed to respond to defendants claim that the state law claims should be dismissed.judgment was entered on october.
on october,kropelnicki filed a timely motion for reconsideration and for permission to amend her complaint,claiming that the district court decision departed from established law,that the court misapprehended the facts she intended to prove,and that reconsideration was required to prevent manifest injustice.she also attached to the motion a proposed amended complaint that incorporated the expanded factual allegations set forth in her opposition papers.on that same date,kropelnicki filed a memorandum of law to comply with the district court order to show cause with regard to sanctions.
on november,the court granted the motion for reconsideration and adhered to its prior ruling.in addition,the court found that r egardless of the merits of kropelnicki claim arising out of the filing of the state lawsuit,that claim was barred by the fdcpa statute of limitations,which the court held began to run on the date the state court complaint was filed.the court also elaborated on its prior ruling that the defendants decision to proceed to judgment in the state court action without first contacting kropelnicki attorney did not come within the purview of the fdcpa provision prohibiting the use of false representation or deceptive means to collect a debt.the court explained that a s a matter of law,an attorney gratuitous yet false representation that he or she will contact opposing counsel prior to moving for default judgment can not constitute a violation of the representation does not and can not negate an attorney obligation to prosecute or defend a case.in relation to the representation made to plaintiff attorney,the court found that r egardless,this claim is untimely as plaintiff states the representation was made on december,over a year prior to her filing this lawsuit.finally,the district court denied kropelnicki motion to amend.that same day,the district court denied in a separate ruling defendants request for sanctions,holding that it can not be said that kropelnicki claim regarding the october letter was not only unsupported by legal authority but was absolutely beyond acceptance as a novel legal theory.
this timely appeal by kropelnicki and timely by defendants followed.

defendants alleged misrepresentation to licaria.the fdcpa 
the purpose of the fdcpa is to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.the fdcpa establishes certain rights for consumers whose debts are placed in the hands of professional debt collectors for collection,and requires that such debt collectors advise the consumers whose debts they seek to collect of specified rights.desantis computer credit,cir.the legislative history of the passage of the fdcpa explains that the need for the fdcpa arose because of collection abuses such as use of obscene or profane language,threats of violence,telephone calls at unreasonable hours,misrepresentation of a consumer legal rights,disclosing a consumer personal affairs to friends,neighbors,or an employer,obtaining information about a consumer through false pretense,impersonating public officials and attorneys,and simulating legal process,at,reprinted in.the fdcpa sets forth examples of particular practices that debt collectors are forbidden to employ.see.the list,however,is,and the fdcpa generally forbids collectors from engaging in unfair,deceptive,or harassing behavior.see et.kropelnicki argues that the defendants violated the fdcpa by advancing the state court action after having told licari that they would not do so without first contacting him.although not dispositive to our holding here,since we dismiss the appeal in regard to this issue,we would have grave reservations about concluding that this sort of claim is actionable under the fdcpa.a review of the fdcpa purpose,as explained both in the statute and in the legislative history,and this court treatment of
