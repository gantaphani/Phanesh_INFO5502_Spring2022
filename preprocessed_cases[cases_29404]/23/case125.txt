opinion of the court 
we are asked to decide whether a false statement in a communication from a debt collector to a debtor must be material in order to be actionable under a provision of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.we conclude that materiality is required,as it is subsumed within the least sophisticated debtor standard that has traditionally governed fdcpa claims.because we do not find the misstatement at issue in this case material,we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to pressler pressler and midland funding,llc.
the facts of this case are largely undisputed.appellant paula jensen defaulted on a bank of america credit card,and her debt was eventually sold to appellee midland funding,llc midland.midland retained the law firm of appellee pressler pressler pressler to help collect jensen debt.midland obtained a default judgment against jensen in the superior court of new jersey in the amount of.pressler then attempted to collect on that judgment by serving an information subpoena and written questions on jensen.
the information subpoena and accompanying questions sought personal and financial information from jensen in aid of collection.it advised that failure to comply may result in arrest and incarceration.the information subpoena was issued pursuant to rule of the rules governing the courts of the state of new jersey new jersey rules,which allows new jersey attorneys to issue subpoenas in the name of the clerk of court.information subpoenas issued under this rule properly bear the signature of the clerk,even though the clerk herself did not sign the subpoena and likely does not even have knowledge of it.the information subpoena here was based on the sample form in the appendix to the new jersey rules.that form provides space for two electronic or typed signatures one for the issuing attorney,and one for the clerk.because pressler sought to enforce a judgment from the superior court of new jersey,the superior court clerk name should have appeared on the clerk signature line.
instead,pressler listed terrence lee on the clerk signature line.lee had never worked as a clerk of the superior court,and although he had been the county clerk of warren county,he left that position six years earlier.ironically,jensen knew lee,and she also knew that he was not a clerk of the superior court.roughly one month later,jensen sent a letter to pressler explaining that she was aware that lee was not the superior court clerk and calling the subpoena fraudulent.however,she also answered the questions that accompanied the information subpoena.
thereafter,jensen moved to vacate the state court judgment against her,but her motion was denied.she then filed a putative class action against pressler and midland together,appellees or collectors in the district court for the district of new jersey,alleging a violation of of the fdcpa,which prohibits making false,misleading,or deceptive statements in the collection of consumer debts.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the collectors and denied jensen cross motion for summary judgment.it concluded that,because the misuse of lee name was not a material false statement,there could be no liability under.see jensen pressler pressler,llp,cv,wl,at.this appeal followed 
we have not yet had occasion to decide whether contains a materiality requirement.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court conclusion that misstatements must be material to be actionable under.accordingly,we will affirm.
this court exercises plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard employed by the district court.trinity,chi.bridge iron,cir.summary judgment should only be granted where,after the close of discovery and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,the movant establishes that no genuine issue of material fact remains.c celotex catrett.a factual dispute is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.lupyan corinthian colls,cir citing doe luzerne,cir.
to prevail on an fdcpa claim,a plaintiff must prove that she is a consumer,the defendant is a debt collector,the defendant challenged practice involves an attempt to collect a debt as the act defines it,and the defendant has violated a provision of the fdcpa in attempting to collect the debt.douglass convergent outsourcing,cir.only the fourth prong is disputed here.as noted,jensen asserts that the subpoena violated,the provision of the law dealing with communications from debt collectors to debtors.she also claims that the subpoena violated two more specific subsections,and.those provisions provide 
a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.without limiting the general application of the foregoing,the following conduct is a violation of this section 
the use or distribution of any written communication which simulates or is falsely represented to be a document authorized,issued,or approved by any court,official,or agency of the united states or any state,or which creates a false impression as to its source,authorization,or approval.
the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.
jensen argues that pressler use of terrence lee electronic signature was a false representation in violation of.jensen is obviously correct as a factual matter,insofar as using terrence lee name is a false representation in the most technical sense of the phrase.the subpoena represents lee to be the clerk of the superior court of new jersey,but he was not the clerk and had never held that post.
however,appellees argue that this technically false representation is not actionable under the fdcpa because it is not material.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit first addressed this issue in hahn triumph partnerships llc,cir.there,the court adopted a materiality requirement for false,misleading,or deceptive statements under the fdcpa.id.at.a number of our sister courts of appeals subsequently adopted such a requirement.see elyazidi suntrust bank,cir donohue quick collect,cir miller javitch,block rathbone,cir.no circuit court that has addressed this issue has disagreed with hahn and held that an immaterial false statement made during the collection of a consumer debt is actionable under the fdcpa.this dispute presents our court with its first opportunity to decide if false,deceptive,or misleading statements must be material to be actionable under 
jensen correctly argues that the word material does not appear in the statute.however,that is not necessarily outcome determinative.congress intent guides our interpretation of statutes.see allen ex rel.martin lasalle bank,f d,cir.our interpretive task begins and ends with the text of the statute unless the text is ambiguous or does not reveal congressional intent with sufficient precision to resolve our inquiry.id.however,w here the statutory language does not express congress intent unequivocally,a court traditionally refers to the legislative history and the atmosphere in which the statute was enacted in an attempt to determine the congressional purpose.in re lord abbett mut.funds fee,cir citation omitted.jensen reliance on the precise wording of the statute here ignores the fact that materiality requirement is simply a corollary of the least sophisticated debtor standard,which courts have routinely applied to alleged violations of in order to advance the congressional intent of the fdcpa.indeed,the parties do not dispute this standard validity and application to this case.yet,that standard,like the disputed materiality requirement,appears nowhere in the text of the statute.as we will explain,we are satisfied that both the least sophisticated debtor standard and the materiality requirement supply a necessary analytical framework and are consistent with the fdcpa purpose and legislative history.because we agree with the district court that the collectors did not violate,we will affirm.
as the fdcpa is an explicitly remedial statute,passed by congress to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,e,we construe its language broadly,so as to effect its purpose,brown card serv,cir citation omitted.courts routinely employ a least sophisticated debtor standard when deciding if debt collection violates the fdcpa.see rosenau unifund,cir we use the least sophisticated debtor standard in order to effectuate the basic purpose of the fdcpa quoting brown,at.although the least sophisticated debtor standard is lower than the standard of a reasonable debtor,it preserv es a quotient of reasonableness and presum es a basic level of understanding and willingness to read with care.id.quoting wilson quadramed,cir.in so doing,it give s effect to the act intent to protect the gullible as well as the shrewd.campuzano burgos midland credit,cir second alteration in original quoting brown,at.
the standard is an objective one,meaning that the specific plaintiff need not prove that she was actually confused or misled,only that the objective least sophisticated debtor would be.see pollard law office of mandy spaulding,cir t he fdcpa does not require that a plaintiff actually be confused.bentley great lakes collection bureau,cir we apply an objective test based on the understanding of the least sophisticated consumer in determining whether a collection letter violates section.thus,the fdcpa enlists the efforts of sophisticated consumers as private attorneys general to aid their less sophisticated counterparts,who are unlikely themselves to bring suit under the act,but who are assumed by the act to benefit from the deterrent effect of civil actions brought by others.jacobson healthcare fin,cir.
as noted earlier,the phrase least sophisticated debtor does not appear in the text of the fdcpa.nevertheless,the standard is almost universally employed by courts of appeals in interpreting that law indeed,the standard was first used more than three decades ago in,a mere four years after the fdcpa was enacted.bingham collection bureau,d.explaining that the standard historically used to analyze federal trade commission act claims,that courts should look not to the most sophisticated readers but to the least,should also be used in the fdcpa context quoting exposition press,ftc,cir.the first court of appeals to adopt this standard did so a year later,in.see baker servs,cir.
the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit has given a thorough and a compelling explanation of why the reasonable person standard is not appropriate under the fdcpa.see jeter credit bureau,cir.as jeter explains,prior to the passage of the fdcpa,the least sophisticated debtor standard was used to analyze claims that deceptive debt collection practices violated the federal trade commission act ftca.id.at.at that time,regulations issued by the federal trade commission under the authority of the ftca banned deceptive practices.see id.however,in enacting the fdcpa,congress explicitly found that e xisting laws and procedures for redressing these injuries are inadequate to protect consumers.b.thus,the jeter court reasoned,i t would be anomalous for the congress,in light of its belief that existing state and federal law was inadequate to protect consumers,to have intended that the legal standard under the fdcpa be less protective of consumers than under the existing inadequate legislation.jeter,at.
based on its legislative history,the context of its passage,and its statutory purpose,the eleventh circuit concluded that congress intended courts to view fdcpa claims from the perspective of the least sophisticated debtor.id.at.the court reasoned that the fdcpa purpose of protecting consumers is best served by a definition of deceive that looks to the tendency of language to mislead the least sophisticated recipients of a debt collector communications.id.second alteration in original citation omitted.as noted,the courts of appeals have nearly universally embraced jeter reasoning and employed the least sophisticated debtor standard to help effectuate the fdcpa purpose.
we regularly apply the least sophisticated debtor standard to claims under.specifically,we focus on whether a debt collector statement in a communication to a debtor would deceive or mislead the least sophisticated debtor.see,e,mclaughlin phelan hallinan schmieg,llp,cir cert.denied.explaining that the debtor collector is responsible for a communication content and for what the least sophisticated debtor would have understood from it rosenau,at determining whether a letter was deceptive by asking whether under the least sophisticated debtor standard,the debt collector letter to the debtor can be reasonably read to have two different meanings,one of which is inaccurate quoting quadramed,at.
as quoted earlier,prohibits the use of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.while it is impossible to know whether a statement is misleading or deceptive without reference to the person being misled or deceived here,the least sophisticated debtor the same is not true of falsity a statement is either true or false.this presented a challenge to courts trying to view false statements through the eyes of the least sophisticated debtor.for example,in wahl midland credit,cir,the court was asked to determine if congress intended false communications to be treated differently than misleading or deceptive communications under the fdcpa.that court explanation for uniformly analyzing the three categories of statements laid the foundation for a materiality requirement 
where a plaintiff alleges that a collection statement is false rather than deceptive or misleading,wahl contends,the only determination for the court is whether the statement is in fact false.it is unnecessary to determine whether the unsophisticated consumer would be deceived or misled or confused by the alleged false statement.that could not be further from the truth.
in deciding whether collection letters violate the fdcpa,we have consistently viewed them through the eyes of the unsophisticated consumer.
id.at.the wahl court stressed that the state of mind of the debtor is always relevant,and that debt collection communications must be assessed from the perspective of the least sophisticated debtor regardless of whether a communication is alleged to be false,misleading,or deceptive.see id.at.
in hahn,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit simply expanded on wahl reasoning.the court explained that materiality is the upshot of the conclusion in wahl that,i f a statement would not mislead the unsophisticated consumer,it does not violate the act even if it is false in some technical sense.hahn,at second and third alterations in original citation omitted quoting wahl,at.the hahn court recognized that the fdcpa was designed to give debtors reliable information so that they can make informed decisions about how to address debts,and that by definition immaterial information neither contributes to that objective if the statement is correct nor undermines it if the statement is incorrect.id.at.accordingly,a false statement is only actionable under the fdcpa if it has the potential to affect the process of the least sophisticated debtor in other words,it must be material when viewed through the least sophisticated debtor eyes.
it is therefore clear that the materiality requirement is simply another way of phrasing the legal standard we already employ when analyzing claims under,so that the same analysis can be applied to communications containing false statements.see donohue,at t he materiality requirement functions as a corollary inquiry into whether a statement is likely to mislead an unsophisticated consumer.because we view the materiality requirement as a different way of expressing the least sophisticated debtor standard,we are satisfied that adopting a materiality requirement for claims brought under is consistent with congress intent in this regard.indeed,refusing to adopt this materiality requirement would be inconsistent with decades of our own jurisprudence employing the least sophisticated debtor standard.
we realize,as we noted earlier,that th
