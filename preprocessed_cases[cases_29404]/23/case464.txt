background 
machinery was in the business of renting,selling,and servicing aerial manlift equipment.machinery financed the purchase of its manlift inventory with gecc,upb,and various other lenders,and it gave those creditors security interests in the inventory they financed.upb was also machinery lender on an operating note,secured by a blanket lien on all of machinery property,and it was machinery depository bank.in march,gecc and upb entered into a subordination agreement in which upb subordinated its security interest in inventory to the interest of gecc,as well as its interest in all cash,rents and proceeds arising from that same property.
in april,upb and machinery set up a cash management system.under this system,machinery maintained three demand deposit accounts with upb a parent account and two operating accounts.machinery would deposit the funds it had collected from equipment rentals,sales,and service into the parent account and write checks on the operating accounts to cover expenses.each day,when machinery checks were presented for payment,upb would transfer funds from the parent account to the operating accounts to cover the checks.if the parent account balance was inadequate to cover the expenditures,a revolving line of credit covered the shortfall.and,if an excess existed in the parent account after the items drawn on the operating accounts were paid,upb would automatically sweep the funds from machinery parent account to pay down the balance owing on the line of credit.in july,machinery established the line of credit at issue in this case 
from april,machinery deposited its revenue in the parent account without identifying which items of inventory,if any,generated the funds it was depositing.upb swept funds from the parent account and provided funds to the operating accounts regularly and automatically.the system operated in this manner until the beginning of march,when machinery affairs began to fall apart.machinery fell into default with upb,and upb terminated the automatic feature of the cash management system.ultimately,machinery filed for bankruptcy on march.
gecc filed suit against upb claiming that upb wrongfully swept proceeds of inventory from machinery parent account in january,february and march.gecc asserted causes of action for wrongful setoff,breach of the subordination agreement,conversion,tortious interference with contract,and unjust enrichment.gecc moved for partial summary judgment on its conversion claim,arguing that upb converted funds in which gecc had a superior interest when upb swept the account.upb for summary judgment on all of gecc claims.the district court granted gecc partial motion,holding that upb was liable for conversion,but reserved the question of damages for trial.the court dismissed the remaining counts with prejudice because they all sought relief for the same injury.
evidence of damages was presented at a bench trial.the district court concluded that upb converted of funds in which gecc had a superior interest when it swept machinery account in january,february,and march.

this case involves a conflict over funds generated by leases of inventory in which gecc held a security interest.those proceeds were deposited in machinery parent account with upb.this was typical of machinery operations and there is no evidence that gecc objected to the deposit of those funds in that account.gecc conversion theory is based on what happened after those funds were deposited.
gecc claimed that upb converted gecc property when it swept funds from machinery parent account under the cash management system in january,february,and march.gecc premised this claim on its security interest in the proceeds of inventory.specifically,it sought to establish that it had a right of property in,and a right to the immediate possession of,the funds upb received.id.because gecc rights were premised on its security interest,gecc had to prove that it had a security interest in the funds upb received from the parent account.to do that,gecc was faced with two tasks.first,it had to prove that proceeds in which it held a security interest were deposited in machinery parent account.if gecc established that fact,then gecc security interest in the funds that were deposited continued in the deposit account to the extent of the amount of such deposits.gecc second task,then,was to prove that the funds upb received through its sweeps were encumbered by gecc security interest in the deposit account.we address these two aspects of gecc claim in turn.
gecc security interest in machinery deposits 
the district court determined that gecc had a security interest in certain funds that were deposited by machinery in its parent account.it made this determination at the bench trial,and its conclusion is a finding of fact.
gecc sought to establish its security interest in deposited funds by establishing that of machinery customers made lease payments to machinery during january,february,and march,those customers leased inventory,and the funds paid by those customers were deposited in the parent account.the funds paid by a lessee of inventory are proceeds of that inventory under missouri law,and gecc security interest in the inventory therefore continued in those proceeds.ann.stat,cmt.but gecc evidence was weak.audit records indeed revealed that the customers had leased inventory.and cancelled checks that had been deposited in machinery parent account established the amounts paid by the customers to machinery.but no leases,invoices,or other evidence tying the payments to the collateral was presented.gecc nonetheless argued that the audit records and cancelled checks showed that the funds paid by the lessees and deposited in the parent account were proceeds of inventory because those customers were likely making payments on their leases of inventory.
upb countered with testimony establishing that of the customers also leased equipment in which gecc had no security interest.the district court concluded that gecc had not proven that those customers payments were proceeds of inventory because the inference upon which gecc such customers were likely making payments on their leases of no longer valid given upb evidence.the court therefore excluded those customers payments from its deposit calculations and held that gecc had proven that the remaining customers payments were proceeds of inventory that was deposited in the parent account.we agree with the district court including the customers payments requires speculation,and although gecc evidence was scant,we see no clear error in the district court finding with regard to the remaining customers payments.
gecc security interest in the funds upb received 
ordinary course payments when to use equitable tracing 
gecc,however,did not object to the deposit of these funds.its conversion claim rests on upb sweeps.so gecc had the burden of proving that the funds upb swept were traceable to the funds in which it had a security interest.see bell,at.but proving that link is quite difficult,if not impossible,when funds from numerous sources are deposited and credited to a single account,from which the depositor makes withdrawals and orders payments.equitable tracing principles ease this difficulty.the question how such tracing works in this case is addressed below.but because equitable tracing principles can not be used unless equity calls for it,and because there are good commercial reasons for not using such principles to impose liability,we must initially determine when a court should trace proceeds through a commingled account.motor bank of new england,cir.
one ucc provision has been used to delineate when a debtor payee will be deemed a recipient of encumbered proceeds through the use of equitable tracing principles.that provision provides the following 
where cash proceeds are covered into the debtor checking account and paid out in the operation of the debtor business,recipients of the funds of course take free of any claim which the secured party may have in them as proceeds.what has been said relates to payments and transfers in ordinary course.the law of fraudulent conveyances would no doubt in appropriate cases support recovery of proceeds by a secured party from a transferee out of ordinary course or otherwise in collusion with the debtor to defraud the secured party.
ann.stat,cmt.c.
we agree with the district court that missouri,like most other states confronted with this issue,would recognize this official comment as law.the current version of missouri uniform commercial code supports this result.see.ann.stat.b west ending a security interest in a deposit account upon the transfer of funds unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party.and we agree with those courts that have held that this comment effectively delineates those circumstances when tracing is appropriate when the payee receives funds out of ordinary course or otherwise in collusion with the debtor.see,motor,at.here,the district court held that the subordination agreement meant that upb,as a matter of law,did not receive the funds swept from the parent account in the ordinary course of machinery business.we disagree.
in orix credit alliance,sovran bank,cir,the court was faced with a factually similar situation.the depository bank and the had set up a cash collateral account in which all of the debtor customers payments were deposited.routinely,and pursuant to an agreement,the balance of that account was applied to the depositor line of credit with the depository bank.the transaction that gave rise to the lawsuit involved the depository bank application of the balance of the deposit account to reduce the balance on the outstanding line of credit just after the proceeds of a crane had been deposited in the debtor cash collateral account.both the the depository bank had a security interest in the crane and the generated proceeds that were deposited.the depository bank had subordinated its interest in the crane to the competing lender interest in the crane.and the court assumed that the bank knew the proceeds of the crane had been deposited in the account.id.at.
the court in orix held that the depository bank took the funds free of the plaintiff superior security interest under official comment c.id.at.as to the plaintiff claim that the depository bank knew that encumbered proceeds had been deposited,the court said,a transferee knowledge of a prior security interest in proceeds does not,by itself,indicate that the transfer of these proceeds occurred outside the ordinary course of the debtor business.id.at.we agree with that statement and,like the court in orix,we conclude that the phrase in the ordinary course,means that the plaintiff must establish more than a defendant knowledge of a superior security interest it must establish either a lack of good faith or that the payee knows that the payment is in violation of some term in the security agreement not waived by the words or conduct of the secured party.ann.stat,cmt.accord orix,at itt commercial fin.bank of the west,cir collecting and discussing authorities.
gecc claim is weaker than the plaintiff claim in orix.in orix,the balance of the cash collateral account was applied only to the line of credit and there was some evidence that the depository bank knew that the deposit at issue contained proceeds.thus,there was at least an inference albeit an insufficient inference for liability purposes of the depository bank knowledge that proceeds of a secured party collateral had been deposited,and there was no question that the account balance was created by such funds.here,there is no evidence that upb knew that proceeds of inventory had been deposited.and,more importantly,there is no evidence that upb knew that the account balance after all other expenses had been paid was created by such deposits.even gecc trial evidence shows that only about four or five percent of machinery million in total deposits were proceeds of inventory,while upb swept an amount that equaled of the total deposits.upb should not be charged with knowing that the remaining account balance was created by the small portion of proceeds of inventory that had been deposited.
if upb did not know that the remaining account balance was traceable to the encumbered deposits,then as a matter of law it did not know that its sweeps violated the terms of gecc security agreement with machinery because it did not know gecc interests were implicated.and even if upb knew that proceeds of inventory had been deposited in the account and that the remaining balance had been created by the deposits,as in orix,that knowledge is not enough.given machinery apparent ability to deposit those funds and use the account to pay creditors,upb surely did not know,and should not be expected to know,that its sweeps would violate a term in machinery and gecc security agreement that gecc had not waived.
the district court concluded that the subordination agreement unlock ed the mystery to this case,holding upb could not avoid liability by claiming it did not know that the funds it swept were encumbered by gecc security interest.upb argued that gecc should have required machinery to segregate the lease payments on inventory from machinery other revenue,and that without such segregation,there was no way for upb to know that it was being paid with proceeds of inventory.the court responded when upb gave up its rights to whatever gecc had,it should have been the party responsible for making sure that it did not violate its contractual obligations.gecc takes this to mean that the district court held that the subordination agreement imposed upon upb an implicit contractual duty to find and segregate any funds that were deposited in which gecc may claim a security interest,and that in the face of that duty,upb could not claim a lack of knowledge.if that is what the district court meant,it erred.first,as explained below,upb did not give up all of its rights.second,we will not imply a duty to segregate a debtor deposits.sophisticated lenders like gecc and upb are fully able to bargain for such duties,and they know the risks associated with allowing debtors to commingle funds in a single account that is used to pay various creditors in the ordinary cou
