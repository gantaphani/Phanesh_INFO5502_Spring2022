great plains trust company,which is chartered and based in kansas,filed this class action against union pacific railroad company,which is doing business in missouri,alleging breach of contract,fraud,and unjust enrichment.diversity jurisdiction is proper in this case under.the district court granted union pacific motion to dismiss,and great plains appeals.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
we recite the facts as alleged in the complaint,viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.davenport farmers ins.group,cir.in,union pacific predecessor company issued debentures accompanied by an indenture setting forth the company payment obligations.in,union pacific assumed these obligations.according to the indenture,interest on the debentures is payable annually on april at a rate of five percent of the principal amount of the outstanding debentures.this interest is payable from union pacific available net income ani,which is computed on a basis according to the accounting rules of the surface transportation board stb.the interest payment due on april,totaled million.on march,union pacific sent a letter and a computation of its ani to the debenture trustee indicating that it lacked sufficient funds to make the payment.the computation stated that union pacific had million in income available to pay fixed charges for.union pacific annual report to the stb,however,indicated that union pacific had million in income available for that period.the stb calculation left union pacific with a net income of million for.union pacific did not make the interest payment due april.
on january,great plains,the holder of of debentures,filed this complaint alleging that union pacific is liable for breach of contract,fraud,and unjust enrichment on account of its failure to make the interest payment.the district court dismissed all claims against union pacific,concluding that each claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations and,alternatively,that great plains had failed to comply with certain prerequisites set forth in the indenture before filing suit.
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,taking the material factual allegations in the complaint as true.katun clarke,cir.in so doing,we may consider documents attached to the complaint and matters of public and administrative record referenced in the complaint.deerbrook pavilion,llc shalala,cir,cert.denied,d.
we first consider whether great plains was required to comply with the procedures set forth in the indenture before filing suit.the indenture contains a clause providing that n o holder of any debenture shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this indenture to institute any suit,action or proceeding for the collection of any sum due from the company hereunder on account of principal or interest without first requesting action by the debenture trustee.indenture at.great plains does not contend that it complied with this clause before filing suit.the indenture also contains a clause that provides 
nothing contained in this indenture or in the debentures shall affect or impair the obligation of the company,which is unconditional and absolute,to pay the principal of and interest on the debentures or affect or impair the right,which is also unconditional and absolute,of the holders of the debentures to receive payment thereof on or after the respective due dates thereof or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective due dates by virtue of said debentures.
id.at.this provision implements section b of the trust indenture act of b,which prohibits the purported restriction by an indenture of certain rights of security holders,including the right to sue for unpaid interest.see cruden bank of,cir.the district court held that the clause was controlling and therefore great plains action was barred,reasoning that the section clause would apply only when the principal amount of the debentures was due.
great plains argues that the district court erred in this regard.the question is whether the clause or the section clause is controlling with respect to the annual interest owed on the debentures.we hold that section grants great plains the absolute right to sue for unpaid interest without having to first comply with the clause.we find persuasive the conclusion reached by other courts that a clause may not override a debenture holder absolute right guaranteed by section to seek payment of overdue interest.see cruden,at upic learning,in re envirodyne.courts have reached this conclusion because section is mandatory in order to assure the negotiability of the debentures by making certain that the promise to pay contained therein was unconditional.envirodyne,at see also watts,cir n egotiability is reduced when clauses are construed to limit suits upon interest obligations.
union pacific contends that quirke francisco railway,cir,cert.denied,d,requires a different result.in quirke,this court held that a bondholder was required to comply with a clause before bringing suit to challenge the company purchase of stock.id.at.quirke did not,however,involve a claim for unpaid interest on debentures and did not implicate section.quirke therefore has no bearing on the interplay between section and a clause in a suit for unpaid interest on debentures.
accordingly,great plains was not required to exhaust the procedure of the clause before filing this suit,and the district court was incorrect in holding to the contrary.
we next consider whether great plains claims are barred by the applicable statutes of limitation.the parties dispute whether the kansas or missouri statutes of limitation apply to this case.great plains argues for application of missouri law,as it contends that each relevant missouri statute of limitation is longer than its kansas counterpart.compare.written contracts to pay money ten years,unjust enrichment five years,fraud five years with.stat.ann.contracts five years,unjust enrichment three years,a fraud two years.the district court held that the kansas statutes of limitation applied to great plains claims and that the claims were barred under these statutes.
a federal court sitting in diversity applies the rules of the forum.nettles am,cir citing guaranty trust york.missouri has a borrowing statute that provides,whenever a cause of action has been fully barred by the laws of the state in which it originated,said bar shall be a complete defense to any action thereon.the critical issue in applying this statute is determining where a cause of action originated.nettles,at.under the statute,originated means accrued.thompson crawford,en banc.
with regard to great plains claim,the missouri borrowing statute directs courts to missouri revised statutes section to determine both when and where such a claim accrues.see ferrellgas,edward smith,per curiam.section provides that a cause of action accrues not when the wrong is done or the technical breach of contract or duty occurs,but when the damage resulting therefrom is sustained and is capable of ascertainment.accordingly,a cause of action accrues where damages are capable of ascertainment.d amages are sustained and capable of ascertainment when the fact of damage can be discovered or made known.jordan willens,emphasis omitted.specifically in a suit,the cause of action accrues upon a defendant failure to do the thing at the time and in the manner contracted.davis laclede gas,en banc citation and quotations omitted.and although no missouri state court has directly addressed the issue,it appears that for cases,the cause of action accrues where payment was to be made.see great rivers coop.of se.iowa farmland,applying missouri law and stating that missouri case law would suggest that a breach of promise claim originates where the performance should have taken place,but did not,aff,cir hailey yellow freight,i n breach of contract actions the cause ordinarily originates or accrues,for purposes of a borrowing statute,where the breach occurs,with that place being the place of performance.in re master mortgage inv.fund,applying the missouri borrowing statute and holding that in a tort action for failure to make a payment as required by contract,the cause of action accrued at the place where payment was to be made.
great plains and union pacific dispute where the interest payment was to be made according to the indenture,which provides,
d ebentures shall be payable both as to principal and interest at the office or agency of the company in new york,or,at the option of the registered holder thereof,at the office or agency of the company in louis,missouri,in such coin or currency of the united states of america as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts interest on debentures shall be paid by check to the order of the registered holder,mailed to the address shown by the records of the company.
indenture at.
the indenture requires that the interest payment be mailed to the holder address,and since great plains is located in kansas,payment to great plains can only be mailed to its kansas address as shown in union pacific records.the plain language of the provision providing for payment at union pacific office in new york or louis refers not to a typical payment by check,but rather to an cash payment.because the interest payment was to be mailed to great plains in kansas,and because great plains did not exercise its right to payment in new york or in missouri,great plain claim originated in kansas.see master mortgage,at holding that a tort action originated in kansas where the plaintiff alleged injury resulted from the defendant failure to make payment as required by contract at the plaintiff place of business in kansas heritage life ins.frame,holding that a cause of action originated in texas where the defendants were required to pay the plaintiff and the plaintiff was located in texas.
great plains contends that building erection services,jlg,cir bes,requires a different result.in bes,this court held that a tort claim originated in missouri,which was the site of the physical injury giving rise to the cause of action.id.at.this court rejected the defendants argument that a corporation can only be injured at its corporate headquarters and that a claim against a corporation must originate where the corporation is located.id.at.great plains argues that bes stands for the proposition that a claim against a corporation can not originate where the corporation feels the economic effects of the injury.
the problem with great plains contention is that unlike bes,this case involves a purely economic of interest.this case is more like rajala donnelly meiners jordan kline,cir,which involved a claim of negligent consultation against an accounting firm.id.at.in rajala,this court held that the cause of action originated in kansas because the plaintiff company was located in kansas and accordingly felt the cash flow crunch there.id.at.thus,for cases involving a purely economic injury,as opposed to a physical accident with economic consequences,a cause of action originates where the plaintiff is financially damaged,which for a corporation is often its place of business.see bes,at rajala concerns a purely economic injury to a corporation,without physical injury precipitating the economic damage.this case involves a purely economic injury that great plains could only have ascertained at its place of business in kansas.therefore,the kansas statute of limitations applies to great plains claim.
under kansas law,a cause of action for breach of contract must be brought within five years.stat.ann.a claim accrues when the contract is breached,irrespective of the plaintiff knowledge or injury.pizel zuspann.great plains claim accrued on april,when union pacific did not make the interest payment as required by the indenture.because great plains did not file this suit until january,the claim is untimely under the kansas statute of limitations.
with regard to great plains claim,under missouri law,such a claim also accrues according to section.see estate of cates brown,per curiam.therefore,the kansas statute of limitations applies to great plains claim as well.
a cause of action for unjust enrichment must be brought within three years.stat.ann.stehlik weaver.an claim accrues when the elements are present and the plaintiff could have filed and maintained a successful suit.dodson int l parts,hiatt,wl,at,unpublished citing pancake house,redmond.the elements of an claim are the plaintiff confers a benefit on the defendant the defendant knows of the benefit and the defendant retains the benefit inequitably.thompson welles prods.great plains claim for unjust enrichment also accrued on april,as great plains alleges in its complaint that union pacific received an improper benefit on account of its failure to make the interest payment.hartman stumbo,concluding that a cause of action for unjust enrichment accrued when payment was made to defendant.since great plains did not file this suit until,the claim is untimely under kansas law.
with regard to great plains fraud claim,the missouri borrowing statute directs courts to missouri revised statutes section,rather than section,to determine when and where a fraud claim accrues.see nettles,at.section provides that a cause of action for fraud accrues upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud.this statute is intended to promote due diligence by plaintiffs in discovering fraud,as w here the means for discovery exist,a plaintiff is deemed to know of the fraud.schwartz lawson.accordingly,a cause of action for fraud accrues in the state where the plaintiff should have discovered the facts constituting the fraud.
great plains should have discovered union pacific alleged fraud at great plains office in kansas.each act allegedly constituting fraud was discoverable with due diligence during the ordinary course of great plains business.specifically,great plains points to union pacific letter and attachments of march,as causing great plains detrimental reliance.because great plains is only located in kansas,great plains could only have reviewed and relied upon these documents during the course of its business in kansas.additionally,great plains claims that union pacific annual report to the stb shows that union pacific ani calculation was fraudulent.again,through the exercise of ordinary diligence,great plains should have discovered this information during the course of its business in kansas.accordingly,the kansas statute of limitations applies to great plains fraud claim.
a cause of action for fraud must be brought within two years.sat.ann.a.a cause of action for fraud accrues when the fraud could have been discovered with reasonable diligence.waite adler.great plains could have discovered the alleged fraud when union pacific sent its letter and attachments on march,when union pacific filed its report with the stb on march,or,at the latest,when union pacific failed to make the interest payment on april.the indenture specifically provides that great plains could have inspected union pacific ani computation after it was sent to the trustee on march.moreover,union pacific annual report to the stb,which great plains alleges is indicative of fraud,is a publicly available document that great plains could have examined beginning march.see united states eagleboy,cir a court may take judicial notice of agency documents.because great plains had constructive notice of the alleged fraud in and did not file this suit until,great plains fraud claim is untimely under kansas law.
great plains contends that the statutes of limitation should be tolled for two separate reasons.first,great plains states that union pacific fraudulently concealed the correct ani for and that great plains was unable to discover union pacific fraudulent actions and concealment until shortly before filing this lawsuit.am.compl.at.second,great plains argues that the filing of previous class actions tolled the statutes of limitation.
because this case arises under our diversity jurisdiction,we apply state tolling law but also apply federal procedural law.see erie tompkins.carter washington metro.area transit.under missouri law,it is a generally accepted rule that when borro
