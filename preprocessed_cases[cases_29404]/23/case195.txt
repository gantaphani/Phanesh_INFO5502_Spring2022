rex saunders brought this suit,alleging that branch banking trust company of virginia bb t violated its duties as a furnisher of information under the fair credit reporting act,west supp fcra.after a full trial,the jury returned a verdict for saunders,awarding him in statutory damages and in punitive damages.bb t appeals,challenging the district court denial of its motions for judgment as a matter of law and for remittitur.we affirm.
on august,saunders purchased an automobile from richmond mitsubishi,and the dealer assigned his loan for the car to bb t.after experiencing mechanical trouble with the car,in late november saunders traded it in for a new car at the dealership.the dealer paid the remaining debt on the original loan,leaving saunders with no obligations under that loan.
the dealer then assigned the loan for the second car to bb t.when saunders did not receive a payment book for the new car in december,he telephoned bb t,and a bb t employee told him that he owed no money on any loan.he visited a bb t branch and obtained a copy of his loan statement at the bank it revealed that he owed nothing.in late january,he went to the department of motor vehicles and found that his car title showed no liens on the vehicle.saunders contacted bb t several more times each time,bb t employees informed him that he owed no money to bb 
on march,saunders received a letter from bb t,informing him his payments were seriously delinquent,his loan was in default,and bb t had accelerated the payment schedule so that he owed a total balance of,including principal,interest,late fees,and other applicable charges,all of which was to be paid in full within days.prior to the march letter,bb t had never informed saunders that he owed money on this loan.
after receiving bb t march letter,saunders met with thomas holben,a bb t lending officer,and explained that bb t had erred in failing even to acknowledge the existence of his loan prior to march saunders told holben that he would meet his obligations under the loan,but he refused to pay any penalties or late fees since he had expressed his willingness to pay numerous times and bb t had repeatedly erred in stating that he owed no money.although bb t offered to wait to assess late fees until after he had made all of the remaining payments on the loan,the bank refused to waive the late fees or penalties.saunders responded that he was unwilling to pay down the loan if bb t was going to charge late fees and penalties resulting from its own admitted accounting errors.
at trial,holben conceded that bb t did not book the second loan into its computer system until march,and that bb t did not provide saunders with an account number until march.holben also admitted that bb t learned of the loan and the failure to record the loan because saunders kept contacting bb t,attempting to pay down the loan.after the loan was booked into the computer system in march,bb t documented numerous communications from saunders and saunders attorney.bb t records entirely accord with saunders testimony.the bank records reveal that saunders sought to resolve the dispute,informed bb t of its error in failing to communicate with him earlier,and told bb t that he had not paid earlier because bb t had not provided him with an account number for the loan.
on april,bb t repossessed saunders new car and informed saunders that he could only redeem it by paying the full amount due,including principal,interest,late fees,and a repossession expense.saunders tried to obtain a new loan from a credit union in order to redeem the bb t loan and avoid further interactions with bb however,bb t had reported saunders loan as in repo ssession status to the credit reporting agencies cras,causing saunders credit score to drop from to.because of this substantial drop in his credit score,saunders could not obtain a new loan from the credit union at a favorable interest rate.
saunders contacted the cras including trans union,lodging a dispute over the recorded information about the bb t debt and triggering the cras obligation to reinvestigate pursuant to a.trans union issued an automated consumer dispute verification form to bb bb t had previously reported the repossession to trans union,resulting in a negative score on the loan,and in response to the dispute verification form,bb t updated the record to reflect a profit and loss writeof f,resulting in the worst possible score for saunders on the loan.the dispute verification form provided bb t with two opportunities to indicate that saunders had contested the legitimacy of the debt with bb bb t therefore could have indicated that it considered the debt uncollectible and also reported that saunders had disputed the debt if bb t had done so,trans union would have reported both the debt and the dispute and would not have considered the debt in determining saunders total credit score.thus,bb t decision to report the debt but not the dispute resulted in a much lower credit score for saunders than a report of both the debt and the dispute.
holben conceded that bb t reported this account as a,reflecting that saunders had made no payments.on direct examination,saunders counsel asked holben if bb t had intended to report saunders loan as it had,without any indication that saunders contested the debt.holben responded with no payments made correct.even as the case went to trial,the record indicated that bb t still had not changed or updated its reporting to the cras to reflect the ongoing dispute with saunders about the legitimacy of the debt.
on october,saunders brought this suit,alleging that bb t violated its duties as a furnisher of information under fcra,b,by failing to report the dispute.at the conclusion of the trial,the court instructed the jury on bb t statutory duties as a furnisher of information.the trial court also instructed the jury that it could find bb t had violated fcra by failing to report the ongoing dispute only if the jury concluded that bb t conduct excused saunders from making his payments on the loan,if the jury considered the dispute meritorious.after deliberation,the jury returned a verdict finding that bb t had intentionally violated its duties under fcra.the jury awarded saunders no compensatory damages but did award the maximum possible statutory damages of and punitive damages of.
on appeal,bb t argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law,because saunders presented insufficient evidence to establish a willful violation of fcra.bb t also maintains that a punitive damages award of violates the due process clause of the constitution,and thus the district court erred in denying its motion for remittitur of the award to.
bb t initially contends that the district court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law.we review de novo a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.anderson russell,cir.a court may award judgment as a matter of law only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party.a.thus,when a jury has returned its verdict,a court may grant judgment as a matter of law only if,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party and drawing every legitimate inference in that party favor,the court determines that the only conclusion a reasonable jury could have reached is one in favor of the moving party.figg schroeder,cir.
we consider first the relevant legal principles governing this fcra claim and then the arguments offered by bb 
congress enacted fcra in to ensure fair and accurate credit reporting,promote efficiency in the banking system,and protect consumer privacy.safeco ins.of am.burr,d citing stat.to this end,fcra requires cras to follow procedures in reporting consumer credit information that both meet the needs of commerce and are fair and equitable to the consumer.b.
in addition to the duties it imposes on cras,fcra also imposes duties on furnishers of information.under a,fcra prohibits any person from furnishing information to a cra that the person knows is inaccurate.additionally,any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more consumer reporting agencies must correct and update the information provided so that it is complete and accurate.a.
at issue in this appeal are the additional duties a furnisher incurs under b if a consumer disputes the accuracy of information that the furnisher reports.if a consumer notifies a cra that he disputes the accuracy of an item in his file,fcra requires the cra to notify the furnisher of the dispute.a.upon receipt of this notice,a furnisher must 
a conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information 
b review all relevant information provided by the consumer reporting agency pursuant to section a of this title 
c report the results of the investigation to the consumer reporting agency and 
d if the investigation finds that the information is incomplete or inaccurate,report those results to all other consumer reporting agencies to which the person furnished the information and that compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis 
thus,fcra requires furnishers to determine whether the information that they previously reported to a cra is incomplete or inaccurate.b d emphasis added.in so mandating,congress clearly intended furnishers to review reports not only for inaccuracies in the information reported but also for omissions that render the reported information misleading.courts have held that a credit report is not accurate under fcra if it provides information in such a manner as to create a materially misleading impression.see,dalton capital associated,cir see also koropoulos credit bureau,reasoning that incomplete reporting can violate fcra when it is misleading alexander moore,
of particular relevance here,in dalton we addressed the duty of a cra to report accurately pursuant to.at.we held that a report is inaccurate not only when it is patently incorrect but also when it is misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be expected to have an adverse effect.id.quoting sepulvado csc credit,cir.thus,we held that a consumer report that contains technically accurate information may be deemed inaccurate if the statement is presented in such a way that it creates a misleading impression.see id.at.the fifth circuit reached a similar conclusion,affirming a jury verdict finding a cra report inaccurate when the report described an account as l itigation p ending,because the report omitted the fact that the consumer,as opposed to the,had brought suit.see pinner schmidt,cir.
finally,fcra imposes civil liability on a ny person violating duties under the act.a a.a consumer may recover compensatory damages or statutory damages of not more than,punitive damages,and attorneys fees from any person who willfully fails to comply with the requirements of the act.only compensatory damages and attorneys fees are available for negligent violations of the act.fcra explicitly bars private suits for violations of a,but consumers can still bring private suits for violations of b.see c see also johnson mbna am.bank,na,cir affirming jury verdict in consumer suit for violation of b.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the arguments in the case at hand.
the jury found that bb t willfully breached its obligations under b and so awarded statutory and punitive damages under.bb t offers three arguments as to why the district court erred in refusing to grant its motion for judgment as a matter of law.first,bb t contends that its response to the cras dispute verification form simply reflected saunders delinquency on his account and thus was not incomplete or inaccurate as a matter of law.second,bb t maintains that even if its response violated its duties under b,saunders failed to present sufficient evidence of intent to establish a willful violation.third,bb t insists that saunders did not have a legitimate excuse for nonpayment after the march communications and so merited the poor credit rating he received from the cras.we consider each argument in turn.
despite the statutory text and precedent detailed above,bb t contends that reporting a debt without reporting its disputed nature can never be deemed inaccurate as a matter of law.bb t argues that furnishers need not report affirmative defenses raised by consumers and suggests that the consumer filing of a dispute with the cras renders any reporting on the dispute by the furnisher superfluous.
according to bb t,fcra requires this result.bb t relies on asserted critical differences between a and b.the former imposes a duty on furnishers to provide accurate information,see a inter alia,it requires furnishers to report consumer disputes,see a.bb t contends that the absence of a specific requirement to report consumer disputes in b means that congress did not intend for furnishers to report disputes to cras when responding to their requests for consumer dispute verification.
this argument ignores the interplay of a and b.the first subsection,a,provides that furnishers have a general duty to provide accurate and complete information the next subsection,b,imposes an obligation to review the previously disclosed information and report whether it was incomplete or inaccurate upon receipt of a notice of dispute from a cra.the second subsection thus requires furnishers to review their prior report for accuracy and completeness it does not set forth specific requirements as to what information must be reported,because these requirements have already been set forth in the first subsection.no court has ever suggested that a furnisher can excuse its failure to identify an inaccuracy when reporting pursuant to b by arguing that it should have already reported the information accurately under a.
in addition to its misreading of,bb t also relies on a handful of district court opinions which suggest that reporting a debt without reporting a dispute to the debt is never inaccurate as a matter of law.see wadley equifax info,llc,d,dauster household credit,d,williams colonial bank,wright trw credit data.to the extent these cases depend upon such reasoning,we find that position plainly inconsistent with the statutory text and longstanding precedent discussed above,including dalton.moreover,all of these cases are distinguishable because they involved claims brought against cras under b or,while the case at hand involves a claim against a furnisher under b.claims brought against cras based on a legal dispute of an underlying debt raise concerns about collateral attacks because the creditor is not a party to the suit,while claims against furnishers such as bb t do not raise this consideration because the furnisher is the creditor on the underlying debt.
bb t would have us create a per se rule that furnishers are never obliged to report affirmative defenses or consumer disputes,regardless of how meritorious the dispute may be.such a rule would be.certainly,if a consumer has a meritorious the jury concluded saunders did consumer failure to pay the debt does not reflect financial irresponsibility.moreover,some courts have concluded that a disputed debt differs materially from an undisputed debt even if the consumer would not succeed at a trial of the dispute.see,alexander.at arguing that consumer dispute of default on debt,even predicated upon an invalid legal defense,is relevant if the underlying default is relevant.the per se rule suggested by bb t would result in numerous reports with omissions that are misleading in such a way and to such an extent that they can be expected to have an adverse effect.dalton,at quotations and modifications omitted.
nor do we find persuasive bb t contention that a furnisher reporting of an ongoing dispute of a debt is superfluous once a consumer has filed a dispute with any cra.among other things,when a furnisher reports a dispute,its report confirms that the consumer has actually contacted the furnisher and explained that the consumer believes he does not owe the debt.moreover,saunders presented evidence that,in the course of business,cras do not consider the furnisher reporting of a dispute superfluous.for instance,when a furnisher responds to a dispute verification form and relates an ongoing dispute,trans unio
