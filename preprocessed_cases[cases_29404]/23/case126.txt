opinion of the court 
dale kaymark defaulted on a mortgage held by bank of america,boa.on behalf of boa,udren law offices,udren initiated foreclosure proceedings against kaymark in state court.the body of the foreclosure complaint listed certain fees as due and owing,which kaymark alleges violated several state and federal fair debt collection laws and breached the mortgage contract.because we conclude that kaymark has sufficiently pled that the disputed fees constituted actionable misrepresentation under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,we will reverse the district court order dismissing certain fdcpa claims against udren but affirm its dismissal of all other claims.
kaymark refinanced his home in coraopolis,pennsylvania,in december,executing a note for and granting boa a mortgage.the mortgage was insured by fannie mae fnma.the terms of the mortgage state,in pertinent part 
lender may charge borrower fees for services performed in connection with borrower default and for the purpose of protecting lender interest in the property and rights under this security agreement,including,but not limited to,attorneys fees,property inspection and valuation fees.
if the default is not cured as specified lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this section,including,but not limited to,attorneys fees and costs of title evidence to the extent permitted by applicable law.
app,emphases added.
kaymark experienced a drop in income in june and failed to make his mortgage payments.on august,boa sent kaymark an act notice of delinquency pursuant to pennsylvania housing finance agency law,c,which requires considering foreclosure to send homeowners a notice as a prerequisite to initiating formal action.an act notice must,among other things,include an itemized breakdown of the total amount past due as of the date of the notice and inform the homeowner that he is entitled to thirty days plus three additional days for mailing to meet with a consumer credit counseling agency to attempt to resolve the delinquency.id.kaymark alleges his act notice was improper by attempting to collect three months payment when,at the date of mailing,kaymark was only two months in arrears,and by misrepresenting the time within which kaymark had to meet with a credit agency as thirty days,instead of days.
over a year later,on september,udren,on behalf of boa,filed a verified foreclosure complaint against kaymark in the court of common pleas of allegheny county,pennsylvania.the body of the foreclosure complaint included an itemized list of the total debt,stating that the following items were due and owing as of july,
unpaid principal balance 
accumulated interest 
accumulated late charges 
escrow deficit reserve 
title report 
attorney fees 
property inspection 
grand total 
the above figures are calculated as of.app.
kaymark alleges that the in attorneys fees,in title report fees,and in property inspection fees or total were not actually incurred as of july,two months before the foreclosure action was filed on september.kaymark also alleges that the fees were improperly calculated on a fixed basis.appellees retort that fixed fees are contemplated under the fnma servicing guide,which sets the maximum foreclosure fee,or cap,for attorneys fees at.see app.
kaymark contested the foreclosure action,which is still pending in the allegheny county court of common pleas.as such,kaymark has never paid the disputed fees.the parties do not dispute that these fees were ultimately incurred in the course of the foreclosure action or that the fees were ultimately reasonable.see app.
in february,kaymark filed a complaint on behalf of himself and a putative class against boa and udren collectively,appellees in the court of common pleas of allegheny county.in the original complaint,kaymark alleged that appellees violated the pennsylvania loan interest and protection law act,et,because the foreclosure complaint sought attorneys fees which were not actually incurred upon commencement of the foreclosure action.id.appellees removed the case to the district court for the western district of pennsylvania and filed motions to dismiss on the grounds that kaymark mortgage exceeded the maximum baseline figure to be governed under act.
in response,kaymark filed an amended complaint,asserting the following four counts on the bases of the alleged misrepresentations in the foreclosure complaint act notice count i,against boa,for violating b ii,v,x,and i of the pennsylvania fair credit extension uniformity act fceua,et count ii,against udren,for violating a,and of the fdcpa count iii,against both boa and udren,for violating the pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law utpcpl,et,by virtue of the violations of the fceua or by engaging in certain unfair or deceptive acts or practices,in violation of v and xxi and count iv,against boa,for common law breach of contract.
boa and udren again moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r to grant the motions on december.it reasoned that kaymark fdcpa claim that appellees were not authorized to list flat fees in the foreclosure complaint was rather hypertechnical,app,and that nowhere do the loan documents or any state or federal law prohibit listing attorneys fees and other fixed costs at the time of filing the complaint,but are reasonably expected to be incurred,app.it also explained that kaymark pled himself out of the state causes of action because he did not show any actual loss or damage.app.
the district court adopted the r r and granted the motions to dismiss in their entirety,with prejudice,on march.agreeing that the inclusion of fees was not prohibited by the mortgage contract or other state or federal laws,the district court dismissed the fdcpa claim.it also concluded that kaymark failed to demonstrate an actual loss as a result of the alleged misrepresentations,and,therefore,that he failed to state a claim under the utpcpl and the fceua.for the same reasons,failure to plead actual loss,the district court dismissed kaymark breach of contract claim against boa.kaymark timely appealed.
the district court exercised jurisdiction over kaymark fdcpa claim under and supplemental jurisdiction over kaymark claims under.this court exercises jurisdiction under.

congress enacted the fdcpa in to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors.e.the court has repeatedly held that a s remedial legislation,the fdcpa must be broadly construed in order to give full effect to these purposes,caprio healthcare revenue recovery,llc,cir,and,as such,we analyze the communication giving rise to the fdcpa claim from the perspective of the least sophisticated debtor,rosenau unifund,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
kaymark alleges that,by attempting to collect fees for legal services not yet performed in the mortgage foreclosure,udren violated specifically,a,and which imposes strict liability on debt collectors who use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt,and by attempting to collect an amount including any interest,fee,charge,or expense incidental to the principal obligation unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.
bearing on these claims,the parties dispute the relevance of our intervening decision in mclaughlin phelan hallinan schmieg,llp,cir decided by this court after the district court order.in mclaughlin,we held that conduct in a debt collection demand letter,rather than a foreclosure complaint,violated the fdcpa.we now conclude that mclaughlin holding extends to foreclosure complaints,and we reverse the district court order dismissing certain fdcpa claims against udren.
timothy mclaughlin defaulted on a mortgage held by citimortgage.citimortgage referred the issue to phelan hallinan schmieg,llp phs,which sent mclaughlin a demand letter on june,itemizing the total amount of debt due as of may,as.id.at.the debt included two line items relevant here in attorney fees and for costs of suit and title search.id.internal quotation marks omitted.like in the case at bar,mclaughlin assert ed,among other things,that these fees and costs had not actually been incurred as of the date stated in the letter,constituting actionable misrepresentation under the false representation of a the character,amount,of legal status of any debt or b any services rendered or compensation which may be lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt.and the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.of the fdcpa.
when mclaughlin filed a class action complaint,the district court held,among other things,that estimating the amount of attorneys fees in an itemized debt collection notice does not violate the fdcpa,id.internal quotation marks omitted,and dismissed mclaughlin claims.on appeal,this court reversed 
nothing in the letter says the amount owed on the debt is an estimate or in any way suggests that it was not a precise amount.as the drafter of the letter,phs is responsible for its content and for what the least sophisticated debtor would have understood from it.if phs wanted to convey that the amounts in the letter were estimates,then it could have said so.it did not.instead,its language informs the reader of the specific amounts due for specific items as of a particular date.if the amount actually owed as of that date was less than the amount listed,then,construing the facts in the light most favorable to mclaughlin as we must when reviewing the dismissal under rule b,mclaughlin has stated a claim that the letter misrepresents the amount of the debt in violation of and.
id.at internal citations omitted.
the facts in mclaughlin are virtually indistinguishable from the case at bar.here,the foreclosure complaint also plainly inform ed the reader of the specific amounts due for specific items as of a particular date,two months prior to the date the foreclosure complaint was filed.udren also did not convey that the disputed fees were estimates or imprecise amounts.thus,pursuant to mclaughlin,the foreclosure complaint conceivably misrepresented the amount of the debt owed,forming a basis for violations of a and.
by extension,it follows that kaymark has sufficiently alleged that udren attempt to collect those misrepresented fees was not expressly authorized by the mortgage contract or permitted by law.to be sure,kaymark expressly agreed to the collection of certain fee categories,such as attorneys fees,property inspection and valuation fees.app.but the contract also specified that boa could only charge for services performed in connection with the default and collect all expenses incurred in pursuing authorized remedies.app,emphases added.while such language is arguably capable of more than one meaning,we must view the foreclosure complaint through the lens of the consumer and in the light most favorable to kaymark.in this perspective,the most natural reading is that udren was not authorized to collect fees for legal services and expenses,forming a basis for a violation of 
this conclusion is not a departure from our sister circuits,which have held that demanding fees in the collection of debts in a way contrary to the underlying agreement is actionable under the fdcpa.see kojetin c u recovery,cir per curiam finding fdcpa violation where the debt collector charged a collection fee based on a percentage of the principal balance of the debt due rather than the actual cost of collection as stipulated in the loan agreement bradley franklin collection,cir finding violation where debtor agreed to pay the actual costs of collection,not a percentage above the amount of his outstanding debt that was unrelated to the actual costs to collect that debt per curiam.likewise,kaymark agreed to pay attorneys fees and other expenses that were actually incurred in connection with the default,not fees that might eventually be incurred.
however,because udren did not threat en to take an action that can not legally be taken,such as falsely threatening to file suit,see brown card serv,cir,kaymark fails to state a claim under.
the false communication in mclaughlin was a debt collection letter here,of course,it is a foreclosure complaint.accordingly,to determine whether kaymark has sufficiently stated an fdcpa claim,we must decide whether this distinction is fatal.
the thrust of udren argument is that pleadings in particular,foreclosure complaints can not be the basis of fdcpa claims.however,the statutory text,as well at the case law interpreting the text,renders this argument meritless.
in heintz jenkins,the supreme court established that attorneys engage d in activity,even when that activity consists of litigation are covered by the fdcpa,d.in so holding,the court explained that congress repealed an express exemption from the definition of debt collector in an earlier version of the statute for any collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of and in the name of a client.id.at quoting,f,stat.once congress amended the law without creating another exemption to fill its void,the court explained,congress intended that lawyers be subject to the fdcpa whenever they meet the general debt collector definition.id.at see defining debt collector as any person who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.that the fdcpa covers attorneys engaged in debt collection litigation is law in this circuit,see,piper portnoff law,cir i f a communication meets the fdcpa definition of an effort by a debt collector to collect a debt from a consumer,it is not relevant that it came in the context of litigation,and there is no dispute here that udren acted as a debt collector when,by filing the foreclosure complaint,it attempt ed to collect a debt on behalf of boa.
but congress did not stop there.subsequent to heintz,congress twice amended the statute and exempted formal pleading s made in connection with a legal action from,as amended,a,stat,and communication s in the form of formal pleading s from d,as amended,a,stat,two provisions not here at issue.if congress intended that all conduct in the course of formal pleadings be exempt from the fdcpa,then these express exemptions would be superfluous,and courts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous.bank germain,d.furthermore,as the fourth circuit explained,the fact that the amendment s occurred after heintz further indicates that congress was aware of the court interpretation of the fdcpa and accepted it,except for the narrow exemption s it provided for formal pleadings in and d.sayyed wolpoff abramson,cir see also merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,curran,d congress is presumed to be aware of a judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change internal quotation marks omitted.if congress had wanted to exclude formal pleadings from the protections of the fdcpa under any of its other provisions,it could have done so.it did not.thus,except for and d,t he amendment s by their terms in fact suggest that all litigation activities,including formal pleadings,are subject to the fdcpa.sayyed,at.
we conclude that a communication can not be uniquely exempted from the fdcpa because it is a formal pleading or,in particular,a complaint.this principle is widely accepted by our sister circuits.see,currier first resolution inv,cir the fact that the alleged violation appears in a lawsuit or other court filing does not diminish the threatening nature of the communication for purposes of the fdcpa.james wadas,cir t he fdcpa applies to the litigating activities of lawyers,which,as other circuits have held,may include the service upon a debtor of a complaint to facilitate debt collection efforts quoting heintz,at donohue quick collect,cir to limit the litigation activities that may form the basis of fdcpa liability to exclude complaints served personally on consumers to facilitate debt collection,the very act that formally commences such a litigation,would require a nonsensical narrowing of the common understanding of the word litigation that we decline to adopt.sayyed,at subjecting interrogatories and summary judgment motions to the fdcpa gearing check brokerage,cir finding and violations where debt collector allegation in its state court complaint gave a false impression as to the legal status it enjoyed.and,while we have not directly decided the issue,this court has extended the fdcpa to state court complaints,see glover,cir explaining that the law firm,i n filing the foreclosure complaint against glover,indisputably met the definition of debt collector under the fdcpa,and so has the supreme court,see jerman carlisle,mcnellie,rini,kramer ulrich lpa,d deciding the scope of the fdcpa bona fide error defense on the basis of a notice attached to mortgage foreclosure complaint.
udren makes two further attempts to distinguish foreclosure complaints from debt collection letters,both of which must fail.
first,udren contends that a complaint,because it is directed to the court,is not a communication to the consumer subject to and.this argument can not be sustained.the statute defines a communication under the fdcpa as the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium.emphasis added.interpreting this provision in allen ex rel.martin lasalle bank,where we decided whether a communication made to a consumer attorney was governed by,we held that i f an otherwise improper communication would escape fdcpa liability simply because that communication was directed to a consumer attorney,it would undermine the deterrent effect of strict liability,cir see also id.at noting that the heintz court also referred to a communication from a debt collector to a consumer attorney,though it did not directly decide that question.
so too for pleadings filed with the court and served on the consumer.because the foreclosure complaint was served on kaymark directly or indirectly through his attorney,he was the intended recipient of the communication.see donohue,at holding that a complaint served on the debtor is a communication subject to the fdcpa courts have only held that a complaint misleads the judge,rather than the consumer,when,for instance,the plaintiff specifically pled that a attachment to a complaint would mislead the cook county judge handling his case.palisades acquisition xvi,llc,cir see id.at noting that this allegation was u nlike most lawsuits under the fdcpa.this is not that case.here,the foreclosure complaint was unquestionably a communication directed at kaymark in attempt to collect on his debt.
udren second argument is that foreclosure actions can not be the basis of fdcpa claims because kaymark has to his avail the protections of the pennsylvania rules of civil procedure and because the heintz court noted that the fdcpa has the apparent objective of preserving creditors judicial remedies.at.
similar arguments have been raised and rejected.in simon fia card services,we refused to categorically preclude fdcpa claims because the claim arose in a pending bankruptcy proceeding,referencing the supreme court reluctan ce to limit the fdcpa because other,preexisting rules and remedies may also apply to the conduct alleged to violate the fdcpa,cir.we explained that t he proper inquiry is whether the fdcpa claim raises a direct conflict between the bankruptcy code or rules and the fdcpa,or whether both can be enforced.id.at see also germain,at redundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting,and so long as there is no positive repugnancy between two laws,a court must give effect to both.internal citations omitted.
nowhere does the fdcpa exclude foreclosure actions from its reach.on the contrary,foreclosure meets the broad definition of debt collection under the fdcpa,see mclaughlin,at defining debt collection as activity undertaken for the general purpose of inducing payment,and it is even contemplated in various places in the statute,see,discussing procedures for action s to enforce an interest in real property securing the consumer obligation glazer chase home fin.llc,cir explaining why f oreclosure legal nature does not prevent it from being debt collection.udren would have us create an enormous loophole in the fdcpa by immunizing any debt from coverage if that debt happened to be secured by a real property interest and foreclosure proceedings were used to collect the debt.wilson draper goldberg,cir.we will not.like the court explained previously,if a collector were able to avoid liability under the fdcpa simply by choosing to proceed in rem rather than in personam,it would undermine the purpose of the fdcpa.piper,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in any event,the prudence of maintaining parallel fdcpa claims is not ours to decide it is congress,and its intent is clear for the reasons discussed.absent a finding that the result will be so absurd as to warrant implying an exemption for fdcpa claims involving foreclosure actions,we are not empowered to disregard the plain language of the statute.heintz,at.thus,udren arguments are more properly addressed to congress,which is,of course,free to amend the statute accordingly.jerman,at.
given our holding in mclaughlin based on facts,we conclude that the fact that the debt collection activity at issue here involves a foreclosure complaint,rather than a debt collection letter,does not remove it from the fdcpa purview under mclaughlin.we will reverse the order dismissing kaymark a,and claims against udren,and we will affirm the order dismissing the claim.
kaymark next alleges that,by misrepresenting or overcharging fees in the foreclosure complaint,boa and violated the utpcpl by virtue of the violations of the fceua,a if a debt collector or creditor engages in an unfair or deceptive debt collection act or practice under the fceua,it shall constitute a violation of the utpcpl,or by engaging in certain unfair or deceptive acts or practices,in violation of v representing that services have characteristics they do not have and xxi engaging in any other fraudulent or deceptive conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding.
to maintain a private right of action under the utpcpl,a plaintiff must demonstrate ascertainable loss of money or property,real or personal,id.a,as a result of the defendant prohibited conduct under the statute,see yocca pittsburgh steelers sports.assuming arguendo that kaymark has pled a violation of the utpcpl,we conclude that kaymark fails to allege ascertainable loss,and we do not reach appellees alternative argument that kaymark also failed to establish reliance.
the crux of kaymark theory of ascertainable loss is that the lien on his property from the mortgage was inflated by services,resulting in a corresponding,precisely quantifiable,diminishment in his interests in property.appellant br.at.he reasons that,for a period of time before any services were performed,he had to pay extra the total overcharged amount on the debt to cure his default and avoid foreclosure.the district court rejected kaymark lien theory,concluding that his argument is couched in speculative terms.app.on the facts presented in this case,we agree.
because the pennsylvania supreme court has not definitively addressed what constitutes ascertainable loss under the statute,we must predict how that court would rule if faced with the issue,and,in doing so,t he decision of an intermediate state court is particularly relevant.covington cont l tire,cir.lower state courts reason that a scertainable loss must be established from the factual circumstances surrounding each case,agliori metro.life ins,but that the loss must be,schwarzwaelder fox,see also benner bank of america,d,a n a
