discussion 
the pearsons contend the judgment in favor of heritage is flawed because the trial court erred when it denied their motion to amend their answer to claim a homestead exemption,and because the judgment fails to recognize the homestead exemption.we agree.
the joint answer filed by the pearsons in july raised half a dozen affirmative defenses but did not mention anything about a homestead exemption.about seven months later,in february,the pearsons filed a motion for leave to amend their answer to raise the homestead issue,stating that it had recently been discovered that the south hobart street property was homesteaded on january.in a supporting declaration,theresa said that,at the time she retained counsel to represent her and pearson in this action,she was not aware that the property had been h omesteaded.she said pearson was incarcerated at that time,and she was involved in a criminal matter in grand junction,colorado.she said that s ometime around the end of november,pearson had told her that he vaguely recalled signing a document in january,and that the property may have been h omesteaded.she called the real estate broker who had drafted the homestead,then told her lawyer about it.

homestead laws are designed to protect the sanctity of the family home against a loss caused by a forced sale by creditors.the homestead exemption itself does not have any effect on the liens created voluntarily by the property owners,nor does it have any effect on the claims of creditors secured by liens that have priority over the declaration of homestead.citation.the homestead exemption ensures that insolvent debtors and their families are not rendered homeless by virtue of an involuntary sale of the residential property they occupy.thus,the homestead law is not designed to protect creditors,but protects the home against creditors of the declarant,thereby preserving the home for the family.this strong public policy requires courts to adopt a liberal construction of the law and facts to promote the beneficial purposes of the homestead legislation to benefit the debtor.citations.
