plaintiff capital ventures international cvi appeals from denial of its motions for an order of attachment and for reconsideration of that ruling.
background 
a.the brady plan 
in the late,after a number of nations defaulted on their external debt,then united states treasury secretary nicholas brady developed a debt relief program known as the brady plan.under its auspices,the republic of argentina argentina negotiated the restructuring of much of its medium and commercial debt in april of,exchanging an estimated billion in unsecured commercial bonds for a series of collateralized bonds due in the brady bonds.the brady bonds were secured,pursuant to a collateral pledge agreement,by united states treasury and german government bonds the brady collateral owned by argentina and held by the federal reserve bank of new york frbny.the brady collateral was divided between two separate accounts,one securing argentina payment upon maturity of the principal of the brady bonds the principal collateral and the other securing interest payments to brady bond holders prior to maturity the interest collateral.
b.the bonds 
in,argentina issued another series of bonds pursuant to various prospectuses and a fiscal agency agreement.cvi,a cayman islands company,acquired a beneficial interest in approximately million worth of these bonds 
in the late,a decade after the debt crisis that spurred the brady plan,argentina sank into recession.in december,it suspended payments of interest and principal on much of its foreign debt,including the brady bonds and the bonds issued in.this constituted an event of default under the fiscal agency agreement,permitting holders of the bonds to declare the principal amount due and payable upon delivery of written notice of acceleration to argentina.
c.the exchange offer 
in january,following improvement in its economy,argentina contemplated restructuring at least some of its debt through an exchange offer the exchange offer pursuant to which holders of certain of its brady and other bonds would be afforded an opportunity to exchange bonds for cash and additional consideration.it intended to obtain at least part of the necessary cash by liquidating so much of the collateral as secured payment of tendered brady bonds,which would become available upon their tender.this,however,created a the brief interval between the release of the collateral upon the tender of brady bonds and the payment of the proceeds of its liquidation to tendering bondholders,a creditor might attach either the collateral or its proceeds.no doubt for this reason,argentina,prior to the exchange offer,entered into a continuation of collateral agreement pursuant to which the tendering bondholders were granted a security interest in the principal collateral and its proceeds until the proceeds were paid to them.
with the continuation of collateral agreement in place,argentina proceeded with the exchange offer.brady bond holders were offered cash proceeds of the liquidation of principal collateral attributable to any bonds they tendered plus a newly issued bond valued at approximately of the principal amount of any brady bonds tendered.
the principal collateral attributable to brady bonds owned by holders could not be sold and,in the ordinary course,will not become available to those holders until the maturity of the bonds.
proceedings below 
cvi did not accept the exchange offer.in april,it gave written notice of acceleration under the fiscal agency agreement and then sued argentina for breach of contract based on its default on the bonds.it sought damages of approximately million plus costs and attorneys fees,and applied for an order attaching the brady collateral 
cvi argued principally that it was entitled to attach the portion of the principal collateral that would be liquidated to pay tendering brady bond holders,thus validating the concern that must have been responsible for the continuation of collateral agreement.it acknowledged that the brady bond holders lien on the principal collateral would be superior to any right it might obtain through attachment prior to the tendering of any bonds.it contended,however,that the portion of the principal collateral attributable to tendered brady bonds would revert to argentina,free and clear of the tendering bondholders security interest,upon the tender,thus giving cvi the senior lien.
the district court concluded that cvi was certain to prevail on its breach of contract claim against argentina,but it nevertheless denied the order of attachment from the bench for at least one and possibly two reasons.
first,it concluded that the continuation of collateral agreement extended the lien of the tendering bond holders on the principal collateral to its proceeds and continued it to the point at which the proceeds were paid over to them.at one point it concluded from this fact that it would not be proper to allow an attachment to simply have plaintiff become a junior lien holder,when the instruments that are operative would mean that the junior lien holder would get nothing.moments later it observed in the same connection that there is no property interest that is attachable in respect to these bonds.
second,the court at another point expressed concern that the issuance of an order of attachment could create a lot of confusion.this appears to have been a reference to possible disruption of the marketplace during the pendency of the exchange offer.it is not clear,however,whether the court relied on this concern in denying relief.
following the bench decision,cvi moved for reconsideration.that application likewise was denied.
the exchange offer closed in due course.argentina liquidated the portion of the principal collateral attributable to the tendered bonds and paid the proceeds to the tendering bondholders.principal collateral attributable to the untendered brady bonds remains in the hands of the frbny.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
cvi concedes that its appeal is moot as to the tendering bondholders portion of the principal collateral,which argentina already has sold,and its proceeds.it argues,however,that it is entitled to attach certain portions of the interest collateral and the principal collateral attributable to the bondholders,which was not released pursuant to the exchange offer.
a.the interest collateral 
cvi did not argue below that it was entitled to attach the interest collateral.we generally do not consider a claim raised for the first time on appeal,sniado bank austria ag,cir per curiam,and see no reason to do so here accordingly,we must determine only whether plaintiff was entitled to attach argentina interest in the reversion of the principal collateral securing the bonds.
