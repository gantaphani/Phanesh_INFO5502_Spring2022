plaintiff and appellant rebecca liceaga,apparently the victim of identity theft,filed a complaint against debt recovery solutions,llc,a collection agency,for damages that she claims were caused when it furnished to a consumer credit reporting agency information about her which it knew or should have known was inaccurate.the complaint alleged a violation of california consumer credit reporting agencies act,civil code section et.ccraa.the trial court granted defendant motion for judgment upon the pleadings upon the ground that any private right of action provided by the ccraa is preempted by the corresponding federal fair credit reporting act et fcra.
in this appeal we are called upon to determine whether the fcra preempts private rights of action as to furnishers of wrongful information and whether,if so,congress has specifically excepted california actions from preemption.we conclude that private actions under the ccraa are preempted,without exception,by fcra.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff apparently was the victim of identity theft.after her car and purse were stolen,her identity was used to obtain a sprint cell phone account.although plaintiff had never done any business with sprint,when the identity thief failed to pay the account,sprint assigned the debt to defendant,a debt collection agency,which began dunning plaintiff.despite her pleas to the agency that she was a victim of identity theft and had no sprint account,they appear to have disbelieved her and ultimately reported her default to several credit reporting agencies,without advising that the debt was contested,thus harming her credit score and damaging her credit reputation.this action followed.
defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings based upon the sole ground that the fcra preempts all private,state law rights of action that are based upon the wrongful acts of a furnisher of credit information.the trial court granted the motion.plaintiff has timely appealed.
standard of review 
the standards governing judgments upon the pleadings and appellate review thereof are well established.a motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same function as a general demurrer,but is made after the time for demurer has expired the same rules apply.cloud northrop grumman th,d.the motion normally lies only for defects fully disclosed upon the face of the complaint and the facts alleged therein must be taken as true and are to be liberally construed.guild mortgage heller d.
the proper interpretation of constitutional or statutory provisions is a question of law,as is the application of a statute to undisputed facts.as such,such issues are subject to independent de novo review by this court.redevelopment agency county of los angeles th,d seligsohn day th,d.as the trial court determination in any motion for judgment on the pleadings generally involves purely questions of law,an appellate court independently reviews the trial court order on such a motion.see smiley citibank cal th,d,involving an issue of federal preemption as to banking laws.
there is no dispute in this action as to the fact that both ccraa and fcra address the prohibition of those who furnish credit information to credit reporting agencies from providing inaccurate credit information about a consumer.
discussion 
general principles of preemption 
preemption of federal statutory law over state law is based upon the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,cl,and whether preemption occurs is largely a question of congressional intent.english general electric,d.
as was stated in smiley citibank,supra,cal th at page,d,there are three circumstances in which federal preemption is found 
congress can state explicitly the extent to which it intends its enactment to preempt state law express preemption 
state law is preempted,even without explicit language,where it attempts to regulate conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively implied or field preemption or 
finally,state law is preempted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law conflict preemption.
irrespective of the type of preemption at issue,it is the task of the courts to ascertain the intent of congress.shaw delta air lines,d.
the intersection of the supremacy clause with the traditional police powers of the states leads,as plaintiff urges,to a presumption against preemption.as was held in jones rath packing,d,where a field has been traditionally occupied by the states,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.at.
the clear and manifest test applies to all types of preemption,as the purposes of congress may be evidenced in several ways.the scheme of federal regulation may be so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.citations.or the act of congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.citation.likewise,the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose.citations.or the state policy may produce a result inconsistent with the objective of the federal statute.citation.it is often a perplexing question whether congress has precluded state action or by the choice of selective regulatory measures has left the police power of the states undisturbed except as the state and federal regulations collide.citations.rice santa fe elevator.
b.the fair credit reporting act 
in adopting the fcra in,the congress made clear its findings and purpose by enacting its first section 
congressional findings and statement of purpose a accuracy and fairness of credit reporting.the congress makes the following findings there is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness,impartiality,and a respect for the consumer right to privacy.b reasonable procedures.it is the purpose of this title uscs et to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit,personnel,insurance,and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer,with regard to the confidentiality,accuracy,relevancy,and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this title uscs et.
in,congress enacted the consumer credit reporting reform act of pub,stat.the reform act,which made very substantial modifications to the fcra.amongst those changes was the inclusion of those who furnish credit information to credit reporting agencies.the primary regulations of the conduct of furnishers is found in section of the reform act,which added section to title of the united states code section.that section provides in part 
a duty of furnishers of information to provide accurate information.prohibition.a reporting information with actual knowledge of errors.a person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.b reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors.a person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if i the person has been notified by the consumer,at the address specified by the person for such notices,that specific information is inaccurate and ii the information is,in fact,inaccurate.d for purposes of subparagraph a,the term reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate means having specific knowledge,other than solely allegations by the consumer,that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of the information.
section additionally contains provisions,amongst others,that require updating of information a,require the furnisher who learns that the consumer disputes information to advise the reporting agency of the dispu
