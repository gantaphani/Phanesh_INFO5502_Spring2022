background 
quicken loans quicken is licensed to engage in residential mortgage lending in california by the california department of corporations commissioner.see cal.fin.code et.
quicken describes its loan process as follows 
after quicken loans approves a loan,quicken loans and its california borrowers typically complete the lending process through independent escrow companies quicken loans deposits the funds for the loan into the escrow.the borrower delivers the executed loan documents to the escrow company 
when the conditions required to close the transaction have been satisfied,the escrow company is instructed by quicken loans to disburse the funds to or on behalf of the borrower,and to deliver the deed of trust to the county recorder office for recordation in the public records 
quicken loans historically has instructed the escrow company to assess interest commencing on the date the escrow company disburses the loan funds directly to the borrower,or to a third party on the borrower behalf.
quicken admits that there are occasional delays between a the disbursement of loan funds to the borrower and b recordation of the deed of trust as interpreted by the commissioner.during these delays quicken assesses interest on the disbursed loans.
because quicken is licensed under the california residential mortgage lending act,the act prohibition on charging interest in excess of one day prior to recordation applies to quicken.cal.fin.code o amended to prohibit violating a similar provision located at cal.civ.code.in addition,california civil code section provides that a borrower is not required to pay interest for a period in excess of one day prior to recording.cal.civ.code amended to prohibit interest payments more than one day prior to disbursement instead of one day prior to recordation.although the statutes were amended to prohibit interest payments more than one day prior to disbursement,these amendments did not become effective until after quicken had received interest payments in violation of the earlier applicable laws.all references to these statutes refer to the prior versions of the statutes unless otherwise specified.
on march,the commissioner sent quicken a letter asserting that quicken had violated and was continuing to violate these statutes.on january,the commissioner ordered quicken to review all loans it had made in california beginning october,and to refund those interest payments received which violated the per diem statutes.he also ordered quicken to pay the borrowers interest on the refunded interest,and to submit a report detailing the loans and amounts refunded.the commissioner sought to revoke quicken license for failure to comply with california law.quicken first amended complaint alleged that the didmca and the parity act preempt the per diem statutes,and that the per diem statutes effected an unlawful taking in violation of the constitution takings clause.quicken and the commissioner for summary judgment.
the district court granted quicken motion for partial summary judgment on the didmca claim,dismissed quicken takings claim for lack of ripeness,and granted the commissioner motion for summary judgment on the parity act claim.
quicken assigns error to the resolutions of the parity act and takings clause claims,and to the denial of a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the per diem statutes to the extent they are preempted by the didmca.the commissioner,assigning error to the resolution of the didmca claim.
wells fargo held that california per diem statutes are not preempted by the didmca.at.quicken attempts to argue that wells fargo should not be followed because it was decided by a panel rather than by the court sitting en banc,and that wells fargo didmca discussion is dicta.in general,one panel of this court can not reconsider or overrule the decision of a prior panel.united states gay,cir.furthermore,the wells fargo didmca discussion begins with the statement that we must decide this substantive preemption issue.wells fargo bank,at.so much for dicta,and quicken can not distinguish wells fargo.accordingly,the didmca does not preempt the california per diem statutes here.as quicken does not prevail on the merits,an injunction is not available.see amoco prod.village of gambell,alaska,d.
