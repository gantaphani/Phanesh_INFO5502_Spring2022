hsbc bank usa,appeals,for the second time,a district court judgment that affirmed a bankruptcy court authorization of a distribution of assets from the estate of bank of new england corporation bnec to holders of bnec junior debt.the parties agree that the holders of the senior debt are entitled to priority payment of their principal along with interest that is,interest that accrued up until the filing of bnec bankruptcy petition before the holders of the junior debt may receive a distribution.at issue is whether this senior priority also includes payment of interest earned on the principal up until the principal was paid in full,as hsbc contends.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
during the and,bnec issued six series of unsecured debt instruments that totaled over million in principal amount.three of these offerings were issued in,and and consist of senior,unsecured debt.the other three offerings were issued in,and and consist of subordinated,or junior,unsecured debt.the holders of the senior debt senior noteholders are represented by indenture trustee hsbc senior trustee,and the holders of the junior debt junior noteholders are represented by indenture trustees bank,and bank of new york mellon trust company,collectively junior trustees.choice of law clauses within the indentures state that new york law controls the debt instruments.
the three junior indentures that govern the junior debt contain virtually identical subordination provisions,as follows 
the company covenants and agrees,and each holder likewise covenants and agrees by his acceptance thereof,that the obligations of the company to make any payment on account of the principal of and interest on each and all of the subordinated notes shall be subordinate and junior,to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth,in right of payment to the company obligations to the holders of senior indebtedness of the company

the company agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets of the company of any kind or character to creditors upon any dissolution or winding up or total or partial liquidation or reorganization of the company,whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy,insolvency,receivership,conservatorship or other proceedings,all principal and premium,if any,sinking fund payments and interest due or to become due upon all senior indebtedness of the company shall first be paid in full before any payment is made on account of the principal of or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the subordinated notes due and owing at the time 
emphasis added.
on january,bnec filed a voluntary petition for relief pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.ben branch was elected to serve as bnec chapter trustee,and over time,he made three distributions that satisfied in full the senior noteholders principal and interest due under the senior notes,along with approved fees and expenses incurred through the date of the third distribution.he also created a reserve to cover future fees and legal expenses.
after the third distribution,made in,the chapter trustee concluded that the estate had satisfied the claims of the senior noteholders,and so on may,he moved for authorization to make a fourth distribution,of million,which would represent the first recovery by the junior noteholders the senior trustee objected,arguing that the junior noteholders were not entitled to receive any payment until the senior noteholders were paid interest.
the bankruptcy court granted the chapter trustee motion over the senior trustee objection and authorized the distribution.in re bank of new eng,bnec i.it held that,in accordance with the rule of explicitness,as articulated in three court of appeals cases during the and as adhered to under new york law senior creditors can recover interest prior to a distribution to junior creditors only when the subordination agreement explicitly states the junior creditors assumption of the risk for such payment.id.at.it then found that the language within the junior indentures was not sufficiently explicit to meet this standard.the district court affirmed.hsbc bank usa bank of new eng.in re bank of new eng,bnec ii.
on appeal,we reversed.hsbc bank usa branch in re bank of new eng,cir bnec iii.we explained that the accrual of interest on an unsecured claim stops when a debtor files a bankruptcy petition,such that interest is generally not recoverable at all at least,not recoverable from the debtor.id.at,see also b.we also acknowledged that subordination agreements may sometimes prioritize the payment of interest to senior creditors over any recovery on junior indebtedness,entitling senior creditors to amounts that would otherwise be payable to junior creditors.bnec iii,f d at.we noted that before the adoption of the bankruptcy code in,the recovery of interest prior to any distribution to junior creditors was controlled by the rule of explicitness,an equitable doctrine fashioned by the courts that prohibited senior creditors from recovering interest absent unequivocal language in subordination agreements to the contrary.id.we concluded,however,that the enactment of the bankruptcy code,and specifically a therein,extinguished the rule of explicitness in its classic form.id.at.
in reaching our holding,we interpreted a,which states a subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law.a.we explained that this section requires courts to reference general principles of state contract law when enforcing subordination agreements,and it prohibits states from creating rules of contract interpretation.id.at.
in view of a,we examined new york general principles of contract law and found that they do not embody any canon that operates in the same manner as the rule of explicitness.id.at.rather,we found that new york courts do not appear to have developed any rules of interpretation that apply specifically to subordination agreements,and that the rule of explicitness is not part of new york general contract law.id.at.
we then applied new york contract law to determine the meaning of the subordination provisions within the junior indentures.specifically,we examined whether the phrase interest due or to become due,owed first to the senior noteholders,was meant to include interest.id.at.finding the phrase ambiguous,we remanded to the bankruptcy court to conduct a contextual examination of the parties intent,taking full account of the surrounding facts and circumstances.id.at.we acknowledged that the backdrop of bankruptcy may inform this examination,id.at,as we noted that new york law recognizes a presumption that the parties had the law in force at the time of agreement in contemplation when the contract was made and that the contract generally will be construed in light of such law,id.internal marks omitted citing dolman trust.we stated further,however,that the effect of that tenet is uncertain absent further factfinding.id.
on remand,the bankruptcy court bifurcated the proceedings and decided first that each party had the burden to establish its claim of entitlement to the disputed funds by a preponderance of the evidence,a holding that neither party appealed.in re bank of new eng,bnec iv.it then conducted a evidentiary hearing involving the testimony of several fact and expert witnesses and approximately exhibits.in re bank of new eng,b,bnec v.upon evaluation of the witnesses,exhibits,and submissions of counsel,along with the backdrop of bankruptcy,the court concluded that the parties to the junior indentures did not intend to permit the holders of senior debt to receive interest prior to payment on the junior debt.id.at.the district court affirmed.in re bank of new eng,bnec vi.
on appeal,the senior trustee argues that the bankruptcy court must again be reversed.it asserts that the court looked to the incorrect law when analyzing the backdrop of bankruptcy,and that it essentially found that new york law does include the rule of explicitness despite this court opposite conclusion.it also argues that the court improperly analyzed the factual evidence presented in holding that the parties to the junior indentures did not intend to include interest.it claims,lastly,that because there was no competent extrinsic evidence to discern the parties intent,the bankruptcy court should have construed the subordination agreements as a matter of law.

as we explained in bnec iii,general principles of new york contract law must be applied to determine the meaning of the phrase interest due or to become due found within the junior indentures.at.under new york law,a straightforward and unambiguous contract is to be interpreted as a matter of law,but when the meaning of the contract is ambiguous,as we found the provisions to be,the intent of the parties becomes a matter of inquiry,and a question of fact is presented.eden music times square music publ ns.in addition,courts may determine the meaning of ambiguous terms based on the law in force at the time the agreements are made,as the law in force becomes part of the agreement and the contract will be construed in the light of such law.dolman,at interpreting the term condemnation found within a lease agreement based on the new york city administrative code see also mayo royal ins.of,construing settlement stipulation not to allow recovery over in view of state statutory limit.
the bankruptcy court sought to apply new york doctrine to the junior indenture agreements.it first stated that it considered this court prior account of new york law,which we explained did not include a version of the rule of explicitness,to be dicta.bnec v,at.it then looked to determine the substantive law in effect at the time the agreements were executed,analyzing the common law of england,which new york adopted as its own common law,as related to insolvency proceedings.id.at.the court concluded 
based upon this authority,i am convinced and hold that,under the law of new york,interest on an obligation ceases upon the filing of an insolvency proceeding of whatever nature by the obligor.this appears to have been the law of new york for so long that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.
the senior trustee argues that the bankruptcy court erred by dismissing as dicta this court previous conclusion that new york law does not include an analog to the rule of explicitness.it also claims that the bankruptcy court applied bankruptcy specific new york and english law,rather than general principles of new york contract law.lastly,it argues that,in reality,the bankruptcy court holding did little to resolve the controversy because it simply concerned the obligations of the debtor in bankruptcy namely,that a debtor is not responsible for paying interest a principle of law neither side disputes and not the subordination rights of senior creditors as compared to junior creditors.
although the bankruptcy court analysis appears somewhat contradictory at times,nonetheless we need not credit it,as,in the end,the discussion was unnecessary to the holding.as we explain below,the bankruptcy court factual findings as to the intent of the parties were sufficient in themselves to support the conclusion that the parties did not intend to subordinate the junior noteholders to interest.
in accordance with new york law,the parties intended meaning of an ambiguous term found in an agreement is to be ascertained in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances,tobin union news,based upon the credibility of the extrinsic evidence or on a choice among reasonable inferences to be drawn from it,williams brosnahan,internal marks and citation omitted.a court may accept any available extrinsic evidence to ascertain the meaning intended by the parties during the formation of the contract.morgan stanley grp.new eng.ins,cir quoting alexander alexander servs.v.these certain underwriters at lloyd,london,cir.the varieties of extrinsic evidence that may demonstrate circumstances surrounding formation of the contract are as limitless as are the types of circumstances.margaret kniffin,corbin on contracts joseph perillo,ed.indeed,dictionaries,treatises,articles,and other published materials created by strangers to the dispute are entirely appropriate for use in contract cases as interpretive aids.in re envirodyne indus,cir quoted in corbin on contracts.only if the extrinsic evidence supplied is conclusory or unable to resolve the ambiguity will the meaning of the term remain a question of law for the court.new york home indem.

here,the bankruptcy court engaged in substantial and determined that the parties to the subordination agreements did not intend to subordinate the junior debt to interest accrued on the senior debt.although the bankruptcy court acknowledged that no party actually involved in the drafting of the junior indentures was located to testify,the court relied on several other pieces of evidence to support its conclusion.see bnec v,at.the court heard direct testimonial evidence from john cashin,the senior trust officer who headed the trust department at chemical bank delaware,the original indenture trustee under the junior indenture,and who executed the junior indenture.see id.at.although his function was only to comment on the duties of the trustee,he testified that it was the bank position that senior noteholders would be entitled to interest and principal due to the senior holders up to and including the petition,but not interest.id.quoting cashin testimony.
the court also heard from the junior trustees corporate trust expert,james gadsden,a practicing attorney with years of experience in the debt securities market and whose testimony added substantially to the picture of what was going on in this field in the period.id.at.gadsden testified that participants in the debt securities market during the understood that a debtor obligation to pay interest on unsecured debt ceased upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition,and that a junior creditor subordination obligations were coextensive with that of the debtor unless the subordination agreements explicitly stated otherwise.id.at.he explained that you needed to convey to the person who was going to acquire the subordinated debt that the rule that interest on the senior indebtedness would cease on the bankruptcy case was not going to apply.id.at quoting gadsden testimony.
