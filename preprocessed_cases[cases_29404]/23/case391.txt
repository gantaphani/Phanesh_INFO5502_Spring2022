state revenue agents entered property rented by tax debtor john bleavins and seized several trailers.bleavins then filed a civil rights action in state court in which he alleged a violation of his rights under the fourth amendment.the defendants removed the case to the district court.the district court ruled for bleavins on liability,and he received an award following trial on damages.the defendants appealed,and we reversed the district court judgment.on remand,the district court determined that the defendants had not violated bleavins fourth amendment rights and,in the alternative,that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.bleavins appeals that determination.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
we have detailed previously the facts of this case in bleavins bartels bleavins i,cir,and briefly recount them here.in,the state of illinois determined that bleavins owed more than in back taxes.the illinois department of revenue idor began the process of administrative seizure.see ilcs.in preparation,idor employee roger bay surveyed the land surrounding bleavins property in january.during his inspection,bay did not enter the property he used binoculars to observe the site from fifty to seventy yards away.he saw two boats,a pickup truck and two flatbed trailer and one that included a container housing bleavins tools the tool trailer bay recorded the vehicles license plate numbers,sketched the site and filled out a seizure checklist,all of which he provided to fellow employee joel bartels.in may,bartels issued an administrative warrant listing the boats as property to be seized.
bartels,bay and vernon mcgregor the defendants or the state,together with several macon county sheriff deputies,proceeded to bleavins house to execute the warrant.the group entered bleavins property mcgregor determined that they would not be able to seize the boats without damaging them.over bleavins objection,mcgregor then directed the deputies to seize instead the flatbed and tool trailers.
bleavins later brought an action in state court for the return of his trailers,which had not been described in the warrant.the state court ordered the return of his property.bleavins then filed,in state court,a civil rights action against the defendants.he alleged that they had violated his rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the united states.
district court proceedings 
the defendants,bartels,bay and mcgregor,removed the case to the district court.see a.the district court rejected the defendants claims of qualified immunity and granted summary judgment to bleavins on liability.after a trial on damages,a jury awarded bleavins.the defendants appealed,arguing that the seizure of bleavins trailers did not violate the fourth amendment and that the district court had erred in determining that they were not entitled to qualified immunity.
after withdrawing an initial opinion and granting a rehearing,we invited the parties to address two particular issues whether the warrant at issue was a valid fourth amendment warrant and whether the seized trailers were located within the curtilage of bleavins home.the defendants conceded that the administrative warrant did not meet the requirements of the fourth amendment.we therefore noted that,absent a valid warrant,the defendants would have violated the amendment if bleavins had a legitimate privacy interest in the area in which the trailers were seized.see leasing united states,d in particular,we noted that if the seized trailers were located within the curtilage of bleavins home,appellants warrantless entry into the area would constitute a violation of bleavins fourth amendment rights.bleavins i,at.
the parties disputed whether the trailers were within or outside the curtilage of bleavins home.because the issue potentially impacted both the fourth amendment claim and the qualified immunity defense and because the district court had made no factual finding on the issue,we remanded the case to the district court to consider whether the trailers which were seized were located within the curtilage of bleavins home and,if they were,whether appellants could have reasonably believed that the area was not curtilage.id.at.
on remand,the parties entered stipulations about the layout of bleavins property and introduced additional evidence,including photos of bleavins property and a sketch of the property as it appeared in.see appendix a,infra.according to this evidence,bleavins property was bounded to the north by william street road and to the south by a creek.fencing surrounded the property on all four sides.a only entrance to the from north to south,from william street road past bleavins home a sign reading private property keep out was posted at the driveway entrance.south of bleavins residence was a field,and a three or internal fence separated this field from the rest of the property.it is in this field that bleavins stored his trailers,together with the boats and a truck.the trailers were seized from this field.the photos depict the property as it appeared at the time of this action,not as it appeared in.they indicate that the property is surrounded by foliage bleavins concedes that the pictures demonstrate more extensive foliage than existed in,and the parties dispute the extent of tree cover during bay wintertime observation of the field.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court first considered the curtilage question.it analyzed the south field according to the four factors identified in united states dunn,d.although the field was relatively close to bleavins house and was fenced,the fence size and construction did not shield items in the field from view.given the inadequacy of the fence,along with the field apparent use only for storage and the relatively unimpeded view from the north street into the field,the district court held that the field was not curtilage for purposes of fourth amendment privacy considerations.
the district court then determined,in the alternative,that the agents were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court based this conclusion primarily on the apparent of bleavins submissions.at any rate,it determined that the nature of the curtilage inquiry precluded bleavins from meeting his burden under the second element of qualified immunity because it was not clear that a reasonable agent in would have understood that his conduct constituted a violation.

qualified immunity 
we first consider whether the defendants enjoy qualified immunity.see anderson creighton,d.this doctrine shields a government actor from further litigation unless the plaintiff can demonstrate the violation of a constitutional right that is clearly established at the time of the violation,so that a reasonable public official would have known that his conduct was unlawful.sonnleitner york,cir see saucier katz,d.as often occurs in these cases,our inquiry into the first prong of the qualified immunity paradigm requires that we assess the constitutional issue at the heart of the plaintiff case.see allison snyder,cir.
the fourth amendment,applied to the states by the fourteenth amendment,mapp ohio,d,provides that t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,const.amend.iv.in katz united states,d,and its progeny,the supreme court rejected a approach to the fourth amendment.siebert severino,cir.the touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness.florida jimeno,d.
nevertheless,a important in evaluating privacy interests.see united states hedrick,cir t he supreme court continues to discuss the protection accorded the curtilage even though it has rejected the notion that property law defines the contours of fourth amendment protection.the importance of curtilage stems from the particularly important protections that the fourth amendment affords to homes 
at the very core of the fourth amendment stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.silverman united states,d.with few exceptions,the question whether a warrantless search of a home is reasonable and hence constitutional must be answered no.see illinois rodriguez,d payton new york,d.
kyllo united states,d.this constitutional protection is not limited to the residence structure both a home and the home,the area outside the home itself but so close to and intimately connected with the home and the activities that normally go on there that it can reasonably be considered part of the within the scope of the fourth amendment protection.siebert,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also oliver united states,d t he conception defining the the area around the home to which the activity of home life a familiar one easily understood from our daily experience.a warrantless search of a home curtilage implicates the very core of the fourth amendment and presumptively is unreasonable.see payton,at.leaf shelnutt,cir hedrick,at describing curtilage as the area in which privacy expectations are most heightened.
these considerations prompted us to remand this case to the district court to determine whether the field in which bleavins stored his seized trailers constituted the curtilage of his home.the supreme court addressed the standard for this determination in dunn.it identified four factors to consider the proximity of the area in question to the home whether the area is included in an enclosure surrounding the home how the owner uses the area and the measures taken to protect the area from observation.dunn,at.we shall discuss each of these factors.
dunn first requires us to consider the proximity of the field to bleavins residence.the stipulated diagram,which does not appear to be drawn to scale,indicates that bleavins house generally occupies the northwest corner of the property,and the field generally encompasses the southern half.a notation describes the span of bleavins property,from north to south,as approximately feet.we know that the south field is less than feet from the home and that the shop tool shed lies between the home and the field,but we can not determine the actual distance between the field and bleavins residence.bleavins claimed before the district court that the south field is feet from the home but,as the district court noted,there is no other evidence in the record to confirm his assertion.
we have,at any rate,resisted on the proximity prong of dunn,standing alone.attempts to establish distance tests with respect to this prong are an exercise in futility.this first dunn factor tends to be very,and its significance is highly dependent on other factors while it is true that we have found that privacy expectations are most heightened when the area in question is near within feet to the home,the proximity to the home,standing by itself,does not per se,suffice to establish an area as within the curtilage.united states french,cir.on the state of the record,we can not determine with any certainty the proximity of the field to bleavins home and thus turn to consideration of the other dunn factors.see united states gerard,cir neither party included in its brief the proximity of the garage to the farm house the distance alone,however,is not determinative that the garage should be treated as an adjunct of the house.
we next consider whether the south field is located in an enclosure surrounding the home.bleavins points out that the south field is enclosed by the fence surrounding his entire property,an enclosure that includes his home.the state notes,however,that the field is further separated from the home by an internal fence and thus is contained in an enclosure separate from that of the residence.
there is no rule to assess the significance of external and internal fencing the supreme court in dunn pointedly rejected an argument that a home curtilage should extend no farther than the nearest fence surrounding a fenced house.dunn,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.instead,it adopted the balancing test.nevertheless,f encing considerations are important factors in defining the curtilage.id.
bleavins property is surrounded by a single enclosure,but interior fencing further demarcates areas within the property.for example,it appears that the area south of bleavins garage is separately demarcated.more importantly,a gated fence separates the south field from the area containing bleavins home,shop tool shed and garage.typically,the enclosure factor weighs against those who claim infringement of the curtilage when their land is divided into separate parts by internal fencing.united states reilly,cir.in this case,the internal fence serves to demark a specific area of land immediately adjacent to the house that is readily identifiable as part and parcel of the house,dunn,at,that is,the area containing the home,garage and shop tool shed.areas outside of this demarcation,including the south field,are not within the enclosure surrounding the home.see gerard,at united states breza,cir united states johnson,cir en banc.the interior fence separating the south field from bleavins living area thus indicates strongly that the field is not part of the curtilage.
we next consider how bleavins used the field curtilage is afforded special protection only because it is an area so close to and intimately connected with the home and the activities that normally go on there.siebert,at.
areas that are intimately connected with the activities of the home include,for example,backyards.see french,at hedrick,at see also united states carter,cir.bleavins does not argue that the south field is a backyard,and it is apparent that bleavins primarily used the south field for parking and storage.these uses were related both to bleavins leisure activities storing his pontoon boat and to his activities storing his tool trailer,but none of these uses are intimately associated with the home.see,palmieri lynch,cir finding an area to be curtilage because,among other things,it was strewn with children toys and other items of a domestic nature.this conclusion is bolstered by the fact that bleavins property contains a separate garage that is included in the enclosure surrounding his home,presumably intended for parking and storage activities of a domestic nature.
finally,dunn instructs us to consider whether the south field was visible to and the measures that bleavins took to shield it from view.
we begin with the uncontested facts.bleavins does not dispute that bay was able to view the lot from a public vantage point,william street road,by looking south through his property and that the agent could identify license plate numbers on vehicles parked in the field.apart from a private property sign,which does nothing to prevent observation,there is no gate or other obstruction that would prevent an individual in a public area from looking across bleavins driveway and viewing the south field.the interior fence demarcating the south field is chain link,only three to four feet high,and thus presents no barrier to observation.the fence enclosing the entirety of bleavins property is four feet high,at various places composed of woven wire,chain link or single strand horse fence,and by itself does not impede observation.the southernmost border of bleavins land was demarcated by a creek.in,an observer could only view the field from the west by entering a neighbor property and from the east by entering a fenced pasture that bleavins rented for his horse.the parties further agree that trees and shrubbery surround bleavins property,and photographs entered on stipulation by the parties indicate that foliage all but obscures the property from view.however,they dispute the amount of cove
