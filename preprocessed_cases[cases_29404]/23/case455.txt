background 
over a period,christine mayfield worked first as an accountant,then as the company controller,and finally as the company treasurer for watson.mayfield duties during her employment with watson included bookkeeping and accounting functions,purchasing,payroll,accounts payable,billing,and reconciling the corporate checking account.to carry out her duties,mayfield received authority to act as a fiduciary of watson and to write checks on funds in watson corporate checking account.watson placed no restrictions or dollar limitations regarding mayfield authority to sign checks.mayfield was solely responsible for reconciling the company checkbook register with the bank statements.although watson received monthly bank statements with cancelled checks,carol watson,one of watson owners,delivered the unopened bank statements to mayfield but never reviewed the bank statements or reconciled the checking account during mayfield tenure at watson.mayfield had unsupervised responsibility for issuing,coding,and accounting for manual checks.manual checks were typed by mayfield for cash on delivery purchases or when an employee was terminated outside of the regular pay cycle.
mayfield husband,an american express account holder,added mayfield name to his account in,the year mayfield began working for watson.from august through october,mayfield manually wrote approximately to checks on watson corporate checking account payable to american express for her or her husband personal debt.the total dollar value of these checks was at the top of each check was printed the caption watson coatings,box,louis,missouri.neither mayfield name nor her husband name was printed on any of the checks.each of the checks was made payable to the order of american express and for credit to the american express account of mayfield husband.american express credited the account of mayfield husband with each payment drawn on watson account,thereby reducing her husband obligation to american express and allowing her husband to continue to incur additional charges consistent with american express card agreement.watson never had an account with american express.
watson informed american express of mayfield fraud after mayfield employment with watson ended.according to paul carey,supervisor of legal and custodial relations at american express,during the period in which mayfield drew watson checks,american express did not have actual knowledge of her fiduciary status with watson,meaning it did not know that she was empowered to draw checks on watson account and that she was employed by watson as its controller.
watson filed a petition in a missouri circuit court,seeking a judgment against american express on theories of money had and received and unjust enrichment.american express subsequently removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri.watson then amended its complaint,adding a claim of acceptance of funds paid in breach of fiduciary duty pursuant to of the missouri revised statutes.the district court granted american express motion for summary judgment.watson filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
watson raises three arguments on appeal that genuine issues of material fact exist as to american express liability under missouri ufl that american express can not qualify as a holder in due course because it is a payee or because it fails to meet the requirement of good faith and that the ufl and the uniform commercial code ucc do not displace watson common law claims of money had and received and unjust enrichment.
uniform fiduciaries law 
watson first argues that genuine issues of material fact exist as to american express liability under the ufl.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.nunley of justice,cir.
the ufl is the missouri codification of the uniform fiduciaries act,which alters the common law with respect to the duties of parties who deal with fiduciaries.in re lauer,cir citing trenton trust western sur,en banc.the ufl purpose is to reliev e banks of their common law duty of inquiring into the propriety of each transaction conducted by a fiduciary and to prevent banks and others who typically deal with fiduciaries from being held liable for a fiduciary breach of duty absent either actual knowledge of the breach or knowledge of sufficient facts to constitute bad faith.id.at citing trenton,at.
the ufl provision applicable to the present case states 
if a check or other bill of exchange is drawn by a fiduciary as such,or in the name of his principal by a fiduciary empowered to draw such instrument in the name of his principal,the payee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the instrument,and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that this action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.if,however,such instrument is payable to a personal creditor of the fiduciary and delivered to the creditor in payment of or as security for a personal debt of the fiduciary to the actual knowledge of the creditor,or is drawn and delivered in any transaction known by the payee to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary,the creditor or other payee is liable to the principal if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the instrument 
emphasis added see also unif.fiduciaries act.under the first sentence of the statute,watson asserts that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether american express acted in bad faith in violation of the ufl when it took checks drawn on watson corporate checking account as payment for the personal debt of mayfield and her husband.in response,american express argues that it did not take the checks knowing facts that would support a finding.
watson also contends that,under the second sentence of the statute,a genuine issue of material fact exists whether american express had actual knowledge that the checks mayfield wrote were for mayfield personal debt or for her personal benefit.american express maintains that no evidence exists that it had actual knowledge that the checks were written by mayfield,a fiduciary,in payment of her personal debt or for her personal benefit.
the ufl does not define bad faith however,it does define good faith.trenton,at.good faith means that the act is in fact done honestly,whether it be done negligently or not.id.quoting.m ere negligence is insufficient to amount to bad faith.however,it is not entirely accurate to equate bad faith with dishonesty,if the latter term is taken to denote a high degree of moral guilt,or evil motives.id.the test of bad faith is whether it is commercially unjustifiable for the person accepting a negotiable instrument to disregard and refuse to learn facts readily available.where circumstances suggestive of the fiduciary breach become sufficiently obvious it is bad faith to remain passive.id.explaining that the term bad faith in the ufl is borrowed from the uniform negotiable instruments act.
to establish bad faith,watson had to show american express knew or disregarded knowledge that mayfield was bre
