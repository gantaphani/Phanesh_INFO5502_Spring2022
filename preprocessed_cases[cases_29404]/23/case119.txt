morgan chase bank morgan,bank,or appellant filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york before judge harold baer seeking a judgment declaring that certain funds held in a collection account in the bank belonged to it.appellee altos hornos de mexico,de altos hornos,debtor,or appellee,a mexican steel manufacturer,had borrowed million from a consortium of banks led by morgan,which also managed the collection account for receiving the loan payments.three altos hornos customers made payments directly into this collection account at the bank.matters proceeded in the normal course until altos hornos filed for bankruptcy in mexico,at which point the funds in the collection account became the subject of the instant litigation.the debtor moved to dismiss the bank complaint on grounds of international comity,asking the federal court in new york to defer to the bankruptcy court in mexico.the district court granted that motion to dismiss.morgan appeals.
on this appeal we are asked to clarify the scope of our holding in koreag,controle et revision refco,in re koreag,cir,where we ruled that the ownership of property a debtor claims as part of its estate in a foreign bankruptcy proceeding is a question antecedent to the distributive rules of bankruptcy.local courts may resolve the question because international comity does not require deference to the parallel foreign bankruptcy proceeding in such circumstances.id.at.the rule announced in koreag,however,only applies to disputes that present a bona fide question of property ownership.it has no application to disputes like this one where a bankruptcy creditor claims to own assets but has a contractual obligation to use those assets to pay down the same debt that is the subject of a foreign bankruptcy proceeding.in such a case,local courts are displaced and must defer to the foreign proceeding.we therefore affirm the district court order dismissing appellant complaint on international comity grounds.
background 
a.the loan and security agreements 
on april,appellee altos hornos de mexico,de of mexico largest steel a loan agreement with morgan and a consortium of other banks under which the banks agreed to loan altos hornos a total of million to pay off a preexisting loan by morgan to altos hornos and to fund altos hornos ongoing operations.morgan was also designated as the facility agent,meaning that it established and managed a collection account into which certain payments would be made and from which morgan would distribute funds to the other consortium members.
according to the terms of the loan agreement,morgan established the collection account in its own name at its office in new york.it had exclusive power to withdraw funds from the account,but only for specified purposes in the following priority to cover its own expenses and fees,to pay interest and principal on the loan to itself and other consortium members,and to refund any surplus funds to altos hornos.
like most contracts,the loan agreement contained forum selection and choice of law clauses under which the parties agreed that new york law would govern any disputes and that the united states district court for the southern district of new york or any new york state court in new york city were acceptable forums.the debtor also irrevocably waive d,to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,any claim that any action or proceeding commenced by the facility agent should be dismissed or stayed by reason,or pending the resolution,of any action or proceeding commenced by the debtor relating in any way to this agreement whether or not commenced earlier.
the parties entered into a security agreement on the same day they concluded the loan agreement.under the security agreement,altos hornos assigned its right to payment from three of its handelsunion ag,kloeckner.ag,and ferrostaal morgan for deposit in the collection account.these payments were collateral security for the prompt payment in full when due of the secured obligations,and effectively required each of the three customers to make deposits directly into the collection account as payment on the debtor loan.any payments the three customers mistakenly made to altos hornos were to be turned over to morgan for deposit in the collection account as soon as possible,and in the meantime were to be held by the debtor in trust for and as the property of the facility agent morgan and shall not be commingled with any other funds or property of the debtor.
altos hornos enters suspension de pagos 
altos hornos defaulted on its loan in april,and the following month it filed for suspension de pagos suspension of payments sop in a mexican civil court.much like chapter reorganization in the united states,sop is a judicial order authorized under mexican law that allows a debtor to suspend payments to its creditors and continue normal operations until such time as the debtor and creditors,under the auspices of the court,reorganize the debt.the mexican court granted altos hornos petition and issued the sop order.morgan,for itself and on behalf of the other consortium banks,appeared before the mexican court to acknowledge its claim as secured creditors for the remaining balance on the loan,which included in principal and in interest.the mexican court acknowledged the consortium claims but ruled that morgan and the other banks were general unsecured creditors because the debtor agreement to permit three of its customers to pay directly into the collection account was an assignment rather than collateral and thus did not qualify the banks as secured creditors under mexican law.both morgan and altos hornos appealed this ruling,and the mexican appellate court denied both appeals in february.morgan took an appeal to the mexican federal court,which reversed the lower courts in january and held that the consortium banks are secured creditors to date,altos hornos continues to operate in suspension de pagos and has not resumed payment on its debt.
c.the dispute over funds in the collection account 
during the summer of,following the mexican court sop declaration,the three customers of the debtor that had agreed to pay directly into the collection account continued to do so.their payments totaled approximately million,from which the bank withdrew for payment of its legal fees and expenses in connection with its participation in the sop proceeding.according to the record before us,no further payments or deductions have been made and the account has been inactive since january.
in december altos hornos petitioned the mexican court to summon morgan to return the million and to issue a letter rogatory to a new york court requesting assistance in enforcing the summons.the debtor sought this remedy to prevent the bank from collecting part of the debt outside the sop proceeding.the bank opposed the debtor motion on the ground that the mexican court lacked jurisdiction to consider altos hornos petition.the mexican court deferred decision on the debtor motion pending resolution of the parties appeals related to the acknowledgment of morgan claim,and thus made no decision regarding its jurisdiction or the ownership of the assets.
proceedings below 
on march,the bank filed suit in the southern district of new york seeking a declaration that it owned the funds in the collection account.altos hornos moved to dismiss because,inter alia,principles of international comity counsel a court to abstain from deciding such questions and to defer to a pending foreign bankruptcy proceeding.in an opinion and order dated january,the district court granted the debtor motion to dismiss.jp morgan chase bank altos hornos de mexico,civ,wl,at.the district court found the issue of who owns the collection account was implicitly raised by altos hornos before the mexican court and that mexican law does not dictate one way or the other where the dispute must be decided.id.at.it further ruled that the choice of law and forum selection clauses in the loan agreement would not control where international comity warranted abstention.id.at.and,it concluded that because the issue had been raised before the mexican court,and that court had jurisdiction to decide the question,international comity required the district court to abstain and allow the issue to be resolved in the mexican proceedings.id.at.morgan appeals from this order.
discussion 
morgan raises three issues on appeal.it contends the district court erred,first,in finding that the ownership issue had been raised before a mexican court with jurisdiction to hear the claim second,in finding that international comity justifies abstention in this case and third,in refusing to honor the loan agreement choice of law and forum selection clauses.we agree with the bank that the trial court analysis was not entirely correct,although we think it reached the proper result.in our view,appellant first claim of error is irrelevant to our decision,and we are unpersuaded by the bank second and third claims of error.
i standard of review 
declining to decide a question of law on the basis of international comity is a form of abstention,and we review a district court decision to abstain on international comity grounds for abuse of discretion.see,finanz ag zurich banco economico,cir allstate life ins.linter group,cir.we recognize that in other abstention cases involving the doctrine and some forms of domestic abstention,we apply a somewhat more rigorous standard of review than abuse of discretion that approaches de novo review.see hartford courant pellegrino,cir bigio,cir hachamovitch debuono,cir.because our international comity abstention cases rely on the abuse of discretion standard,we apply that standard in this case.of course,in evaluating the district court exercise of discretion,we review its conclusions of law de novo.sheerbonnet,am.express bank,cir.
ii international comity 
a.a brief review of its origins 
international comity has been described by the supreme court as the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative,executive or judicial acts of another nation,having due regard both to international duty and convenience,and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.hilton guyot.the doctrine has never been,leading one scholar to pronounce it an amorphous land whose borders are marked by fuzzy lines of politics,courtesy,and good faith.harold maier,extraterritorial jurisdiction at a crossroads an intersection between public and private international law,am.int l.
whatever its precise contours,international comity is clearly concerned with maintaining amicable working relationships between nations,a shorthand for good neighbourliness,common courtesy and mutual respect between those who labour in adjoining judicial vineyards.british airways bd.laker airways.we have stated that the doctrine is not an imperative obligation of courts but rather is a discretionary rule of practice,convenience,and expediency.pravin banker,banco popular del peru,cir quoting somportex phila.chewing gum,cir.
scholars trace the origins of international comity to the emergence of the in europe and the corresponding rise in international commerce.see joel paul,comity in international law,harv.int l.the doctrine as we know it developed from the writings of century dutch scholars,including paul and john voet and ulrich huber,id.at,and was imported into english common law by lord mansfield,who refined the doctrine to exclude deference to foreign law in cases where the plaintiff claim is not allowed or approved by the law of england.id.at quoting somerset stewart,eng,as reprinted in robert cover,justice accused.lord mansfield used this interpretation of comity to order the release of an slave held on board ship in england.id.at.
justice joseph story introduced the doctrine to american jurisprudence,primarily as a means of reconciling the competing laws of free and slave states with respect to fugitive slaves by allowing each state a principled way to accommodate and,if necessary,avoid the law of the others.id.at.story opined that comity between nations is appropriate due to mutual interest and utility,joseph story,commentaries on the conflict of laws ed,even if it is an imperfect obligation that can not be reduced to any certain rule.id,quoting saul his creditors,mart.story also shared lord mansfield view that comity should not be extended to contradict the forum state law or policy.see id.the supreme court expressly adopted justice story views,first in bank of augusta earle,pet.citing story for the proposition that comity,as part of the voluntary law of nations,promote s justice between individuals and a friendly intercourse between the sovereignties to which they belong but is inadmissible when contrary to the forum state policy,or prejudicial to its interests,and,most famously,in hilton guyot,at,discussed above.
international comity and foreign bankruptcy proceedings 
international comity,as it relates to this case,involves not the choice of law but rather the discretion of a national court to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a case before it when that case is pending in a foreign court with proper jurisdiction.see maxwell communication societe generale in re maxwell communication,cir.we have repeatedly held that courts should ordinarily decline to adjudicate creditor claims that are the subject of a foreign bankruptcy proceeding.since t he equitable and orderly distribution of a debtor property requires assembling all claims against the limited assets in a single proceeding,american courts regularly defer to such actions.finanz ag,at quoting victrix,salen dry cargo,cir allstate life ins,at.in such cases,deference to the foreign court is appropriate so long as the foreign proceedings are procedurally fair and consistent with the principles of lord mansfield holding do not contravene the laws or public policy of the united states.cunard salen reefer servs.ab,cir.
iii the koreag exception 
we identified a limited exception to this rule in koreag.in koreag,the debtor,a swiss bank known as mebco,had a currency exchange contract with a new york currency trading corporation known as refco.under the terms of the contract,refco deposited currency in a bank account in new york and mebco agreed to exchange the deposited funds for foreign currency.refco deposited over million dollars in the mebco account,but mebco failed to perform the required exchange into foreign currency and instead declared bankruptcy in switzerland.see id.at.the swiss bankruptcy court appointed koreag as mebco liquidator.
refco brought suit against mebco in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and claimed ownership of the million it had previously deposited in mebco account.see id.at.refco argued that because it never received mebco corresponding payment of foreign currency,mebco had no right to the funds that had been advanced to it.koreag intervened as mebco and moved to dismiss on international comity grounds.the district court did not dismiss or decide refco claim,but instead determined that the case should be addressed in a turnover proceeding pursuant to b.koreag,at.
koreag subsequently brought such an action in a united states bankruptcy court seeking a turnover of the assets in mebco new york bank account as property of mebco estate under b and sought summary judgment.koreag,at.the bankruptcy court granted koreag motion for summary judgment it held that international comity warranted turning over all disputed assets to koreag for distribution in the swiss bankruptcy proceeding and therefore declined to reach the threshold ownership issue.id.at.the district court consolidated refco suit and its appeal from the bankruptcy court judgment and affirmed.
we vacated the district court order and remanded for reconsideration,holding that disputes with respect to the ownership of assets do not always implicate the concerns that ordinarily require international comity abstention in foreign bankruptcy proceedings.we stated 
property interests have an independent legal source,antecedent to the distributive rules of bankruptcy administration,that determines in the first instance the interests of claimant parties in particular property.it logically follow
