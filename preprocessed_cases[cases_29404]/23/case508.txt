appellants urge error in the district court grant of summary judgment rejecting student borrowers claims that challenge loan servicer methods of calculating interest,assessing late fees and setting the repayment start date on their loans.we must determine the preemptive scope of the statutes and regulations governing lenders and loan servicers under the federal family education loan program of the higher education act.we conclude that the student borrowers claims are preempted by this federal law and we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on that ground.
the higher education act hea of,now codified at,was passed to keep the college door open to all students of ability,regardless of socioeconomic background.rowe educ.credit mgmt,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as part of that effort,congress established the federal family education loan program ffelp,a system of loan guarantees meant to encourage lenders to loan money to students and their parents on favorable terms see rowe,at.the secretary of the department of education doe is authorized to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the ffelp.a.under that authority,the doe has promulgated detailed regulations.see.we preliminarily review how the ffelp operates,and thereafter explain the procedural history of this case.
the ffelp regulates a series of transactions related to student loans.the first layer of transactions occurs between lenders and student or parent borrowers.eligible banks,credit unions,schools,government agencies,and others may make loans to students.a.the lenders must abide by the terms of the ffelp,and the doe may terminate the participation of any lender who does not follow the rules.lenders may assign their loans to loan servicers,in which case the loan servicer must also abide by the ffelp regulations.see a,a.
a second layer of ffelp transactions involves guaranty agencies that guarantee the lenders loans.a guaranty agency is a state or private nonprofit organization that has an agreement with the secretary under which it will administer a loan guarantee program under the act.b see also requiring that a guarantee agency enter into four specific agreements with the doe before it may participate in the ffelp.when a borrower defaults on his or her student loan and the lender is unable to recover the amount despite due diligence,the lender recoups its loss from the guarantor.e if a borrower defaults on a loan,the guarantor reimburses the lender for the amount of its loss.the guarantor then collects the amount owed from the borrower.
a third level of ffelp transactions takes place between the guaranty agencies and the doe.guaranty agencies must enter agreements with the doe in order to participate in the ffelp.c.after an agreement is entered,the doe acts as a secondary insurer on the loans guaranteed by the agency.a d,c.when a lender assigns its guaranty agency a defaulted loan,the guaranty agency must take diligent steps to recover the default amount,but,having done so,may then recover up to one hundred percent of its losses from the doe if it is unable to collect the debt.a,b.
the ffelp governs four types of loans.three of these are at issue in this appeal first,stafford loans are made to students,c,and may be either subsidized or unsubsidized.for subsidized stafford loans,the government pays interest on the loan during specified periods,such as when the student borrower is attending school on at least a basis.a b.for unsubsidized stafford loans,the student is responsible for all accrued interest from the time the loan is disbursed and the government pays none of it.e.the second type of loan here involved is a consolidation loan,which allows the borrower to consolidate multiple loan obligations with one lender.see a.the third type of loan falls under the supplemental loans to students program,which applied to periods of student enrollment beginning before july,and has since been discontinued.a.
congress directs the doe to issue common application forms and promissory notes to be used by ffelp participants.m.these common forms include a free application form,master promissory note,and common loan deferment form.id.the purpose of the common forms is to standardize the terms and formatting to help applicants understand their loan obligations.id.m b.
the plaintiffs in this diversity chae,william coakley,hoon koo,and carlos out stafford,supplemental,and consolidated loans from various lenders between and.sallie mae,sallie mae was the loan servicer for each of the plaintiffs loans in its capacity as a servicer,sallie mae performed administrative and servicing functions related to the loans,such as issuing billing statements,collecting and processing payments,assessing and collecting late fees,and giving notices to borrowers required by ffelp regulations.
the plaintiffs sued sallie mae,on behalf of a purported class of borrowers,complaining about three practices sallie mae uses in servicing student loans.first,the plaintiffs challenge sallie mae use of the daily simple interest or simple daily interest method of calculating interest.this calculation method applies a borrower payment on the date the payment is received,not the date the payment is due,such that interest accrues based on the number of days since the last payment.this means that borrowers who make payments before the due date pay less overall interest,while borrowers who make payments after the due date pay more overall interest.the plaintiffs claim that the terms of the loan agreements prevent sallie mae from using the daily simple method of calculating interest.instead,the plaintiffs allege that their loan contracts require sallie mae to use the installment method.under the installment method,the total amount of interest is fixed and does not vary depending on the date when payment is remitted.the plaintiffs in their complaint asserted that sallie mae failure to use the installment method conflicts with the ffelp statutes and regulations,offends the terms of the loan documents and otherwise violates california law.
second,the plaintiffs challenge sallie mae practice of assessing late fees.when permitted by the borrower promissory note,sallie mae charges a late fee of up to six percent of each installment remitted more than fifteen days after it is due.the plaintiffs allege that california law prohibits sallie mae from charging late fees,at least where sallie mae also charges daily simple interest.
third,the plaintiffs challenge sallie mae method of setting the first repayment date on a consolidation or plus loan.sallie mae charges interest on these loans from the day they are disbursed and sets the borrower first repayment date within sixty days after disbursement.because sallie mae charges interest during that period of up to sixty days,the plaintiffs argue that sallie mae deceptively increases the cost and life span of the loan.
all told,the plaintiffs allege and have argued that sallie mae practices violate california business,contract,and law they request actual and punitive damages,restitution,and injunctive relief to prevent sallie mae from employing the challenged practices in the future.the united states filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff seeking a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs state law claims were preempted by federal law.the district court granted the united states motion.the parties then moved for summary judgment in whole or in part,and the plaintiffs also moved to certify the class.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of sallie mae.it held that all the plaintiffs claims were preempted by the hea,and alternatively held that each claim failed on the merits.the district court dismissed the remaining motions as moot and entered judgment in favor of sallie mae.the plaintiffs timely appealed.

the supremacy clause of the constitution provides that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi,cl.consistent with that command,the united states supreme court has recognized that state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.altria group,good,d quoting maryland louisiana,d.we have succinctly delineated the supreme court principles,holding federal preemption occurs when congress enacts a statute that explicitly state law state law actually conflicts with federal law or federal law occupies a legislative field to such an extent that it is reasonable to conclude that congress left no room for state regulation in that field.tocher city of santa ana,cir,abrogated on other grounds by city of columbus ours garage wrecker,d see also crosby foreign trade council,d discussing express,conflict,and field preemption cipollone liggett group,d same.
turning now to the issues before us,we have previously held that field preemption does not apply to the hea.see keams tempe technical,cir it is apparent that congress expected state law to operate in much of the field in which it was legislating.accord armstrong accrediting council for continuing educ.and training,affirming prior holding that federal education policy regarding private lending to students is not so extensive as to occupy the field.accordingly,under our precedent field preemption is off the table to resolve this case involving the hea and its attendant federal regulations.the legal standards governing express preemption and conflict preemption are the standards that control our decision.
we focus first on the law of express preemption.the supreme court has made clear that congress may indicate its intent to displace state law through express language.altria group.at.where congress enacts an express preemption provision,our task is to interpret the provision and identify the domain expressly by that language.medtronic,lohr,d internal quotation marks omitted.we use the text of the provision,the surrounding statutory framework,and congress stated purposes in enacting the statute to determine the proper scope of an express preemption provision.id.at cipollone,at.
congress has enacted several express preemption provisions applicable to ffelp participants.see,d,a b,b,a.these provisions expressly preempt the operation of state usury laws,statutes of limitations,limitations on recovering the costs of debt collection,infancy defenses to contract liability,wage garnishment limitations,and disclosure requirements.this last provision,is entitled,exemption from state disclosure requirements.the text of the statute reads loans made,insured,or guaranteed pursuant to a program authorized by title iv of the higher education act shall not be subject to any disclosure requirements of any state law.id.the ffelp falls within title iv of the hea,and is thus subject to its express preemption provision.
we conclude that applies to,and thus precludes,several of the plaintiffs state law claims.two of the plaintiffs unfair competition law claims allege that sallie mae employs unfair and fraudulent business practices by using billing statements and coupon books that trick borrowers into thinking that interest is being calculated via the installment method when sallie mae really uses a simple daily calculation.see cal.bus.a similar allegation concerns sallie mae practice of using statements that set the first repayment date.under california consumer legal remedies act,the plaintiffs allege that the billing statements and standardized loan applications misrepresent that the student loans confer rights,remedies,and obligations which do not exist,thereby constituting an unfair or deceptive practice.see cal.a.
at bottom,the plaintiffs misrepresentation claims are claims.the plaintiffs do not contend that california law prevents sallie mae from employing any of the three practices at issue.we consider these allegations in substance to be a challenge to the method sallie mae used to communicate with the plaintiffs about its practices.in this context,the prohibition on misrepresenting a business practice is merely the converse of a requirement that alternate disclosures be made.see cipollone,at.
the plaintiffs dispute this characterization of their claims,arguing that they do not seek specific disclosures,but merely seek to stop sallie mae from fraudulently and deceptively misleading borrowers through the written documents.but preemption can not be avoided simply by relabeling an claim.id.recognizing that a claim was a restated claim subject to express preemption.under the very terms of the ffelp,a misleading disclosure would be improper.see m b requiring common forms to use clear,concise,and simple language to facilitate understanding of loan terms and conditions by applicants a,b,c requiring lenders to make a series of disclosures in simple and understandable terms.a ffelp practice can not simultaneously be misleading under state law,for state disclosure law is preempted by the federal statutory and regulatory scheme.we conclude that the plaintiffs claims challenging the language in sallie mae billing statements and coupon books are restyled claims,and are therefore subject to express preemption under 
the plaintiffs remaining claims allege breach of contract,unjust enrichment,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and the use of fraudulent and deceptive practices apart from the billing statements.these claims are not impacted by any of the ffelp express preemption provisions.we next examine whether principles of conflict preemption apply to bar any of those claims.
addressing conflict preemption,we again may start with a principle that has been declared by the united states supreme court a state law,whether arising from statute or common law,is preempted if it creates an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.crosby,at.quoting hines davidowitz.we discern congressional objectives by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.id.congress codified several explicit ffelp purposes at a.the first is to encourage states and nonprofit private institutions and organizations to establish adequate loan insurance programs for students in eligible institutions.id.a a.adequate loan insurance programs make lending to college students a proposition.two additional ffelp purposes to provide a federal program of student loan insurance,and to guarantee a portion of each loan insured have the same effect.see id.a b,d.by covering student loans with layers of insurance and guarantees,congress encourages private lenders to help fund higher education.the government argues that to accomplish the goal of encouraging such lending,congress intended that the core aspects of the ffelp be uniform.we examine the ffelp to evaluate whether it shows a preference for uniformity,and,if we find such intent demonstrated,we will determine whether the plaintiffs claims conflict with a policy of uniformity.
we must be cautious about conflict preemption where a federal statute is urged to conflict with state law regulations within the traditional scope of the state police powers.when we deal with an area in which states have traditionally acted,the supreme court has told us to start with the assumption that a state historic police powers will not be superseded absent a clear and manifest purpose of congress.wyeth levine,d.contract and consumer protection laws have traditionally been in state law enforcement hands.see,fidelity fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d florida lime avocado growers,paul,d cliff payco am.credits,cir.the supreme court has said that a presumption against preemption may apply to preserve state law claims in the face of preemption claims.see medtronic,at.citing cipollone,at.accordingly,we would not lightly decide that the plaintiffs contract and consumer protection claims under california law are preempted by conflict preemption with the hea.yet,it is our duty to consider carefully what congress was trying to accomplish in the hea and whether these state law claims create an obstacle to the congressional purposes.see crosby,at.
in determining congress intent in enacting the ffelp,we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law.see gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d quoting pilot life ins.dedeaux,d alteration omitted.after reviewing the ffelp as a whole,we agree with the doe that congress intended it to operate uniformly.that intent is shown by the comprehensive framework that congress set up to govern the billion per year program.see.the statutes describe the nuts and bolts of the ffelp,defining the required terms of each type of loan.see id.the statutes go so far as to mandate specified repayment terms and specified insurance and guaranty requirements.id.as one example,the ffelp sets the maximum interest rate that a lender may charge,depending on the type of loan and the date when it was taken out.id.such provisions show congressional intent that ffelp participants be held to clear,uniform standards.
congress direction to the doe shows that it aimed for uniformity of ffelp regulations.the doe has the power to prescribe regulations necessary to establish minimum standards for lenders and servicers.id.a.in a subsection entitled,uniform administrative and claims procedures,congress tells the doe to develop standardized forms and to require their use within the program.id.l.here is congress the forms and procedures that the doe must prescribe shall include all aspects of the loan process as such process involves eligible lenders and guaranty agencies.id.l a emphasis added.this is a clear command for uniformity.yet another section,this one entitled common forms and formats,tells the doe to prescribe common application forms and promissory notes,including forms used by ffelp participants for funding applications,payment deferrals,and loan reporting.id.m.in the rules governing the direct loan program,congress created a policy of uniformity by requiring that loans made to borrowers under the direct loan program shall have the same terms,conditions,and benefits,and be available in the same amounts,as loans made to borrowers under the ffelp.id.a.congress instructions to the doe on how to implement the statutes carry this unmistakable command establish a set of rules that will apply across the board.
regulatory uniformity can be a helpful tool if congress objectives in passing the ffelp are to be realized fully.the house committee on education and labor discussed the need for binding regulations during the major amendments to the ffelp in,at,reprinted in.the committee emphasized the federal nature of the program,and sought more thorough regulations that would,among other things,ensure the stability in the loan program.id.at.stability is necessarily affected by the continued participation of private lenders.one need not have an advanced degree in risk management and financial practices to believe,as we have previously suggested,that exposure to lawsuits under fifty separate sets of laws and court systems could make lenders reluctant to make new student loans.brannan united student aid funds,cir.thus we have held that the ffelp requires uniformly administered standards in order to remain viable.id.at.in this sense,were the law to indulge the plaintiffs california state law claims,and thereby to endorse the possibility of similar claims being asserted under varying state laws in each of the fifty states,it would impair and threaten the efficacy of the federal lending effort for students.
the plaintiffs primary reply to the doe uniformity argument is based on the fourth circuit decision in college loan slm,cir.in that suit between two lenders,the plaintiff sought to use evidence that the defendant violated the ffelp regulations to satisfy elements of various state law causes of action.id.at.the district court found the claims preempted insofar as they permitted a private entity to interpret and enforce the hea,because only the doe was permitted to remedy ffelp violations under the hea,and permitting the state suit would therefore erect an obstacle to uniform ffelp enforcement.id.at.the fourth circuit reversed,explaining that it was unable to confirm that the creation of uniformity was actually an important goal of the hea.id.at.
college loan is not the law of our circuit,and we do not consider the plaintiffs argument based on it to be persuasive for the reasons we set forth above.permitting varying state law challenges across the country,with state law standards that may differ and impede uniformity,will almost certainly be harmful to the ffelp.the costs of the program would go up and either there would be fewer loans made or loans made for lesser amounts or for higher interest,making it harder for students to gain the loan funds they need to get the education they want.
moreover,even if within the fourth circuit,we would not apply college loan because it is distinguishable from our case.first,college loan involved a contractual relationship between lenders,which is not a relationship that the ffelp is primarily designed to govern.the fourth circuit stressed,i mportantly,neither the district court nor the parties have explained how the ffelp purposes would be compromised by a lender pursuing breach of contract or tort claims against other lenders or servicers.id.the situation differs where student borrowers invoke state law principles against lenders.to permit that would subject a lender to the potentially varying laws of fifty states,dissuading lenders from ffelp participation and contravening the congressional purpose of facilitating student loans.second,the plaintiff in college loan sought to enforce ffelp rules,not to vary them.see id.at.the plaintiff liability theory turned on the contract that required hea compliance.id.using an ffelp violation there as an element of the prima facie breach claim did not undermine the regulations,and posed no threat to accomplishment of congressional purposes.see id.at.the situation faced by the fourth circuit is fundamentally different from that presented here,where the plaintiffs ask us to hold that sallie mae can not rely on the ffelp statutes and least not in california.the plaintiffs do not seek to buttress the ffelp framework,but rather to alter it in their home state.the college loan analysis is inapplicable.
the plaintiffs also argue that uniformity can not be a goal of the ffelp because the regulations set only minimum standards and permit flexibility within those standards.see,a authorizing the doe to establish minimum standards with respect to sound management and accountability of programs under the ffelp.in particular,the plaintiffs point to regulatory flexibility with regard to the form of the billing statements and the decision about whether or not to charge late fees.see f stating that a lender may charge a late fee,prescribing required disclosures but not a specific billing or disclosure form.
but the presence of some flexibility in the regulations does not mean that regulatory uniformity is not vital to the ffelp success.federal regulators often include calculated flexibility within their programs without violating congressional intent to have a federal program uniformly control.in geier american honda motor,d,for example,a department of transportation regulation deliberately provided car manufacturers with a range of choices among different passive restraint devices after determining that doing so would maximize the congressional objective of road safety.id.at.the flexibility in the regulation did not mean,as the plaintiffs would have us conclude here,that state law could further restrict the car manufacturers choices.rather,the flexible federal standard alone governed.id.at.
fidelity federal savings and loan ass de la cuesta,d,involved a similarly flexible regulation.
there,the federal home loan bank board issued a regulation permitting savings and loan associations to include a due on sale clause in a mortgage contract at its option.id.at.the flexible policy was critical to the financial stability of the lending institutions,which in turn furthered the congressional purpose of encouraging associations to provide affordable credit for home purchases.id.at.see also a the lending and investment powers conferred by this section are intended to encourage federal savings associations to provide credit for housing safe
