fg hemisphere associates seeks to execute a default judgment against two washington,dc dwellings owned by the democratic republic of congo drc.drc diplomatic officials resided in these properties by virtue of their official capacities up until the,when political disruption led to their removal from office but not from the properties.in,the drc succeeded in recovering the properties for use as diplomatic residencies.fg hemisphere obtained a default judgment against the drc for breach of a credit agreement unrelated to the properties.fg hemisphere then sought writs of execution against the two first mention in the litigation.the drc again defaulted.some two months later,the drc filed a rule b motion to quash the execution order,arguing,among other things,that its failure to respond earlier was due to excusable neglect and that the two properties were immune from execution under as property in the united states of a foreign state.the district court denied the motion.the drc appeals,and we reverse and remand the district court order.the drc neglect in the delay of its response to the motion to execute was excusable.
in the drc then the republic of zaire and its electric company société nationale snel entered into a credit agreement with energoinvest to finance the construction of an electric power transmission facility in zaire.the drc failed to repay,and in,after an arbitration at which the drc failed to appear,energoinvest obtained an arbitration award of roughly million.after providing the drc with formal diplomatic service,energoinvest in september obtained a default judgment from the district court for the district of columbia confirming the arbitral award.energoinvest assigned its rights in the award to fg hemisphere,a company that identifies itself as financial advisor and investor specializing in sovereign debt obligations in emerging markets.
fg hemisphere then moved to execute on the drc commercial property in the united states.motion for permission to execute on judgment and memorandum in support thereof at.the motion mentioned no specific commercial properties.on march,fg hemisphere filed an amended motion motion to execute seeking to execute on two pieces of drc real property in washington,dc linnean avenue,nw,and glenbrook road,nw.zaire had originally bought both properties to serve as diplomatic residences.the drc ambassador,oscar tatanene manata,lived in the linnean property during his ambassadorship and continued there after he lost his position,leaving only in.the drc military attaché lived in the glenbrook property until,when he was dismissed and moved out at that point the similarly dismissed drc deputy military attaché,elinga simoke atembina,either continued to live there or moved in.compare decl.of faida mitifu may,atembina refused to vacate the glenbrook property when his services were terminated with appellant br.at a fter the glenbrook property was vacated by the congolese defense and army forces attaché,atembina and his family moved into the residence.both manata and atembina remained as squatters for over ten years,at least in part as leverage to secure past salaries for diplomatic service.see manata motion to intervene at may,noting drc judicial judgment that manata family has a right of occupancy in the linnean property until the full payment of their salaries and benefits aff.of manata at,noting that i manata have not been paid in fourteen years i must and will remain in this home until the drc settles with me atembina motion to intervene at may,noting that atembina family occupancy is employment right as long as the drc will keep them abroad until the full payment of their salaries and benefits sic mem.order at,democratic republic of congo atembina,no,filed in drc rule j letter,noting that atembina asserts a right to remain in the glenbrook property until he is paid salary that he claims is due him.over the years the drc made some efforts to evict them,including a request that the power company cut off electricity for the linnean address.it finally regained possession of the linnean property from manata in and obtained an eviction order against atembina in.
on filing the motion to execute,fg hemisphere arranged to deliver it by dhl courier service to the drc.on march days after the motion was mail department in the drc foreign ministry office of protocol received and signed for the dhl package in kinshasa,the drc capital.as delivered,the motion was in english the drc official language is french.two days later,the district court granted the motion to execute march order.
meanwhile,in kinshasa the dhl package made its bureaucratic rounds.it went first to the bureau of translation,and after translation into french,on to snel.snel forwarded the package to the office of protocol,from which it went first to the office of legal affairs and then,in late may,to the foreign minister chief of staff.for reasons that are entirely clear,manata learned of the motion and phoned to alert the chief of staff before it arrived in his kinshasa office.on may,evidently no more than a day after the alert from manata,the current ambassador of the drc,faida mitifu,was directed to secure counsel.this was more than days after the district court granted the motion to execute and,of course,before receipt of the motion by the chief of staff.
the drc then moved to quash the writs of execution on may,filed a rule b motion to vacate the march order on july,and filed a rule motion to stay the execution on july.on august same day that the united states filed a statement of district court denied the drc three motions without opinion.the drc appeals,arguing that the district court erred because the march order was void under rule b for lack of jurisdiction notice,and the drc delay in its response to the motion to execute qualified as excusable neglect under rule b.
we review the district court denial of the rule b motion for abuse of discretion.see hall,lepkowski united states of treasury.because the district court provided no explanation for its denial of the drc motion,we face several possibilities either the district court found the drc neglect inexcusable,it remained unpersuaded by the drc position on the merits.because we find that the district court abused its discretion insofar as it may have failed to find the drc neglect excusable,we do not reach the issue of whether the judgment was void.
rule b provides that a court may relieve a party from a final judgment for mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.fed.civ.b.in pioneer investment services brunswick associates.partnership,d,the supreme court held that the determination of excusable neglect is an equitable matter and identified several relevant factors the risk of prejudice to the,the length of delay,the reason for the delay,including whether it was in control of the movant,and whether the movant acted in good faith.id.at.while pioneer involved excusable neglect under bankruptcy rule b,id.at,the same test governs our determination under rule b.see,in re vitamins antitrust class actions.though the united states as amicus argues excusable neglect in more detail than the drc,the latter opening brief clearly preserved the issue.see kamen kemper financial services,d.
the factors listed by pioneer are of course not exclusive.see pioneer,at.robb norfolk western ry,cir.in a case applying other sections of rule b,we stressed a foreign sovereign our interest in protecting that being able to assert defenses based on its sovereign status.intolerant adherence to default judgments against foreign states could adversely affect this nation relations with other nations and undermine the state department continuing efforts to encourage foreign sovereigns generally to resolve disputes within the united states legal framework.practical concepts republic of bolivia,ruth bader ginsburg,internal quotation,brackets,and ellipsis omitted.see also pulliam pulliam,noting that in the context of a default judgment a court should liberally allow relief under rule b because a resolution on the merits is preferable to a judgment by default meadows dominican republic,cir.noting that default judgments are generally disfavored pena seguros la comercial,cir same engineers,white mountain gypsum,cir finding that rule b is applied liberally in the default judgment context only in the exceptional circumstance where default was not in the meaningful control of the moving party.
apart from the united states interest in assuring foreign nations ability to rely on the courts,the express pioneer factors favor the drc.the duration of the delay,to be sure,is hard to calculate because of uncertainty over when the starting shot was is,when the drc received the relevant notice.fg hemisphere suggests that delay should be measured from september,when the drc defaulted in the action to enforce the arbitral point in time,of course,when there had been no mention of executing on the diplomatic properties.it relies on rule,which says n o service need be made on parties in default for failure to appear except that pleadings asserting new or additional claims for relief against them shall be served upon them in the manner provided for service of summons in rule.fed.civ.a.the drc and the united states as amicus want to use the march,filing of the motion to execute as the starting point.they argue,moreover,that the attempt to execute against the diplomatic properties is a new claim for relief within the meaning of rule a,thus triggering the rule reference to rule and thus,under rule j,to the service provisions of the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia.
we do not here decide whether the attempt to reach the diplomatic residences qualifies as a new claim under rule a.in resolving the equitable question under rule b,however,we think it appropriate to use the time the motion to execute was filed,as that represented the first time that the drc received the slightest hint that its diplomatic properties were in jeopardy.as we said in practical concepts,quoting language drawn from the brief of the united states in that case,when a foreign government has appeared and asserts legal defenses,albeit after a default judgment has been entered,it is important that those defenses be considered carefully and,if possible,that the dispute be resolved on the basis of all relevant legal arguments.at.the context of the language underscores its force we used it to explain our decision to give the foreign government an extra chance to establish its jurisdictional immunity under after having just found no substantial basis for immunity.at.
with the motion to execute as the starting point,the roughly two month delay between the deadline to respond to the motion and the drc response and month delay between the motion filing and drc response was relatively short,especially in light of the distance between the drc and the on brief amicus united states,br.at,and fg hemisphere,br.at,appear to assume that the drc was entitled to days to respond to the march,motion of those days,it took eight simply for the dhl package to be delivered to the drc.had the drc used the same courier service,its response could easily have taken another eight days,until well after the district court ruled.moreover,the drc secured counsel only one day after receiving its first actual notice,filing its motion to quash less than four weeks later.
in light of the difficulties,the delay period does seem long in relation to the benchmarks of the rather limited set of cases none of which,so far as we discovered,involves comparable international distance complications.see,bateman postal service,cir finding excusable neglect when delay was over one month because plaintiff left country on a family emergency smith district of columbia,noting that delay of well over a year militated against finding excusable neglect.
second,there is no danger of prejudice to fg hemisphere.prejudice under rule b appears typically and properly to contemplate costs that reconsideration of the final judgment would inflict on the party independent of the chance of reversal.see,bateman,at.pigford johanns,is not to the contrary.there,in ruling on courts rule b power to modify an order in light of changed circumstances,we referred to excusable neglect by way of analogy and noted that relaxing a consent decree deadline would lead the government to be prejudiced to the tune of almost one million dollars.given our concern in pigford about protecting the benefit of the government bargain in which the firm deadline was presumably agreed on in consideration for offsetting benefits for the claimants,pigford can not be read as making simple exposure to adjudication a qualifying form of prejudice under rule b.see id.at if the district court had granted the requested relief from the deadlines,the government would have lost the benefit of its bargain.reliance interests control.
here,fg hemisphere used the delay period to appraise and make arrangements to auction off the properties.but these costs appear hemisphere brief makes no effort to quantify them or otherwise show their significance.besides,the drc in the trial court offered to compensate fg hemisphere for its expenses in having the writs executed and the properties appraised.see defendant the democratic republic of the congo reply to plaintiff response to emergency motion to quash march,writs of execution at july.smith,at noting that the award of costs and attorney fees was aimed at remedying prejudice.reconsideration imposes no cognizable prejudice on fg hemisphere.
third,the failure to file a timely response was in considerable measure out of the drc control.the movant use of english rather than french virtually guaranteed the drc inability to file a timely response.although we do not rule on the argument that service should have been governed by fsia service provision,a,we note that a calls for translation by the serving party,thus facilitating the sovereign ability to make a timely response and tending in part to overcome what practical concepts recognized as the perils of converting the legal terms and concepts of one system into those of another.at.the absence of translation is comparable to the placement of the deadline at the bottom of a letter entitled notice for meeting of creditors,an obscurity that the pioneer court found to militate in favor of creditors who had missed the deadline.at.further,it seems likely that much of the motion bouncing around the various departments within the drc was due to substantial political and institutional differences between the united states and the drc,which practical concepts exhorts us to consider.see at.finally,of course,the drc was plainly hampered by its devastating civil war,which cost over three million lives,shattered the drc already shaky political structure,and set off hyperinflation that peaked at over per year in.it is not surprising that the war would be accompanied by substantial confusion over responsibilities in the foreign the office of the foreign minister itself appears not to have any record of receiving the motion.brenner shore,ohio app d,vacating default judgment under parallel state rule b because of complete physical and mental collapse of defendant.
fg hemisphere points to the facts that the drc sold electricity to neighboring countries,that drc president kabila visited east asia with an entourage of people,and that the drc sent a delegation to pope john paul ii funeral,arguing that each of these supports a finding that drc neglect was inexcusable.but a polity ability to fund foreign travel for its chief executive and other officials is hardly evidence of the sort of general state capacity that would make for swift and efficient handling of a dhl package with materials.the delay here,then,seems like the sort of innocent neglect that in the absence of prejudice or bad faith commonly qualifies as excusable.see,walter blue cross blue shield united of wisconsin,cir finding excusable neglect in secretary clerical error in failing to record deadline.
fg hemisphere itself seems virtually to admit as much,see oral arg.tape at conceding that it is a record from which one could conclude that it was excusable neglect,in the end relying mainly on a number of points apparently thought to show the drc bad fourth express pioneer factor.see pioneer,at
