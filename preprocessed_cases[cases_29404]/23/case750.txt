national automobile and casualty insurance company appeals from an order denying its motion to vacate forfeiture and exonerate a bail bond.appellant contends that the trial court lost its jurisdiction over the subject bail bond by a failing to give notice of forfeiture on october,a date on which the defendant for whom the bail bond was posted had been ordered to appear and b improperly reinstating the bail bond on its own motion and without prior notice,when the defendant subsequently appeared at a continued hearing on october.because the record shows there was no actual forfeiture of the defendant bail on october or subsequent reinstatement thereof on october,the trial court did not err in failing to give notice with respect to either date.we therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on august,appellant posted bail bond no.mt for the release from custody of defendant hetzel carrera on september,the trial court took up the defendant demurrer and motion to set aside the information under penal code section the trial court continued the hearing to october,specified that the defendant remains on bail,and ordered him to return to court on the date of the scheduled hearing.
on october,days before the scheduled hearing parties appeared before the court in connection with a request by the district attorney for a continuance.not having been ordered to be in court until october,the defendant himself was not present.on the record,counsel for defendant and the deputy district attorney agreed to continue the hearing to october.in response to the trial court expressed concern with the preservation of jurisdiction over the defendant and the inconvenience to counsel and the defendant of having to return on october,defense counsel asked that the defendant appearance be waived for that date the trial court responded right.to insure preservation of the jurisdiction i will leave the matter on the,that is,with the understanding that counsel and defendant will not be appearing here.what i will do at that point is order the forfeiture of the bond,taking a bench warrant under submission.it shall not issue until october the at to preserve jurisdiction.defense counsel agreed,and thanked the court.
the trial court minute order of october,states that on the basis of a finding of good cause,the trial court vacated the hearing on defendant demurrer,previously set for october,and reset it to october.somewhat ambiguously,the minute order goes on to state the matter was continued to october,for,with a motion for issuance of bench warrant and bail forfeiture also under submission to that date,and defendant ordered to return.
consistent with the trial court statements on the record on october,neither defendant nor defense counsel appeared on october.during the brief proceeding,at which only a deputy district attorney made an appearance,the trial court recounted what had happened at the earlier hearing on october reiterated that the matter had been reset or continued to october,ordered the defendant posted bond of forfeited stayed any further action to that forfeiture until the next hearing on october,took under submission a bench warrant and continued the matter to october for the appearance of all parties on the demurrer.the minute order for october simply states that the defendant was not present,the matter was continued to october for a hearing on the defendant demurrer,and that both bail forfeiture and issuance of a bench warrant were under submission.
the defendant appeared at the continued hearing on october.on the record,the trial court r ecall ed the bench warrant that was taken under submission,and set aside the forfeiture of the bond that had been stayed,so that the defendant remain ed on his posted bond.because of the district attorney filing of an amended information,the matter of defendant demurrer and section motion was continued to november,with the defendant again ordered to return.
after further continuances and subsequent proceedings,the defendant entered a plea of no contest on july,and the matter was set for sentencing on october.on september,the defendant appeared in court in custody,and sentencing was continued to november,on defendant motion.at the sentencing hearing on november,appellant failed to appear.at that point,the trial court ordered defendant bail forfeited and the issuance of a bench warrant with no bail allowed.a notice of forfeiture of bail was sent to appellant surety on november,
on april,james rankin bail bond company rankin moved to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond in accordance with section,arguing that the statutes governing bail were jurisdictional,and the trial court failure to declare a forfeiture of the bond on october,upon the defendant nonappearance on that date,had deprived it of jurisdiction to do so at a later time.on june,appellant filed a supplemental motion to vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond,on the grounds the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order the defendant bail bond forfeited on november,because it had previously failed to comply with the applicable statutory provisions by providing the defendant surety either with notice of the purported forfeiture of bail on october,or with prior notice of the reinstatement of bail on october.
on july,the trial court denied the motion to vacate forfeiture and exonerate the bond.this appeal timely followed.
discussion 
on appeal,appellant reiterates the same contention it made in its supplemental motion to vacate forfeiture and exonerate the bond namely,that because the trial court failed to provide appellant with notice of its declaration of forfeiture on october,and its subsequent reinstatement of the defendant bond on october,it was without jurisdiction to declare the bond forfeited when the defendant failed to appear on november.in response,the people argue that because the trial court had previously waived the defendant appearance on october,he was not required to attend the hearing on that date and consequently,there could have been no actual forfeiture of his bail on october or subsequent reinstatement thereof on october.thus,the trial court did not err in failing to give notice with respect to the defendant bail on either date,and its subsequent declaration of forfeiture on november,was valid.in our opinion,the people have the better of the argument.
the statute applicable to this case is section.section,subdivision a provides the jurisdictional prerequisites before a court can order forfeiture of bail.these requirements are the defendant must fail to appear for arraignment,trial,judgment,execution of judgment,or when his presence is otherwise lawfully required and the failure to appear must be without sufficient excuse.citation.people classified ins.d,fn.omitted.section,subdivision b in turn provides that the clerk of the court shall,within days of the forfeiture,mail notice of the forfeiture to the surety and if it fails to do so,that the surety or depositor of money posted in lieu of bail shall be released of all obligations under the bond.finally,subdivision c of section states that if the defendant reappears in court,rather than exonerating the bail bond,the trial court may order it reinstated,if the surety is given prior notice of the reinstatement,subd.c.
the courts have held that because the law disfavors forfeitures,these provisions regarding forfeiture of bail establish jurisdictional requirements that must be strictly construed in favor of the surety and the individual citizens who pledge their property to the surety on behalf of persons seeking release from custody.the law traditionally disfavors forfeitures and this disfavor extends to forfeiture of bail.citations.thus,penal code sections and dealing with forfeiture of bail bonds must be strictly construed in favor of the surety to avoid the harsh results of a forfeiture.the standard of review,therefore,compels us to protect the surety,and more importantly the individual citizens who pledge to the surety their property on behalf of persons seeking release from custody,in order to obtain the corporate bond it is well established in the case law that penal code sections
