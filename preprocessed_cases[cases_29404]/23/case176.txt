at issue is whether a putative class representative claim is mooted by a rule offer of judgment so as to defeat federal subject matter jurisdiction in a suit requesting relief.this appeal reflects the tension between two rules of civil.civ.and.whether they can be harmonized when the only individual relief requested by the representative plaintiff has been satisfied through an offer of judgment the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness.we will reverse and remand.
on october,defendant bill collector regal collections mailed a letter to richard weiss demanding payment of a debt allegedly owed to citibank.contending that certain statements in the letter constituted unfair debt collection practice in violation of the fair debt collections practices act fdcpa,weiss filed a federal class action complaint on february,seeking statutory damages on behalf of himself and a putative nationwide class.on march,weiss filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the fdcpa,and adding lancer investments as a.
on april,before filing an answer,and before weiss moved to certify a class,defendants made a.offer of judgment to weiss in the amount of plus attorney fees and maximum amount an individual may recover under the fdcpa.the offer of judgment provided no relief to the class and offered neither injunctive nor declaratory relief.weiss declined to accept the offer of judgment.defendants then filed a motion to dismiss under.b,arguing weiss claim was rendered moot because the rule offer provided him the maximum damages available under the statute for this reason,defendants contended the district court no longer had subject matter jurisdiction over weiss claims.the district court agreed and dismissed the class action complaint.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,weiss asserts the rule offer did not provide the maximum possible recovery because the complaint requested declaratory and injunctive relief,and sought recovery for a putative nationwide class.as such,weiss argues his claim was not rendered moot by the rule offer,and the district court erred in dismissing the class action complaint despite weiss assertion,the fdcpa does not permit private actions for declaratory or injunctive relief.the principal question,therefore,is whether defendants rule offer mooted the claim.
article iii of the united states constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to cases and controversies.const.art.iii flast cohen,d.when the issues presented in a case are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome,the case becomes moot and the court no longer has subject matter jurisdiction.county of los angeles davis,d.an offer of complete relief will generally moot the plaintiff claim,as at that point the plaintiff retains no personal interest in the outcome of the litigation.rand monsanto,cir once the defendant offers to satisfy the plaintiff entire demand,there is no dispute over which to litigate and a plaintiff who refuses to acknowledge this loses outright,under.b,because he has no remaining stake.internal citation omitted see also charles alan wright arthur miller,fed.practice and procedure jurisdiction,at ed.even when one party wishes to persist to judgment,an offer to accord all of the relief demanded may moot the case.
as a threshold matter,we hold defendant rule offer of judgment,in the amount of plus reasonable costs and fees provided the maximum statutory relief available to weiss individually under the fdcpa.the fdcpa allows a plaintiff to recover any actual damage sustained as a result of the debt collector violation of the fdcpa,as well as such additional damages as the court may allow,but not exceeding,and the costs of the action,together with a reasonable attorney fees determined by the court.a,a.
the fdcpa contains no express provision for injunctive or declaratory relief in private actions.see listing damages and counsel fees as remedies,but not declaratory or injunctive relief most courts have found equitable relief unavailable under the statute,at least with respect to private actions.see crawford equifax payment,cir noting that all private actions under the fdcpa are for damages bolin sears roebuck,cir a lthough this circuit has not definitively ruled on the issue,courts uniformly hold that the fdcpa does not authorize equitable relief.sibley fulton dekalb collection,cir noting that equitable relief is not available to an individual under the act.
the remedies under the fdcpa differ depending on who brings the action compare a damage remedies for private litigants with administrative enforcement by federal trade commission.the statute authorizes damages for civil liability,but permits only the federal trade commission to pursue injunctive or declaratory relief.see some trial courts have interpreted this statutory structure to preclude injunctive or declaratory relief in private actions.see zanni lippold,the fdcpa specifically authorizes the federal trade commission ftc to seek injunctive relief and defendant persuasively argues that this is a strong indication of congress intent to limit private actions to damage claims.quoting strong credit mgmt.see also washington csc credit,cir under the fair credit reporting act,the affirmative grant of power to the ftc to pursue injunctive relief,coupled with the absence of a similar grant to private litigants,when they are expressly granted the right to obtain damages and other relief,persuasively demonstrates that congress vested the power to obtain injunctive relief solely with the ftc.because the statute explicitly provides declaratory and equitable relief only through action by the federal trade commission,we believe the different penalty structure demonstrates congress intent to preclude equitable relief in private actions.
for these reasons,we hold injunctive and declaratory relief are not available to litigants acting in an individual capacity under the fdcpa.therefore,the rule offer provided all the relief available to weiss as an individual plaintiff acting in his personal capacity.
of course,the rule offer did not provide the maximum damages to the putative class.for class actions,the maximum relief under the fdcpa is greater.the fdcpa authorizes additional recovery for class members without regard to a minimum individual recovery,not to exceed the lesser of or per centum of the net worth of the debt collector.a b.because defendants rule offer included no relief for the putative class,either under the provisions of the fdcpa or through the aggregation of class claims,we address the mootness question in that context.
the federal rules of civil procedure are designed to be interdependent.see.these rules govern the procedure in all suits of a civil nature canister leahy,cir the rules must be considered in relation to one another.whenever possible we should harmonize the rules.in the event of an unreconcilable conflict,then one rule of procedure may have to take precedence over another.
as discussed,under traditional mootness principles,an offer for the entirety of a plaintiff claim will generally moot the claim.we have held a class action may be dismissed when the named plaintiff claim is rendered moot before filing a motion for class certification.see brown phila.hous,cir w hen claims of the named plaintiffs become moot before class certification,dismissal of the action is required.quoting lusardi xerox,cir.defendants argue this action is moot because they submitted the.offer for complete individual relief before weiss filed a motion for class certification.
the question of mootness in the class action context is not a simple one.see lusardi,at s pecial mootness rules apply in the class action context,where the named plaintiff purports to represent an interest that extends beyond his own.nonetheless,it appears to be settled that once a class has been certified,mooting a class representative claim does not moot the entire action because the class acquire s a legal status separate from the interest asserted by the named plaintiff.sosna iowa,d.
in two decisions in,united states parole comm geraghty,d and deposit guar.bank roper,d,the supreme court provided some guidance in this area.these cases permitted a named plaintiff whose individual claims were mooted to appeal a denial of class certification.
in geraghty,the question presented was whether a trial court denial of a motion for certification of a class may be reviewed on appeal after the named plaintiff personal claim has become moot.at.the court looked beyond the mootness of geraghty substantive claims and focused on his distinct procedural right to represent a class.id.at.the court held the action was not moot upon the expiration of the substantive claim,because the plaintiff retained a personal stake in the class certification decision.id.at.
of special significance to this appeal,in roper,the supreme court expressed concern at a defendant ability to pick off named plaintiffs by mooting their private individual claims.at.credit card holders brought a class action challenging finance charges levied on their accounts and those of similarly situated card holders.id.at.after the district court denied their motion for class certification,the bank tendered to each named plaintiff the maximum amount he would have received individually.id.at.the named plaintiffs refused the offer,but the district court,over their objections,entered judgment in their favor and dismissed the action as moot.id.at.the court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed,noting the notion that a defendant may a class action by paying off the class representatives either with their acquiescence or,as here,against their will,deserves short shrift.indeed,were it so easy to end class actions,few would survive.roper consurve,cir.
granting certiorari,the supreme court considered whether putative class representatives retained a private interest in appealing the denial of class certification subsequent to the entry of judgment in their favor,over their objections.the bank argued the entire case had been mooted by the individual offers.the supreme court disagreed,stating 
requiring multiple plaintiffs to bring separate actions,which effectively could be picked off by a defendant tender of judgment before an affirmative ruling on class certification could be obtained,obviously would frustrate the objectives of class actions moreover it would invite waste of judicial resources by stimulating successive suits brought by others claiming aggrievement.
justice rehnquist concurred in the judgment,but wrote separately,commenting 
the distinguishing feature here is that the defendant has made an unaccepted offer of tender in settlement of the individual putative representative claim.the action is moot in the art.iii sense only if this court adopts a rule that an individual seeking to proceed as a class representative is required to accept a tender of only his individual claims.so long as the court does not require such acceptance,the individual is required to prove his case and the requisite art.iii adversity continues.acceptance of defendant offer need not be mandated under our precedent since the defendant has not offered all that has been requested in the complaint relief for the class 
id.at.rehnquist,concurring.
we recognize roper addressed a different issue,whether a putative class representative retains an individual interest in appealing the denial of class certification subsequent to an entry of judgment in his favor,to which he objected but the matters addressed in roper particularly a defendant ability to pick off representative plaintiffs and thwart a class direct application to the issue presented by this appeal of course,plaintiff here was only a putative class representative.although weiss filed a class complaint,he had not yet moved for class certification.
as sound as is rule when applied to individual plaintiffs,its application is strained when an offer of judgment is made to a class representative as in roper,allowing the defendants here to pick off a representative plaintiff with an offer of judgment less than two months after the complaint is filed may undercut the viability of the class action procedure,and frustrate the objectives of this procedural mechanism for aggregating small claims,like those brought under the fdcpa.
the purposes behind.are.a significant benefit to claimants who choose to litigate their individual claims in a context is the prospect of reducing their costs of litigation,particularly attorney fees,by allocating such costs among all members of the class who benefit from the recovery.roper,at.the supreme court also commented that c lass actions may permit the plaintiffs to pool claims which would be uneconomical to litigate individually.for example,this lawsuit involves claims averaging about per plaintiff most of the plaintiffs would have no realistic day in court if a class action were not available.phillips petroleum shutts,d.this c can also enhance the means for private attorney general enforcement and the resulting deterrence of wrongdoing.in re gen l motors,truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir.allowing defendants to pick off putative lead plaintiffs contravenes one of the primary purposes of class aggregation of numerous similar especially small claims in a single action.
moreover,a rule allowing plaintiffs to be picked off at an early stage in a putative class action may waste judicial resources by stimulating successive suits brought by others claiming aggrievement.roper,at.this result is contrary to the purpose of.as well.see moore federal practice,at ed.the primary purpose of rule is to promote settlements and avoid protracted litigation.
there is another significant consideration.congress explicitly provided for class damages in the fdcpa.see a b establishing maximum damages in class actions under the fdcpa.congress also intended the fdcpa to be by private attorney generals.see.describing fdcpa as see also graziano harrison,cir fdcpa mandates an award of attorney fees as a means of fulfilling congress intent that the act should be enforced by debtors acting as private attorneys general.representative actions,therefore,appear to be fundamental to the statutory structure of the fdcpa.lacking this procedural mechanism,meritorious fdcpa claims might go unredressed because the awards in an individual case might be too small to prosecute an individual action.for this reason,defendants view of the interplay between.and.would frustrate congress explicit directive that the fdcpa be enforced by private attorney generals acting in a representative capacity.alleged violators of federal law would be allowed to tender the statutory amount of damages to a named plaintiff,derailing a putative class action and frustrating,the goals and enforcement mechanism of the fdcpa 
as the court in geraghty stated,mootness can be avoided through certification of a class prior to expiration of the named plaintiff personal claim.at.see also holstein city of,cir finding case moot where plaintiff did not move for class certification before evaporation of his personal stake.some appellate courts have extended geraghty and declined to dismiss on mootness grounds while class certification was pending.see susman lincoln am,cir holding case not moot when class certification motion was pending before district court at the time named plaintiffs were tendered damages zeidman ray mcdermott,cir.july conclud ing that a suit brought as a class action should not be dismissed for mootness upon tender to the named plaintiffs of their personal claims,at least when,as here,there is pending before the district court a timely filed and diligently pursued motion for class certification.see also lusardi,cir noting the exception to the general mootness rule where a certification motion which district court did not have a reasonable opportunity to decide was filed before plaintiff claim expired.as noted,although plaintiff here filed a class complaint,he never filed a motion for class certification.his individual claim was allegedly mooted by the rule offer before the court had a reasonable opportunity to consider class certification under.this situation is not uncommon in fdcpa cases and has created an unsettled area of law 
there appears to be considerable authority that once a motion for class certification has been filed,the relation back doctrine explained by the supreme court in sosna iowa,d comes into play.in sosna,the court recognized 
there may be cases in which the controversy involving the named plaintiffs is such that it becomes moot as to them before the district court can reasonably be expected to rule on a certification motion.in such instances,whether the certification can be said to relate back to the filing of the complaint may depend upon the circumstances of the particular case and especially the reality of the claim that otherwise the issue would evade review.
id.at.furthermore,in geraghty the court held class certification may relate back to the filing of the complaint where claims are so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative individual interest expires.at.the mootness exception recognizes that,in certain circumstances,to give effect to the purposes of rule,it is necessary to conceive of the named plaintiff as a part of an indivisible class and not merely a single adverse party even before the class certification question has been decided.by relating class certification back to the filing of a class complaint,the class representative would retain standing to litigate class certification though his individual claim is moot.but the question in this case is whether the relation back doctrine should apply only after the filing of a motion for class certification or whether it may also be employed after the filing of a class complaint.
the relation back doctrine generally has been used for inherently transitory claims.see county of riverside mclaughlin,d quoting geraghty,at.although weiss claims here are not inherently transitory as a result of being time sensitive,they are acutely susceptible to mootness,comer cisneros,cir,in light of defendants tactic of picking off lead plaintiffs with a rule offer to avoid a class action.as noted,this tactic may deprive a representative plaintiff the opportunity to timely bring a class certification motion,and also may deny the court a reasonable opportunity to rule on the motion 
it bears noting that most of the cases applying the relation back doctrine have done so after a motion to certify the class has been filed.see zeidman ray mcdermott,cir.july susman lincoln am,nonetheless,reference to the bright line event of the filing of the class certification motion may not always be.representative actions vary according to the substantive claims and the courses of action.there are at least three distinct events on the path to a certified class filing the class complaint,filing the motion for class certification,and a decision on the motion.yet plaintiffs may file the class certification motion with the class complaint,and in some cases,include a motion for approval of an already negotiated settlement.of course,the federal rules do not require certification motions to be filed with the class complaint,nor do they require or encourage premature certification determinations it seems appropriate,therefore,that the class action process should be able to play out according to the directives of rule and should permit due deliberation by the parties and the court on the class certification issues.
that said,the proper procedure is for the named representative to file a motion for class certification.that did not occur here.but neither was there undue delay in circumstances like these,we believe the relation back doctrine should apply.absent undue delay in filing a motion for class certification,therefore,where a defendant makes a rule offer to an individual claim that has the effect of mooting possible class relief asserted in the complaint,the appropriate course is to relate the certification motion back to the filing of the class complaint because in this case,no motion for class certification was made,we will direct the trial court to allow weiss to file the appropriate motion.
we recognize our decision creates some tension with our opinion in lusardi xerox,cir,but we believe the cases can be reconciled in lusardi,the named plaintiffs,following two orders decertifying a class,agreed to a full and unconditional release of their individual age discrimination claims,and the court dismissed their individual claims.id.at.nonetheless,the named plaintiffs filed a de novo motion for class certification.after the trial court dismissed the class claims as moot,we affirmed,noting that after the named plaintiff claims had been voluntarily settled,they no longer had justiciable claims when they moved for class certification.id.at.
unlike the case here,lusardi did not involve an offer of judgment made in response to the filing of a complaint.the named plaintiffs voluntarily entered into individual settlements subsequent to class decertification.see id.at here,there is no dispute that plaintiffs voluntarily settled their individual claims.in this appeal,the picking off scenarios described by the supreme court in roper are directly implicated.in lusardi they were not.the roper court stressed that at no time did the named plaintiffs accept the tender in settlement of the case instead,judgment was entered in their favor by the court without their consent.at.similarly,in zeidman,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit wrote 
p laintiffs claims have been rendered moot by purposive action of the defendants by tendering to the named plaintiffs the full amount of their personal claims each time suit is brought as a class action,the defendants can in each successive case moot the named plaintiffs claims before a decision on certification is reached.
the tactic at play here,similar to those described in roper and zeidman,contrasts with the voluntary settlement in lusardi where the plaintiffs agreed to settle with the defendants after two motions for class certification had been denied.indeed,even lusardi noted,in a somewhat different context,that it simply was not a case where the defendant successfully prevented effective resolution of a class certification issue.lusardi,at.in lusardi,no unilateral action by the defendant rendered the plaintiffs claims inherently transitory.defendants here used the rule offer to thwart the putative class action before the certification question could be decided.
under this set of circumstances,we believe the tension between.and.should be addressed through the relation back analysis 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court will be reversed and the matter will be remanded for proceedings consistent with our opinion.
our court addressed a similar issue in colbert,cir.that case was vacated and reheard by the court en banc,cir,which then dismissed the appeal as improvidently granted.cir.
provides at any time more than days before the trial begins,a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer,with costs then accrued.if within days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted,either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment.an offer not accepted shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs.if the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.
