we have consolidated for decision four intertwined cases that present nine questions under the fair debt collection practices act,et,several of which have engendered considerable controversy at the circuit level and even some circuit splits.we shall first try to answer the questions and then indicate the disposition of each of the appeals that follows from our answers.
here are the questions 
whether,if the consumer as the statute refers to the putative debtor is represented by a lawyer,a debt collector must give the same written notice to the lawyer that section would require were the consumer unrepresented and the notice sent directly to him.
whether communications to lawyers are subject to sections through,which forbid harassing,deceptive,and unfair practices in debt collection.compare sayyed wolpoff abramson,cir,answering yes,with guerrero rjm acquisitions llc,cir per curiam,and kropelnicki siegel,cir,both answering no.
whether,if the answer to question is yes,the standard applicable to determining whether a representation is false,deceptive,or misleading under section is the same whether the representation is made to the lawyer or to his client.
whether a settlement offer contained in a letter from the debt collector to a consumer is lawful per se under section.compare lewis acb business services,cir yes,with goswami american collections enterprise,cir no.
if it is not per se lawful,whether its lawfulness should be affected by whether it is addressed to a lawyer,rather than to the consumer directly.
whether there should be a safe harbor for a debt collector accused of violating section by making such an offer.
again,if such a letter is not per se lawful,what type of evidence a plaintiff must present to prove that a settlement offer violates section.
whether the determination that a representation is or is not false,deceptive,or misleading under section is always to be treated as a matter of law.compare mcmillan collection professionals,cir taylor cavalry investment,llc,cir,and walker national recovery,cir no,with wilson quadramed,cir,and terran kaplan,cir yes.
whether,if that determination is not always a matter of law,nevertheless a charge under section can sometimes be dismissed on the pleadings on the ground that the challenged representation was,as a matter of law,not false or misleading.
the questions thus fall into three overlapping groups.the first is the application of the fair debt collection practices act to lawyers questions through,and the second is the proper treatment under the act of settlement offers questions through and the last questions and concerns the role of.c in deciding claims of violation of section.
section provides 
a notice of debt contents 
within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt,a debt collector shall,unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt,send the consumer a written notice containing 
the amount of the debt 
the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed 
a statement that unless the consumer,within thirty days after receipt of the notice,disputes the validity of the debt,or any portion thereof,the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector 
a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the period that the debt,or any portion thereof,is disputed,the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector and 
a statement that,upon the consumer written request within the period,the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor,if different from the current creditor.
there are additional subsections,but they do not require discussion.the required written notice must be sent to the consumer,that is,to the person claimed to owe a debt.the consumer lawyer is not that person.but if the debt collector knows that the consumer is represented by a lawyer,then with immaterial exceptions he may not communicate with the consumer directly.a.he must go through the lawyer.the lawyer receives the notice and shares it with,or explains it to,his client.hence the debt collector is communicating with the consumer within the meaning of the act,which defines communication as the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium.emphasis added.the lawyer is both any person and any medium.
it would be passing odd if the fact that a consumer was represented excused the debt collector from having to convey to the consumer the information to which the statute entitles him.for example,sections a and provide that the required notice must state the amount of the debt and the name of the creditor.is it to be believed that by retaining a lawyer the debtor disentitles himself to the information or that the debt collector,though knowing that the debtor is represented,can communicate directly with him in defiance of the principle that once a party to a legal dispute is represented,the other party must deal with him through his lawyer,and not directly we conclude that any written notice sent to the lawyer must contain the information that would be required by the act if the notice were sent to the consumer directly.national consumer law center,consumer credit law manual b heintz jenkins,d.
the next question is whether debt collectors can,without liability,threaten,make false representations to,or commit other abusive,deceptive,or unconscionable acts against a consumer lawyer,in violation of sections,e,or f.these sections do not designate any class of persons,such as lawyers,who can be abused,misled,by debt collectors with impunity.section forbids any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass,oppress,or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt emphasis added.section forbids a debt collector to use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.and section forbids a debt collector to use any unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.
it is true that a lawyer is less likely to be deceived,intimidated,harassed,and so forth for simplicity,we shall assume that only deception is alleged than a consumer.but that is an argument not for immunizing practices forbidden by the statute when they are directed against a consumer lawyer,but rather for recognizing that the standard for determining whether particular conduct violates the statute is different when the conduct is aimed at a lawyer than when it is aimed at a consumer.
the courts have ruled that the statute is intended for the protection of unsophisticated consumers sophisticated consumers presumably do not need its protection,so that in deciding whether for example a representation made in a dunning letter is misleading the court asks whether a person of modest education and limited commercial savvy would be likely to be deceived.olson risk management alternatives,cir.the standpoint is not that of the least intelligent consumer in this nation of million people,chuway national action financial services,cir gammon gc services.partnership,cir clomon jackson,cir,but that of the average consumer in the lowest quartile or some other substantial bottom fraction of consumer competence.this is implicit in the rule that a plaintiff can not withstand summary judgment just by presenting his affidavit that he was confused.taylor cavalry investment,llc,supra,at pettit retrieval masters creditors bureau,cir.he must show that he is representative of the protected group.chuway national action financial services,supra,at.
but if the debt collector has targeted a particularly vulnerable,consumers who he knows have a poor command of benchmark for deciding whether the communication is deceptive would be the competence of the substantial bottom fraction of that group.and application note united states bragg,cir united states.grimes,cir.
