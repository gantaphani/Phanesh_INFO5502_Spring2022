rather than answer the complaint,hfs moved for its dismissal,and in the alternative asked for summary judgment.concluding that the letter did not violate the statute,the district court granted summary judgment to hfs.jacobson,d at.moreover,finding that plaintiff action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,a,the court awarded attorneys fees and costs to defendant.jacobson,at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the merits 
summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c the facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed,and we review de novo the district court holding that the collection letter did not violate the fdcpa.see russell equifax,cir.
in passing the fdcpa in,legislators noted abundant evidence of the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices.a.finding existing laws inadequate to address the problem,congress acted with the aim of eliminating abusive practices in the debt collection industry,and also sought to ensure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged.id.e.these purposes inform the fdcpa many provisions.among other things,the act regulates and restricts the acquisition of information about debtors.id.it further prohibits conduct whose natural consequence is to harass,oppress,or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt.id.and it bars the use of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt,id,while proscribing unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.id.
as a response to the recurring problem of debt collectors dunning the wrong person or attempting to collect debts which the consumer has already paid,at,as reprinted in,the fdcpa gives the consumer the right to dispute a debt claimed by a debt collector,and to seek verification of the validity of the debt.b.if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing,within the period afforded by the act,that she disputes the debt or any portion of the debt,the debt collector must cease collection.id.the debt collector may resume collection activities only when it has obtained verification of the debt,and has mailed a copy of the verification to the consumer.id.the window is not a grace period in the absence of a dispute notice,the debt collector is allowed to demand immediate payment and to continue collection activity by the same token,however,t he failure of a consumer to dispute the validity of a debt under may not be construed by any court as an admission of liability.c.
significantly,the fdcpa does not assume that the recipient of a collection letter is aware of her right to require verification of the debt.instead,the act requires the debt collector,as the party in the better position to know the law,to inform the consumer of that right.section a orders the debt collector to send a written notice,within five days of its initial communication with the consumer,stating the amount of the debt and the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed,a.this validation notice must further include a statement that unless the consumer,within thirty days after receipt of the notice,disputes the validity of the debt,or any portion thereof,the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector.id.a.the notice must incorporate a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the period that the debt,or any portion thereof,is disputed,the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt.id.a.finally,the notice must contain a statement that,upon the consumer written request within the period,the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor,if different from the current creditor.id.a.
in this circuit,the question of whether a communication complies with the fdcpa is determined from the perspective of the least sophisticated consumer.clomon jackson,cir.the purpose of the standard,here as in other areas of consumer law,is to ensure that the statute protects the gullible as well as the shrewd.id.at.but in applying this standard,we bear in mind the act dual purpose in addition to protecting consumers against deceptive debt collection practices,the objective test we apply protects debt collectors from unreasonable constructions of their communications.id.at.even in crafting a norm that protects the naive and the credulous,we have carefully preserved the concept of reasonableness.id.at.accordingly,the fdcpa does not aid plaintiffs whose claims are based on bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations of collection notices.id.at.
in this case,jacobson concedes that the language of the validation notice,standing alone,would satisfy hfs obligations under a.but that is not the end of the matter,for hfs has the obligation,not just to convey the information,but to convey it clearly.russell,at.applying the standard,we have held repeatedly that a debt collector violates a,even if the collector includes an accurate validation notice,if that notice is overshadowed or contradicted by other language in communications to the debtor.see,savino computer credit,cir russell,at.
a notice overshadows or contradicts the validation notice if it would make the least sophisticated consumer uncertain as to her rights.russell,at we have said that this judicial gloss on the original text of the statute accords with the act overarching purpose of deterring deceptive conduct,and ensures that purported compliance with the form of the statute is not given sanction at the expense of the substance of the act.id.and congress has now codified our approach by adding the following sentence to the statute any collection activities and communication during the period may not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumer right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor.b as amended by the financial services regulatory relief act of,c,stat.
in the event of a transgression,the fdcpa provides for enforcement by the federal trade commission and by other administrative agencies.l.but it also grants a private right of action to a consumer who receives a communication that violates the act.id.in addition to compensatory damages,id.a,the act empowers district courts to award additional damages of up to per consumer,id.a a,and mandates the award of attorneys fees to successful plaintiffs.id.a.in order to prevail,it is not necessary for a plaintiff to show that she herself was confused by the communication she received it is sufficient for a plaintiff to demonstrate that the least sophisticated consumer would be confused.in this way,the fdcpa enlists the efforts of sophisticated consumers like jacobson as private attorneys general to aid their less sophisticated counterparts,who are unlikely themselves to bring suit under the act,but who are assumed by the act to benefit from the deterrent effect of civil actions brought by others.
jacobson asserts that the validation notice was overshadowed or contradicted,in three different ways,by the second paragraph of the letter.that paragraph reads as follows if your payment or notice of dispute is not received in this office within days,we shall recommend further action be taken against you to collect this outstanding balance.we address in turn each of his three contentions.
a.the right to dispute the debt before payment 
plaintiff contends first that the letter might lead the least sophisticated consumer to be uncertain whether she had any right to dispute the debt at all before paying it.if that were the case,the letter would violate a under the law of this court.like the district court,however,we find no violation of the act on this score.
as noted above,a debt collector is,as a general matter,entitled to demand immediate payment of a debt,and to threaten further action in the event of.our cases have recognized,however,that such demands may cause confusion about the right to dispute,and will sometimes,in that way,lead debt collectors to run afoul of the act.in russell equifax,for example,a debt collection agency sent a letter captioned as an immediate collection notice,telling the consumer if you do not dispute this claim see reverse side and wish to pay it within the next days we will not post this collection to your file.at.on the reverse side of the letter,there was a validation notice accurately stating the nature of the recipient right to dispute the debt.id.twenty days later,the debt collector sent another letter,demanding payment in full within days.id.at.we found that both communications violated the fdcpa.while the collector was technically within its rights to demand payment,the least sophisticated consumer would be left uncertain whether she had the option to dispute the debt,and to withhold payment while disputing it.id.
we elaborated on our approach to this kind of claim in savino computer credit,at.there,the front of the letter stated that the creditor insists on immediate payment or a valid reason for your failure to make payment.id.at.at the bottom,the letter also referred to an important notice on back,where the information required by a could be found.id.the savino court held that the notice violated the fdcpa.by demanding immediate payment on the front,and only informing the debtor of his right to dispute on the back,the notice,we concluded,would leave the least sophisticated consumer uncertain as to her right to dispute the debt.id at.
jacobson claims that the actual holding of savino is that an immediate demand for payment violates the act even when it is presented with an alternative.appellant br.at.we disagree the savino panel stressed that a request for immediate payment d oes not,standing alone,violate the fdcpa.savino,at.indeed,the savino court went further and provided examples of transitional language designed to call attention to a validation notice,which would still allow a debt collector to demand immediate payment while complying with the act.id.at.that the debt collector in savino itself violated the act by requiring immediate payment without also explaining that its demand did not override the consumer rights under section to seek validation of the debt,id.emphasis added,in no way supports jacobson extreme position.
the letter sent by hfs to jacobson,though it demanded payment,adequately explained that the recipient had the right to seek verification of the debt.it presented jacobson with two alternate ways of avoiding further action either pay the debt within days,or submit a notice of dispute,within days.this right to seek validation of the debt was further explained,not on the back of the demand letter,but on its face,below the initial statement,and in clear terms.in these circumstances,even the least sophisticated debtor would understand that she had the option to submit a notice of dispute,rather than pay the claimed sum.we therefore affirm the district court decision to reject jacobson first argument.
b.the period starting date 
plaintiff next argues that the letter statement that further action would be taken unless payment or a notice of dispute was submitted within days casts doubt on the starting date for the period.a recipient,jacobson asserts,would be uncertain as to whether the period for submitting a notice began on the date of the letter july,or instead started on the date jacobson received it,which,the parties agree,was some days later.if that were so,the letter would violate the statute,for the latter date is the correct one under the act.section a requires the validation notice to state that the debtor may dispute the debt within thirty days after receipt of the notice emphasis added.we agree with the district court,however,that on the facts of this case,even the least sophisticated consumer would understand that the period began only when the notice was received.
the first case jacobson cites in support of his second argument,cavallaro law office of shapiro kreisman,is not on point.the validation notice in that case stated explicitly that the debt would be assumed valid unless the recipient disputed the debt within thirty days from the date of this notice.id.at emphasis added.the district court quite rightly found a violation of the statute,for the notice expressly stated the wrong starting date.id.at.here,by contrast,the contested statement says simply that payment or a notice must be submitted within days,without specifying when the period starts running.
while the letter is,therefore,perhaps ambiguous as to when the period begins,the validation notice clarifies any possible ambiguity.it contains a clear and accurate statement of the starting date,informing jacobson that he has days from receiving this notice to submit the notice of dispute.in this respect,the debt collector those considered by this court in mcstay system,cir,where we rejected a similar claim of overshadowing.in mcstay,the letter threatened further action if the recipient had not paid the debt after days.id.at.the front of the mcstay letter contained no reference to the debtor right to dispute the debt,but directed the reader intention to important information on the reverse side.there,the debtor would find an explanation of her rights,which comported with a.on these facts,the court found that any confusion created by the ambiguity on the front of the letter dissipates when read in conjunction with the language on the back.id.at.we agreed with the district court in mcstay that the least sophisticated consumer was not liable to conclude
