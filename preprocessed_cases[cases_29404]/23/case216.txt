kerry decay,stanford barre,and the louisiana sheriffs pension and relief fund lsprf appeal the district court order granting garnishment of decay contributions to and barre monthly benefits from state pension funds held by the lsprf.we conclude that the united states may garnish decay and barre retirement benefits to satisfy a criminal restitution order,but that the united states is limited to garnishing percent of barre monthly pension benefit.accordingly,we reverse the district court entry of the final garnishment orders as to barre,affirm as to decay,and remand for proceedings consistent with our holding.
factual procedural background 
kerry decay and stanford barre pleaded guilty to one count each of mail fraud,conspiracy to commit mail fraud,and obstruction of justice for their roles in a scheme to defraud the city of new orleans the city.at sentencing,the district court determined that the city had suffered an injury compensable under the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,and ordered decay and barre to pay,jointly and severally,in restitution.after judgment was entered,the united states moved for writs of garnishment under the federal debt collection procedures act fdcpa seeking seizure of the defendants interests in their pension funds to satisfy the restitution order.the district court found that the statutory prerequisites to garnishment were satisfied,see b,and issued the writs of garnishment to the lsprf.
the lsprf answered the garnishment orders by stating that decay currently was eligible only for an immediate withdrawal of the he had contributed toward his retirement and that barre was currently receiving a monthly pension benefit of.the lsprf asserted that the pension benefits were exempt from seizure under federal and louisiana law and that enforcement of the writs against it as garnishee would violate the tenth amendment to the united states constitution.the lsprf also argued that,to the extent that garnishment is proper,the united states failed to follow the appropriate formal procedures to withdraw decay employee contributions.regarding barre,the lsprf argued that even if garnishment were proper,the consumer credit protection act ccpa limits the united states right to garnish barre pension to percent of his monthly benefit.
decay,proceeding pro se,adopted the lsprf brief.barre also objected to the writ of garnishment against him,asserting that the tenth amendment precludes the united states from garnishing his pension benefits and,in the alternative,that the ccpa prohibits the united states from garnishing more than percent of his pension benefits.
the district court overruled the appellants objections to the garnishment writs and held that the united states could garnish the entire amount of decay contributions to the lsprf,as well as the full amount of the monthly benefits paid by the lsprf to barre.accordingly,the district court entered final orders of garnishment compelling the lsprf to immediately pay the united states,representing the present value of decay employee contributions to the lsprf,as well as of any future distributions of pension funds due to barre.the lsprf and barre filed motions for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment.decay adopted the lsprf motion.the district court denied the motions.
the lsprf,decay,and barre filed the instant appeal they assert that the garnishment orders violate federal and louisiana law,including the tenth amendment to the united states constitution.the appellants argue in the alternative that,if garnishment is proper,the district court erred by not requiring the united states to complete certain formalities before withdrawing decay employee contributions and by allowing the united states to garnish the full amount of barre monthly pension benefit.

iii.standing 
before we address the merits of the appellants arguments,we must determine whether the lsprf has standing to assert arguments on appeal.united states holy land found.for relief,cir when standing is placed in issue in a case,the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of a particular issue and not whether the issue itself is justiciable.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the united states asserts that the lsprf lacks standing to object to the writs of garnishment because the lsprf does not have a personal interest in the retirement benefits and thus has not suffered an.
in addressing a plaintiff standing,the supreme court has required 
injury in fact,by which we mean an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical a causal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct,by which we mean that the injury fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant,and has not resulted from the independent action of some third party not before the court and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision,by which we mean that the prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of the favorable ruling is not too speculative.
ne.chapter of the contractors of am.city of jacksonville,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the supreme court further has observed that the nature and extent of the facts that must be alleged to establish standing depends considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an object of the action at issue.if he is,there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.but when a plaintiff asserted injury arises from the government allegedly unlawful regulation or lack of regulation of someone else,much more is needed.id.at.
of course,the lsprf did not come to court seeking relief.the united states obtained an order compelling the lsprf to turn over funds in its possession representing any interest decay and barre may have in any property subject to the lsprf control,thus drawing the lsprf into the instant litigation.the writs of garnishment compel the lsprf to take particular action,and the lsprf asserts that the ordered action is unconstitutional under the tenth amendment and,as to decay,subjects it to potential double exposure in the future.in essence,the lsprf is saying to the court you ca make me do this.having been brought before the court involuntarily by another party,we conclude that the lsprf has the ability to say it can not be the object of such court actions accordingly,the lsprf,as the object of the writ of garnishment and as a sovereign entity,has standing to assert that the united states lacks the constitutional authority to compel it to release the funds see lujan,at holy land,at 
we need not decide whether the lsprf has standing to raise the remaining objections to garnishment because decay and barre plainly have standing to assert exemptions to the garnishment of their property.because decay and barre raise the same objections to garnishment that the lsprf makes,this court has jurisdiction to decide the case.see arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d in the ordinary case,a party is denied standing to assert the rights of third persons.but we need not decide whether the circumstances of this case would justify departure from that prudential limitation f or we have at least one individual plaintiff who has demonstrated standing to assert these rights as his own.see also horne flores,d because the superintendent clearly has standing to challenge the lower courts decisions,we need not consider whether the legislators also have standing to do so.having concluded that the appellants possess standing to challenge the final orders of garnishment,we now turn to the merits of this dispute.
the mvra makes restitution mandatory for certain crimes,including any offense committed by fraud or deceit,a,c a ii,and authorizes the united states to enforce a restitution order in accordance with its civil enforcement powers the mvra broadly permits the united states,notwithstanding any other federal law,to enforce a restitution order against all property or rights to property of the person fined.a.section of the mvra sets forth several enumerated exceptions to the united states authority to garnish any and all of the debtor property to satisfy a restitution order however,the statute does not exempt pension plans further,a explicitly states that the exemptions contained in the fdcpa,do not apply to the enforcement of a federal criminal judgment.
the appellants collectively make three arguments why the district court erred in issuing the final garnishment orders against barre and decay.first,the appellants assert that the defendants pension benefits are exempt from garnishment under federal and state law.second,barre argues that,if the united states may garnish his retirement benefits,the ccpa limits the united states to garnishment of percent of his monthly pension benefits.third,the lsprf,joined by decay,asserts that,if the united states is allowed to garnish decay contributions into his retirement,the united states is required to apply for a withdrawal of decay employee contributions.we address each of these arguments in turn.
garnishment of pension benefits under the mvra 
the appellants assert that the united states may not garnish pension benefits under the mvra because a of the internal revenue code irc makes pension benefits inalienable the tenth amendment to the united states constitution precludes the united states from garnishing pension funds controlled by the lsprf and louisiana constitutional and statutory law exempt pension benefits from garnishment.
the lsprf argues that the defendants pension benefits are exempt from garnishment because the irc prohibits the assignment or alienation of retirement benefits.a a.section a a states that a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.this circuit has never addressed whether a of the mvra overrides a of the irc.
section a of the mvra states that notwithstanding any other federal law a judgment imposing a fine may be enforced against all property or rights to property of the person fined.emphasis added.this language is qualified only by the enumerated exceptions contained in a.we conclude that the language in a authorizing the united states to enforce a garnishment order against all property or rights to property of the debtor,n otwithstanding any other federal law,is sufficient to override the provision of the irc.several factors compel us to conclude that the mvra allows garnishment of a defendant retirement benefits to satisfy a criminal restitution order.
first,the supreme court has recognized that the use of a notwithstanding clause signals congressional intent to supersede conflicting provisions of any other statute.caseros alpine ridge group,d t he use of such a notwithstanding clause clearly signals the drafter intention that the provisions of the notwithstanding section override conflicting provisions of any other section.likewise,the courts of appeals generally have interpreted similar notwithstanding language to supersede all other laws,stating that a clearer statement is difficult to imagine.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the appellants argue that the notwithstanding clause is insufficient to override the language in a of the irc under the supreme court decision in guidry sheet metal workers national pension fund,d.in guidry,the supreme court was faced with the question of whether b of the reporting and disclosure act of lmrda which provided pension funds with a private right of action to recover damages or secure an accounting or other appropriate relief for the benefit of the labor organizations allowed the government to create a constructive trust on a defendant pension benefits.the court held that the other appropriate relief language in the lmrda was insufficient to override the provision in d of the employee retirement income security act erisa.id.at we do not believe that congressional intent would be effectuated by reading the lmrda general reference to other appropriate relief as overriding an express,specific congressional directive that pension benefits not be subject to assignment or alienation.
unlike the general other appropriate relief language contained in the lmrda,the notwithstanding any other federal law clause signals a clear congressional intent to override conflicting federal law.indeed,we agree with our sister circuit that it appears that congress accepted the supreme court invitation in guidry by enacting the mvra.united states irving,cir see also united states novak,cir en banc in sum,all standard principles of statutory construction support the conclusion that mvra authorizes the enforcement of restitution orders against retirement plan benefits,the provision of erisa notwithstanding.our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that congress exempted certain retirement plans from garnishment under the mvra,see a incorporating the exemptions in irc a for certain federal annuity and pension payments,but did not include pension plans in the list.waggoner gonzales,cir the canon of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another indicates that the listed ground is the only requirement.citation omitted.
second,reading a to allow garnishment of the defendants retirement benefits is consistent with the mvra statutory scheme and purpose.the only property exempt from garnishment under a is property that the government can not seize to satisfy the payment of federal income taxes.a.section c underscores the congressional directive that restitution orders should be satisfied in the same manner as tax liabilities.c stating that an order of restitution imposed under this chapter is a lien in favor of the united states on all property and rights to property of the person fined as if the liability of the person fined were a liability for a tax assessed under the internal revenue code of emphasis added.as we have already recognized,pension plan benefits are subject to levy under the irc to collect unpaid taxes.see shanbaum united states,cir see also irving,at erisa pension plans are not exempted from payment of taxes under of the irc,and thus they should not be exempted from payment of criminal fines moreover,c of the mvra demands that criminal fines in favor of the united states should be enforced in the same manner as a tax liability would be enforced.
third,other circuit and district courts have concluded that the united states may garnish a defendant pension benefits to satisfy a restitution order,despite similar language contained in d of erisa.see irving,at novak,at united states lazorwitz,d,holding that neither erisa provision,d,nor the provision in the internal revenue code,a,provide a bar to the garnishment of a qualified pension plan.section d of erisa states each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.d.we find these cases persuasive,see patterson shumate,d referring to irc a and erisa d as coordinate section s containing similar restrictions,and conclude that a of the mvra authorizes the united states to garnish retirement benefits,notwithstanding the provision in a of the irc.
the tenth amendment 
the appellants also argue that the garnishment writs violate the tenth amendment to the united states constitution.this claim hinges on the appellants contention that federal law does not govern benefit plans and the mvra does not supersede louisiana broad police powers.we reject the appellants tenth amendment argument.
the tenth amendment declares that powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution,nor prohibited by it to the stat
