on august,the plaintiffs,aon and its subsidiary,aon financial products,afp,together aon,brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking recovery in breach of contract against société générale sg under a million credit default swap agreement between them dated march,the cds contract.
the cds contract provides that if a credit event occurs before the defined termination date of the agreement and aon notifies sg of that credit event,then sg must pay aon million.aon contends that a credit event occurred when the government service insurance system gsis,an agency of the philippine government,defaulted on a surety bond that gsis had issued to cover investments in a project with respect to which bear stearns international limited bsil later made a loan.bsil,in an effort to protect itself against the risk of gsis defaulting on the bond,entered into a credit default swap agreement with aon the cds contract.in a separate suit,the district court determined that a credit event occurred under the cds contract when gsis defaulted on the surety bond.see ursa minor aon financial products,wl,at,dist.lexis,july,ursa minor allen schwartz,judge,aff.cir.aon argues that if a credit event occurred under the cds contract,then a credit event also must have occurred under the cds contract that is the subject of this suit,and that aon therefore was entitled to payment thereunder.the issue on this appeal is whether a credit event occurred under any of the definitions set forth in the cds contract such that sg refusal to pay aon constituted breach of contract.we disagree with the determination by the district court george daniels,judge that a credit event occurred within the meaning of that term in the cds contract,which prompted the court to grant the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and deny the defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and enter judgment in favor of sg.
background 
this case arises out of one of a series of transactions related to the financing of a condominium complex in the philippines.in,bsil agreed to loan ecobel land,ecobel million to build the condominiums.ecobel was obligated under this agreement to repay bsil million on march.as a condition precedent to that loan,bsil required that ecobel procure a surety bond from gsis that guaranteed repayment of the full million in the event that ecobel defaulted on its loan.gsis then purportedly transferred to bsil as obligee a million gsis surety bond covering ecobel borrowings for the condominium project dated march,but apparently issued on february,the surety bond,which listed ecobel as principal and philippine veterans bank as obligee.see ursa minor,wl,at,dist.lexis,at section of the statute establishing gsis states that the government of the republic of the philippines guarantees the fulfillment of the obligations of gsis when and as they shall become due.an act to create and establish a property insurance fund and to provide for its administration and for other purposes,act,phil.
in order to protect itself against the risk of gsis defaulting on the surety bond,bsil entered into the cds contract on february,according to the agreement,aon promised to pay bsil million upon the occurrence of a credit event,which the contract defined as a failure to pay,that is,the failure by gsis to make,when due,any payments under the obligations for whatever reason or cause.cds contract,dated,at,the only obligation referred to in the agreement was the surety bond.for this credit protection,bsil paid aon.
to reduce its own risk exposure,on february,aon entered into a separate credit default swap agreement with sg the cds contract.in it,sg promised to pay aon million upon the occurrence of a credit event,defined as one of five occurrences a failure to pay,a sovereign event,a cross default,a repudiation,or a restructuring.but whereas the cds contract defined reference entity,whose obligations were the subject of the swap,as gsis and any successors and assigns,the cds contract defined reference entity as republic of philippines and any successors.similarly,while the reference obligation,which was the subject of the cds contract,was gsis million surety bond,the reference obligation of the cds contract was a million republic of philippines treasury bond,coupon rate,maturing on april.for the credit protection under the cds contract,aon paid sg,nearly less than the amount that bsil had paid aon for protection under the cds contract.
about one year later,in march,ecobel defaulted on its bsil loan.on march,bankers trustee company,bankers,to whom bsil had assigned its rights under the various agreements relating to the loan,notified aon that it had received a letter from gsis stating that it did not intend to pay bankers on the bond because it had not been appropriately authorized on gsis behalf.aon responded the following day that it would not pay bankers under the cds contract because gsis statement that it intended to refuse to honor the surety bond did not constitute a credit event under the agreement.aon then initiated a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois seeking clarification of its rights as against bsil and sg under the various agreements.
before the illinois litigation was resolved,however,bsil assignees filed suit against aon in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the district court granted summary judgment in the action in favor of the assignees.ursa minor,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court concluded that the cds contract specifically defined credit event as a failure by gsis,the reference entity,to pay under the surety bond for whatever reason or cause,id.at,dist.lexis at,and that gsis default clearly satisfied that condition,id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court noted that in the cds contract,aon had waived the defense of any illegality of the gsis surety bond.the court concluded that aon bore the risk of by gsis,for whatever reason or cause,including a justifiable refusal to pay.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
on april,more than two months before the district court decision in ursa minor,aon filed this action in the same court,the united states district court for the southern district of new york,against sg,seeking payment of million under the cds contract.on october,sg moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,arguing principally that aon had failed to allege a breach of the cds contract because gsis was not included in the definition of republic of philippines,the reference entity of the cds contract,and gsis default therefore did not constitute a credit event for the purposes of that agreement.
in response,aon moved for summary judgment,contending first that the finding in ursa minor that a credit event had occurred for the purposes of the cds contract,ursa minor,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,necessarily meant that a credit event had occurred for the purposes of the cds contract.aon argued that because both ursa minor and this litigation were based on the same series of transactions and evidence regarding whether or not there was a failure to pay,and because sg was in privity with aon,sg was precluded from relitigating that factual issue.aon mot.for summ.dated,at.aon urged the court to reject sg argument that the cases are distinct because the verbiage in the swap contracts in certain sections are slightly different because the key issue,whether a credit event had occurred,was the same in both cases.id.at.
second,aon argued that sg was liable to aon because a credit event occurred as a matter of law under the provision of the cds contract defining a credit event as,inter alia,a sovereign event or a failure to pay.in response to sg argument that the gsis default was not a sovereign event because the republic of the philippines and gsis are separate entities,aon asserted that the april,letter from the philippine government refusing to honor its statutory guarantee of gsis obligations did not deny that gsis had authority to bind it the philippine government,nor does it assert that the gsis and the philippine government are separate and distinct entities id.at.
by order dated february,the district court denied sg motion for judgment on the pleadings and granted aon for summary judgment.the court decided that under the plain and unambiguous terms of the cds contract,gsis default satisfied the definition of sovereign event,and therefore constituted a credit event.aon fin.prods.aon société générale,wl,dist.lexis,société générale.the court concluded that the definition of sovereign event,which includes a condition that has the effect of causing a failure to honour any obligation relating to the government of the reference entity,id.at,dist.lexis,at quoting the cds contract ellipses in original,requires only that gsis s act have the effect of causing a failure to honour an obligation relating to the philippine government,id.at,dist.lexis,at emphasis in original.

ii.sovereign event 
credit default swaps are a method by which one party the protection buyer transfers risk to another party the protection seller.in emerging markets such as the philippines,
p rotection buyers can use credit derivatives to manage particular market exposures and and protection sellers generally use credit derivatives to earn income and diversify their own investment portfolios.simply put,a credit default swap is a bilateral financial contract in which a protection buyer makes periodic payments to the protection seller,in return for a contingent payment if a predefined credit event occurs in the reference credit 
often,the reference asset that the protection buyer delivers to the protection seller following a credit event is the instrument that is being hedged.but in emerging markets,an investor may calculate that a particular credit risk is reasonably correlated with the performance of the sovereign itself,so that the investor may seek to isolate and hedge country risk with credit default swaps written on some portion of the sovereign outstanding debt.

cds agreements are thus significantly different from insurance contracts.as amicus correctly points out,they do not,and are not meant to,indemnify the buyer of protection against loss.rather,cds contracts allow parties to hedge risk by buying and selling risks at different prices and with varying degrees of correlation.br.of amicus curiae int l swaps and derivatives ass n,isda,at footnote omitted.aon bought from bsil the risk of a credit event as defined by the cds contract.with the cds contract,aon hedged the risk that it bought from bsil by selling to sg the risk of a credit event as defined by the cds contract.but the risk transferred to aon and the risk transferred by it were not necessarily identical.the terms of each credit swap agreement independently define the risk being transferred.
to decide whether gsis failure to pay on the surety bond because gsis took the position that it was not a legally binding obligation,an event that constituted a credit event as defined in the cds contract,also constituted a credit event as defined in the cds issue presently before look first to the language of the contract.if it is we think that it we are required to give effect to the contract as written.bell,lloyd underwriters,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the cds contract defines credit event as,inter alia,a sovereign event,which is 
a condition which is created by or results from any act or failure to act by the government of the reference entity or any agency or regulatory authority thereof,including the central bank of the reference entity,that has the effect of declaring a moratorium whether de facto or de jure on,or causing a failure to honour any obligation relating to,or cancelling or generally causing material changes to the terms and conditions of,any obligation issued by the government of the reference entity or the central bank of the reference entity.
cds contract at.the contract defines reference entity as republic of philippines and any successors.id.at.thus,for purposes of our analysis,after redacting inapplicable language,the cds contract provides that an event is a sovereign event if it is a condition created by or result ing from any act or failure to act by the government of the republic of philippines and any successors or any agency or regulatory authority thereof that has the effect of causing a failure to honour any obligation relating to any obligation issued by the government of the republic of philippines.
the district court concluded that this definition requires only that,to be a credit event,gsis s act ha s the effect of causing a failure to honour an obligation relating to the philippine government.société générale,wl,at,dist.lexis,at emphasis in original.similarly,aon argues that the contract defines sovereign event as,inter alia,a failure to honor any obligation relating to any obligation issued by the reference entity,the philippine government.we disagree with aon and the district court principally because we think that these interpretations ignore the crucial word condition at the outset of the definition.gsis failure to pay on the surety bond may well have been a failure to act,or an event,but surely it was not a condition.
put another way,aon asks us to conclude that the gsis default on the surety bond constituted an act or failure to act by an agency of the philippine government gsis,which created a condition,which had the effect of causing a failure of gsis to honor its obligation,the surety bond,which obligation relates to an obligation of the philippine government but we do not think that the definition of sovereign event includes a the failure of a philippine agency gsis to honor its surety bond,thereby creating b a condition that in turn caused c the failure of the agency to honor the same surety bond,irrespective of whether the surety bond is an obligation that relates to an obligation of the philippine government.the default was not a condition that caused the failure of gsis to honor its obligation.nor was it caused by an act or failure to act by the republic or its agency.it resulted from gsis decision that it was not legally bound to honor its putative obligation to pay.we do not think that gsis decision determination that it is not legally bound by the surety bond to be characterized as either an act or failure to act or as a condition within the ordinary meaning of those terms.
a literal reading of the sovereign event definition might suggest that the act or failure to act by the government of the philippines that had the effect of causing the failure of gsis to honour the surety bond was something other than the failure to pay on the surety bond itself.hypothetically,for example,the act might have been the issuance of gsis letter to bsil assignees denying liability.even if that were what aon complaint said the argument would fail.the letter was,to be sure,an act.but it did not create a separate condition which in turn caused the default on the surety bond.
moreover,an act or failure to act in the context of a sovereign event seems to refer to such events as the restructuring of the sovereign,the government debt,taken in its capacity as a sovereign.the act of debt restructuring by a sovereign may well may be expected to general condition throughout the country,currency devaluation,restriction on exports of dollars,and the like that in turn results in one or more defaults on one or more particular obligations against which an entity doing business with or within the country would want to protect itself.eternity global,at addressing the operation of cds contracts where the government of the republic of argentina,in the grip of economic crisis,initiated a voluntary debt exchange.there was no such act or resulting condition here.
aon points out that the ursa minor district court held that gsis default in march qualified as a credit event under the cds contract.compl.indeed the court did so hold 
the definition of credit event in the cds contract specifically includes failure by gsis to pay under the surety bond for whatever reason or cause.plaintiffs allege that gsis s refusal to make payment under the bond amounted to a credit event,that aon was given proper notice and that aon refusal to pay constituted a default triggering aon obligations under the guarantee.
ursa minor,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court then ruled against aon because the gsis default constituted a credit event,which the cds contract defined as,inter alia,a failure to pay,and because aon ha d an obligation to pay irrespective of the bond potential invalidity or enforceability with respect to gsis.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the ursa minor district court never addressed the possibility that the gsis default may have been a sovereign event under the cds contract,let alone under the cds contract before us.this is hardly surprising inasmuch as the cds contract did not define credit event to include sovereign event as the cds contract did.
yet aon contends that the ursa minor court determination that a credit event occurred under the cds contract necessarily means that a credit event occurred under the cds contract but it does not follow from the occurrence of a credit event as defined in one contract that there was a credit event as defined in the other.there is,as noted,no reason to assume that the risk transferred to aon was precisely the risk that it transferred or sought to transfer to sg.and we can perceive of no basis for concluding that the district court decision in ursa minor that there was a failure to pay credit event under the cds contract implies that there was a sovereign event credit event under the cds contract.
we therefore conclude that gsis default was not a sovereign event as that term is used in the cds contract.
iii.failure to pay 
the district court considered only one of the five kinds of credit events referred to in the cds sovereign event.finding that there had been such a credit event under the terms of the cds contract,the court declined to consider whether the events also constituted a failure to pay,which is also one of the defined credit events under that agreement.
although we ordinarily will not review an issue the district court did not decide,whether we do so or not is a matter within our discretion.chertkova connecticut general life ins,cir citing singleton wulff,d.we think this case an appropriate one for exercising that discretion.apparently as a result of the district court conclusion that a sovereign event had occurred,the parties devote little attention to the failure to pay issue in their briefs to us.but the parties amply presented arguments on that issue to the district court.in fact,there,the parties focused on the failure to pay language rather than the sovereign event provision upon which the district court eventually decided the motions.the interpretation of the unambiguous terms of a contract is,moreover,a matter of law that we may properly evaluate and decide ourselves.see krumme,at chertkova,at.
as noted above,the cds contract defines the reference entity as the republic of philippines and any successors.cds contract at.under the cds contract,a failure to pay means the failure by the reference entity the republic of philippines and any successors to make,when due,any payments equal to or exceeding the payment requirement if any under any obligations.id.at,second emphasis added.an obligation under that agreement is with respect to the republic of philippines,any obligation,whether present or future,contingent or otherwise,as principal or surety or otherwise for the payment or repayment of money.id.at.the reference obligation is identified as 
republic of philippines 
maturity april,
original issue amount usd 
id.the payment requirement is usd or its equivalent in any other currency at the time of the credit event.id.
aon argues that gsis itself qualifies as the reference entity of the cds contract,that is,that republic of philippines includes gsis gsis default on the surety bond,therefore,is a failure to pay by the reference entity on an obligation of the reference entity.aon contends that because the isda credit derivatives definitions,incorporated into the cds contract,see cds contract at,define sovereign as any state,political subdivision or government,or any agency,instrumentality,ministry,department or other authority including,without limiting the foregoing,the central bank thereof,the term republic of philippines must also include any agency of the state.br.of at citing isda credit derivatives definitions,at we disagree.
it is clear from the face of the cds contract that republic of philippines does not include gsis or other government agencies like it there is no language in the reference entity definition,or anywhere else in the agreement as we read it,suggesting that it does,or indicating that it incorporates the isda definition of sovereign.to incorporate that definition of sovereign into the definition of reference entity,we would expect the parties to use that word,sovereign,in the relevant portion of the contract.they did not.rather,they use the words republic of philippines.where the contract uses the word sovereign,in the term sovereign event,by contrast,the contract does clearly mean to incorporate the isda definition.sovereign event is the only term in the cds contract that refers not only to the reference entity,but to the reference entity or any agency or regulatory authority thereof,including the central bank of the reference entity.cds contract at.
if we were to credit aon argument as to the expansive meaning of republic of philippines,it would follow that any cds contract listing a sovereign nation as a reference entity will be incorporating the isda definition of sovereign without using the term,or at least that the contract is ambiguous in that regard.we are given,and ourselves see,no reason to do so.
instead,we look to philippine law for guidance about the distinction between the republic of the philippines and its agencies and instrumentalities.see first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d g overnment instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct from the sovereign should normally be treated as such.before the district court,sg offered uncontested expert evidence that,under philippine law,gsis is considered a juridical entity distinct from the republic.mem.in support of mot.for on the pleadings dated,at citing decl.of cesar villanueva dated.we conclude that,as a matter of philippine law,gsis is a separate juridical entity from the republic of the philippines.see,an act amending presidential decree,as amended,expanding and increasing the coverage and benefits of the government service insurance system,instituting reforms therein and for other purposes,act,phil.stating gsis powers and functions,including the power to sue and be sued see also curley amr,cir a ppellate courts,as well as trial courts,may find and apply foreign law.the court,in determining foreign law,may consider any relevant material or source,including testimony,whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the federal rules of evidence.the court determination shall be treated as a ruling on a question of law.as such,gsis is not the republic of philippines its obligations are not the republic of the philippines obligations and a failure by gsis to make a payment on its obligations is not equivalent to the failure of the republic of the philippines to make a payment on its obligations.
to be sure,in the context of the argument that gsis failure to pay on the surety bond was a failure to pay as defined by the contract,aon assertion that the issue was decided by ursa minor appears to have more traction than when made in support of aon sovereign event argument.although the ursa minor court did not address the question of whether a sovereign event had was no such provision in the cds did decide that there had been a failure to pay under that contract.aon therefore argues that the ursa minor court decision that there was a failure to pay under the cds contract foreclosed the district forecloses principles of issue preclusion or collateral estoppel from deciding that there was no failure to pay under the cds contract.
but even though the identical term failure to pay is used in both cds agreements,and the ursa minor court decided that there was a failure to pay under the agreement,the term failure to pay has distinctly different meanings in the two agreements.under the cds contract,which defines reference entity as gsis and any successors and assigns,and obligation s as the surety bond,failure to pay means the failure by the reference entity gsis and any successors and assigns to make,when due,any payments under the obligations the surety bond for whatever reason or cause.cds contract at,first italics in original.as discussed above,the cds contract,by contrast,defines reference entity as republic of philippines and any successors.in that contract,failure to pay means the failure by the reference entity republic of philippines and any successors to make,when due,any payments equal to or exceeding the payment requirement if any under any obligations.cds contract at,first italics in original.moreover,whereas the cds contract defines obligation as the surety bond,the cds contract defines obligation as with respect to the reference entity republic of philippines,any obligation whether present or future,contingent or otherwise,as principal or surety or otherwise for the payment or repayment of money.id.at.thus,the agreement explicitly covers failure to pay by gsis on the surety bond,while the agreement explicitly does not do so.it covers failure to pay by the republic of the philippines on obligations of the republic of the philippines.
one might argue,then,although the plaintiffs do not,that the republic statutory guarantee of gsis debt was an obligation of the reference entity,which the republic failed to pay when the surety bond came due on march,and that this failure to pay was a credit event,triggering sg payment obligations under the contract.this argument would also fail.to trigger sg payment obligations,a credit event must occur before the termination date of the cds agreement,march.cds contract at.but aon did not send a notice and demand to the government of the republic of the philippines until april,three days after the termination date of the cds contract.see société générale,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.and the republic of the philippines did not deny aon demand until april,two weeks after the termination date.id.because the republic denial of liability did not occur before the termination date,it can not constitute a credit event under the contract.
we therefore conclude that neither the default,which constituted a failure to pay under the cds contract,nor the republic failure to honor its alleged statutory obligation,constituted a failure to pay under the cds contract.for the same reasons,neither event constituted a repudiation.they similarly do not satisfy the other definitions of credit event enumerated in the cds contract.
iv.credit event notice 
although not central to the result we reach,we note that the contract also provides that sg is obligated to pay aon only after aon serves sg with a credit event notice and a demand for payment.see isda master agreement,dated,at defining,as an event of default,f ailure by the party to make,when due,any payment under this agreement if such failure is not remedied on or before the third local business day after notice of such failure is given to the party emphasis added see also mem.in support of pls.mot.for sum,dated,at arguing that sg obligation is absolute and unconditional upon a notice of a credit event and a demand for payment thereunder emphasis added.
the district court concluded that aon march,letter constituted a credit event notice.société générale,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we disagree.the cds contract defines credit event notice as an irrevocable notice which may be oral,including by telephone to the parties and the calculation agent that describes the occurrence of a credit event on or after the effective date and on or prior to the scheduled termination date.cds contract at.in the march letter,which does not use the term credit event notice,aon informed sg that gsis had declined to make payments on the surety bond and that bsil had made a demand on aon pursuant to the cds agreement.letter from aon to sg,at.the letter outlined aon position 
recognizing this matter is not likely to settle itself,in an effort to get a resolution,we have this day filed suit in chicago seeking a declaration of the rights and obligations of all relevant parties.in order to preserve our rights under aon societe generale sic agreement,we felt compelled to name you in the litigation however,recognize our alignment of interests.if our position is upheld,you will not have to pay us.if we lose,you will owe us.we think our interests are the same,but again,for procedural reasons and to protect our rights in what we think would be the unlikely event we are called upon to pay bsil,we named you 
in this vein,the cds contract contains several procedural requirements which must be met for presentment to you on our agreement,such as presenting a claim to the government of the philippines and producing publicly available information.out of an abundance of caution we are initiating those steps as part of our notification to you,but in light of our position there is no obligation on the underlying matter sic,we would like to discuss with you whether we could dispense with those prerequisites.
to be a credit event notice,the action taken must be irrevocable.cds contract at.the march letter was not irrevocable.aon went to great lengths to explain in the letter the circumstances under which it would rescind its contention that sg owed aon and would agree that no credit event had occurred under either cds contract and that neither aon nor sg was obligated to pay under them.this letter was not a credit event notice and therefore could not have triggered sg payment obligations under the contract.
conclusion 
as a matter of law and under the unambiguous language of the cds contract,no credit event occurred thereunder and sg therefore did not breach that agreement by declining to pay aon thereunder.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and enter judgment in favor of sg.
