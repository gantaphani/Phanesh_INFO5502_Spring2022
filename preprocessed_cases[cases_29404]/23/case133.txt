opinion of the court 
although the facts of this case include details of money transfers and offshore asset protection trusts in sunny south pacific locales,its ultimate resolution involves nothing more exotic than the interpretation of the bankruptcy code.we consider the code provisions defining the property of a bankruptcy estate and determine what is required for a trustee to recover that property for the benefit of the estate,as provided in.the property at issue here is million that was fraudulently transferred by appellant advanced telecommunication network atn to two of its former owners,including appellee daniel allen,allen,as part of a shareholder litigation settlement in.atn avoided that transfer and obtained a recovery order in its separate bankruptcy proceedings in the united states bankruptcy court for the middle district of florida the florida bankruptcy court.allen subsequently filed the present bankruptcy case in the district of new jersey,and argues that the funds were never recovered and are therefore property of his estate subject to the code automatic stay provision.we conclude that the district court applied too narrow a definition of recover and hold that where a debtor like atn avoids a fraudulent transfer and obtains a recovery order,it has sufficiently recovered those funds such that they are a part of that debtor estate under the code.accordingly,we will reverse and remand this case to the district court.
in,allen and gary carpenter carpenter founded atn,a company engaged in reselling long distance telephone service.allen and carpenter each owned of the voting stock in atn,while allen brother david allen and carpenter father robert carpenter owned the remaining stock.allen and carpenter had a falling out in the spring of,and carpenter ultimately terminated allen employment with atn on august.
a.the allen carpenter shareholder litigation 
allen sued carpenter and atn in new jersey state court in april,asserting several claims pertaining to the management of atn.during trial,daniel and david allen the allens and carpenter along with their respective attorneys entered into a handwritten settlement agreement that relieved carpenter of any liability to the allens in exchange for,inter alia,a million payment to the allens attorneys,a million payment to the allens in two installments and million,and a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice upon execution.a formal written agreement outlining substantially the same terms was signed on january,and the million transfer at issue in the present case was made on june,
b.the atn bankruptcy 
on january,atn filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the florida bankruptcy court.atn also filed an adversary proceeding against the allens on april,seeking,inter alia,to avoid the million transfer pursuant to and of the bankruptcy code,as well as the new jersey uniform fraudulent transfer act the new jersey ufta,stat.ann.et.the adversary complaint alleged that the million payment to the allens on june,was fraudulent insofar as atn did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange.
after commencing the adversary proceeding in the florida bankruptcy court,atn sought a preliminary injunction to freeze the funds at issue.the allens moved for a continuance,which the court granted.in the interim,the allens took the following actions daniel allen transferred the the sic assets under his control to a cook islands asset protection trust known as the shingle oak family trust and david allen transferred approximately to a cook islands self settled sic asset protection trust known as the southern breeze trust.app.at.the florida bankruptcy court found that,as a result of these actions,g ood cause exists to believe that defendants acted in bad faith in twice requesting a continuance of the preliminary injunction hearing,thus allowing them time to transfer the money to the cook islands trusts.app.at.the court granted preliminary injunctive relief and ordered that the funds be repatriated.when the allens failed to comply with the court order,the florida bankruptcy court twice held daniel allen in contempt of court.
when the case proceeded to trial,the allens prevailed.the florida bankruptcy court found that atn claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that its fraudulent transfer claims failed on the merits under the new jersey ufta.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed.advanced telecomm.network,allen in re advanced telecomm.network,cir.the eleventh circuit held that atn had proved a fraudulent transfer under the new jersey ufta insofar as it was insolvent at the time of the million transfer and it received no reasonably equivalent value for the transfer.id.at.on remand,the florida bankruptcy court avoided the transfers to the allens and entered a million judgment on january,in favor of atn on its fraudulent transfer claims.atn then sought to collect on its judgment pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.in response,the florida bankruptcy court entered an order directing daniel allen i to repatriate all monies currently held in his shingle oak trust to counsel for atn within days of the entry of the order,ii to provide an accounting of all monies deposited in and transferred from the shingle oak trust within days of the entry of the order,and iii to otherwise immediately freeze any other use or transfer of any monies in the shingle oak trust.app.at.when allen failed to comply with the second repatriation order,atn brought a motion to hold allen in contempt on august.no action was taken on that motion because on september,allen filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey the bankruptcy court.
proceedings in the present case 
atn filed the instant adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court shortly after allen filed his chapter petition.atn sought an order determining that the litigation in the florida bankruptcy court was not stayed pursuant to allen bankruptcy filing because atn was seeking to collect its own estate assets and not those of allen or,in the alternative,granting atn relief from the automatic stay to continue with the litigation and collection of the judgment and waiving the day stay of effectiveness of order.app.at.atn maintains that the funds at issue should not be subject to the automatic in allen bankruptcy case pursuant to d of the code,which allows a court to grant relief from the stay for cause.d.
following a hearing,the bankruptcy court denied atn motions by concluding that any property in the cook islands trusts was not property of atn bankruptcy estate pursuant to but was instead property of allen estate and thus subject to the automatic stay upon allen bankruptcy filing and the funds were not held by allen in constructive trust for the benefit of atn under new jersey law.as is relevant here,the bankruptcy court concluded that the funds did not fit within the bankruptcy code definition of property of the estate because atn despite having avoided the transfer did not actually recover tangible possession of the funds under.absent actual tangible recovery,allen had a superior interest in the funds,which were thus the property of his estate not atn and subject to the automatic stay.the bankruptcy court entered its opinion on march,and atn appealed.
on july,the district court affirmed for essentially the same reasons.it also rejected atn argument that the new jersey bankruptcy and district courts the new jersey federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear the adversary proceeding.atn filed a timely notice of appeal to this court on august.on october,the bankruptcy court entered an order discharging allen debts pursuant to.
the district court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal below pursuant to a,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.our review of the district court decision effectively amounts to review of the bankruptcy court opinion in the first instance.in re hechinger inv.of,cir.because this issue involves interpretation of the bankruptcy code,it is a question of law subject to plenary review.id.
we address two issues in this appeal.first,we consider whether the new jersey federal courts had subject matter jurisdiction over atn adversary proceeding.second,we consider whether the million payment was a part of atn bankruptcy estate in florida such that it was not affected by the automatic stay provisions triggered by allen bankruptcy proceedings in the present case.we consider each issue below.
subject matter jurisdiction 
atn argues that the new jersey federal courts lacked jurisdiction under the doctrine set forth in princess lida of thurn and taxis thompson,on the ground that the new jersey federal courts decisions could conflict with the florida courts disposition of the funds in the offshore trust.the district court concluded that it had jurisdiction because the judgment in the florida case was in personam,and therefore the new jersey federal courts were not required to exercise control over property already under the control of the florida courts.we agree.we exercise plenary review in determining whether the district court was vested with subject matter jurisdiction.brown francis,cir.
the princess lida doctrine prevents a court in which an action is filed from exercising jurisdiction when a court in a previously filed action is exercising control over the property at issue and the second court must exercise control over the same property in order to grant the relief sought.dailey hockey league,cir.as discussed by the supreme court 
t he principle applicable to both federal and state courts that the court first assuming jurisdiction over property may maintain and exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other,is not restricted to cases where property has been actually seized but applies as well where suits are brought to marshal assets,administer trusts,or liquidate estates,and in suits of a similar nature where,to give effect to its jurisdiction,the court must control the property.
princess lida,at.the princess lida doctrine applies when the litigation in both the first and second fora are in rem or quasi in rem in nature,and the relief sought requires that the second court exercise control over the property in dispute and such property is already under the control of the first court.dailey,at citing princess lida,at.because the test is elucidated in the conjunctive,we need only discuss the first element to reject atm jurisdictional argument.
the crux of the jurisdictional question in this case is whether the florida bankruptcy court exercised in rem jurisdiction over the trust funds or in personam jurisdiction over allen.although b ankruptcy jurisdiction,at its core,is in rem,central virginia community college katz,t he framers would have understood that laws on the subject of b ankruptcies included laws providing,in certain limited respects,for more than simple adjudications of rights in the res,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.historically,this additional judicial authority included the power to imprison third parties who possessed the bankruptcy estate assets and the power to grant in personam writs of habeas corpus ordering the release of individuals from debtors prison.id.at.apropos of the present case,the katz court also recognized that the trustee,in order to marshal the entirety of the debtor estate,will need to recover the subject of the transfer pursuant to a.a court order mandating turnover of the property,although ancillary to and in furtherance of the court in rem jurisdiction,might itself involve in personam process.id.at.thus the supreme court drew a distinction between the bankruptcy proceedings themselves which are in rem and ancillary orders entered in the course of those proceedings including those pursuant to which may be in personam.
in united states nordic village,the supreme court addressed a postpetition transfer of property that had been avoided pursuant to a,recovered pursuant to a,and reduced to a monetary judgment.id.at.in dictum,the court rejected an argument based upon in rem jurisdiction as an initial matter,the premise for the argument based upon in rem jurisdiction is missing here,since respondent did not invoke,and the bankruptcy court did not purport to exercise,in rem jurisdiction.respondent sought to recover a sum of money,not particular dollars,so there was no res to which the court in rem jurisdiction could have attached.id.at citations omitted.
the statements in katz and nordic village demonstrate that the judgment rendered by the florida bankruptcy court was not directed at particular property.black law dictionary ed defining judgment in rem as a judgment that determines the status or condition of property and that operates directly on the property itself.emphasis added.the florida bankruptcy court explicitly entered the judgment at issue here against individuals by stating that j udgment is entered against the defendants,daniel allen and david allen in the amount of.app.this order,which granted relief pursuant to bankruptcy code sections avoidance and recovery falls into that area identified in katz a court ancillary power to utilize in personam process in order to effectuate its in rem bankruptcy jurisdiction.katz,at.like in nordic village,the recovery order was aimed at recovering a sum of money,not particular dollars,therefore taking the order outside the florida bankruptcy court in rem jurisdiction.see at.
atn argues that the repatriation order exercised in rem jurisdiction over the trust funds in particular this argument disregards the underlying judgment,however,and looks solely to an ancillary order entered in aid of execution.the repatriation order was entered pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,which applies federal rule of civil procedure to adversary proceedings.fed.rule in turn provides the procedure for executing on a judgment by way of proceedings ancillary to the court primary basis for jurisdiction.see ifc interconsult,ag safeguard int l partners,llc,cir noting that a garnishment action pursuant to rule fell under a court ancillary jurisdiction.thus,the repatriation orders were ancillary to the exercise of the court in personam jurisdiction,not an exercise of new in rem or quasi in rem jurisdiction.the florida bankruptcy court judgment was,therefore,an in personam judgment against allen,not the funds themselves.absent a showing that both the florida bankruptcy court and the new jersey federal courts exercised such control,atn fails to meet the first prong of the princess lida test.we thus conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider the merits of atn appeal.
property of the estate 
the new jersey federal courts found that the fraudulently transferred funds were not property of atn bankruptcy estate in the florida litigation under because they were never recovered by atn pursuant to.we reject this analysis because it failed to address the central issue in this case what it means to recover property or the value of such property for the benefit of the estate.with respect to that issue,the new jersey federal courts applied too restrictive a definition of recover a definition that required atn to recover actual tangible possession of the funds before considering them part of its estate.that definition does not comport with the provisions of the bankruptcy code,as we discuss below.
circuit split 
the new jersey federal courts identified a split between the fifth circuit and the second and tenth circuits in addressing whether recovery of funds is required before they can be considered property of a bankruptcy estate.compare am.bank of austin mortgageamerica in re mortgageamerica,cir,with fdic hirsch in re colonial realty,cir,and rajala gardner,cir.the courts in both mortgageamerica and colonial realty interpreted a,which defines property of the estate as all property,wherever located and by whomever held,including all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.
mortgageamerica addressed whether property fraudulently transferred by a debtor remains the property of the debtor estate under a even though that property remains in the hands of third parties.at.the fifth circuit held that it does,noting that p roperty fraudulently conveyed and recoverable under the texas fraudulent
