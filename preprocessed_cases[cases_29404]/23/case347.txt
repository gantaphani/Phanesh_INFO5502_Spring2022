in august and october,filed individual actions against the four debtors in hamilton county,indiana small claims court.the actions sought payment on the debts owed to vincent.even though was given the right to collect the consumer debt for vincent,the hospital always maintained ownership of that debt.did not purchase consumer debt from vincent.yet,filed the lawsuits solely in its name as plaintiff.
in each case,filed the small claims complaint form,and it attached additional documents as part of the complaint.the small claims complaint form did not include vincent name as a creditor.on the form,described the claims sought as unpaid medical bills,and it directed readers of the complaints to see attached.in each case,the documents attached to the complaint form indicated that the debts were owed to vincent.
one of the documents attached in each case was a financial consent form that the debtor had signed prior to receiving treatment.in addition to establishing debtor liability to vincent,each financial consent form provided that the signatory was responsible for reasonable attorney fees if his or her hospital account was forwarded to a collection agency.

debtors learned from deposition testimony given by employees in an unrelated matter that filed approximately lawsuits against from about october to october.did not own the debt in any of these cases,but it always filed the lawsuits in its own name as plaintiff.demanded attorney fees in virtually all of these cases.in testimony,employees admitted that had agreements with vincent and other health care providers that it would be paid attorney fees and court costs incurred with respect to the debt collection.also would receive a percentage of the amounts collected after deduction of attorney fees and court costs.additionally,debtors learned,attorneys gaber,niper,and huston had internal agreements with whereby they would keep a certain percentage of attorney fees they had obtained usually or.the remainder or would go to.
on september,kelley,boyd,emous,and housely hereinafter referred to as plaintiffs filed suit against,huff,niper,gaber,and huston defendants in federal district court on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.they alleged that representations that it was entitled to attorney fees violated of the fdcpa,which generally prohibit the use of false,deceptive,or unfair means in connection with the collection of a debt.plaintiffs claimed that did not have the right to recover attorney fees from the plaintiffs without an assignment of ownership rights or contractual rights of the debt obligation from the health care provider that and its employees made false and misleading statements as to their entitlement to recover attorney fees and that they were harmed by deceptive demands for attorney fees.plaintiffs also made state law fraud and equity claims not at issue on appeal.they requested damages in an amount no less than all the attorney fees awarded to defendants by the state court.
on december,defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint.on february,the district court for the southern district of indiana dismissed plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court applied the doctrine in dismissing plaintiffs federal fdcpa claims and their state law claims.plaintiffs appeal the district court dismissal of their fdcpa claims only.
ii.analysis 
the doctrine derives its name from two supreme court decisions,rooker fidelity trust,and district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.it precludes lower federal court jurisdiction over claims seeking review of state court judgments no matter how erroneous or unconstitutional the state court judgment may be.brokaw weaver,cir citing remer burlington area sch,cir.the doctrine applies not only to claims that were actually raised before the state court,but also to claims that are inextricably intertwined with state court determinations.see feldman,at.a state litigant seeking review of a state court judgment must follow the appellate process through the state court system and then directly to the united states supreme court.see gash assocs.village of rosemont,cir.
the supreme court recently revisited the doctrine in exxon mobil saudi basic industries,d.the doctrine previously had been applied expansively.see exxon mobil,at.describing how lower courts at times had interpreted the doctrine to extend far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases.in exxon mobil,the court explicitly limited the doctrine.the doctrine now is a narrow doctrine,confined to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.lance dennis,d citing exxon mobil,at.the doctrine will not prevent a losing litigant from presenting an independent claim to a district court.exxon mobil,at.
in this case,plaintiffs argue that the doctrine does not bar federal subject matter jurisdiction.they divide their argument into two parts.first,they argue that their federal claims are independent of the state court judgments because their lawsuit seeks only to remedy defendants deceptive representations and requests related to attorney fees and not the fact that the state courts awarded attorney fees.second,they argue that even if the federal claims are not independent of the state court judgments,should not apply because they did not have reasonable opportunities to litigate their federal claims in state small claims court.defendants combat these arguments.in addition,they argue that even if does not apply,issue and claim preclusion do apply to bar the district court from entering judgments in plaintiffs favor.
we review de novo a district court determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction based on the doctrine.brokaw,at.a district court,in ruling upon an issue of subject matter jurisdiction,must accept as true all factual allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.capitol leasing fed.deposit ins,cir.
does not apply because plaintiffs federal claims are independent and distinct of the state court judgment 
as mentioned,plaintiffs carefully craft their argument so that their lawsuit seeks only to remedy defendants representations and requests related to attorney fees,and not the state court judgments granting those requests.they argue that the representations and requests were deceptive and in violation of the fdcpa.thus,they claim,all violations of the fdcpa occurred prior to the entry of the state court judgment
