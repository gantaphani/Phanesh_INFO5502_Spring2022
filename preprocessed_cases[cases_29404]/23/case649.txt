introduction 
following the entry of a judgment in favor of plaintiffs terence kilker and paula kilker the kilkers and against defendant frank stillman,the trial court ordered stillman to produce documents regarding his assets to the kilkers.after stillman failed to comply with that order,the trial court found stillman in contempt and ordered,inter alia,that stillman pay the kilkers reasonable attorney fees and costs,plus interest.the underlying judgment was eventually satisfied.
to collect on the attorney fees and costs award,the kilkers served a writ of execution on preferred bank to levy funds in stillman bank account.stillman submitted a claim of exemption to the writ.he asserted the funds in the account were social security payments exempt from levy under united states code section.the kilkers opposed stillman claim of exemption,arguing that under code of civil procedure section,only social security funds directly deposited into a bank account by the government are protected by the exemption.all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise specified.the trial court found stillman bank account at preferred bank solely contained social security payments,but,nevertheless,denied stillman exemption claim.the court did so because those funds were not directly deposited into the bank account by the government.the court conclusion was legally erroneous because stillman social security payments are protected by federal law from levy.
accordingly,we reverse.federal law protects social security funds from execution,levy,attachment,garnishment,or other legal process,or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.a.it is undisputed stillman bank account at preferred bank solely contained social security payments.the exemption under united states code section a thus applied to the social security payments in the preferred bank account.
the authorities,relied on by the kilkers,do not eliminate this protection of social security payments.true,under section,subdivision b,a judgment debtor,who receives social security payments by direct deposit,does not need to prove that the funds are exempt up to certain amounts.section,by providing such automatic exemption for direct deposit amounts,provides additional protection to social security payments that are directly deposited.but neither section,nor any other legal authority cited by the parties,supports the interpretation that section,subdivision b eliminates the availability of the united states code section a exemption as to social security payments that are not directly deposited into a bank account.
read together,these statutes make perfect sense if funds are directly deposited by the government,there is no need to trace their source.if they are not directly deposited,the judgment debtor may claim exemption from levy but must prove such funds were social security payments.stillman met that requirement.
background 
is entered against stillman.
in,the kilkers hired curcies coordinated construction,curcies,to build a swimming pool on their property.curcies,in turn,hired stillman to provide soil testing in connection with the pool construction.stillman prepared a soils report,and curcies built the pool.in,the kilkers sued curcies,stillman,and others for damages they sustained after the mastic seal of the pool separated.the kilkers and stillman entered into a settlement agreement whereby stillman agreed to pay the kilkers.after stillman failed to timely pay the settlement amount,the trial court entered judgment in favor of the kilkers and against stillman in the amount of.
the kilkers efforts to execute on the judgment 
on july,stillman was ordered to provide the kilkers counsel with certain documents on or before august the july order,a few days before stillman judgment debtor examination scheduled for august stillman did not produce the documents.
the kilkers attempted to collect on the judgment by levying on stillman bank account at union bank.the trial court denied stillman claim of exemption from execution of the funds contained in that account.stillman appealed from that order and this court dismissed the appeal due to stillman failure to timely designate the record.
the kilkers also attempted to collect on the judgment by levying on real property referred to as the railroad street property.shortly before the date that had been noticed for the sheriff sale of the railroad street property,luis arriaga,as successor trustee of the walla walla group trust,an irrevocable trust,tendered a third party claim to the sheriff,asserting that the trust owned the railroad street property.the sheriff sale was cancelled.
the kilkers filed a petition to establish the invalidity of the trust third party claim,in which they asserted stillman transfer of the railroad street property to the trust in constituted a fraudulent conveyance under the uniform fraudulent transfer act,et.
following a bench trial,the court found the trust third party claim to the railroad street property invalid.this court affirmed the judgment in favor of the kilkers,holding that substantial evidence showed stillman transferred the railroad street property to the trust with the actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor,within the meaning of civil code section.kilker stillman,nonpub.opn.
the trial court finds stillman in contempt for violating the july order and awards the kilkers attorney fees and costs,plus interest.
in march,a trial was held to determine whether stillman should be found in contempt for violating the july order.the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that stillman was aware of the july order requiring him to produce documents to the kilkers counsel and that stillman willfully failed to comply with that order.stillman was found in contempt of court pursuant to section,subdivision a.the court imposed a fine,a sentence in the orange county jail,and placed stillman on three years probation.the imposition of the jail sentence was stayed pending stillman successful completion of the terms of his probation,which included stillman production of all documents he was previously ordered to provide to the kilkers counsel.the court also ordered stillman to pay the kilkers reasonable attorney fees and costs that they had incurred in connection with the contempt proceedings,which were later determined to be in the amount of,plus interest.
the trial court denies stillman exemption claim as to the preferred bank account containing social security funds stillman appeals.
at a point in time not specified in the record,the kilkers recovered from stillman the full amount awarded to them under the judgment.the kilkers attempted to collect the attorney fees and costs award by serving a writ of execution on preferred bank,in an effort to levy of the total amount of contained in stillman bank account.stillman submitted a claim of exemption on the ground that all the funds in that bank account were social security payments and thus were exempt from levy under united states code section a.
the kilkers filed an opposition to stillman exemption claim,in which they argued the funds were not exempt from levy because they were not directly deposited by the government or its agent within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and no evidence showed otherwise the funds in the account were not used by stillman for living expenses as evidenced by stillman testimony at his judgment debtor examination that the walla walla group trust he created paid his expenses and stillman did not meet his burden of establishing that all the funds in the levied preferred bank account were exempt social security payments.
at the hearing on the exemption claim,the trial court rejected the kilkers final argument,stating i agree you look at the numbers,it pretty clear that everything in that account is social security money.i agree with that.nevertheless,the court denied stillman exemption claim.the trial court set forth its rulings in an order,dated march,as follows
