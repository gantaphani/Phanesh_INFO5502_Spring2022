we are,once again,called upon to interpret and apply the massachusetts consumer protection statute.laws ch.chapter.this case has humble origins a dispute over several late fees the pondview condominium trustees charged to one of their residents,appellant william mcdermott mcdermott,after he did pay his condominium fees on time.unable to resolve the matter with mcdermott,the trustees hired law firm appellee marcus,errico,emmer and brooks,meeb,to collect from mcdermott.soon enough,what began as a disagreement quickly blossomed into litigation in the state and federal courts.we are concerned here with the complaint mcdermott filed against meeb in the federal district court.mcdermott alleged that meeb collections activities violated both chapter and the federal fair debt collection practices act,u.et fdcpa.
a magistrate judge held a bench trial and initially found in mcdermott favor on both counts.she awarded mcdermott on his chapter count,and on the fdcpa claim.both parties filed motions for reconsideration,following which the magistrate judge reversed in part,finding meeb not liable under chapter,and leaving mcdermott with only the recovery under the fdcpa.
mcdermott timely appeal followed.
background 
the magistrate issued a page written decision following a bench trial.see mcdermott marcus,errico,emmer brooks,d.we have no need to fully detail the extensive factual background in order to decide the narrow issues before us,and we commend the magistrate judge thorough decision to the reader seeking a full.we need only sketch a rough outline of the,which we do based on the magistrate judge factual findings,the vast majority of which are unchallenged on appeal.
mcdermott owned two units and at the pondview condominiums,a unit condominium in lynn,massachusetts.pondview trustees from now on collectively referred to as pondview,as permitted by the condominium documents,required all unit owners to pay monthly assessments for the upkeep of common areas and facilities,along with several other types of monthly fees any assessments not paid on time incurred a late payment fee,which acted as a lien against the owner unit.if pondview had to turn the matter over to collections,the condominium documents allowed for the assessment of attorney fees,late charges,and collection costs against the offending owner.
mcdermott lost his job in.he fell behind on his condominium fees for both units in july of that year,and the next month he fell behind on the late payment fees,too.in september,mcdermott agreed to pay two months of condominium and late fees for unit but not unit by september.although mcdermott ended up making payments for both units by september,this did not bring the accounts current because he did not pay all of the late fees.
in the first of a series of unfortunate misunderstandings,mcdermott seems to have thought his september payments brought him.compounding his troubles,mcdermott paid his october monthly assessment for unit late,triggering another late fee.he fell further behind in december.
on december,pondview sent mcdermott a letter detailing how much he owed for unit.the letter also told mcdermott that,pursuant to the condominium documents,he was being charged late fees for payments received after the of the month during which each of the payments were due according to pondview,by the end of mcdermott owed,including late payment fees,on unit and for unit.mcdermott,however,let pondview know that he disagreed with the late fee assessments and would not pay them.by the time march rolled around,mcdermott had not paid condominium fees,loan payback charges,or late fees for either unit for january,february,and march.
having apparently decided enough was enough,pondview brought in meeb to collect mcdermott debt.meeb informed mcdermott in a march,letter that he owed on unit,an amount it said encompassed collection costs and attorney fees.a separate letter with the same date told mcdermott he owed on unit.mcdermott,who does not appear to have by this point,stood by his refusal to pay.
over the approximately years between april and september,meeb filed nine collection actions in massachusetts state court against mcdermott.mcdermott retained counsel somewhere along the way the exact date is not important here.five of meeb collection suits related to unit,and four related to unit.only two reached trial,but meeb won them both and was awarded attorney fees to boot 
during the course of its collection activities,and while litigation was ongoing,meeb repeatedly contacted the mortgagees on each of mcdermott units without his knowledge or consent,informed them of mcdermott delinquencies,and demanded payment directly from them.when asked to do so,the mortgagees accommodated meeb and paid the amounts requested.they then passed these costs on to mcdermott by tacking them onto the outstanding mortgages.further,meeb occasionally contacted mcdermott directly,despite knowing he was represented by counsel.
displeased with meeb collection activities,mcdermott filed suit against the firm in the federal district court for massachusetts on february.his complaint alleged a variety of violations of federal the fdcpa and state chapter law 
specifically,mcdermott took issue with the wording of several collection letters,contending they were deliberately misleading,sporadic,inconsistent,confusing,and contained numerous errors and double billings.he also alleged meeb consistently and deliberately misleadingly,confusingly,and deceptively conflated its legal fees with condominium assessments in most of its communications concerning his debts,and made certain oppressive and extortive statements to him in violation of the fdcpa.mcdermott further complained about meeb direct contacts with himself and his mortgagees.mcdermott wrapped up his complaint by espousing his theory that meeb ran up between and in legal fees by its deliberate,intentional provocation of a dispute between pondview and himself over in unlawful late fees and by its other,relentless,egregious,unfair,deceptive,false,misleading,oppressive,and abusive violations of the fdcpa.
after trial,the magistrate judge found that although meeb acted at all times in good faith and that none of its actions were deceptive,it nevertheless committed numerous violations of the fdcpa.the details of each fdcpa violation are not important for our purposes,other than that the judge found none of them were in bad faith the magistrate judge further determined that,pursuant to regulations issued by the massachusetts attorney general,meeb fdcpa violations served as a basis for imposing liability under chapter,even though meeb had not committed any unfair or deceptive acts.in other words,she found the fdcpa violations constituted per se violations of chapter.she also found,however,that meeb did not commit any unfair or deceptive acts that could give rise to chapter liability independent of the per se violations.ultimately,the magistrate judge awarded mcdermott under the fdcpa,and for the chapter violations.
meeb subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to.e the magistrate judge reviewed a case from the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc interpreting chapter,klairmont gainsboro restaurant,determined her finding of per se chapter violations was incorrect as a matter of law,and vacated the judgment on that count.see mcdermott marcus,errico,emmer brooks,d.she did not disturb her findings with respect to meeb fdcpa violations.as a result of the magistrate judge reconsideration,mcdermott saw his recovery slashed from to.
unsatisfied with this outcome,mcdermott appealed to us.

iii.discussion 
mcdermott raises several discrete arguments in this appeal.first and foremost,he says the magistrate judge erred when she snatched away his victory on the chapter count because meeb fdcpa violations give rise to per se chapter liability,without the need of showing that they are unfair or deceptive.next,he argues that the magistrate judge should have found meeb violated the fdcpa by charging him excessive legal fees.last but not least,and predicated upon the assumption that we will conclude meeb is liable to him under chapter on some theory,mcdermott takes the position that meeb violation of chapter entitles him to an award of multiple damages.not surprisingly,meeb disagrees with each of mcdermott arguments and asks us to affirm the magistrate judge orders.
we address these topics in turn.
chapter liability 
the basics and the concept of per se liability 
this appeal requires us to interpret and apply massachusetts consumer protection law as embodied in chapter.more specifically,we are called upon to look at the concept of per se chapter liability.we open with a primer on the statute,discuss the concept of per se violations,and finally address the parties arguments on appeal.
because mcdermott chapter arguments implicate matters of state law,we apply the substantive law of massachusetts.see dykes depuy,cir when facing a claim that does not arise under the constitution or the laws of the united states,a federal court must apply the substantive law of the forum in which it sits see also skinner,recognizing that it is not the function of a federal court to construe a state statute contrary to the construction given it by the highest court of a state.this is so even where we are dealing with a claim brought under supplemental jurisdiction,such as mcdermott chapter claim.dykes,at.
the massachusetts statute at issue here,chapter,straightforwardly declares that u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful.laws ch,a.t he intent of the legislature is that a court hearing a chapter claim will be guided by the interpretations given by the federal trade commission and the federal courts to section a of the federal trade commission act a,as from time to time amended.laws ch,b.the statute permits the massachusetts attorney general to implement rules and regulations interpreting the provisions of chapter,but these shall not be inconsistent with the rules,regulations and decisions of the federal trade commission and the federal courts interpreting the provisions of the federal trade commission act,as from time to time amended.laws ch,c.
although chapter broadly prohibits unfair and deceptive conduct in trade or commerce,the statute does not spell out what specific actions make the grade doing so would not be feasible anyway because,as the sjc has observed,t here is no limit to human inventiveness in this field.kattar demoulas,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.thus,whether or not particular conduct violates chapter is generally determined on a basis.see id.
nevertheless,massachusetts courts have recognized that violations of a limited number of statutes automatically give rise to liability under chapter.see,polaroid travelers indem,violation of state unfair claims settlement act.laws ch,constitutes violation of chapter reddish bowen,d,same with respect to a home improvement contractor violation of.laws ch.this automatic liability,which the parties refer to as per se liability,could be thought of as a species of strict liability.in the instances where the massachusetts appellate courts have found per se chapter liability based on a statutory violation,such conclusion,as we discuss hereafter,was grounded on explicit statutory language.
with respect to unfair claims settlement act violations like those addressed in polaroid,per se chapter liability arises directly from the consumer protection act itself.chapter provides that a ny person whose rights are affected by another person violating the provisions of clause of section three of chapter one hundred and d,the unfair claims settlement act may bring an action in the superior court.laws ch.in accordance with this statutory text,the sjc has recognized that a consumer asserting a claim under chapter,may recover for violations of chapter,cl,without regard to whether the violation was unlawful under chapter,because of the explicit statement to that effect in chapter.polaroid,at.thus,chapter itself established that an act that violates the unfair claims settlement act violates chapter as well.voil√†,per se liability.
but chapter language is not the only way to get to per se liability it may also arise through the text of an independent statute,as in reddish.the statute at issue there,chapter,regulates home improvement contractors and provides that v iolations of any of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act under the provisions of chapter.laws ch.one of the act provisions prohibits contractors from committing any violation of the building laws of the commonwealth.laws ch.the massachusetts appeals court has applied this plain language to conclude that a home improvement contractor violation of the massachusetts building code,thanks to chapter,constituted an unfair or deceptive act under chapter by operation of chapter.reddish,at.thus,reddish points the way along this alternative path,the text of an independent statute to per se chapter liability.
taken together,these cases demonstrate a recognition by the massachusetts courts that the commonwealth legislature has decreed that a limited number of certain statutory violations automatically violate the consumer protection act as well.whether the per se liability comes about through language the legislature incorporated directly into chapter referencing another statute as is the case with chapter,or whether it arises from the text of an independent statute keep chapter in mind,it is a clear directive by the legislature that a violation of that particular statute constitutes an automatic violation of chapter,without the need of showing the act was otherwise unfair or deceptive or occurred in trade or commerce.this concept is critical to our resolution of the arguments on appeal.
per se chapter liability after klairmont 
we proceed to the parties particular arguments about meeb per se chapter liability.the question they have placed before us is narrow although chapter is a statute of broad applicability,kattar,at,in the wake of what they both consider to be the key case,klairmont gainsboro restaurant,do fdcpa violations give rise to per se liability under chapter,because the parties have relied so extensively on klairmont,an extended discussion of it is required in order to place the parties arguments in context.and,although the magistrate judge interpreted and applied klairmont,we consider its import de novo.see casavant norwegian cruise line,finding that the boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a chapter violation is a question of law internal quotation marks omitted 
klairmont involved the alleged wrongful death of a college student who,while in the midst of a cell phone conversation,fell down a flight of steps at a bar.at.the stairway,it turned out,was a bad stairway.not only was the very presence of the stairs obscured with hanging vinyl strips,the stairs themselves violated the massachusetts building code in multiple respects.for example,the stairway was not equipped with a door and landing at the top,there were no hand rails,and the riser and tread dimensions did not meet the building code dimensional requirements.id.at.furthermore,the had rebuilt the stairs years before the decedent fall,yet when they did so they failed to acquire a building permit or to comply with the building code.id.at.moreover,the defendants knew that building permits and a change in use permit were required,as evidenced by the fact that the defendants filed,and then abandoned,multiple building permit and change in use permit applications.id.at.
the plaintiffs decedent parents brought a chapter count premised solely on the defendant noncompliance with the massachusetts building code see id.at.they grounded their chapter theory on the interplay between chapter,and an attorney general regulation declaring that a violation of a state statute providing for public health,safety,or welfare is itself a chapter violation see id.in essence,the plaintiffs claimed the defendants were liable under chapter because they knew about the building code violations but failed to do anything about them.
the defendants took a different tack.they argued that should not be construed in such a way as to transform every act that violates a statute concerned with public health,safety,or welfare into a chapter violation because doing so would enshrine chapter as the preeminent law of the commonwealth.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the defendants sought to convince the sjc that it was not enough for the plaintiffs to simply show a building code violation.instead,the defendants urged,they must prove the defendants acts were unfair or deceptive before the defendants could run afoul of chapter.id.
taking on these arguments,the sjc first noted that the building code may qualify as a regulation meant for the protection of the public health,safety,or welfare that is of concern to.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,in light of the attorney general regulation,a violation of the building code opens a defendant up to the possibility of chapter liability.see id.at t o the extent the defendants contend that as a matter of law,chapter does not apply to claims premised on violations of the building code,we reject the argument.
yet,that the building code is embraced by the unquestionably broad ambit of does not by itself render its violation a per se violation of chapter id.the reach of the regulation emanating as it does from the attorney general rather than the legislature is bound by the scope of chapter,a.id.this means that under a violation of a law or regulation will be a violation of chapter,a,only if the conduct leading to the violation is both unfair or deceptive and occurs in trade or commerce.id.by making this pronouncement,the sjc sharply limited the occasions on which an unlawful act will lead to liability under chapter through operation of the attorney general regulations.
the sjc,reiterating that whether the particular violation or violations qualify as unfair or deceptive conduct is best discerned from the circumstances of each case,id.internal quotation marks omitted,proceeded to review the evidence in the record relevant to the plaintiffs chapter claim.first,it concluded the defendants conduct was unfair and deceptive within the meaning of chapter because the defendants consciously violated the building code for more than twenty years,thereby creating hazardous conditions in a place of public assembly where alcohol is served to commercial patrons.id.next,the sjc concluded the unfair and deceptive conduct occurred in trade or commerce because the victim was the bar patron at the time of his accident,and because the defendants knowingly failed to acquire the required permits in order to avoid the expense of building code compliance to their restaurant and bar business.id.at.accordingly,the sjc found the defendants conduct met both prongs of chapter.
the course of the sjc analysis in klairmont demonstrates exactly what it meant when it said that is bound by the scope of chapter despite the regulation broad wording purporting to do so,the attorney general is not empowered to issue regulations rendering certain statutory violations per se chapter violations.indeed,the sjc went out of its way to say that the trial judge got it wrong when she said the defendants building code violations were per se violative of chapter.
the lesson of klairmont may be summed up as so the massachusetts attorney general regulatory authority to make rules and regulations interpreting chapter,a.laws ch,c,does not extend so far as to permit her to allow a plaintiff to show that a defendant has violated an independent statute in lieu of satisfying chapter substantive requirements of showing the act was both unfair and deceptive and that it occurred in trade or commerce.
per se chapter liability and the fdcpa 
we come now to mcdermott arguments that meeb fdcpa violations result in per se chapter liability.he advances two separate,but related,grounds.
first,using the federal statute as his starting point,mcdermott observes the fdcpa states any act that violates its provisions also violates the federal trade commission act ftc act.according to mcdermott,the ftc act is chapter federal equivalent.by enacting chapter,he argues,the massachusetts legislature grafted federal consumer protection law,including the fdcpa,onto state law.in his view,this means that a violation of the fdcpa violates the ftc act and,by extension,chapter.
second,mcdermott focuses on a regulation promulgated by the massachusetts attorney general which is similar to the one addressed in klairmont,and which explicitly provides that violations of federal consumer protection law count as chapter violations.see.the fdcpa,he maintains,is just such a consumer protection law.in mcdermott view,and thanks to this regulation,one who violates the fdcpa necessarily violates chapter at the same time.
not so fast,says meeb.first,it does not contest the magistrate judge finding that it committed fdcpa violations.but,in its eyes,the sjc klairmont opinion was explicit that even per se chapter violations are subject to a trade or commerce requirement.in other words,a per se violation is not truly per se,as per se findings satisfy chapter first prong only,that the conduct at issue is unfair or deceptive.a plaintiff here,mcdermott still has the burden of proving the conduct occurred in the course of trade or commerce.because all of its interactions with mcdermott were related to its representation of pondview in a private dispute,meeb did not act in a business context with respect to mcdermott and,therefore,did not act in trade or commerce when it violated the fdcpa.it follows,according to meeb,that it may not be held liable under chapter.
notably,meeb misunderstands mcdermott arguments as being limited solely to a claim that per se liability arises through the attorney general regulation.as such,meeb does not respond to mcdermott first argument that per se liability can also come from chapter federal equivalent,the ftc act.therefore,we will first turn our attention to mcdermott argument that per se liability arises under the attorney general regulation.
attorney general regulation 
in light of our discussion of klairmont,mcdermott argument that per se chapter liability may be imposed by is easily disposed of.although klairmont involved a different attorney general regulation,the two are substantially similar 
without limiting the scope of any other rule,regulation or statute,an act or practice is a violation of chapter,if 
it fails to comply with existing statutes,rules,regulations or laws,meant for the protection of the public health,safety or welfare promulgated by the commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof intended to provide the consumers of this commonwealth protection or 
it violates the federal trade commission act,the federal consumer credit protection act or other federal consumer protection statutes within the purview of chapter.
the regulation mcdermott relies upon states that conduct which violates a federal consumer protection statute,like the fdcpa,also violates chapter for our purposes,the only relevant substantive difference between klairmont regulation,and mcdermott,is the source of law looks to state consumer protection law,while refers to federal consumer protection law.compare referring to massachusetts statutes intended to provide the consumers of this commonwealth protection with referring to federal consumer protection statutes within the purview of chapter.
the logic underpinning klairmont is clearly applicable here.we can conceive of no plausible rationale,and none has been suggested to us,for treating these two provisions differently based solely on the origin of the specific consumer protection law with which each is concerned.indeed,finding klairmont reasoning inapplicable to would enshrine a distinction without a difference as a matter of massachusetts law.this we refuse to do.
we,therefore,conclude that just as the scope of is bound by the strictures of chapter,including the requirements of showing unfair and deceptive conduct occurring in trade or commerce,so too is limited by those same requirements.because the attorney general is not permitted to regulate away these two requirements with respect to chapter claims based on violations of state consumer protection law,the attorney general may not do likewise when the claimed violation arises out of federal consumer protection law.applying klairmont reasoning,we reject mcdermott argument that renders meeb violations of the fdcpa per se violative of chapter.
ii.per se liability through federal consumer protection law 
reaching this conclusion does not settle the entire matter.although meeb seeks to characterize mcdermott liability arguments as premised solely on the attorney general regulation,mcdermott has in fact also argued per se liability arises through chapter incorporation of federal consumer protection law into state law.his position is premised on the notion that massachusetts incorporated federal unfair competition law into state law when it enacted chapter.
as it turns out,the ftc act is quite similar to chapter.like chapter,it provides that unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce are unlawful.a see also.laws ch,a u nfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.chapter echo of the ftc act language,along with the legislative directive that courts interpreting chapter are to be guided by the federal courts interpretation of this statute,see.laws ch,b,are important indications that mcdermott is on the right track.
decades ago,the sjc addressed the connection between federal consumer protection law and chapter.the sjc announced with striking clarity that massachusetts has wholly incorporated the ftc act,a,into chapter.slaney westwood auto.chapter,it explained on another occasion,was enacted in,partly in response to a federal trade commission policy to stop unfair practices on a state level before they become interstate problems.purity supreme,attorney general.to effectuate this underlying motivation,chapter incorporates the extensive body of federal administrative and decisional law under the ftc act,at least in so far as it relates to definitions of unfair and deceptive.id.internal citation omitted.lest there be any doubt that the sjc has changed its thinking over the years,it recently stated that chapter defines unfair acts or practices by reference to interpretations of those terms in the federal trade commission act,a,in which chapter has its roots.kraft power merrill.it follows that,because massachusetts has folded the ftc act into chapter,unfair or deceptive conduct that violates the ftc act also violates chapter.
having come this far,we turn to the next part of mcdermott argument,which is that per se liability arises through operation of the fdcpa.the fdcpa explicitly provides that a violation of its provisions shall be deemed an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of the ftc act.a.
at this point,it is helpful to recall our previous discussion of the alternative paths to per se chapter liability the text of chapter itself,or the text of an independent statute.the fdcpa language we just quoted is substantially similar to.laws ch.provision imposing per se chapter liability on home contractors for violations of chapter.in other words,just as chapter does with respect to chapter,the fdcpa establishes that an unfair debt collection act in violation of the fdcpa is a per se violation of the ftc act.and because massachusetts has wholly incorporated the ftc act and its interpretation into state consumer protection law,a violation of the fdcpa not only per se violates the ftc act,it also constitutes a per se chapter violation.
to drive the point home,we will make one more comparison to state law.although not cited by either party,massachusetts has its own unfair debt collection statute.laws ch,which is entitled debt collection in an unfair,deceptive or unreasonable manner.the statute reads as follows 
n o one who is a creditor or an attorney for a creditor,or an assignee of a creditor,of a natural person present or residing in massachusetts who has incurred a debt primarily for personal,family or household purposes shall collect or attempt to collect such debt in an unfair,deceptive or unreasonable manner.
laws ch.it goes on to list various actions that shall be deemed unfair,deceptive or unreasonable.id.included is a prohibition against a debt collector communicat ing directly with the alleged debtor after notification from an attorney representing such debtor that all further communications relative to the debt should be addressed to that attorney.laws ch,b.finally,violations of the statute lead to chapter liability,as f ailure to comply with the provisions of this section shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the provisions of chapter.laws ch,cl.
here,the magistrate judge found that meeb violated the fdcpa by,among other things,contacting mcdermott despite its awareness that he was represented by counsel.although mcdermott has not advanced any claims under the state debt collection statute,it is clear that this particular fdcpa violation would have violated state debt collection law as well.and,by virtue of chapter clear language,it would have constituted an unfair or deceptive act or practice for chapter purposes that meeb direct contact of mcdermott would have led to per se chapter liability under the state debt collection statute provides yet another reason for interpreting the similar language in the ftc act and the fdcpa in the same way.
summing up,and although our analysis differs markedly from the magistrate judge,we conclude meeb violations of the fdcpa constitute per se chapter violations by virtue of the unambiguous statutory language in the fdcpa and the ftc act.the sjc klairmont opinion does nothing to alter this reasoning,as klairmont determined only that attorney general regulations are bound by the scope of chapter.klairmont simply did not address per se chapter liability arising through an independent statute.the magistrate judge,therefore,committed an error of law when she concluded that klairmont required a separate trade or commerce finding in these circumstances.accordingly,to the extent that the magistrate judge vacated the judgment in favor of mcdermott on his chapter claim,we reverse 
excessive,redundant,or otherwise unnecessary attorney fees in violation of the fdcpa 
mcdermott next argues that the magistrate judge should have found that meeb violated the fdcpa by charging and attempting to collect from him excessive,redundant,or otherwise unnecessary attorney fees.appellant br.at.to get to this conclusion,mcdermott first cites several massachusetts cases for the proposition that charging excessive fees violates massachusetts law.working from this premise,he directs our attention to language in the fdcpa which includes in its definition of unfair debt collection practices the collection of any amount including any interest,fee,charge,or expense incidental to the principal obligation unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.
after setting forth this basic position,mcdermott argues meeb was obligated to prove at trial that its fees were reasonable.mcdermott says meeb is unable to do so because it violated.laws ch,which mcdermott contends required it to send notices to mcdermott mortgagees.according to mcdermott,these notices were intended to allow the mortgagee to make up the mortgagor deficiency,and therefore avoid a lawsuit.per mcdermott,had meeb sent out the notices as required,then his mortgagees would have paid the debt in order to avoid suit.therefore,he urges us to find that meeb failure to send out notices resulted in meeb filing unnecessary lawsuits and,by extension,charging him unnecessary fees.
meeb makes several responses to these arguments.the only one with which we need concern ourselves is meeb position that mcdermott is attempting to raise a new legal theory on appeal.meeb says that mcdermott theory at trial was consistent with the allegations in his verified complaint that meeb was responsible for causing an unreasonable,unfair,unlawful,unexplained,and retroactive change in pondview policy for the specific purpose of precipitating a dispute with mcdermott in order to generate legal fees for meeb.appellee br.at.having failed to make those allegations stick,meeb says mcdermott is now impermissibly attempt ing to recast his theory of liability solely under u,previously having asserted that the alleged underlying conduct violated various other provisions of the fdcpa.id.at.
having reviewed the record,we agree with meeb that mcdermott excessive fees theory has been advanced for the first time on appeal.following the bench trial,the magistrate judge ordered each side to submit a brief of no more than pages detailing their legal positions and requests for findings of fact and rulings of law.mcdermott filed a page brief,which included a footnote seeking to incorporate by reference all other legal arguments it raised throughout the history of this case.see pl post trial brief,dist.docket entry at.in a docket order,the magistrate judge allowed the oversized brief,with the exception of that footnote.see dist.docket entry.mcdermott has not appealed this particular ruling,so we will concentrate only on the theories mcdermott espoused in his brief.
from his opening line,mcdermott took the position that he proved at trial that meeb main objective in its activities was to run up its attorneys fees to pondview,which pondview then assessed to mcdermott,and which meeb then collected from mcdermott mortgagees in part.pl.post trial br.at.he went on to reference,but that reference is in concert with,which prohibits debt collectors from engag ing in any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass,oppress,or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt.he then told the magistrate judge that meeb violated these two statutes when 
it engaged in a convoluted collection procedure which inevitably caused miscommunication,lack of communication,confusion,and acrimony that escalated litigation costs and served as a pretext for meeb to evade its obligation under to apply payments of mcdermott debt as he directed and not to debts he disputed and for meeb to provide mcdermott with communications which were illegible,deceptive,and incomprehensible in violation of,and.
id.these arguments smack of chapter claims of unfair and deceptive conduct.indeed,the title of each and every subsection in mcdermott brief referred to meeb bad faith.
however,is aimed at something else entirely.the statute prohibits attempts to collect any amount unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.although mcdermott successfully asserted claims that meeb violated other provisions of the fdcpa,nowhere in his brief does he take the position that the amount of his debts were not authorized by the condominium agreement further,he did not even hint at the pathway to a violation that he advances in this appeal.instead,following trial mcdermott focused his arguments on meeb alleged bad faith and intentional violations of federal and state law.
in this circuit,it is a virtually ironclad rule that a party may not advance for the first time on appeal either a new argument or an old argument that depends on a new factual predicate.cochran quest software,cir see also united states slade,cir it is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court,she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.our review of the record leaves us with no doubt that mcdermott liability theory in this appeal was never raised to the magistrate judge.accordingly,we will not consider it further.
multiple damages for willful or intentional conduct 
mcdermott next says the magistrate judge should have multiplied the damages award thanks to meeb knowing violations of chapter.chapter,requires a court to double or treble a plaintiff damages if that court finds a defendant violation of chapter was a willing or knowing violation of chapter.
to get here,mcdermott argues that the magistrate judge committed an error of law when she found meeb was not obligated under.laws ch.to send notices to mcdermott mortgagees.according to mcdermott,had the magistrate judge gotten this legal ruling right,it would have provided a basis for finding that meeb willfully or intentionally violated chapter since it was aware of his mortgagees names and addresses,thereby bringing the damages multiplier into play.separately,mcdermott argues that the magistrate judge clearly erred when she considered the evidence and found meeb fdcpa violations which resulted in per se chapter liability were not in bad faith.the judge,he says,should have found meeb willfully violated chapter and awarded multiple damages for that reason.
meeb urges us to affirm the magistrate judge determination that it did not act in bad faith.meeb first says the magistrate judge was correct when she determined that meeb did have to send any notices under chapter.thus,chapter provides no basis for imposing multiple damages in meeb view.with respect to its purported bad faith,meeb points out that the magistrate judge,in her initial decision,imposed per se chapter liability only,explicitly finding meeb had not acted in bad faith or intentionally violated the law.this conclusion,meeb asserts,was based on the evidence at trial and should not be uprooted on appeal.
we see no basis for reversal on this record.
the interpretation of chapter requirements presents a legal question,which we review de novo.the specific provision upon which mcdermott relies,chapter,c contains the following relevant language 
when any portion of the unit owner share of the common expenses has been delinquent for at least sixty days the organization of unit owners shall send a notice stating the amount of the delinquency to the unit owner by certified and first class mail.the organization of unit owners shall also send a notice stating the amount of the delinquency to the fist mortgagee by certified and first class mail,provided,that the first mortgagee has informed the organization of unit owners of its name and mailing address.
the key language in this passage is the clear statement establishing that the notice requirement is triggered only if the first mortgagee has informed the organization of unit owners of its name and mailing address.id.per the unambiguous statutory language,such notice by the mortgagee essentially allows a mortgagee to opt in to the receipt of deficiency notices.while mcdermott argues that the evidence shows meeb was aware of his mortgagee identity and address,there is no evidence in the record that any mortgagee ever informed meeb of this information,which is required to bring the statute into play.
mcdermott,without providing any convincing reason to do so,asks us to simply ignore this requirement and pick and choose to apply only that statutory language which benefits him.but where,as here,a massachusetts statute is unambiguous,our function is to enforce the statute according to its terms.reading co op.bank suffolk constr.we therefore decline mcdermott invitation to rewrite the statute to facilitate the outcome he desires.
accordingly,we conclude from the plain language of the statute that the magistrate judge did not commit an error of law in finding that meeb was not required to send notices to any mortgagee that had not informed meeb of its name and address.mcdermott may not rely on chapter in an attempt to demonstrate that meeb acted in bad faith.
meeb alleged bad faith 
mcdermott is now left with his argument that the magistrate judge clearly erred when she found that meeb did not intentionally violate chapter and that its actions were not motivated by bad faith,and again when she declined to award multiple damages.ultimately,chapter ties liability for multiple damages to the degree of the defendant culpability.kattar,at.a reviewing court will only overturn a trial judge finding in this regard if it was clearly erroneous.id.citing clegg butler,see also smith,at where a trial judge finding as to an actor motivation following a bench trial is plausible,appellate review is at an end.mcdermott faces an uphill climb on this claim,and he is unable to reach the summit.
the magistrate judge had a seat to each witness testimony on direct and over the course of the bench trial.her page written decision summarized the testimony and set forth her credibility determinations she concluded meeb did not conduct itself in such a manner as to intentionally pump up its legal fees,and that it was instead motivated by its desire to zealously represent pondview interests.the magistrate judge further noted that in at least one instance,meeb incorrect statement about the amount owed by mcdermott went in mcdermott favor,meeb said he owed less than he really did,which supports her finding that meeb was not simply trying to increase its legal fees.
at the end of the day,the magistrate judge found that meeb acted in good faith,that it did not willfully or knowingly violate chapter,and that its conduct was neither unfair nor deceptive.on this record,we are unable to say the magistrate judge findings were clearly erroneous.and in the absence of intentional or bad faith violations of chapter,meeb is not liable for double or treble damages.
iv.conclusion 
in light of the foregoing,the magistrate judge order with respect to meeb rule e motion to reconsider alter and amend the judgment is hereby reversed to the extent the magistrate judge determined meeb is not liable under chapter.we therefore remand this matter to the magistrate judge with instructions to reinstate the original judgment in mcdermott favor on his chapter count.the magistrate judge resolution of the parties rule e motions is affirmed in all other respects.the parties shall bear their own costs.
at the outset of the case,the parties mutually agreed to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge over all proceedings,including trial.
monthly fees included a loan payback charge,which was either part of a special assessment or a line item in pondview budget.
the magistrate judge found that meeb was not involved in the decision to impose a charge for delinquent loan payback charges or to change any policy to impose late fees.
in one of these cases the state court awarded in attorney fees,approximately half of what meeb had sought.
mcdermott complaint grounded federal jurisdiction on,as his was an action arising under the constitution,law,or treaties of the united states.he also invoked the federal court supplemental jurisdiction to decide his chapter claims.although in an apparent typographical error mcdermott complaint cited the wrong statute for supplemental jurisdiction the instead of,meeb has never asked the federal courts to decline the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.
the magistrate judge also found some of mcdermott fdcpa claims,having been brought outside of the fdcpa limitations period,were barred as untimely.
mcdermott filed one too,but we need not discuss it as mcdermott does not appeal its denial.
neither does the statute define trade or commerce.
some years ago,we noted that a violation of the fdcpa is a per se violation of chapter.french corporate receivables,cir.and before that,we stated that a violation of a federal consumer protection statute constitutes a per se violation of chapter,a.barnes fleet bank,cir.these conclusory statements,devoid of substantive analysis or explanation,are not particularly helpful to our analysis here.further,these cases were decided prior to klairmont,which controls our interpretation of state law.
the bar itself and trustees of the legal entity that owned the real estate on which it was located.
they also brought general negligence claims,but those are not germane here.
the regulation provides thatan act or practice is a violation of chapter,if it fails to comply with existing statutes,rules,regulations or laws,meant for the protection of the public health,safety,or welfare promulgated by the commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof intended to provide the consumers of this commonwealth protection.
indeed,the sjc noted in no uncertain terms that the trial judge misstated the law when she said that the defendants b uilding c ode violations were per se deceptive and unfair acts or practices.id.at emphasis added.
the parties take it for granted that the fdcpa is a federal consumer protection statute within the purview of chapter,as required by the attorney general regulation.the district courts that have considered the issue have concluded that it is.see in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,d,dean compass receivables mgmt,d.the correctness of these holdings is confirmed by the text of the fdcpa itself,which sets forth one of its purposes as to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.thus,we agree the fdcpa is a consumer protection statute for the purposes of chapter.
at first blush,chapter may not appear to provide for per se chapter liability because it does not address the trade or commerce requirement.yet,chapter applies specifically to debt collectors.and a debt collector business is,by definition,collecting debts.although we need not decide the issue here,we would be to imagine why a debt collector who violates chapter would not be acting in trade or commerce with respect to the particular debtor.
before moving on,we note meeb contention that because certain fdcpa violations found by the magistrate judge occurred outside of the fdcpa limitations period,these untimely claims can not serve as the basis for chapter liability.the massachusetts appellate courts have unambiguously held that a chapter claim is subject to chapter limitations period.see fine huygens,dimella,shaffer,a chapter claim need only be dismissed if,under chapter limitations period and the accrual date applicable to the particular chapter claim,it was not timely filed.we,too,recognized this more than twenty years ago.see tagliente himmer,cir distinguishing between statute of limitations applicable to claim of fraudulent concealment and chapter claim based upon the same underlying conduct.meeb does not argue that any of its fdcpa violations are untimely under chapter.accordingly,its statute of limitations defense is without merit.
mcdermott also argues that collection of excessive,redundant,and unnecessary fees wrongfully cause s a debtor to incur avoidable costs in violation of.appellant br.at.that section,however,renders it unlawful for a debt collector to c aus e charges to be made to any person for communications by concealment of the true purpose of the communication.mcdermott makes no attempt to explain how this section applies to his avoidable costs theory.accordingly,we do not consider it further.
as the magistrate judge noted in addressing one of mcdermott other arguments,i t is not abusive to collect or charge the costs of an ordinary collection action where,as here,the condominium documents gave pondview the ability to charge those costs to mcdermott.mcdermott,d at.
the magistrate judge made multiple findings in this regard.for example,she found mcdermott testimony about why he refused to pay certain assessments was self serving and no
