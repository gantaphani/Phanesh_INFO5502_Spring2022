michael hess,personal representative of his father estate,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing the estate claims under state law and the truth in lending act,tila.we affirm.
michael hess father,george hess,was the holder of a citibank visa credit card when he died on august.at the time of his death,his account balance was.on november,the probate court of jackson county,missouri,appointed michael hess the personal representative of his father estate.on february,citibank filed a claim for in the probate estate and attached a copy of george hess credit card statement dated september,reflecting this account balance.
michael hess,on behalf of the estate,sent citibank a check for in december,apparently relying on the last statement received by his father prior to his death,which listed this higher amount as the balance due.this older statement,dated august,did not reflect either a payment of that posted on august or finance charges added to the account by citibank,which resulted in the balance of on the september statement.citibank internal statements from november through november,which were never mailed to george or michael hess,list an account balance of.the estate payment posted on december,and citibank internal statements dated december,and january,both list a credit of.
on june,michael hess filed suit in the district court,claiming citibank owed his father estate a refund of,which represented the difference between citibank claim in probate and the estate payment,or,at a minimum,the credit balance reflected on citibank internal statements after the payment.he alleged that citibank had failed to refund the credit and had instead swept the credit into its own general account,then had covered up the allegedly unlawful transaction by failing to provide periodic statements,in violation of the tila and regulation z.he also alleged violations of state law,including conversion,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith,fraud,money had and received,and unjust enrichment.hess purported to sue on behalf of a nationwide class of consumers whose accounts allegedly had been swept by citibank after days of inactivity.
in response,citibank moved for summary judgment,arguing that hess could not prove one essential element necessary to every count in the,that citibank had misappropriated an account balance properly due to george hess thus could not seek relief on behalf of himself or any member of the purported class.citibank claimed that it was entitled to interest that had accrued during the two years between the date in february,when it filed its claim in the probate court,and michael payment in december.citibank contended that,whether the amount of interest was calculated according to the terms of the cardmember agreement attached by hess to his complaint or under missouri statutory interest rate,the balance on the account as of december exceeded the payment,so citibank did not owe any money to george hess estate.
the district court stayed discovery pending resolution of the motion for summary judgment,and then granted citibank motion.the court calculated the amount of interest that would have accrued on the account through december employing three different potential methodologies.using the annual percentage rate of listed on the statement dated september,the court calculated the total interest that would have accrued under both variable and fixed rates,and then,as a third alternative,calculated the total interest accrued using the statutory rate of per annum,as provided by missouri revised statutes.the court reasoned that under any method of computing interest,the balance on george hess account in december would have been greater than.the court observed that the cardmember agreement submitted by hess states that finances charges continue to accrue until is credited to the account,and concluded that once citibank was notified of george hess death,the tila and regulation z do not require citibank to continue to send monthly statements to his estate.the court concluded that citibank had demonstrated that it was entitled to interest,and that the total account balance was more than the payment,so there was no overpayment and no credit balance owing to george hess account.the court therefore held that hess could not prove an essential element of each of his seven claims.app.at.
on appeal,hess argues that citibank violated the tila because it did not send a billing statement to the estate disclosing how and when it supposedly charged the interest eliminating the positive credit balance in george hess account.appellant br.at.under section b of the tila 
t he creditor of any account under an open end consumer credit plan shall transmit to the obligor,for each billing cycle at the end of which there is an outstanding balance in that account or with respect to which a finance charge is imposed,a statement setting forth each of the following items to the extent applicable t he amount of any finance charge added to the account during the period.
b.hess argues that upon george hess death,his estate became the obligor entitled to periodic statements,because it was obligated to pay the debt and was treated as an obligor by citibank when it submitted a claim against the estate in the hess probate.appellant br.at.hess also claims that citibank failure to send account statements to the estate violated the disclosure requirements of regulation citibank responds that it was not required to send statements to george hess estate for three independent reasons,one of which is that the hess estate was not an obligor within the meaning of b.
congress has delegated to the board of governors of the federal reserve system the authority to prescribe regulations that may contain such classifications,differentiations,or other provisions,and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions,as in the judgment of the board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of the tila,to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof,or to facilitate compliance therewith.a.congress has specifically designated the board as the primary source for interpretation and application of the tila,see household credit,pfennig,d,empowering it to formulate interstitial policy and to create rules for administering the statute.
in reviewing the agency construction of the statute,if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,then we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent.chevron,natural res.def.council,d see also first bank of council bluffs office of the comptroller of the currency,cir finding the statutory phrase immediate preceding examination in section e i of the tila to be unambiguous.otherwise,where congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.chevron,at.absent a clear expression of congressional intent,legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.deference to the views of the board is especially appropriate in the process of interpreting the tila,given the agency pivotal role in setting the statutory machinery in motion,broad administrative lawmaking power delegated by congress,and unique position to navigate the complexities of the statute striking the appropriate balance between competing considerations of complete disclosure and the need to avoid informational overload.ford motor credit milhollin,d internal quotations omitted.
the tila does not define the term obligor used in section b.as we shall explain below,there is a substantial argument that the text and structure of the tila unambiguously excludes an estate from the scope of obligor,but at best for hess,the term is ambiguous.the board enacted regulation z to implement the tila,see a,and it is entitled to deference in applying ambiguous terms.sections of regulation z include the regulatory provisions that govern credit plans,see schnall marine midland bank,cir,and it is evident that the board intended to define the sc
