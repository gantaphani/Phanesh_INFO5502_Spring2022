opinion of the court 
timothy mclaughlin had a mortgage.as a result of an error,the mortgage company believed that he was in default and referred the matter to the law firm phelan hallinan shmieg,llp,whose lawyers include lawrence phelan,francis hallinan,daniel schmieg,and rosemarie diamond collectively phs.phs sent mclaughlin a letter about the debt that he claims violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et.the district court dismissed certain claims because mclaughlin did not ask phs to validate the debt before he filed suit.because we conclude that he is not required to do so,we will reverse.we will,however,affirm the district court imposition of sanctions against phs for its failure to produce certain documents during discovery.
background 
mclaughlin appeal 
in october,timothy mclaughlin executed a adjustable rate note in favor of citimortgage,secured by a mortgage on his home.mclaughlin fell behind on his mortgage payments due to an error on citimortgage part.in,citimortgage referred mclaughlin account to phs.phs sent him a letter the letter dated june,that stated that t he amount of the debt as of was.app.this included two line items relevant here in attorney fees and for costs of suit and title search.app.mclaughlin asserts,among other things,that these fees and costs had not actually been incurred as of the date stated in the letter.
rather than seek verification of the debt from phs,mclaughlin filed a putative class action complaint alleging that phs violated several sections of the fdcpa by,among other things falsely representing that phs had performed legal services on or before may.the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice,holding that mclaughlin could not bring suit challenging the information contained in the letter without having first disputed the validity of the debt pursuant to the fdcpa validation procedure 
after mclaughlin filed an amended complaint,the district court issued another opinion,again stating that mclaughlin was required to follow the debt validation procedure required by section and that the amended complaint fail ed to allege that he had done so.app.the district court also found that the fees in the letter were estimates and held that estimating the amount of attorneys fees in an itemized debt collection notice does not violate the fdcpa.app.for these reasons,the district court dismissed mclaughlin claims under and that alleged misrepresentations concerning the amount of the debt and the fees for services associated with its collection.mclaughlin appeals this ruling.
phs cross appeal 
one claim survived dismissal,namely mclaughlin claim that phs violated the fdcpa by creating the false impression that attorneys were involved in the debt collection activity in violation of discovery proceeded on this claim.before the motion had been decided,mclaughlin had served a document demand upon phs seeking a ll invoices for professional services rendered by phs in relation to the loan of timothy mclaughlin.app.alterations in original.phs objected,claiming that the information was not likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.in response,mclaughlin filed a motion to strike this objection and a motion to compel,arguing that the invoices were clearly relevant to his claim that defendants sought attorney fees and costs from him that had not been incurred and were not authorized by the underlying loan documents.pl.mot.to strike objections compel disc.at,mclaughlin phelan hallinan schmieg,llp,ecf.the district court orally granted mclaughlin motion.despite this order,phs did not produce the invoices during discovery.instead,they withheld them until they attached them to their summary judgment reply brief.
the district court found that these invoices contain ed material facts showing that phs had in fact misstated the attorney fees and costs of suit.app.specifically,the district court noted that the invoices showed that phs had incurred only in total costs and in fees,and not the and,respectively,set forth in the letter.as a result,the district court invited mclaughlin to file a motion seeking relief from its orders dismissing his claim.
mclaughlin thereafter moved for reconsideration of the district court dismissal order,but the motion was denied.the district court did not say that the letter was accurate but rather held that it contained reasonable estimates of the itemized costs,and therefore did not violate the fdcpa.app.
the district court,however,did find that phs failure to produce the invoices during discovery was sanctionable under.b a and sua sponte ordered phs to pay all expenses,including attorney fees,that mclaughlin had incurred in connection with his motion for reconsideration,reasoning that phs action prevented full and timely investigation of the facts and led to additional briefing on the summary judgment motion.
the parties thereafter submitted briefs concerning the amount of the award.phs argued that the district court raised the issue of sanctions sua sponte,and hence did not provide phs with notice that sanctions were being contemplated,and asked the district to reevaluat e the imposition of sanctions in light of its view that the invoices were irrelevant to the lack of attorney involvement claim under,which was the only claim pending at the time discovery occurred,and to find that its noncompliance with the discovery order was therefore neither in bad faith nor willful.mem.of law in opp to pl.appl.for att ys fees expenses at,ecf ecf.the district court considered this request,found that phs had ample opportunity to address the sanctions issue,adopted the finding that the conduct was sanctionable,and ordered sanctions in the amount of.phs appeals the sanctions order.
ii.discussion 
fdcpa claim 
we will first address mclaughlin appeal of the order dismissing his claims under and.we exercise plenary review of a district court order granting a motion to dismiss.burtch milberg factors,cir 
debt collection activity 
mclaughlin contends that phs letter knowingly misrepresented that,as of may,in attorney fees and in costs of suit and title search were due and owing,and hence that the letter violates the fdcpa.appellant br.phs contends that the letter does not constitute debt collection activity subject to the fdcpa because it made no demand for payment,contained no suggestion that mclaughlin settle the underlying debt,nor enter into a payment plan.appellee br.emphasis omitted.
the fdcpa regulates debt collection but does not define the term.simon fia card,cir.the statute substantive provisions,however,make clear that it covers conduct taken in connection with the collection of any debt.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.put differently,activity undertaken for the general purpose of inducing payment constitutes debt collection activity.id see also gburek litton loan servicing lp,cir describing the commonsense inquiry of whether a communication from a debt collector is made in connection with the collection of any debt.thus,a communication need not contain an explicit demand for payment to constitute debt collection activity.simon,at.indeed,communications that include discussions of the status of payment,offers of alternatives to default,and requests for financial information may be part of a dialogue to facilitate satisfaction of the debt and hence can constitute debt collection activity.id.
phs letter is plainly part of such a dialogue.the letter states that phs is a debt collector attempting to collect a debt and that information phs obtains may be used for that purpose,namely to collect a debt.app.it then provides an presentation of the amount due.the letter also informs the recipient how to obtain updated payoff quotes,meaning how to obtain current information about the amount that would have to be paid to satisfy the debt.id.
it is reasonable to infer that an entity that identifies itself as a debt collector,lays out the amount of the debt,and explains how to obtain current payoff quotes has engaged in a communication related to collecting a debt.thus,the letter constitutes debt collection activity under the fdcpa and misrepresentations contained therein may provide a basis for relief.
mclaughlin argues that the failure to accurately set forth the amount due as of may,constitutes a misrepresentation actionable under and and the order dismissing these claims should be reversed.these subsections prohibit t he false representation of either the character,amount,or legal status of any debt or any services rendered or compensation which may lawfully be received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt,as well as t he use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.
each of these provisions deals with debt collectors representations to debtors.we analyze such communications from the perspective of the least sophisticated debtor.rosenau unifund,cir brown card serv,cir.this low standard effectuate s the basic purpose of the fdcpa to protect all consumers,the gullible as well as the shrewd.rosenau,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
phs contends that the letter did not violate the fdcpa because it contained estimates of the amount owed.this characterization is inconsistent with the unequivocal language of the letter.the letter says that it sets forth t he amount of the debt as of.app.the only message this conveys to the reader is the amount owed on a specific date.nothing says it is an estimate or in any way suggests that it was not a precise amount.as the drafter of the letter,phs is responsible for its content and for what the least sophisticated debtor would have understood from it.see glover fdic,cir the language of a creates a straightforward,objective standard.nothing suggests that an allowance is to be made for a defendant lack of knowledge or intent.if phs wanted to convey that the amounts in the letter were estimates,then it could have said so.it did not.instead,its language informs the reader of the specific amounts due for specific items as of a particular date.if the amount actually owed as of that date was less than the amount listed,then,construing the facts in the light most favorable to mclaughlin as we must when reviewing the dismissal under rule b,phillips,at,mclaughlin has stated a claim that the letter misrepresents the amount of the debt in violation of and.
prerequisite to filing suit 
phs argues that it nonetheless can not incur liability as a matter of law where it has complied with the debt validation procedure set forth in the fdcpa,appellee br.emphasis omitted,and mclaughlin did not seek to validate the debt described in the letter this argument lacks any statutory support.
the statute text provides no indication that congress intended to require debtors to dispute their debts under before filing suit under,and in fact,the statutory language suggests the opposite.the language of indicates that disputing a debt is optional.the statute lists consequences i f the consumer disputes a debt,b emphasis added,and it makes clear that failure to dispute a debt can not be construed as an admission of liability.c.thus,the statute protects a prospective litigant from being penalized in a lawsuit if he or she chooses not to seek validation.the absence of a validation request requirement does not appear accidental given the protection congress bestowed on those who opt not to seek validation of the debt.
moreover,permitting debtors to proceed under without first disputing their debts under is consistent with this court fdcpa jurisprudence,which has never imposed a prerequisite and which has consistently emphasized the purpose of the fdcpa as a remedial statute,applying a least sophisticated debtor standard to communications.brown,at see also wilson quadramed,cir t he debt validation provisions of section were included to guarantee that consumers receive d adequate notice of their rights under the law.imposing a dispute prerequisite in the absence of any statutory language requiring it would undermine the fdcpa protection of unsophisticated debtors,who would have no reason to suspect that they would be prevented from filing suit concerning deceptive communications as a consequence of failing to invoke the optional statutory validation procedure.
furthermore,imposing a requirement that the debtor challenge the validity of the debt described in a communication before filing suit would have the effect of immunizing false statements that a consumer failed to promptly dispute put differently,if a debt collector communication was false,the debt collector would avoid liability for the false communication simply because a request to validate its contents was not made.this would be inconsistent with the fdcpa goal of ensuring debt collectors act responsibly.
finally,declining to require debtors to lodge disputes under before filing suit would not frustrate the fdcpa validation procedure.see lindbergh transworld,contrasting the significant burden of litigation with the validation procedures provided by the fdcpa.debtors will still have an incentive to follow the validation procedure even if pursuit of the validation process is not required to preserve the ability to file suit as it can enable debtors to cheaply and quickly resolve disputes with debt collectors.moreover,because the validation process facilitates the exchange of information,it may ultimately help debtors bolster their fdcpa claims.see hubbard bond collection assocs,aff,cir table t his exchange of information under validation procedure provides debt collectors with actual knowledge of the facts relevant to their collection efforts.this is significant because only a knowing violation of is actionable.
for these reasons,a consumer is not required to seek validation of a debt he or she believes is inaccurately described in a debt communication as a prerequisite to filing suit under.thus,the district court imposition of such a requirement was incorrect and its dismissal of mclaughlin and claims on this basis was improper.
we next address the order imposing sanctions against phs.we review the district court imposition of sanctions under rule for abuse of discretion.grider keystone health plan,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted we exercise plenary review of phs assertion that it was not provided due process before the district court imposed sanctions.martin brown,cir.
phs asserts that the sanction order should be reversed because it did not engage in sanctionable conduct and it did not receive notice that sanctions were being contemplated before they were imposed.we will address each contention in turn.
rule provides,in relevant part,that a party failure to obey an order to provide or permit discovery allows the court to issue further just orders.b a.rule requires the court to order the disobedient party,the attorney advising that party,or both to pay the reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,caused by the failure,unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.b c.
here,there was a clear violation of the district court discovery order.the district court ordered phs to produce documents responsive to mclaughlin demand for invoices for any services provided relating to the debt.phs did not do so.the district court explained that mclaughlin document request plainly encompassed the invoices phs withheld and it rejected phs argument that the invoices it withheld were not requested.the district court further explained that phs noncompliance impacted the parties investigation of the facts and caused additional briefing.as a result,it properly found phs violated the discovery order.
phs argues that it should not have been sanctioned for this noncompliance because the invoices mclaughlin requested were irrelevant in light of the district court december,order stating that mclaughlin only remaining claim at that time was his claim concerning phs alleged misrepresentations regarding the involvement of attorneys.appellee br.this does not excuse phs failure to comply with a discovery order that h
