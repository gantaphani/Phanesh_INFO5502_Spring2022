this appeal arises out of the intersection of the bankruptcy code and the fair debt collection practices act.the issue is whether a debt collector letter and notice requesting an examination under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure and offering to settle a debt,sent in a pending bankruptcy in contemplation of an adversary proceeding to challenge dischargeability,can be the basis for liability under the fdcpa.
a law firm,weinstein riley,sent the letter and attached notice at issue on behalf of fia card services,to both appellants,bankruptcy debtors stacey helene and robert maxwell simon,through their bankruptcy counsel.the district court dismissed the simons fdcpa suit arising from the letter and notice under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court held that the bankruptcy code provided the exclusive remedy for the alleged violations and precluded the fdcpa claims.the district court also held that even if the fdcpa claims were not precluded,the simons complaint did not allege sufficient facts to state a claim.the simons appealed.we will affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
on december,the simons filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code,in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey.in re simon.filed.the schedules submitted to the bankruptcy court identified an unsecured,nonpriority claim debt owed to bank of america now fia.fia retained weinstein riley to represent it in the simons bankruptcy proceeding.
on january,weinstein riley sent the letter and attached notice to both and simon through their bankruptcy counsel.the letter stated that fia was considering filing an adversary proceeding under to challenge the dischargeability of the debt.the letter included an offer to forego an adversary proceeding if the simons stipulated that the debt was nondischargeable or if they agreed to pay a reduced amount to settle the debt.the letter stated that a rule examination to gather information for filing an adversary proceeding had been scheduled for february,but that weinstein riley was open to discuss ing with your client whether the matter can be resolved without conducting the examination to reschedule it for an informal telephone conference at a mutually agreeable time prior to the bar date.the bottom of the letter set out additional information about how to challenge the debt i n the event that this letter is governed by the fdcpa.
attached to the letter was a document entitled notice of examination in accordance with and local rule.the notice identified the date and time for the rule examinations and the place as weinstein riley offices in new york city or upon written request,at an alternate location to be agreed upon by the parties.the notice included a statement that the simons were to bring specified documents to the rule examinations the notice stated that p ursuant to local rule,no order shall be necessary.the simons alleged,and the appellees acknowledged at oral argument,that the notice was subject to the requirements for a subpoena under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure and federal rule of civil procedure.
at the bottom of the subpoena was a certificate signed by a weinstein riley attorney.the certificate stated that a true and correct copy of the foregoing has been mailed on january,to the above address.two addresses were listed the simons home in new jersey and their bankruptcy counsel office.the simons allege that they did not receive a copy at their home address and that weinstein riley did not in fact send a copy there.the simons bankruptcy counsel received the copies sent to his office.
the simons filed a motion in the bankruptcy court to quash the rule examination notices on the ground that they failed to comply with the bankruptcy rule and civil rule subpoena requirements.on february,the simons filed an adversary proceeding asserting fdcpa claims against fia and weinstein riley.the bankruptcy court quashed the rule examination notices.the bankruptcy court later ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the fdcpa claims and dismissed them without prejudice.
the simons then sued fia and weinstein riley in the federal district court for the district of new jersey.they alleged that the letters and subpoenas violated the fdcpa prohibition on false,deceptive,and misleading practices under,and.the appellees moved to dismiss on three grounds the fdcpa claim was precluded by the bankruptcy court earlier dismissal of the adversary proceeding the simons had filed the complaint did not state a claim and the allegations from which the fdcpa claims arose were governed exclusively by the bankruptcy code.
on july,the district court dismissed the fdcpa suit,with prejudice,stating that the fdcpa claims were precluded by the bankruptcy code and that the complaint does not appear to set forth sufficient factual allegations to state a claim under the fdcpa.simon fia card,civ,wl,at.

iii.analysis 
whether the complaint stated claims under the fdcpa 
section of the fdcpa prohibits debt collectors from using any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.the simons alleged that the letter and notice violated,and.section states that a debt collector may not make a threat to take any action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.section prohibits a debt collector from making a false representation or implication that documents are legal process.
the simons alleged that by sending the letter and attached notice,weinstein reilly and fia violated and in four ways 
by intentionally failing to send the letter and subpoena to the simons and instead sending the documents to their attorney,violating civil rule b requirement that subpoenas be served directly on the individuals subpoenaed.
by specifying the location for the rule examinations as the weinstein riley office in new york,rather than in new jersey.the simons alleged that this violated civil rule a b requirement that a subpoena be issued from the court for the district where the deposition is to be taken.
by failing to include in the subpoena the text of civil rule c and d,as civil rule a l a iv requires.
by failing to include in the subpoena the method of recording the rule examinations,as civil rule a b requires.
additionally,the simons allege that weinstein riley violated the fdcpa by failing to include the warning required under.under that section,a debt collector must disclose in the initial communication with the debtor that the debt collector is attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose.
the argument that the fdcpa did not apply because there was no communication attempting to collect a debt 
the appellees generally contend that the fdcpa claims should be dismissed on the ground that the letter and notice sent to the simons did not attempt to collect a debt under the statute because there was no demand for payment.instead,the appellees contend,the letter offered to discuss a possible nondischargeability claim pursuant to.courts have not construed the fdcpa so narrowly.
the fdcpa regulates debt collection without defining that term.the fdcpa states that to be liable under the statute substantive provisions,a debt collector targeted conduct must have been taken in connection with the collection of any debt,e,a b,or in order to collect any debt,id.glazer chase home fin.llc,cir.the fdcpa does define three other relevant terms 
debt means any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money,property,insurance,or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.
debt collector means a person in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts,or who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.
communication means the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium.
the supreme court held in heintz jenkins that a debt collector includes an attorney who regularly engage s in activity,even when that activity consists of litigation,d the simons claims can not be dismissed on the ground that weinstein riley actions did not amount to debt collection covered by the fdcpa.
nor can the simons fdcpa claims be dismissed on the ground that the letter and notice were not communications under the statute.in allen ex rel.martin lasalle bank,cir,we addressed whether a letter sent by a bank attorneys met the fdcpa requirement for a communication.id.at n citing.the bank argued that the letter was not an actionable fdcpa communication because it did not make a demand for payment.we rejected that argument and noted that a communication need only convey information regarding a debt and is not limited to specific requests for payment.id.quoting.
opinions from other circuits provide further support for applying the fdcpa to debt collectors communications to debtors even if there is even if there is no explicit demand for payment.in gburek litton loan servicing lp,the seventh circuit addressed whether two letters to a debtor who had fallen behind on her mortgage payments could be the basis for fdcpa claims.cir.the letters,sent by or on behalf of a loan servicer,offered to discuss ways the debtor could avoid foreclosure and asked for the debtor detailed,current financial information.the seventh circuit held that the letters were sent in connection with the collection of a debt under.id.at.the court explained that t he absence of a demand for payment is just one of several factors that come into play in the commonsense inquiry of whether a communication from a debt collector is made in connection with the collection of any debt.id.noting that the debtor was in default,no forbearance agreement was in place,and the letters offered to discuss foreclosure alternatives and requested financial information,the court concluded that the first of the letters was the opening communication in an attempt to collect the debtor defaulted home loan by settlement or otherwise.though it did not explicitly ask for payment,it was an offer to discuss the debtor repayment options,which qualifies as a communication in connection with an attempt to collect a debt.id.at.
the sixth circuit adopted the seventh circuit approach in grden leikin ingber winters pc,cir.in grden,a law firm filed a action.the firm sent the debtor a letter with an attachment that appeared to be a motion.the debtor had not missed the deadline for answering the complaint.when the debtor called the law firm,it allegedly provided him with an incorrect account balance.the debtor filed an fdcpa claim.the law firm moved for summary judgment on the ground that the letter with the attachment and telephone call were not communications that attempted to collect a debt.the sixth circuit held that for a communication to be in connection with the collection of a debt,an animating purpose of the communication must be to induce payment by the debtor.id.at citing gburek,at.a letter that is not itself a collection attempt,but that aims to make such an attempt more likely to succeed,is one that has the requisite connection.id.the letter and document appearing to be a motion gave rise to an fdcpa claim.the telephone call,however,did not give rise to an fdcpa claim because the debtor had initiated the call,and the statements by the person answering were merely a ministerial response to a debtor inquiry,rather than part of a strategy to make payment more likely.id.
other circuits considering related questions have similarly held that the fdcpa applies to activities that do not include an explicit demand for payment when the general purpose is to collect payment.see,mccollough johnson,rodenburg lauinger,llc,cir the district court correctly held that the defendant service of false requests for admission violated the fdcpa as a matter of law.sayyed wolpoff abramson,cir holding that the fdcpa applied to allegedly erroneous statements made in interrogatories and a summary judgment motion during the course of a suit.
given allen broad gloss on communication and the consistent analysis from other circuits described above,we reject the appellees argument that the letter and subpoena weinstein riley sent each appellant was not a communication from a debt collector made in connection with the collection of a debt.the letters stated that the simons had defaulted on their credit obligations fia was considering filing adversary proceedings under to challenge the dischargeability of their debt rule examinations were scheduled to gather information about dischargeability and the simons were to bring personal financial information and documents to the rule examinations.the letters offered the simons a way to avoid the rule examinations and adversary proceedings by paying a reduced amount to settle the debt or by stipulating that the debt was nondischargeable.the letter and notice were an attempt to collect the simons debt through the alternatives of settlement including by partial payment or gathering information to challenge dischargeability.the absence of an explicit payment demand does not take the communication outside the fdcpa 
the arguments that the complaint did not allege an fdcpa claim 
a.the fdcpa claims based on alleged violations of bankruptcy rule and civil rule 
the district court found that several of the simons specific fdcpa allegations were contradicted by the language of the subpoenas weinstein riley sent the district court rejected the simons and claims that the appellees violated the fdcpa because the subpoenas failed to disclose the method for recording the examination.the district court noted that the statement in both subpoenas that a certified court reporter or any other notary public or officer authorized by law to take depositions would be used for the rule examinations was sufficient.simon,wl,at.we will affirm this conclusion,but on a different ground.cardona bledsoe,cir we may affirm a district court for any reason supported by the record.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.we find that the failure to specify the recording method in the subpoena did not violate bankruptcy rule or civil rule.
bankruptcy rule provides that civil rule applies to subpoenas issued in bankruptcy cases.civil rule a b requires that a subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition must state the method for recording the testimony and applies to subpoenas for depositions.courts have recognized that a rule examination differs from a deposition,serving different purposes and subject to different procedures see,in re j r trucking,although a rule examination is obviously an investigatory device and it is conducted under oath,it should not be confused with discovery or a discovery deposition.bankruptcy rule c provides that the attendance of an entity for examination may be compelled as provided in rule for the attendance of a witness at a hearing or trial.civil rule does not require a subpoena for attendance at a hearing or trial to include a notice of the recording method.civil rule a b and bankruptcy rule did not require the subpoenas weinstein reilly sent to state the method for recording the rule examinations.accordingly,we will affirm the dismissal of the and claims because there was no failure to comply with the rules.
the district court also dismissed the simons claims that the appellees violated and of the fdcpa by issuing the subpoenas from the district of new jersey for rule examinations to be held in the southern district of new york.see.a a providing that a subpoena must issue from the court for the district where the hearing or trial is to be held.the district court dismissed this fdcpa claim on the basis that there was no underlying rule violation,finding that the subpoenas did not compel the simons to appear only in new york,as they alleged.the subpoenas stated that the examinations could take place upon written request,at an alternate location to be agreed upon by the parties.the simons did not address on appeal the district court ground for dismissing this claim,and we find no basis for reversal.we will affirm the dismissal of this claim.
the district court did not find,and the appellees do not argue,that the subpoenas met civil rule requirements that they be served directly on the individuals subpoenaed and include the text of civil rule c and d.see.b a a iv.the district court instead dismissed the and claims arising from the violations of civil rule on the basis of preclusion.the district court dismissed the remaining fdcpa claim under ll on the basis that it failed to state a claim.this fdcpa claim,unlike the and claims,does not depend on an underlying alleged violation of the bankruptcy rules.
b.the fdcpa claim based on the failure to include the warning 
the district court found that the letter sent to the simons bankruptcy counsel did not violate the fdcpa because it simply advised the attorney for the debtor that the defendant debt collection agency believed that the debt might be and it would like to settle the matter if the attorney for the debtor did not believe that there was a defense to the claim under a.simon,wl,at quoting villegas weinstein riley,d.the villegas court first held that the fdcpa does not apply to a debt collector communications to a debtor attorney.the court then held that to the extent that the fdcpa applies to such communications,they should be analyzed under a competent lawyer standard,not the least sophisticated debtor standard that ordinarily applies to a debt collector communications with a debtor.see lesher law offices of mitchell kay,pc,cir w e analyze communications from lenders to debtors from the perspective of the least sophisticated debtor.internal quotation marks omitted.the villegas court concluded that under the competent lawyer standard,a letter advising the debtor bankruptcy counsel of the desire to settle a potential adversary complaint did not violate the fdcpa.villegas,d at.
the simons contend that villegas is not persuasive because of our decision in allen,at.allen was a mortgage foreclosure lawsuit filed on a bank behalf against a borrower.at the request of the borrower attorney,the bank attorney sent a letter quoting the amounts needed to pay off the loan,fees,and costs.another letter sent the same day itemized the attorney fees and costs referred to in the previous letter.the borrower filed a class action under of the fdcpa against the bank and the law firm,alleging that the letters misstated the charges the borrower owed and that the charges were neither authorized by contract nor permitted by law.the defendants moved to dismiss on the basis that the fdcpa does not cover a debt collector communication to a debtor attorney.the district court rejected this argument but granted the motion to dismiss because a competent attorney would have recognized the charges as incorrect.we reversed.noting that the fdcpa defines communication broadly to include the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly through any medium,we held that a communication to a consumer attorney is undoubtedly an indirect communication to the consumer.id.at.we also held that the competent attorney standard did not apply to the debtor claim because t he only inquiry under is whether the amount collected was expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.id.this inquiry did not turn on the reader sophistication.
allen did not articulate a standard for fdcpa claims arising out of communications to a consumer attorney.but allen reasoning supports rejecting the competent attorney standard for the claim at issue here.the inquiry under is whether the disclosure was required in the weinstein reilly communications and,if so,provided.the sophistication of the party receiving the communication is irrelevant to that inquiry.
allen also supports rejecting the competent attorney standard for the only part of the remaining and claims that the parties have raised on appeal.these fdcpa claims are based on the allegations that the subpoenas failed to comply with civil rule,as incorporated by bankruptcy rule in two respects because they were not served on the simons directly,as required by civil rule b and they did not include the text of civil rule c d,as required by civil rule a a iv.each claim requires two inquiries.the first inquiry is whether the subpoenas failed to comply with the rules,as alleged.the second is whether the alleged failures to comply also violated or of the fdcpa.see leblanc unifund ccr partners,cir w e do not hold that all debt collector actions in violation of state law constitute per se violations of the fdcpa.rather,the conduct or communication at issue must also violate the relevant provision of the fdcpa.the district court did not reach the second inquiry,and the parties do not address it on appeal.instead,the district court,and the parties on appeal,focused on whether the subpoenas violated the rules,and did not discuss whether,if so,that is enough to state a claim under the fdcpa.the sophistication of the party receiving weinstein riley communications is irrelevant to determining the subpoena compliance with civil rule and bankruptcy rule,which is the only inquiry before us on appeal.the competent attorney standard is not relevant to this inquiry.the district court dismissed these two remaining claims on the basis of preclusion by the bankruptcy code,without reaching the question whether,if the subpoenas violated civil rule and bankruptcy rule,that was enough to violate the fdcpa.we will reverse the preclusion ruling without resolving whether the alleged failures to comply with civil rule,as incorporated by bankruptcy rule,also state claims under and of the fdcpa.
c.the allegations that state an fdcpa claim 
in sum,we affirm the dismissal of the simons and claims based on alleged violations of civil rule and bankruptcy rule for failing to identify the recording method in the rule examination subpoenas and for issuing the subpoenas from a district other than where the rule examinations were to be held.
the remaining fdcpa claims are the and claims for violating civil rule b by failing to serve the subpoenas directly on the individuals subpoenaed and rule a a iv by failing to include the text of civil rule c d,and the claim for failing to include the warning in the letters and subpoenas.we now consider whether the bankruptcy code precludes those claims.
b.the relationship between the bankruptcy code and the fdcpa 
appellees argue that if any of the simons claims survive dismissal,the bankruptcy code and rules precludes them.the simons contend that there is no basis to find that the bankruptcy code and rules preclude their fdcpa claims.we have not previously addressed whether,or to what extent,an fdcpa claim can arise from a debt collector communications to a debtor in a pending bankruptcy proceeding.the appellate and trial courts have reached varying and sometimes inconsistent conclusions about whether and when the bankruptcy code precludes fdcpa claims arising from communications to a debtor sent in the bankruptcy context.compare simmons roundup funding,llc,cir walls wells fargo bank,cir and b real,llc chaussee in re chaussee,finding that fdcpa claims were precluded by the bankruptcy code,with randolph imbs,cir finding the fdcpa claims not precluded 
the ninth circuit has taken a broad approach,holding that a debt collector communications to a consumer debtor in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding can not be the basis for an fdcpa claim.in walls wells fargo bank,a debtor sued a bank for attempting to collect a debt that had been discharged in bankruptcy.the ninth circuit concluded that the debtor fdcpa claim was barred because it was based on an alleged violation of and consideration of it necessarily entails determinations.id.at.to decide the fdcpa claim,the district court would first need to address issues typically decided by a bankruptcy court.these issues included whether the debtor payments were voluntary under f and whether she was required to enter a reaffirmation agreement under c.id.the ninth circuit also found that the bankruptcy court contempt power allowed the debtor to enforce the discharge injunction,removing the need to invoke the fdcpa.
in dismissing the fdcpa claim,the ninth circuit observed that a mere browse through the complex,detailed,and comprehensive provisions of the lengthy bankruptcy code demonstrates congress intent to create a whole system under federal control which is designed to bring together and adjust all of the rights and duties of creditors and embarrassed debtors alike.id.quoting msr exploration,meridian oil,cir.the walls court concluded that allowing an fdcpa claim based on a violation of the bankruptcy code discharge injunction would circumvent the remedial scheme of the code under which congress struck a balance between the interests of debtors and creditors by permitting and limiting debtors remedies for violating the discharge injunction to contempt.id 
in in re chaussee,the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel similarly concluded that filing allegedly proofs of claim in a pending bankruptcy case was not actionable under the fdcpa.relying on walls and msr exploration,the court found that where the code and rules provide a remedy for acts taken in violation of their terms,debtors may not resort to other state and federal remedies to redress their claims lest the congressional scheme behind the bankruptcy laws and their enforcement be frustrated.id.at.
in addition to this categorical basis,the chaussee court also found that an fdcpa claim based on a proof of claim filed in a pending bankruptcy would create direct conflicts with the bankruptcy code.the chaussee court explained 
a ttempting to reconcile the debt validation procedure contemplated by fdcpa with the claims objection process under the bankruptcy code results in the sort of confusion and conflicts that persuades us that congress intended that fdcpa be precluded in the context of bankruptcy cases.we fail to understand how a debt collector could comply with fdcpa and its various notice and informational requirements because those provisions conflict with the code and rules.
id.at.the fdcpa requires a debt collector to include a notice of the debtor rights within five days of the initial communication to the debtor.a.the bankruptcy code automatic stay provision prevents collection steps after a bankruptcy case is filed.a debt collector could not satisfy the fdcpa by including the notice of rights in a proof of claim,because a communication in the form of a formal pleading is not an initial communication under the fdcpa.if a debt collector had to send the notice of rights to a debtor in a pending bankruptcy case to avoid an fdcpa claim,that communication could violate the automatic stay.to omit the notice in order to avoid violating the stay could violate the fdcpa.this conflict was a specific,and narrower,basis for finding that the fdcpa claim could not proceed.
the second circuit reached a similar result in simmons roundup funding,llc,but without taking a broad analytical approach.the debtors in simmons filed an fdcpa claim alleging that the defendant debt collector had filed an inflated proof of claim in their bankruptcy proceeding.the second circuit held that the debtors had no fdcpa claim,stating that t here is no need to protect debtors who are already under the protection of the bankruptcy court,and there is no need to supplement the remedies afforded by bankruptcy itself.id.at.the bankruptcy code provided both a mechanism to challenge proofs of claim and remedies if they were improperly filed,including by revoking fraudulent proofs of claim and by invoking the bankruptcy court contempt power.id.but the second circuit noted that while some courts have ruled more broadly that no fdcpa action can be based on an act that violates any provision of the bankruptcy code,because such violations are dealt with exclusively by the bankruptcy code,we are not compelled to consider that rule in this case.id.citations omitted.
the seventh circuit in randolph imbs,took a different approach.in randolph,the court considered consolidated appeals involving fdcpa claims arising from attempts to collect debts that violated the automatic stay.the district courts dismissed the fdcpa claims on the ground that they were precluded or preempted by the bankruptcy code.the seventh circuit reversed,explaining that w hen two federal statutes address the same subject in different ways,the right question is whether one implicitly repeals the other.id.at.repeal requires either an irreconcilable conflict between the statutes or a clearly expressed legislative decision that one replace the other.the court emphasized that repeal by implication is a rare bird indeed.id.the seventh circuit found no irreconcilable conflict between the fdcpa prohibitions and the bankruptcy code discharge injunction and automatic stay provisions,and no clearly expressed congressional statement that the code preclude fdcpa claims arising in bankruptcy.although the bankruptcy code and fdcpa provisions at issue in randolph overlapped,the court found that because i t is easy to enforce both statutes,and any debt collector can comply with both simultaneously,the fdcpa claim could proceed.id.at.
we will follow the seventh circuit approach.when,as here,fdcpa claims arise from communications a debt collector sends a bankruptcy debtor in a pending bankruptcy proceeding,and the communications are alleged to violate the bankruptcy code or rules,there is no categorical preclusion of the fdcpa claims.when,as is also the case here,the fdcpa claim arises from communications sent in a pending bankruptcy proceeding and there is no allegation that the communications violate the code or rules,there is even less reason for categorical preclusion.the proper inquiry for both circumstances is whether the fdcpa claim raises a direct conflict between the code or rules and the fdcpa,or whether both can be enforced.
this approach is consistent with supreme court precedents recognizing a presumption against the implied repeal of one federal statute by another.w hen two statutes are capable of coexistence,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.ag supply,pioneer hi bred,d quoting morton mancari,d.redundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting,and so long as there is no positive repugnancy between two laws,a court must give effect to both.bank germain,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.nor is a statute dealing with a narrow,precise,and specific subject submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum.radzanower touche ross,d.the supreme court has repeatedly held that r epeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.hawaii office of hawaiian affairs,d quoting of home builders defenders of wildlife,d second alteration in original see also branch smith,d posadas city bank of.courts should not infer a statutory repeal unless the later statute expressly contradicts the original act or unless such a construction is absolutely necessary in order that the words of the later statute shall have any meaning at all.ass of home builders,at alterations and internal quotations marks omitted see also branch,at an implied repeal will only be found where provisions in two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict,or where the latter act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute.internal quotation marks omitted.
