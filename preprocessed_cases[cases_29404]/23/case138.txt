introduction 
ashley gager brought suit against dell financial services alleging that dell violated the telephone consumer protection act of tcpa,b l a iii,by using an automated telephone dialing system to call her cellular phone after she revoked her prior express consent to be contacted.gager contends that the district court improperly dismissed her complaint for failure to state a claim on the theory that she could not revoke her consent once it was given.we agree with gager.therefore,for the reasons that follow,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.background 
around december,gager applied for a line of credit from dell to purchase computer equipment.the credit application required that she provide her home phone number.gager listed her cellular phone number in that place on the application.in doing so,however,she neither stated that the number was for a cellular phone,nor did she indicate that dell should not use an automated telephone dialing system to call her at the number she provided.
dell granted gager a line of credit,which she used to purchase several thousand dollars worth of computer equipment.gager subsequently defaulted on her debt.dell then began using an automated telephone dialing system to call gager cellular phone,leaving messages on her voicemail concerning the debt.in december,gager sent a letter to dell,listing her phone number and asking dell to stop calling it regarding her account.the letter did not indicate that the number was for a cellular phone.gager has alleged that,after receiving her letter,dell called her cellular phone approximately forty times over the three week period,using an automated telephone dialing system.
gager filed a complaint in the court of common pleas of wayne county,pennsylvania,asserting violations of b a iii,the tcpa provision banning certain automated calls to cellular phones.gager alleged that,after receiving her letter,dell had an obligation under the tcpa to cease all autodialed calls to her cellular phone because she had withdrawn her prior express consent to be contacted at that number via an automated dialing system.the case was subsequently removed to the middle district of pennsylvania under.
dell moved to dismiss the complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motion,holding that gager could not revoke her prior express consent for three reasons.first,the court concluded that the lack of language in the tcpa providing for revocation of consent weighed in favor of finding that no such right exists.gager dell fin,llc,cv,wl,at.may.second,the district court held that,although gager was entitled to give instructions to the contrary as to whether dell could use an automated telephone dialing system to call her,those instructions had to be provided at the time she knowingly release d her telephone number to dell.id.finally,the district court determined that,because calls regarding debt collection are not subject to the tcpa and because dell calls were for debt collection purposes,gager failed to allege a violation of the tcpa.id.gager appealed.
iii.standard of review 
to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d.we exercise plenary review over an order granting a rule b motion.penn allegheny health,upmc,cir.we also exercise plenary review over issues of statutory interpretation.united states manzella,cir.
we are asked to resolve two issues today whether the tcpa allows a consumer to revoke her prior express consent to be contacted via an automated telephone dialing system on her cellular phone and if a revocation right exists,whether there is a temporal limitation on that right.neither the third circuit nor any other appellate court has addressed either issue.our analysis of the scope of the tcpa is guided by the text of the statute,the fcc interpretation of the statute,the statute purpose,and our understanding of the concept of consent as it exists in the common law.see restrepo att y of,cir.considering all of these factors,we conclude that gager has stated a plausible claim for relief because the tcpa affords her the right to revoke her prior express consent to be contacted on her cellular phone via an autodialing system and there is no temporal limitation on that right.
congress passed the tcpa to protect individual consumers from receiving intrusive and unwanted calls.see mims arrow fin,llc,d.the relevant portion of the tcpa provides that it is unlawful for any person 
to make any call other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice to any telephone number assigned to a paging service,cellular telephone service,specialized mobile radio service,or other radio common carrier service,or any service for which the called party is charged for the call.
b l a iii emphasis added.notably,the statute does not contain any language expressly granting consumers the right to revoke their prior express consent.
congress authorized the federal communications commission fcc to implement rules and regulations enforcing the tcpa.b.under its rulemaking authority,the fcc has stated that autodialed both cellular phones and lawful so long as the recipient has granted permission to be called at the number which they have given,absent instructions to the contrary.in the matter of rules regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,fcc rcd,emphasis added hereinafter the ruling.the ruling,however,left unresolved the question of whether instructions to the contrary may be given after a consumer has granted her prior express consent and,if so,whether there is any temporal limitation on the right to revoke prior express consent.
the most significant guidance from the fcc on the issue of revocation of prior express consent comes from a decision issued after the district court dismissed gager claim.see in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,soundbite communications,fcc rcd,hereinafter soundbite.in soundbite,the fcc issued a declaratory ruling to resolve the issue of whether a consumer prior express consent to receive text messages from an entity can be construed to include consent to receive a final,text message confirming that such consent has been revoked.id.at.the fcc concluded that a text message confirming an request is permissible under the tcpa id.at.
although the fcc analysis in soundbite was directed at the use of an automated dialing system to confirm an request,rather than whether an right exists,the decision indicates that the fcc supports gager argument that a consumer may revoke her prior express consent once it is given.the decision in soundbite starts by noting that neither the text of the tcpa nor its legislative history directly addresses the circumstances under which prior express consent is deemed revoked.id.at.the fcc then noted that consumer consent to receive messages is not unlimited.id.at.consistent with this notion,the fcc stated several times that a consumer may fully revoke her prior express consent by transmitting an request to the sending party.id.at see also id.at stating that a consumer may request that no further text messages be sent id.at noting that a consumer may opt out of receiving voice calls after prior express consent has been given.
the remainder of the analysis in soundbite focuses on why permitting a text message confirming an request would be harmonious with the tcpa objectives,a concern not germane to this appeal.thus,notwithstanding the fact that soundbite principally addresses an unrelated issue,the decision demonstrates that the fcc endorses two important points a consumer may revoke her informed consent once it has been given,see id.at,and there is no temporal limitation on when a consumer may revoke her prior express consent by sending an message,see,id.at suggesting that,after a consumer has
