in this consumer class action against a debt collector,the issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in certifying a class when defendant asserted a defense unique to the claims of the class representative.we will vacate and remand.
maximus,has a contract with the department of education to collect overdue student loans.between may,and may,maximus sent a form collection letter entitled employment verification request to the employers of pennsylvania individuals.the employment verification request displayed maximus collection center in boldface type at the top and bottom of the page and requested information about the individual location and employment.on may,maximus sent an employment verification request to appellee donna beck employer,inolex chemical company.
beck did not have an outstanding loan with the department of education.maximus had confused her with another woman,with the same name,who lived in the same philadelphia neighborhood.the two women had a history of being mistaken for one another.they had been confused on voter registration rolls,and their credit histories had been mixed up by the credit information service that provided maximus with employment information.
before sending the employment verification request,a maximus representative telephoned inolex at least twice,attempting to reach beck.on one call,inolex department informed the maximus representative that,based on the social security number he provided,the debtor donna beck did not work there.the maximus representative responded by contending beck must be using two different social security numbers.notified of the inquiries,beck called maximus to clarify she was not the debtor in question.she also contacted the other donna beck,met her in person,and established she had an outstanding debt with the department of education.after this meeting,neither woman contacted maximus to clarify the situation.beck testified that when she saw the employment verification request,she knew it was intended for the other donna beck and was sent to inolex in error.
on may,beck filed a complaint in the district court,alleging maximus violated the fair debt collection practices act,and.the fair debt collection practices act is intended to protect both debtors and from misleading and abusive practices.see e.among other things,the act expressly prohibits a ny debt collector communicating with any person other than the consumer from stat ing that such consumer owes any debt,and from indicat ing that the debt collector is in the debt collection business or that the communication relates to the collection of a debt.the complaint alleged maximus violated the act by sending beck employer a form collection letter,which improperly identified the sender as a collection agency and implied the existence of a debt.
section c of the act offers a defense to a debt collector whose violation results from a bona fide error.it provides 
a debt collector may not be liable in any action under this subchapter if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such error.
beck filed a motion for class certification of consumers in pennsylvania whose employers received an employment verification request from maximus.maximus responded it had a defense to beck claims under c because it made a bona fide error on the identity of the debtor donna beck.maximus contended this defense,unique to beck claims,precluded beck from being an adequate representative with claims typical of the class.after the district court denied maximus motion to dismiss the class allegations,maximus filed an answer to the complaint,again contending it had a defense to beck claims under c.
maximus designated two corporate witnesses under.b the project manager who oversaw student loan collection,and the collection supervisor in charge of assuring compliance with the fair debt collection practices act.at depositions prior to class certification,these witnesses explained the employment verification request was a standard form letter,drafted by maximus.it was used to verify whether a given debtor worked for the employer maximus had listed in its records.the witnesses testified maximus had no specific procedures governing use of employment verification requests.they also testified that sending the employment verification request to beck employer did not violate any established policy,and that it was not uncommon to send employment verification requests to the wrong employer.
following oral arguments,the district court certified a class consisting of all individuals in pennsylvania to whose employer maximus had sent an employment verification request on or after may.the district court designated beck as class representative and the law firms of francis mailman,and donavan and searles,llc,as class.
in its findings of facts supporting class certification under.a the district court noted neither numerosity nor commonality was in dispute.numerosity was shown by the existence of class members,and commonality was satisfied because t he principal question is whether defendant violated the fair debt collection practices act by sending an employment verification request or a substantially same form to the person employer s on or after the applicable date.app the court concluded typicality was satisfied because t he claims of plaintiff donna beck are typical of the claims of the class.id.in a footnote,the court rejected maximus contention that beck was atypical because her claims were subject to a unique defense.the court stated 
d efendant says that sending the evr to plaintiff employer was the result of a bona fide error and defensible.plaintiff counters that it is irrelevant whether the communication was in error,because the prohibited language included in all not an error.plaintiff cites deposition testimony of two representatives of defendant that defendant drafted the language of the evr,there was no specific procedure for sending evrs,and it was not uncommon for evrs to be sent to employers for whom debtors did not work.given this evidence,the evr does not appear to have been sent to beck employer in error,and she will not be disqualified from representing the class on this basis.
app.internal citations to district court record omitted.the court concluded adequacy of representation was also satisfied,noting beck retained qualified counsel,appeared for deposition,and verified answers to interrogatories.app.the district court concluded the class could be maintained under rules b,b,and b.the court did not acknowledge beck had previously withdrawn her request for certification under rule b.
maximus petitioned for an interlocutory appeal under.f,which we granted.maximus contends if it prevails on its bona fide error defense,beck will be precluded from recovery on the class claims.in its view,the district court abused its discretion in concluding beck was a typical and adequate class representative,and in certifying the class.beck responds her interests are aligned with those of the class.that she was not the donna beck referred to in the employment verification request,she contends,is a factual variation that does not create a conflict of interest between her and the class,and does not render her inadequate or atypical as a class representative.
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under e.we review a district court decision to certify a class for abuse of discretion.in re prudential ins.am.sales practice,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if its decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.id.quoting in re ge.motors.truck fuel tank products liab,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states igbonwa,cir quotations omitted.
to evaluate typicality,we ask whether the named plaintiffs claims are typical,in terms,of the class,thus suggesting that the incentives of the plaintiffs are aligned with those of the class.baby neal casey,cir.f actual differences will not render a claim atypical if the claim arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members,and if it is based on the same legal theory.id.at quoting hoxworth blinder,robinson,cir.the adequacy inquiry serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.amchem products,windsor,d.it assures that the named plaintiffs claims are not antagonistic to the class and that the attorneys for the class representatives are experienced and qualified to prosecute the claims on behalf of the entire class.baby neal,at.
the supreme court has noted the typicality and adequacy inquiries often tend to merge because both look to potential conflicts and to whether the named plaintiff claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.amchem,at.quoting.sw.falcon,d.because of the similarity of these two inquiries,certain whether a unique defense should defeat class relevant under both.
maximus contends its alleged bona fide error defense renders beck neither typical nor adequate as a class representative.beck disputes that the alleged defense renders her atypical,but does not address its effect on her adequacy of representation.the district court also addressed the issue exclusively in terms of typicality.we believe the alleged unique defense is relevant under both inquiries.accordingly,we will address both the typicality and adequacy requirements of rule a.
courts of appeals have held that unique defenses bear on both the typicality and adequacy of a class representative.see,gary plastic packaging merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir regardless of whether the issue is framed in terms of the typicality of the representative claims or the adequacy of its representation there is a danger that absent class members will suffer if their representative is preoccupied with defenses unique to it.cohn am.appraisal,cir t he presence of even an arguable defense peculiar to the named plaintiff or a small subset of the plaintiff class may destroy the required typicality of the class as well as bring into question the adequacy of the named plaintiff representative.commentators agree.see charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,ed noting securities class actions in which a unique defense defeated typicality id.at citing cases in which a unique defense defeated adequacy of representation james moore et,moore federal practice ed typicality id.at b iv adequacy of representation.
other courts of appeals emphasize,as do we,the challenge presented by a defense unique to a class representative interests might not be aligned with those of the class,and the representative might devote time and effort to the defense at the expense of issues that are common and controlling for the class.see,gary plastic packaging,at t here is a danger that absent class members will suffer if their representative is preoccupied with defenses unique to it.see also hanon dataproducts,cir cohn,at.a class representative should not be permitted to impose such a disadvantage on the class.koos first bank of peoria,cir.
district courts have discretion under rule to certify a class.see califano yamasaki,d.but a trial court must clearly articulate its reasons,in part,so we can adequately review the certification decision on appeal under rule f.under rule c b,the trial court must include in class certification orders a clear and complete summary of those claims,issues,or defenses subject to class treatment.wachtel guardian life ins.of america,cir.june.
a class may be certified only if the court is satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.falcon,at.in addition,parties seeking class certification must show that the action is maintainable under rule b,or.in re warfarin sodium antitrust,cir.depending on the circumstances,class certification questions are sometimes enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action,and courts may delve beyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements for class certification are satisfied.newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir quotations omitted.
here,we have difficulty discerning the district court reasons for concluding beck was a typical and adequate class representative.we note two problems in particular.first,we are unclear whether the court concluded the alleged violation was based on the content of the employment verification request or on the transmission of the form to employers.this issue,which the parties contest,is central to a proper certification analysis in this case.second,we are unclear whether the court considered the three requirements of a successful bona fide error defense in concluding that the employment verification request had not been sent to inolex in error,and that beck should not be disqualified on these grounds as a class representative.because these two issues are closely related,we address them together.
to qualify for the bona fide error defense under the fair debt collection practices act,a defendant alleged violation of the act must have been unintentional and must have resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such error.c.accordingly,to avail itself of the defense,maximus will have to establish the alleged violation was unintentional,the alleged violation resulted from a bona fide error,and the bona fide error occurred despite procedures designed to avoid such errors.see johnson riddle,cir kort diversified collection,cir.
beck contends the alleged violation resulted from the content of the employment verification request.she explains the standardized language of the form gave rise to identical claims on behalf of each class member,and concludes w hether the language of the evr violates the act is the common overarching issue in this case.appellee br.maximus takes the opposite the transmission and not the content of the employer verification request gave rise to the class claims.maximus contends a debt collection letter content alone can not violate the fair debt collection practices act,and it is only when the content is communicated to a consumer or a third party that a violation can occur.
the district court appears to have adopted each party position at different points in its analysis in the text of the opinion,the court focused on the form transmission,articulating the principal question of law or fact common to the class as whether defendant violated the fair debt collection practices act by sending an employment verification request or a substantially same form to the person employer s on or after the applicable date.app this is maximus position.but in footnote seven,the court adopted beck contrary position,focusing on the form content as the basis of the violation.the court stated,i t is undisputed that the dispositive issue is whether the display of maximus collection center at the top and bottom of the evr violated the act.app.
the difference between the parties positions is central to determining whether maximus could possibly establish the three requirements of a bona fide error defense,and possibly defeat beck typicality and adequacy as a class representative.the record demonstrates the drafting of the employment verification request was neither unintentional nor the result of a bona fide error under the first two requirements of the defense.maximus witnesses maximus maximus drafted the form language.but the transmission of the form to beck employer,inolex,may have been both unintentional and the result of a good faith,bona fide error on the identity of the debtor donna beck.maximus relied on a credit agency that reported the debtor beck worked for inolex.at issue is whether maximus was aware this information was incorrect 
if the error resulted from the transmission of the form,and if maximus can establish the third requirement of th
