this appeal arises from a bankruptcy court adversary proceeding challenging appellant banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria bbva garnishment of funds in the bank account of a corporation wholly owned by a chapter debtor and his wife.bbva appeals the district court affirmance of a bankruptcy court judgment in favor of the bankruptcy trustee,holding that bbva garnishment of funds was a preferential transfer of estate property avoidable under b.bbva seeks to argue in this court,under a number of theories,that ownership of the garnished funds was properly vested in the bank and not the debtor.because bbva neglected to squarely raise these arguments before the bankruptcy court,it has waived them and we therefore affirm.
in,bbva brought suit in a commonwealth court against manuel enrique,his wife,and an associated business partnership,resulting in an attachment in the amount of on several parcels of real property owned by the couple.bbva filed the attachment order in the puerto rico registry of property in june.
in august,and his wife sold one of the attached properties,a parcel located in paseo de la fuente,puerto rico.as it happened,the purchasers arranged for financing through bbva.though bbva ordered a title report prior to the closing,the report omitted for reasons that are in dispute and not material here bbva attachment.the personnel in charge of the financing at bbva were apparently unaware of the attachment and remained so until after the closing.
upon sale of the parcel,bbva issued a manager check to and his wife in the amount of,the entire proceeds of the sale,who admitted at trial that he was aware of the attachment order,may or may not have been surprised at the amount of the check and bbva failure to withhold any portion of the proceeds to satisfy its attachment,but he did not raise the issue with bbva 
and his wife deposited the check for into a newly created bank account at a bank.the account was opened in the name of code inspector and management code inspector,a corporation created by the couple in.and his wife were the sole shareholders and officers of code inspector,and each had full control over the funds held in code inspector bank account.
two weeks after the closing,having belatedly become aware of the failure to withhold a portion of the paseo de la fuente sales proceeds to satisfy its attachment,bbva garnished all of the available funds in the code inspector bank account at the time,the account contained.bbva was unaware that the account was maintained in code inspector name,believing it to be personal account 
in december,filed a petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy schedules accompanying petition listed the code inspector bank account as property of the bankruptcy estate.
the bankruptcy trustee responsible for the estate initiated this adversary proceeding against bbva in september,asserting that the bank garnishment of funds in the code inspector bank account amounted to a preferential transfer under b the trustee sought to recover the full garnished by bbva 
the bankruptcy court held a bench trial in may.after hearing testimony from and a representative of bbva,the court ordered further briefing on the core issue that emerged at trial whether had transferred his interest in the sales proceeds to code inspector by depositing them in code inspector bank account,effectively removing those funds from the bankruptcy estate.in an opinion and order issued on october,the court found that had retained ownership of the funds in the code inspector account,and therefore that bbva garnishment of funds constituted an avoidable,preferential transfer of property from the estate.
bbva appealed to the district court,see a,arguing that the bankruptcy court had erred in finding that the funds in the code inspector bank account were owned by.bbva also raised several new defenses under puerto rico negotiable instruments law,and argued as well that half of the proceeds from the sale of the paseo de la fuente parcel belonged to wife and not to the estate.the district court affirmed,adopting the reasoning of the bankruptcy court and rejecting bbva newly asserted defenses as waived because bbva had failed to raise them in the bankruptcy court.responding to bbva remaining argument,the court held that the sale proceeds constituted community property of and his spouse and thus were properly included in the bankruptcy estate.
this timely appeal followed.we review a bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo,granting no special deference to the intermediate decision of the district court on appeal.see stornawaye fin.hill in re hill,cir.
under section b of the bankruptcy code,the trustee of an estate in bankruptcy may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property made to a creditor,on account of an antecedent debt,while the debtor was insolvent,during the period preceding the filing of the petition,which allowed such creditor to receive more than it would have under chapter.advanced testing,desmond in re computer eng g assocs,cir quoting b.the only contested element in this adversary proceeding is whether the garnished funds were an interest of the debtor in property,that is,whether had a property interest in the funds on deposit in code inspector bank account when they were garnished by bbva.
in the proceedings before the bankruptcy court,bbva sought to establish that had no property interest in the funds on the theory that the deposit into code inspector bank account converted the funds from personal property subject to bankruptcy procedures into corporate property this contention placed bbva in the somewhat awkward position of arguing that it had garnished funds from an entity that owed bbva no debt.indeed,bbva necessarily conceded that,if its theory of the case were correct,code inspector might have a cause of action against bbva.the bankruptcy court rejected this argument,and bbva does not challenge the bankruptcy court holding here.
in fact,bbva has wholly abandoned on appeal each of the arguments it made before the bankruptcy court.instead of arguing that deposit of the sales proceeds transferred ownership to code inspector,as it did below,bbva offers here an array of new legal arguments contending that a valid property interest in the funds never even passed from bbva to.first,bbva raises a defense it styles payment by mistake,contending that never obtained a right to the sale proceeds because the proceeds were transferred to him due to,that bbva failed to withhold funds sufficient to satisfy the attachment because that encumbrance was erroneously omitted from the title report.in support of this argument bbva primarily relies on article of the puerto rico civil code see laws ann.tit.
second,bbva offers a somewhat obscure argument under two sections of the puerto rico civil code that relate to the extinguishment of debt owed concurrently by two parties each to the other,referred to by bbva as.see laws ann.tit.under this theory,obligation to bbva was extinguished by operation of law upon the closing of the sale of the paseo de la fuente parcel,at which moment bbva and each owed a debt to the for the preexisting attachment,and bbva,as the purchaser financing agent,for the sale price.the thrust of this argument,never fully elucidated by bbva,appears to be that the sale proceeds were automatically applied to the attachment,and thus of the check issued to and his wife represented an overpayment to which they had no legal entitlement.
third,bbva argues,under several provisions of puerto rico negotiable instruments law,that bbva had the right to rescind the manager check issued to because did not take the instrument in good faith and therefore did not qualify as a holder in due course.see laws ann.tit.fourth,bbva contends that the paseo de la fuente parcel and the proceeds from its sale were in custodia legis literally,in the custody of the law at all points subsequent to the issuance of the attachment order,barring from obtaining a legal interest in the sale proceeds.
as set forth below,we hold that bbva has forfeited its chance to be heard on these argume
