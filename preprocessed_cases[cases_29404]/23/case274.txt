kyle hamilton appeals from the dismissal of his fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,claim against healthcare recoveries,hri,as well as from the district court determination that it lacked diversity jurisdiction.he also appeals from the district court refusal to allow him to amend his complaint.for the following reasons,we reverse in part,affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in october of,hamilton was seriously injured in a automobile accident in which he was a passenger.as a result of the accident,hamilton required medical and other treatment.defendant,united healthcare of louisiana,united,had in force a group health plan,offered through hamilton father employer,pursuant to which hamilton was insured as a dependent.pursuant to that coverage,united paid for certain of the medical and other services necessitated by the accident,allegedly totaling in excess of.at the time of the accident,hamilton father also had in effect uninsured underinsured motorist um coverage pursuant to two polices with state farm insurance company state farm.state farm paid nearly in um benefits and in medpay benefits to hamilton pursuant to those policies.shortly thereafter,hri,acting pursuant to its contract with united began sending notices to hamilton father and state farm in an attempt to enforce subrogation rights that united claimed to have against any of the proceeds that hamilton might receive from third parties,including his own insurer state farm.state farm,through hamilton counsel,subsequently paid out of the um policy proceeds,to which hamilton would have otherwise been entitled,to hri on behalf of united.hamilton then retained new counsel who attempted to recover the monies that united had obtained from state farm.on february,counsel sent united a letter outlining in detail why louisiana revised statutes sections and precluded the type of subrogation claims that united had made against the state farm proceeds.attached to that letter was a copy of a state court petition.hamilton state lawsuit sought to recover the funds paid to united through hri and asked the court to enjoin any further attempts by united to either coordinate benefits or subrogate claims to any future proceeds under the state farm policies.united removed the case to federal court alleging that erisa completely preempted hamilton state law claims.after united removed,hamilton filed a putative class action,naming hri as defendant.in that suit,hamilton alleged that hri acts during its recovery of funds from himself and others violates the fdcpa,as well as the louisiana unfair trade practices act.ann,et.west lutpa.the two cases were subsequently consolidated and the defendants in both cases filed motions to dismiss.thereafter,the district court remanded the united suit to state court.hamilton united health care of,nos.civ,wl,at.may.the district court then considered hri motion for judgment on the pleadings and alternative motion for summary judgment,which the court treated as a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.by an order entered on july,the motion was granted in part,and the court dismissed hamilton fdcpa claim with prejudice,finding that hamilton failed to state a claim because hri was not collecting a debt under the fdcpa.
on august,the district court concluded that no independent basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction existed over the remaining state law claims because hamilton failed to establish that the amount in controversy exceeded for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.the court refused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.as such,the state law claims were dismissed without prejudice.hamilton then filed a motion for reconsideration and motion for leave to file a supplemental and amended complaint seeking to add new theories of recovery in order to cure the defect.the district court denied these motions.in doing so,it concluded that the proposed amendments to hamilton complaint would not cure the amount in controversy defect.judgment was entered and hamilton appealed.

discussion 
the fdcpa was enacted in part to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by collectors.e.as such,the fdcpa enumerates several practices considered contrary to that goal,and forbids debt collectors from taking such action.poirier alco collections,cir.for the fdcpa to apply,the obligation at issue must qualify as a debt,defined as any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money,property,insurance,or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.
the district court dismissed hamilton fdcpa claim pursuant to rule b after concluding that the subrogation claim that hri sought to enforce on behalf of united was not a debt within the meaning of the fdcpa.the court began its analysis by noting that several key elements of the term debt appear to be present in this case.the court concluded that hamilton entered into a consensual transaction for insurance and purchased that insurance for personal or family use for which hamilton was obligated to pay money to united if its subrogation claim was valid.the court found that the question of whether hamilton obligation to pay arises out of his transaction with united to be more problematic.the court recognized that but for hamilton health insurance contract with united,his recovery on the um proceeds would create no obligation.however,in rejecting hamilton argument that the debt arose out of his contract with united,the court relied on garner augustine,kern levens,c,wl.in garner,health care services corporation health care administered group health and welfare benefit plans for a number of employers,including garner employer.wl,at.garner was a member of that plan.garner daughter was injured and health care paid medical benefits to cover her medical care.health care filed suit for reimbursement of the benefits paid after garner refused to respond to health care requests for information,which would allow it to assess whether it had any reimbursement rights by reason of garner recovery from a third party,or to subsequent letters from health care counsel.when health care counsel learned that there was no right of reimbursement,the suit was voluntarily dismissed.garner then filed a claim against the law firm representing health care,and one of its partners,under the fdcpa and state law.the district court held that health care reimbursement claim against its insured was not a debt for purposes of the fdcpa.id.at.the court reasoned that the inclusion of debts relating to insurance in was obviously aimed at a consumer who contracts for insurance coverage and then does not pay the premium.id.at.the court further concluded that the fdcpa was not intended to cover the situation here,where an employee or his or her beneficiary under an employee benefit plan has received benefits that may give rise to a reimbursement obligation under that plan,then fails to respond to the plan bona fide inquiries as to the facts that bear on the existence or nonexistence of the employees or beneficiary duty of reimbursement,so that the insurer is forced to sue.id.to hold otherwise,the court concluded,would unduly strain the normal meaning of the language that has been used by congress in the fdcpa.id.
based on garner,the district court concluded that a contractual subrogation claim,while in fact arising out of the contract of insurance,is not the kind of payment obligation that congress intended when it created the fdcpa for the protection of consumers.
hamilton contends that hri claims against hamilton arise out of a transaction in which the insurance that is the subject of the transaction is primarily for personal,family,or household purposes.he asserts that the district court erred by failing to find that hri enforcement of united subrogation rights for reimbursement of benefits paid by united as hamilton group health insurer constitutes a debt under.to support this position,hamilton cites pollice tax funding,cir t he plain meaning of section indicates that a debt is created whenever a consumer is obligated to pay money as a result of a transaction whose subject is primarily for personal,family or household purposes.further,he argues that the district court determination that the contractual subrogation claim was too attenuated from the original purchase of insurance to be a debt under the fdcpa is contrary to the broad protections afforded by the fdcpa.
hamilton claims that garner is distinguishable because it involved a plan,whereas hamilton health plan is an insured plan,and here,louisiana revised statute section prohibits united from seeking reimbursement.he argues that garner limitation on the scope of debts,its conclusion that the fdcpa inclusion of insurance was meant to address only of premiums by an based upon the erroneous assumption that there must be an extension of credit to the consumer.
additionally,hamilton claims that his purchase of the united insurance policy is the consumer transaction that gave rise to united obligations to pay medical benefits and its alleged right to seek reimbursement out of the proceeds of his recoveries against third parties.in support of his claim that the reimbursement obligation arose from the purchase of insurance,hamilton relies on brown budget,cir.in brown,brown rented a truck and dolly from budget,and also paid for loss damage waiver ldw protection.id.at.while operating the truck,brown ran into an overpass,and budget sought reimbursement from brown and his insurance company.brown insurance carrier paid for damage to the truck,but brown refused to pay the deductible or loss of use fees because he believed they were encompassed by the ldw.budget contended that ldw coverage did not apply and that brown violated the restrictions clause in the rental agreement,and retained collection agents to initiate collection activities against brown.brown filed suit against the collection agents under the state law and the fdcpa,and the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to rule b.the court found that because the alleged obligations did not arise from an extension or offer of credit,there was no debt as defined by the fdcpa.id.at.on appeal,the eleventh circuit held that as long as the consumer transaction creates an obligation to pay,a debt is created,and that the extension of credit is not a prerequisite to existence of a debt under the fdcpa.id.the court concluded that budget assertion that brown is obligated as a result of a consumer transaction suffices to bring the obligation within the term debt.id.
hri counters that there is no debt within the definition of the fdcpa because the subject of the transaction from which the obligation to pay arose is not primarily for personal,family or household purposes.contrary to hamilton assertion that the consumer transaction was the purchase of insurance,hri claims that hamilton reimbursement obligation arose out of the automobile accident and his subsequent recovery of money from a third party.further,hri asserts that garner is directly on point,holding that the fdcpa does not apply to claims because they do not arise out of a consumer transaction.hri claims that,like in garner,its august,letter was designed to determine whether there was a reimbursement obligation,not as an attempt to collect an alleged debt because the reimbursement claim did not arise out of a consumer transaction.
further,citing hawthorne mac adjustment,cir,hri asserts that brown is distinguishable because it concerned whether the fdcpa requires an extension of credit and did not address whether the alleged debt arose pursuant to a consumer transaction.in hawthorne,the eleventh circuit held that a debt arising from tortious conduct on the part of the defendants does not constitute a consumer transaction for purposes of the fdcpa.id.at.in discussing its holding in brown,the court stated in part as follows 
we held that the fdcpa does not require the extension of credit to be applicable to an obligation.we did not consider the question of whether the obligation at issue in brown involved a transaction under the fdcpa.it is clear,however,that the facts delineated in brown do not exclude the possibility that the obligation in that case constituted a debt under the fdcpa,as brown obligations arose at least in part out of a business transaction where brown contracted for what appear to be personal services the truck rental and the loss damage waiver protection.
id.because no such transaction,contract,business,or consensual in hawthorn,the court held that brown did not require the court to conclude that the tort obligation at issue was covered by the fdcpa.id.
as with all issues of statutory interpretation,the appropriate place to begin our analysis is with the text itself.hughey united states,d.we agree with the seventh circuit determination that the fdcpa definition of debt is plain.bass stolper,koritzinsky,brewster neider,cir.the definition is not beset with internal inconsistencies or burdened with vocabulary that escapes common understanding.id.quoting eeoc v.the chicago club,cir.in the absence of ambiguity,our inquiry ends with the text itself.as the bass court noted 
t he plain language of the act defines debt quite broadly as any obligation to pay arising out of a consumer transaction.in examining this definition,we first focus on the clear and absolute language in the phrase,any obligation to pay.such absolute language may not be alternatively read to reference only a limited set of obligations as long as the transaction creates an obligation to pay,a debt is created.
a fundamental canon of statutory construction instructs that in the absence of a statutory definition,we give terms their ordinary meaning.perrin united states,d.arising out of are words of much broader significance than caused by.they are ordinarily understood to mean originating from,having its origin in,growing out of or flowing from,or in short,incident to,or having connection with.red ball motor freight,employers mut.liab.ins.of,cir see also black law dictionary ed defining arise as originating or stemming from.moreover,the ordinary meaning of the term transaction is a broad reference to many different types of business dealings between parties,and does not connote any specific form of payment.bass,at citing webster new world dictionary ed defining transaction simply as a business deal or agreement.we can not avoid the inescapable conclusion that the plain meaning of debt encompasses the funds owed in this case.there is no question that the obligation to pay arose out of hamilton transaction of purchasing insurance.hri is simply incorrect in its assertion that the obligation to pay arose out of a tortious act.hawthorne itself suggests that hamilton obligations arose out of a consumer transaction for purposes of the fdcpa.as opposed to hawthorne,where hawthorne obligations arose from tort law,hamilton obligations arose from a business transaction where hamilton contracted for personal and family services,insurance.moreover,the plain meaning of arising out of as stemming from leads us to conclude that the obligation to pay arose from the for insurance.
the district court and garner interpretation of the definition of debt is too narrow.as the supreme court stated in hubbard united states,we are prohibited from reading into clear statutory language a restriction that congress itself did not include,d a bsent any indication that doing so would frustrate congress clear intention or yield patent absurdity,our obligation is to apply the statute as congress wrote it.internal quotations and citation omitted.
finally,while fifth circuit law is crystal clear that when,as here,the language of a statute is unambiguous,this court has no need to and will not defer to extrinsic aids or legislative history,our review of the legislative history brings forth nothing that contradicts our statutory interpretation.see guilzon comm r of internal revenue,cir.congress,through the fdcpa,has legislatively expressed a strong public policy disfavoring dishonest,abusive,and unfair consumer debt collection practices,and clearly intended the fdcpa to have a broad remedial scope.see.at in addition to the specific prohibitions,this bill prohibits in general terms any harassing,unfair,or deceptive collection practice.this will enable the courts,where appropriate,to proscribe other improper conduct which is not specifically addressed,reprinted in,wright fin.serv.of norwalk,cir en banc explaining that congress wrote broad language into the fdcpa to forestall abusive practices by debt collectors.for these reasons,and because we agree with the bass court conclusion that the meaning of debt is clear,we hold that the district court erred in concluding that hamilton obligation to pay hri did not fall under the fdcpa.see bass,at.
hri next offers an alternative argument in support of the district court rule b dismissal of hamilton complaint.hri contends that it is not a debt collector within the meaning of the statute.instead,it maintains that it is excluded pursuant to the exemption set forth in f iii,which states that a debt collector does not include any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity concerns a debt which was not in default at the time it was obtained by such a person.hamilton vigorously disagrees.
for purposes of dealing with this argument,we must remain within the bounds of review permitted for a dismissal pursuant to rule b.although hri filed a motion for summary judgment,the district court explicitly stated that it was dismissing the case on b grounds.the district court commented on hri alternative debt collector argument however,its decision was in no way predicated on it.when dealing with hri argument,the court noted that it need not address the parties arguments on the debt collector issue because the debt issue was dispositive.hamilton united healthcare of,nos.civ,wl,at.july.
after considering the district court opinion,the parties contentions,and the particular language of the statutory exclusion in dispute,we conclude that further appellate review is foreclosed by rule b.the rule constrains us to scrutinize the complaint only.resolution of the debt collector issue in this case is clearly tied to a determination of the circumstances surrounding the inception of the debt.accordingly,we remand to the district court for further consideration of this issue.
finally,hamilton urges that the court erred in dismissing its remaining claims because diversity jurisdiction existed.hri does not dispute that the parties are diverse instead,it maintains that hamilton has failed to meet the requirement.the crux of hamilton argument is that attorneys fees will raise the well above.
the district court noted that attorneys fees may be imputed to a class representative however,it also observed that we have held that imputing fees to a class representative is only permitted when a statute explicitly provides for attorneys fees.graham henegar,cir.further,when a statute awards attorneys fees to the named plaintiffs in a class action,the fees are attributed solely to the class representatives.in re abbott,cir a b,a.since the court had already dismissed the fdcpa claim,the court focused on the remaining statutory claim,the lutpa claim.concluding,correctly,that the lutpa does not allow class action claims,and that hamilton personal fees would not be enough to push hamilton above the requirement,the court held that it did not have diversity jurisdiction.we find no error in this assessment 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court determination that the funds at issue in this case do not qualify as a debt under the fdcpa and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.we also affirm the district court decision that diversity jurisdiction did not exist in this case.
reversed in part,affirmed in part,and remanded.
i agree with the majority conclusion that the district court correctly dismissed hamilton remaining claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in addition,i agree that it would be inappropriate for us to rule on the issue of whether healthcare recoveries,hri constitutes a debt collector under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.i can not,however,agree with the majority conclusion that an obligation to pay an insurance subrogation claim constitutes a debt under the fdcpa.
the fdcpa defines a debt as follows 
a ny obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money,property,insurance,or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.
the majority opinion focuses on the words any obligation and arising out of,and concludes that the fdcpa applies to an insurance subrogation claim.the reasoning in the majority opinion appears to be as follows united health care of louisiana,united agreed to provide insurance for hamilton via an agreement with his father employer.that insurance agreement is a transaction that is primarily for personal,family,or household purposes because it provides health care insurance for employees and their families.the agreement is a but for cause of united subrogation claim,for,without the agreement,united would have no claim for reimbursement.therefore,the majority concludes,the subrogation claim arises out of a consumer transaction for insurance,and constitutes a debt for purposes of the fdcpa.
i doubt,however,that the matter is so simple.the word debt as defined in the fdcpa does not have the expansive scope that the majority analysis suggests.the seventh circuit whose decisions are relied on extensively by the majority opinion has reasoned that not all obligations to pay are considered debts under the fdcpa.bass stolper,koritzinsky,brewster neider,cir.on the contrary,the definition of debt serves to limit the scope of the act.see also hawthorne mac adjustment,cir w e do not hold that every consensual or business dealing constitutes a transaction triggering application of the fdcpa such a holding would be contrary to the plain language of the statute limiting applicability to specified transactions.
in addition,only an extremely broad interpretation of arising out of could lead the majority to conclude that united subrogation claim aris es out of the single transaction between united and hamilton.the subrogation claim asserted by united arose out of a string of events.first,there was the insurance contract between united and hamilton.second,there was the contract for uninsured underinsured motorist coverage um policy between hamilton and state farm.third,there was the accident that injured hamilton.fourth,there was united payment of hamilton medical bills.fifth,there was the payment by state farm to hamilton pursuant to the um policy.so,although one might say that this subrogation claim arose out of the underlying insurance agreement between united and hamilton,one could also say that the claim arose out of any one of these other events.it would be most accurate to say that the subrogation claim arose out of the combination of events,and not out of a single transaction 
nevertheless,the majority opinion concludes that t here is no question that the obligation to pay arose out of hamilton transaction of purchasing insurance.the opinion supports this conclusion by asserting that this court has given the phrase arising out of an expansive interpretation.it is true that we have construed the phrase broadly when interpreting insurance policies.see am.states ins.bailey,cir this court has held that the words arising out of,when used within an insura
