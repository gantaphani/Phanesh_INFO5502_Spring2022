plaintiffs joni eades and levere pike,sued defendant kennedy,pc law offices kennedy,alleging that kennedy attempts to collect a debt from the plaintiffs violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.the united states district court for the western district of new york larimer,dismissed the plaintiffs amended complaint,holding primarily that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over kennedy.in the alternative it also concluded that the payment allegedly owed to kennedy client,a pennsylvania nursing home,was not a debt under the fdcpa and that the amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we affirm in part and vacate in part and remand.
background 
we draw the following facts from the allegations in the plaintiffs amended complaint and documents attached thereto or incorporated by reference therein.see org.for marriage,walsh,cir.in october doris pike was admitted to corry manor,a pennsylvania nursing home.two months later corry manor required pike husband,levere pike,to sign an admission agreement in order to keep his wife at the nursing home.under the admission agreement,pike promised to use pike assets to pay for the nursing care provided to her.the agreement also required pike to assert that he has legal access to pike income,assets or resources.
when pike passed away in january,corry manor claimed an outstanding balance of approximately for its nursing care services.corry manor retained kennedy,a debt collector,to collect that balance.in july kennedy mailed a debt collection letter to and pike daughter,joni eades,at her home in new york.the letter stated,y ou may be held personally liable for the cost of your mother care pursuant to pennsylvania indigent support statute,and quoted portions of that statute and pennsylvania uniform fraudulent transfer act.it also stated that kennedy would assume the debt was valid unless eades notified it of a dispute within days.during a subsequent telephone conversation with eades,a kennedy employee stated that if the debt was not paid kennedy would put a lien on pike home and garnish eades wages.when eades disclaimed responsibility for her mother medical bills,the kennedy employee replied,s ervices were provided,the bill needs to be paid and you are responsible.
in december kennedy filed a complaint against the plaintiffs on behalf of corry manor in pennsylvania state court.the complaint alleged that pike had breached the admission agreement by failing to use pike resources to pay the balance owed to corry manor.the complaint also alleged that by not paying the debt,the plaintiffs had violated pennsylvania indigent support and fraudulent transfer statutes.kennedy mailed the summons and complaint to the plaintiffs homes in new york.
the plaintiffs responded by suing kennedy in the united states district court for the western district of new york.their amended complaint alleged that kennedy violated various provisions of the fdcpa,in connection with the filing of the pennsylvania lawsuit and the letter and telephone call to eades.the plaintiffs also alleged that kennedy suit for breach of the admission agreement violated the fdcpa,because the financial obligations imposed by the admission agreement were unlawful under the nursing home reform act,nhra.they did not,however,assert a separate claim for a violation of the nhra.when kennedy moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b,b,and b,the plaintiffs responded,among other things,that kennedy lawsuit in pennsylvania violated the fdcpa because the nhra preempted pennsylvania indigent support statute.
the district court granted kennedy motion,holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over kennedy and that,in any event,the plaintiffs alleged obligation to pay corry manor did not constitute a debt as defined by the fdcpa,the nhra did not preempt pennsylvania indigent support statute,and the complaint failed adequately to allege that kennedy collection efforts violated the fdcpa or to state a cause of action under the nhra.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
personal jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,we address whether the plaintiffs factual allegations support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over kennedy.in order to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that jurisdiction exists.licci ex rel.licci lebanese canadian bank,sal,cir quotation marks omitted.to determine personal jurisdiction over a in a case involving a federal question,we first apply the forum state statute.chloé queen bee of beverly hills,llc,cir.if the statute permits personal jurisdiction,we analyze whether personal jurisdiction comports with due process protections established under the constitution.id.at.
the plaintiffs assert that jurisdiction lies under a of new york civil practice law,which provides in relevant part that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any who in person or through an agent transacts any business within the state.a.to establish personal jurisdiction under section a,two requirements must be met the defendant must have transacted business within the state and the claim asserted must arise from that business activity.licci,at quotation marks omitted.p roof of one transaction in new york is sufficient to invoke jurisdiction,even though the defendant never enters new york,so long as the defendant activities here were purposeful and there is a substantial relationship between the transaction and the claim asserted.chloé,at quoting kreutter mcfadden oil,quotation marks omitted.purposeful activities are those with which a defendant,through volitional acts,avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.fischbarg doucet,quotation marks omitted.
kennedy activities in new one debt collection notice to eades,engaging in one debt collection phone call with eades,and mailing a summons and complaint to both enough to establish personal jurisdiction under a.on this record,it appears that negotiating debt collections constituted a major aspect of kennedy of its principal reason for being.deutsche bank.bd.of,quotation marks omitted.and kennedy initiated its debt collection efforts in an active rather than responsive attempt to collect money from two new york residents.paterno laser spine.moreover,the plaintiffs fdcpa claims arise directly from kennedy business communications into new york.see bates c s adjusters,cir r eceipt of a collection notice is a substantial part of the events giving rise to a claim under the fdcpa.
we turn then to whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with the constitution due process protections.it does.as an initial matter,we note that despite the fact that section a of new york statute and constitutional due process are not coextensive,and that personal jurisdiction permitted under the statute may theoretically be prohibited under due process analysis,we would expect such cases to be rare.licci,at.to establish personal jurisdiction over a defendant,due process requires a plaintiff to allege that a defendant has certain minimum contacts with the relevant forum,and that the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable in the circumstances.in re terrorist attacks on,cir quoting int l shoe washington.as to the first requirement,we evaluate the quality and nature of the defendant contacts with the forum state under a totality of the circumstances test.licci,at quotation marks omitted.where,as here,specific jurisdiction is asserted,minimum contacts necessary to support such jurisdiction exist where the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the forum and could foresee being haled into court there.id.quotation marks and alterations omitted.t he commission of some single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state may sometimes be enough.daimler ag bauman,quoting int l shoe,at.
if minimum contacts exist,the defendant has to present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.licci,at quoting burger king rudzewicz,quotation mark omitted.these considerations include 
the burden that the exercise of jurisdiction will impose on the defendant the interests of the forum state in adjudicating the case the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of the controversy and the shared interest of the states in furthering substantive social policies.
chloé,at.ultimately,the exercise of personal jurisdiction is reasonable if it would comport with fair play and substantial justice.licci,at quoting burger king,at.
kennedy three purposeful contacts with new york meet the minimum contacts test.see daimler ag.at.the considerations we identified in chloé and more recently in macdermid,deiter,cir do not compel a contrary conclusion.kennedy,located in pennsylvania,can easily defend itself in new york new york has a manifest interest in providing effective means of redress for its residents and the plaintiffs have an interest in adjudicating their case in the state where they reside.chloé,at quoting burger king,at.the fourth factor is neutral the controversy can be resolved efficiently in either new york or pennsylvania.finally,the states share an interest in enabling plaintiffs to litigate fdcpa claims in their states of residence.see,sluys hand,noting that fdcpa plaintiffs should be able to file suit in their states of residence because o therwise,debt collectors could invoke the protection of distance and send violative letters with relative impunity,at least so far as less parties are concerned.
for these reasons,the district court had personal jurisdiction over kennedy pursuant to a.
failure to state a claim under the fdcpa 
the district court also concluded that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the fdcpa for two reasons the payment sought by kennedy was not a debt under the fdcpa and kennedy did not engage in the kind of conduct that would be actionable under the fdcpa.we consider each conclusion in turn.
definition of debt under the fdcpa 
the fdcpa defines debt as any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money,property,insurance,or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.a t a minimum,the fdcpa contemplates that the debt has arisen as a result of the rendition of a service or purchase of property or other item of value.beggs rossi,cir quotation marks omitted.
here,the balance owed to corry manor constitutes a debt under the fdcpa.the balance arose out of a consumer transaction in which nursing home services were exchanged for a monetary obligation.as such,it encompass es that type of pro tanto exchange which the statutory definition envisages.boyd robert,cir quotation marks omitted.the nursing home services nursing care for pike were primarily for personal or family purposes.moreover,the plaintiffs are consumers because kennedy claims that they are obligated to pay the balance,id.defining consumer as any natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay any debt,and for the same reason,the balance is an alleged obligation of a consumer,id.
we appreciate that some other courts have held that an arguably analogous statutory obligation,child support,is not a debt under the fdcpa.for example,the fourth circuit held that child support obligations do not qualify as debts under the fdcpa because they were not incurred to receive consumer goods or services r ather,a state agency imposed these obligations upon appellants to force them to fulfill their parental duty to support their children.mabe servs,cir.kennedy argues that the plaintiffs obligation to pay similarly arises from pennsylvania indigent support and fraudulent transfer statutes and as such does not qualify as a debt.we disagree.in determining whether an obligation is a debt under the fdcpa,the relevant consideration is whether the obligation arose out of a transaction of the type specified in the fdcpa,not whether the obligation is imposed or enforceable by statute.see.here,the plaintiffs alleged obligation to pay the balance exists only because of the exchange of nursing home services for money and accordingly constitutes a debt under the fdcpa.
kennedy debt collection activities 
we next consider whether kennedy debt collection activities the pennsylvania lawsuit and the letter and telephone call to eades are adequately alleged to be actionable under the fdcpa.
as an initial matter,the plaintiffs claim that kennedy violated,e,e,e,and of the fdcpa by attempting to collect the debt and by filing and pursuing the pennsylvania lawsuit.they advance four arguments why this is so first,that kennedy collection efforts and lawsuit in pennsylvania were based on an admission agreement that violated the nhra second,that kennedy lawsuit was premised on a pennsylvania statute that is preempted by the nhra third,that kennedy filed the lawsuit without supporting evidence and fourth,that the lawsuit falsely alleged that pike property was fraudulently transferred.we address each of these arguments in turn.
we reject the first argument because the provisions of the admission agreement on which the plaintiffs rely do not violate the nhra.the nhra provides that a nursing that participates in medicare or medicaid must not require a third party guarantee of payment to the facility as a condition of admission or expedited admission to,or continued stay in,the facility,c a ii,c a ii,with the caveat that a facility may require an individual,who has legal access to a resident income or resources available to pay for care in the facility,to sign a contract without incurring personal financial liability to provide payment from the resident income or resources for such care,id.c b ii,c b ii.the breach of contract claim that kennedy brought against pike in the pennsylvania action alleged that pike failure to use doris pike resources to pay corry manor is a breach of the agreement.joint app x emphasis added.pike admitted he had legal access to pike resources,and the nhra permitted corry manor to require him to agree to provide payment for pike care from pike resources,so long as the contract did not require him to incur personal financial liability.but pike never alleged that the admission agreement required him to pay any of his own money for pike care or to incur personal financial liability in the event that pike income or resources ran out.instead,he alleged that the agreement required him to use his wife assets to pay for her care.the nhra permits that requirement.
we also reject the plaintiffs preemption argument that the nhra actually conflicts with and therefore implicitly preempts the pennsylvania indigent support statute on which kennedy lawsuit relies.an actual conflict between state and federal law exists when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,when state law is an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,or where federal law is in irreconcilable conflict with state law.mary jo state local ret,cir quotation marks omitted.that said,we presume federal statutes do not preempt state law.bond united states.
with these principles in mind,we conclude that there is no actual conflict between the nhra and pennsylvania indigent support statute.the central purpose of the nhra is to improve the quality of care for nursing home residents,pt,at,reprinted in,see resident councils of leavitt,cir.and another principal purpose of the particular nhra provisions in this case is to protect the rights of nursing home residents in connection with the admissions policies of nursing facilities.see,c,c,pt,at,reprinted in at.nothing in the nhra indicates that its purpose is to shield family members of nursing home residents from financial responsibility for the residents medical care its aim is to protect actual or prospective residents of nursing care facilities from expulsion or from a denial of admission based on the failure of fam
