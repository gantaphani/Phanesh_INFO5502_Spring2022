discussion 
i.the court lacked authority to shorten time for notice of the summary judgment hearing.
urshan challenges numerous aspects of the trial court proceedings in this case.however,we find dispositive urshan argument the trial court abused its discretion by shortening time to permit musicians to file,and to hear,a motion for summary judgment.urshan urges this is especially so because the trial court did so even after musicians alerted the court insufficient days remained before trial to satisfy the then statutory requirement of a minimum of days notice.
