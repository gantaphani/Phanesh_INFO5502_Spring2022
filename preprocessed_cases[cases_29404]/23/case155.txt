ufp,a leading manufacturer of treated lumber products,began its business relationship with hechinger some years prior to hechinger june,bankruptcy filing.prior to february,hechinger was one of ufp biggest customers.however,hechinger financial condition worsened in and ufp became concerned about continuing to sell goods to hechinger on credit.
on february,ufp and hechinger had a meeting to discuss hechinger financial situation and possible solutions in order to allow the companies to maintain their business relationship during the upcoming spring season,when hechinger demand for lumber products was the greatest.prior to this meeting,hechinger had an open line of credit with ufp on terms of days,net,with a mail float.under this arrangement,hechinger could earn a price reduction for invoices paid within the discount period,namely,ten days plus a grace period for payments made by mail.app.hechinger had up to days to pay in order for the payment to be considered prompt.id.hechinger paid ufp by check accompanied by remittance advices that matched each payment to particular previous invoices.during the three years prior to hechinger bankruptcy filing,hechinger made most of its payments to ufp within the discount period.app.as of february,hechinger account reflected no amount past due,and coming due within the next days.app.
at the february meeting,ufp presented hechinger with four different options to allow the business relationship of the parties to continue.hechinger agreed to a million credit limit for future purchases and its credit terms were reduced to,days,net,meaning that hechinger could earn a price reduction for invoices paid within the seven day discount period,and had up to eight days to pay in order for the payment to be considered prompt.hechinger also agreed to remit payments to ufp by wire transfer,instead of check.hechinger wired payments in lump sum amounts of or million,prior to sending remittance advices to ufp.the changed terms of hechinger credit arrangements with ufp required hechinger to make larger and more frequent payments to ufp because hechinger placed orders for between and worth of product per day.hechinger made a total of wire transfers during the preference period,which ran from march to june.this equates to a wire nearly every days.hechinger usually made wire transfers in the amount of the credit limit,which was million for most of this period the payments reduced the outstanding balance in hechinger ufp account and replenished hechinger million line of credit,so that hechinger could order additional goods from ufp 
at the time that hechinger made each wire transfer,it did not know which shipments were covered by the transfer.hechinger sent remittance advices to ufp after making payments,in order to explain how ufp should match the payments to the invoices that ufp created.according to these remittance advices,some of hechinger payments during the preference period were advance payments,meaning payments made prior to shipment of the goods.hechinger payments during the preference period were usually made up to ten days before shipment,to eight days after shipment,with the greatest concentration of payments occurring on the date of shipment.app.
hechinger filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on june.on june,hechinger filed a complaint against ufp to avoid and recover preferential transfers under and.hechinger originally sought to recover,the full amount of the payments made to ufp during the period prior to hechinger june,filing.before trial,hechinger conceded that of these payments were advance payments and therefore,by definition,not recoverable under as payments for or on account of an antecedent debt.the parties also stipulated that the net preference at issue at trial,potentially subject to ufp c and c defenses,was and that hechinger had established a prima facie case under b that these transfers were avoidable.app.
prior to trial,ufp filed a spoliation motion with the bankruptcy court,asking the court to draw an adverse inference against hechinger because,prior to the filing of its complaint,hechinger destroyed documents that might have helped ufp prove that hechinger intended its preference period payments to be contemporaneous exchanges for new value under c.the court denied the motion,without discussion,in october.
a trial in the bankruptcy court commenced on february,with the main issue being ufp contention that in payments were not avoidable based on c and c of the bankruptcy code.these sections provide that 
c the trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer 
to the extent that such transfer was 
a intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and 
b in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange 
to the extent that such transfer was 
a in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee 
b made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee and 
c made according to ordinary business terms 
accordingly,ufp urged that,although the payments may have been on account of antecedent debts,they were nonetheless not avoidable because they were contemporaneous exchanges for new value under c,and,alternatively,because they were made in the ordinary course of business under c.
the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of hechinger on june,in the amount of.with respect to whether the transfers were intended as contemporaneous exchanges for new value under c,the court stated that the nature of a credit relationship is inconsistent with the intent which is required in order to sustain the c defense.in re hechinger inv.of.it also concluded that the transfers were not made in the ordinary course of business between the parties under c b because the transfers were made under vastly different conditions from those that had previously governed the relationship of the parties.id.at.the court further found that the transfers were not made according to ordinary business terms under c c because the terms varied substantially from those normally employed by ufp with other customers similar to hechinger.id.at.hechinger had requested prejudgment interest to compensate it in full for the value of the payments it recovered,but the bankruptcy court denied this request without any discussion.id.at.
both parties appealed the adverse rulings to the district court.challenging the bankruptcy court rejection of ufp contemporaneous exchange defense under c,ufp argued that the bankruptcy court ruling was grounded in an error of law regarding the nature of the transactions and the intent required under c.the district court disagreed,concluding that the bankruptcy court did not commit legal error in stating that the c defense may not be applied to credit transactions.in re hechinger inv.of.the district court did not read this statement as a legal pronouncement that credit transactions are categorically excluded from c.rather,it understood this passage to signify that the bankruptcy court had found that the parties intended a credit,rather than a cash,relationship.id.the district court then rejected ufp other challenges to the judgment of the bankruptcy court and hechinger challenge to the denial of prejudgment interest,and affirmed the bankruptcy court order.id.at.this appeal followed.
the district court had jurisdiction over the appeal of the bankruptcy court orders pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction to review the district court decision pursuant to d.our review of the district court decision effectively amounts to review of the bankruptcy court opinion in the first instance,in re hechinger inv.of,cir,because our standard of review is the same as that exercised by the district court over the decision of the bankruptcy court,in re schick,cir.

a.the contemporaneous exchange defense 
to prove that the transfers were not avoidable because they fell within the contemporaneous exchange defense under c,ufp had to show that the transfers were i intended by the debtor and the creditor to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and ii in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.in re spada,cir.the critical inquiry in determining whether there has been a contemporaneous exchange for new value is whether the parties intended such an exchange.id.at.
the bankruptcy court found that the disputed transfers were not intended by the parties to be contemporaneous exchanges because the transfers were credit transactions.in reaching this result,the court relied upon several factually distinguishable cases,none of which stand for the proposition that parties can never intend credit transactions to be contemporaneous exchanges under c a we disagree with the bankruptcy court conclusion.indeed,it would appear that c covers little other than credit transactions.the c defense applies only to transfers that the debtor has shown are payments on an antecedent debt under b.see b definition of avoidable transfers.if there is no delay between when the debt arises and payment of the obligation,then the transfer is outside the scope of b,and c is not implicated.the existence of a delay between the creation of a debt and its payment is a hallmark of a credit relationship,which is,by definition,a relationship in which the creditor entrusts the debtor with goods without present payment.oxford english dictionary ed defining credit as t rust or confidence in a buyer ability and intention to pay at some future time,exhibited by entrusting him with goods,without present payment.
we do not think that the district court interpretation of the bankruptcy court,as concluding that the parties intended to have a credit resolves the question.the inquiry still remains even if a credit relationship was intended,was it nonetheless their intent that the ongoing payments would be contemporaneous exchanges for new value a court may find the parties intended a contemporaneous exchange for new value even when the transaction is styled as a credit transaction.see in re payless cashways,aff,cir.the question is one of intent,and although a delay between the incurrence of the debt and its payment can evidence that the exchange was not intended to be contemporaneous,the passage of time does not necessarily negate intent.in in re payless cashways,for example,the debtor generally paid the creditor for specific shipments some time after the goods were shipped,but before or at the time that the shipments arrived at the debtor facility.id.at.the court concluded that the parties intended the transfers to be part of a contemporaneous exchange for new value.the court noted that the debtor and creditor agreed to credit terms that would match up the date of the actual delivery of the goods purchased by the debtor with the date of the debtor obligation to wire payment for the goods to the creditor.id.at.the court also put great weight on the fact that the contracts were destination contracts,meaning that the creditor could have refused to deliver the goods if the debtor had failed to make payment before the delivery arrived.id.at.
similarly,the bankruptcy court in in re ccg,found that a debtor payment,made seven to eleven days after shipment of the goods but prior to receipt of the creditor invoices,was intended by the parties as a contemporaneous exchange for new value under c a.the court did not specify whether the debtor had arranged credit terms with the creditor.see also in re bridge inform,finding that parties intended a contemporaneous exchange for new value when they agreed that debtor would pay creditor within one business day following its receipt of invoice for services provided the previous week in re,finding that parties intended a contemporaneous exchange for new value when creditor refused to deliver goods without debtor assurance of payment.the payments at issue in the present case were,for the most part,made even closer to the date of shipment than the payments in in re payless cashways and in re ccg.the parties stipulated that over half of the payments that hechinger sought to avoid were made within five days of the date of the invoice which was also the date that the orders were shipped.app.the bankruptcy court,however,did not address the evidence that the outstanding debt to which the transfers were applied was in most cases less than six days old.instead,the court categorized the transfers at issue as credit transactions and then found,as a matter of law,that this finding compelled it to conclude that the debtor did not intend the transfers to be part of a contemporaneous exchange for new value.
we conclude that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that the fact that the parties had a credit relationship precluded,as a matter of law,a finding that hechinger intended the transfers to be part of a contemporaneous exchange for new value.we do not opine as to whether there is sufficient evidence in the record for the bankruptcy court to have found that ufp failed to prove that the transfers were intended to be contemporaneous exchanges for new value rather,we conclude only that the bankruptcy court did not make the necessary finding as to what the parties intended.instead,the court decided that hechinger did not intend a contemporaneous exchange based on the erroneous legal conclusion that the existence of a credit relationship between the parties was determinative.whether the parties intended a contemporaneous exchange is a question of fact to be decided in the first instance by the factfinder.in re spada,cir the determination of such intent is a question of fact.we will accordingly remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the bankruptcy court to consider whether hechinger and ufp intended the transfers at issue to be contemporaneous exchanges for new value,with the understanding that transfers made under credit terms are not,as matter of law,categorically excluded from the scope of the c defense to avoidance.
b.the ordinary course of business defense 
to prove that the transfers were not avoidable by hechinger as preferential transfers under c,ufp had the burden to prove that the transfers were a incurred in the ordinary course of both the debtor and the creditor business b made and received in the ordinary course of their respective businesses and c made according to ordinary business terms.in re molded acoustical products,cir quoting c.neither ordinary course of business nor ordinary business terms is defined in the bankruptcy code.in re fyfe,cir.the parties agreed that ufp proved the first element.the trial therefore focused on subsections b and 
starting with subsection b of the defense,ufp argued that all payments made by hechinger within the new credit terms,within eight days of the invoice date presumptively qualified as payments made in the ordinary course of the parties business under c b ufp maintained that in re daedalean,established this presumption of ordinariness.however,the daedalean court did not address the presumptive ordinari
