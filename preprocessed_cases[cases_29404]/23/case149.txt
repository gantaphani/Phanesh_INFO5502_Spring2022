opinion of the court 
the issue presented in this appeal is whether the adverse action notice provisions of the fair credit reporting act fcra apply to the actions of a company that provides mortgage guaranty insurance mi to a mortgage lender at a premium rate that is determined,in part,by information in the mortgage borrower credit report.our decision is informed in part by the recent opinion of the united states supreme court in safeco insurance burr,d.
in,whitney and celeste whitfield the whitfields contracted to build a new home in virginia.they wanted to finance all but of the purchase price of their new home.the whitfields,who had a poor credit history,enlisted a mortgage broker to facilitate the process and he helped them contact the eventual mortgagee,countrywide home mortgage.
countrywide agreed to provide the whitfields with a mortgage which loaned them of the purchase price on condition that the whitfields pay for mortgage insurance.after the mortgage papers were signed,countrywide requested appellee radian guaranty,to provide the mortgage insurance,which radian agreed to do for a monthly charge of countrywide provided the whitfields with a disclosure statement that informed them the cost of the mortgage insurance.radian based the price of the mortgage insurance on the ratio of the mortgage and on whitfield credit score,which countrywide obtained from whitfield consumer credit report.in the mortgage closing packet,countrywide gave the whitfields the credit report upon which it had relied.
in accordance with the mortgage guaranty insurance process,radian prepares and files its rate schedule for mortgage guaranty insurance with the virginia bureau of insurance.after the bureau has approved radian proposed rates,lenders,including mortgagees,are free to access the mi rate schedule and place their orders online by entering the borrower credit score and ratio.if radian accepts the lender application for guaranty insurance,it sends a confirmation letter to the lender.on the other hand,if it rejects the application it sends an adverse action notice to the borrower.three days after countrywide closed the mortgage with the whitfields,it submitted an electronic order to purchase mortgage guaranty insurance from radian.countrywide then passed this cost along to the whitfields,as had been agreed upon at settlement.
the whitfields were required to set up an escrow account to pay the cost of the premiums.countrywide paid the premiums to radian,regardless of whether the whitfields escrow account contained sufficient funds to pay the cost of the premium.there were,however,sufficient funds in the whitfields escrow account in fact the whitfields were due,and did receive,a refund for unearned premiums directly from radian in the amount of.
radian conceded that had whitfield credit score been higher,it would have charged a lower premium for the mortgage insurance,and in turn,the whitfields would have paid a lower premium for mortgage insurance.the whitfields were not provided with an adverse action notice by radian.indeed,it is radian standard policy not to send adverse action notices to borrowers when the lender application for mi is approved.
the whitfields filed suit in january,alleging that radian did not provide them with an adverse action notice as required by the fcra,a.they asked the district court to certify a class,composed of borrowers who paid more than the lowest rate for private mortgage insurance and were not notified of the adverse action.the district court granted radian motion for summary judgment,which had the effect of rendering the whitfields motion for class certification moot.whitfield radian guaranty,d.the whitfields filed a timely notice of appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
this court exercises plenary review of the district court grant of radian motion for summary judgment.further,this court applies the same standard in reviewing a motion for summary judgment as the district court.mbia ins.royal indem,cir.a motion for summary judgment should only be granted if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
relevant statutory provisions 
the fcra requires that if a person who is a permissible user of information from a consumer report also known as a credit report takes any adverse action against an individual,such person shall notify the individual of the adverse action.we set out the relevant provision 
if any person takes any adverse action with respect to any consumer that is based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer report,the person shall 
provide oral,written,or electronic notice of the adverse action to the consumer 
provide to the consumer orally,in writing,or electronically 
a the name,address,and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency that furnished the report to the person and 
b a statement that the consumer reporting agency did not make the decision to take the adverse action and is unable to provide the consumer the specific reasons why the adverse action was taken and 
provide to the consumer an oral,written,or electronic notice of the consumer right 
a to obtain,under section of this title,a free copy of a consumer report on the consumer from the consumer reporting agency referred to in paragraph,which notice shall include an indication of the period under that section for obtaining such a copy and 
b to dispute,under section of this title,with a consumer reporting agency the accuracy or completeness of any information in a consumer report furnished by the agency.
the definition of adverse action in the fcra includes an insurance prong,a credit prong,and a provision.section k a is referred to as the credit prong,k b i is referred to as the insurance prong,and k b iv as the provision.the district court analyzed the transaction under the insurance prong,and we agree that the transaction at issue falls within the insurance prong.
the district court also stated that charging a higher initial rate for insurance would be an adverse action.whitfield,d at.the fcra defines the term adverse action as it applies to an insurance company as follows 
k adverse action.
actions term adverse action 
i a denial or cancellation of,an increase in any charge for,or a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of,any insurance,existing or applied for,in connection with the underwriting of insurance.
the act defines consumer report,so far as relevant here,as 
any written,oral,or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer credit worthiness,credit standing,or credit capacity which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer eligibility for credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal,family,or household purposes.
the district court noted that the transaction at issue in this case was between radian,the mortgage insurer,and countrywide,the lender.it cited approvingly the decision in hinton federal national mortgage ass n,where the court,on facts substantially similar to those here,stated that the lender is the insured,not the borrower,because the contract is between the mortgage insurer and the lender.id.at.the hinton court held that the borrower was an incidental beneficiary who had no cause of action.id.at.the district court in this case granted summary judgment for radian because it found that radian insurance relationship was with countrywide and not the whitfields.
b.the safeco decision 
the safeco decision,encompassed two separate cases,safeco insurance burr and geico general insurance edo,both of which involved challenges to the failure of the insurance company to provide the adverse action notification required under the fcra.in the course of its opinion,the court read the statutory language willfully fails to comply as reaching reckless fcra violations and rejected the insurance
