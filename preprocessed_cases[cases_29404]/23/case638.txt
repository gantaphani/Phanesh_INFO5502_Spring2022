penal code section,subdivision a section a requires that a forfeiture of bail be declared in open court.in this case the trial judge ordered forfeiture,but the record does not affirmatively establish whether this declaration did,or did not,occur in open court.we granted review to address in this setting the propriety of a trial court subsequent order denying the bail surety motion to set aside the forfeiture and to exonerate the bond.
we conclude as follows although the circumstance that a trial court has declared a bail forfeiture is a matter that should be reflected in the court minutes,and although it is better practice for the minutes further to reflect that such a declaration was made orally in open court,as required by section a,contrary to the conclusion reached by the court of appeal below the statute does not require that a reporter transcript,or the minutes,reflect the circumstance that the declaration occurred in open court.moreover,consistent with the presumptions that official duty has been regularly performed and that a court or judge is presumed to have acted in the lawful exercise of its jurisdiction,in the posture in which this case arises but contrary to the determination of the appellate court below,a failure to declare forfeiture in open court will not be presumed on a silent record.because in the present case the party seeking to set aside the forfeiture and exonerate the bond has not established that the trial court failed to declare the forfeiture in open court,we reverse the judgment rendered by the court of appeal.
allegheny mutual casualty company allegheny posted a bond for the release from custody of criminal defendant fernando velente.the court minutes reflect that on march,velente failed to appear as ordered at and the trial judge ordered bail forfeited and issued a bench warrant,but the minutes do not affirmatively reflect that the judge declared the forfeiture in open court.there is no reporter transcript of the march proceedings,apparently because no court reporter was present at the time.subsequently,velente still not having been located,the court issued summary judgment against the bond,pursuant to section.
nearly two years after the summary judgment had become final,allegheny moved to set it aside,arguing that section a requires bail forfeitures to be declared in open court and that,absent a reporter transcript demonstrating that this occurred,the trial court was without jurisdiction over the bond,and therefore the bond was exonerated as a matter of law.the trial court denied the motion in april,concluding that the statute imposes a requirement,but does not impose a requirement that a reporter transcript or the minutes reflect that the declaration was made orally in open court in the absence of a record making clear that the declaration occurred in open court,the presumption is that this is what occurred the absence of a reporter transcript of the proceedings does not undermine an otherwise proper declaration of forfeiture made in open court and in light of a minute order disclosing that the trial court ordered bail forfeited and issued a bench warrant even though this order did not recite that the declaration itself occurred in open court,the forfeiture of bail should stand.
the court of appeal reversed,reasoning that the requirement calls for an express statement of forfeiture by the judge in open court and also that a reporter,apparently,at least the reflect that the declaration was made orally in open court.the appellate court further concluded that because in this case there is no reporter transcript of the relevant proceedings,and the minutes do not affirmatively reflect that the trial judge declared the forfeiture in open court,the bail forfeiture must be vacated and the bond exonerated.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment rendered by the court of appeal.
section a provides in relevant part a court shall in open court declare forfeited the undertaking of bail or the money or property deposited as bail if,without sufficient excuse,a defendant fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance.italics added.allegheny,consistent with the conclusion reached by the court of appeal below,asserts that this statute imposes the dual requirement that a judge declare forfeiture of bail in open court,and a reporter transcript reflect that this declaration was made in open court.the people assert the statute imposes only a requirement.
as explained below,we conclude that a declaration of bail forfeiture must be made in open court,and of course the record also should reflect,in the minutes,the circumstance that forfeiture was ordered.see,minutes reflecting any order,judgment or decree of the court are to be prepared forthwith see generally witkin,cal.procedure ed.courts,at.although it is better practice for the minutes to reflect further that the declaration of forfeiture was made in open court,section a does not require the record to reflect that this occurred in open court.
a s with any statute,we strive to ascertain and effectuate the legislature intent.citations.because statutory language generally provide s the most reliable indicator of that intent citations,we turn to the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meanings and construing them in context citation.citation.if the language contains no ambiguity,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.if,however,the statutory language is susceptible of more than one reasonable construction,we can look to legislative history in aid of ascertaining legislative intent.citation.people robles cal th,d.
the term open court typically is understood to refer to nothing more or less than a hearing or trial held in a courtroom from which the public is not excluded.see generally nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,people valenzuela d.by this common understanding of the term,the statute requirement that the judge in open court declare forfeited the undertaking of bail is fully satisfied by such a statement made orally by the judge in the courtroom,while it is open to members of the public.
as noted,allegheny insists we should read the statute as imposing an additional requirement that a reporter transcript or,apparently,at least the court minutes reflect that the declaration was made in open court.the statutory language chosen by the legislature,however,does not support this construction.matters or events may occur in open court and yet not be reflected in a reporter transcript even assuming a court reporter is present or in the events that occur in open court simply are not recorded by a reporter or memorialized by a court clerk.likewise,matters may be reflected in a reporter transcript or in the minutes without transpiring in open,for example,proceedings take place in a session properly closed to the public or held in chambers.we believe that had the legislature intended to impose,in addition to the requirement,a further condition that the record that is,the minutes and,if available,a reporter transcript reflect the circumstance that the declaration occurred in open court,that body would have employed words to such effect,instead of the words set forth in the statute.
allegheny insists,nevertheless,that section a is ambiguous,and that the history of the provision supports the conclusion that the legislature intended to require that a bail forfeiture declaration,made by a judge in open court,also be reflected in a reporter transcript or at least in the minutes.we doubt that the statute is ambiguous but in any event,as explained below,find that the legislative history supports the conclusion we reach and not that urged by allegheny.
the requirement that forfeiture be declared in open court did not exist in the statute until it was revised in.stats,ch.events leading to that change shed light on the evident purpose underlying the amendment.
in people ranger ins.th,d ranger,a surety sought to discharge a bail forfeiture on the ground that its agents had been present in the courtroom and observed that the criminal defendant for whom they had provided bail had failed to appear,but the agents also observed that the judge failed to declare forfeiture in open court,at,d.the surety argued that the then existing version of section a stats,ch,required a trial court to declare forfeiture of bail in open court.the appellate court in ranger disagreed,finding no such requirement in the version of the statute and concluding instead that simple notation of the forfeiture in the minutes was sufficient,at,d.
section a was amended in stats,ch,but that change did not add the requirement rejected in ranger,supra,th,d.subsequently in people topa ins.th,d topa,the court of appeal,reviewing proceedings conducted under the statute as amended in,considered an assertion by a surety that a court was required to declare forfeiture of a bond on the record.the court in topa rejected that contention,reasoning nothing in the amendments remotely suggests the legislature rewording of the statute was intended in fact the trial court to state on the record that bail has been forfeited.the legislature certainly knows how to require statements by the court.and nothing in the current language of the statute suggests an pronouncement of forfeiture is necessary.topa,supra,th at,d,italics added,citation omitted.
in early,assembly bill reg.sess,which led to the amendment at issue in the present case,was introduced.the bill did not propose to add a requirement,such as was at issue in the decision in topa,supra,th,d,that the is,a reporter transcript or the the court statement of forfeiture.instead,the bill addressed the issue that had been before the appellate court in in ranger,supra,th,d it proposed simply to add the words in open court to the then current statute,so that it would read,as it does now a court shall in open court declare forfeited the undertaking of bail 
committee reports concerning assembly bill were prepared by the senate committee on public safety and by the assembly committee on public safety.both reports noted that,according to the bill author,under existing law and practice,o ften the bond is not declared forfeited in open court rather it is declared forfeited days or weeks later by a clerk of the court.by delaying the declaration,the defendant has an opportunity to flee and avoid apprehension.com.on pub.safety,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.june,senate committee analysis assembly com.on pub.safety,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.may,assembly committee analysis.the senate committee analysis described the overall purpose of the bill as intended to make the return of fleeing defendants swifter and easier,observing that t he longer a defendant remains at large,the greater the odds that he or she may commit other crimes,thereby putting the public at risk.com.analysis,supra,at.the assembly committee analysis explained if a defendant fails to appear at a scheduled court appearance,existing law requires that the court order the bail forfeited and the bail agent or surety notified within days.this bill requires that the declaration of forfeiture be made in open court at the time the defendant fails to appear and a bench warrant is issued.this is a minor technical change to existing law and only requires the court to openly order forfeiture of the rationale being that the bail agent assuming he or she is present in the courtroom receives notice of the forfeiture at the time,rather than when the notice is sent and is able to immediately pursue the fugitive.assem.com.analysis,supra,at.
the two committee reports addressed opposition to the bill requirement.the senate committee analysis quoted the following objection made by the trial courts legislation committee an association of county clerks and administrators c onsiderable time and effort on the part of bench officers and court staff would be required to perform the proposed declaration of forfeiture in open court.many courts direct the clerk to take roll call of the calendar prior to the judicial officer taking the bench.the bench officer enters forfeiture orders based upon the clerk information on those failing to appear.forcing courts to abandon this timesaving measure would be wasteful and inefficient.com.analysis,supra,at.the two committee reports also observed that the judicial council opposed the bill on the related grounds that bail agents promptly were notified under the existing system,and that requiring each bail forfeiture to be declared in open court would significantly and unnecessarily burden the system,at assem.com.analysis,supra,at.the assembly committee analysis rejected those criticisms,reasoning despite the judicial council objection,the requirement places an insignificant burden on the court as it only requires the court to state in open court,bail is forfeited.it is a better practice to openly declare the forfeiture most courts already follow this procedure assem.com.analysis,supra,at.
finally,reviewers of assembly bill criticized the assumption,implicit in the author comments in support of the legislation,that a requirement generally would allow bail agents to receive notice at the time an oral declaration is made instead of having to wait to review that day minutes or receive notice by mail from the court clerk.a may,assembly republican bill analysis commented the author believes that requiring a court to announce in open court that bail is forfeited will allow them instant notification,thus allowing them to immediately begin the hunt for their client.this argument is true only if the bail agent is actually sitting in the courtroom.in this counsel tenure as a prosecutor,it was rare that bail agents attended court proceedings.assem.republican bill analysis of assem.bill at,capitalization in original.
despite the foregoing objections,assembly bill reg.sess.was passed by both houses without amendment,enrolled,and approved by the governor.
the legislative history does not support allegheny assertion that by adding the requirement,the legislature also intended to impose a requirement that a reporter transcript,or at least the minutes,reflect that the declaration was made in open court.indeed,this history suggests the opposite.it demonstrates that the legislature wished to provide actual and immediate notice of bail forfeiture for the benefit of any surety or bail agent in attendance at the public court session,so that prompt efforts might be undertaken to locate the absent defendant.although,as noted above,the assembly republican bill analysis in a report to caucus members cautioned that as a practical matter bail agents often are not present in court and hence will not hear the judge declaration of forfeiture,such was the case in ranger,supra,th,d are present in the courtroom when bail is forfeited.indeed assembly bill,as promoted by its author,was premised upon the assumption that in at least some cases bail agents would be present in the courtroom.in the face of these variable circumstances,the legislature proceeded with the bill as originally written,without specifying a requirement that a reporter transcript,or the minutes,further reflect that the declaration was made in open court.in so acting the legislature doubtless was aware that minutes reflecting any court order or decree must be prepared forthwith,and hence that body presumably understood that a judge declaration of forfeiture uttered in open court would trigger a prompt minute order reflecting,at a minimum,the circumstance that bail was forfeited in the particular case,and such a minute order would be available at the end of the day,or at least by the next,to so inform all interested parties indeed,as the people observe,in view of the legislature apparent objective of enhancing the provision of prompt notice to sureties,an additional condition that a reporter transcript be prepared to further reflect that the order or decree was made in open court would have been might be counterproductive.
as mentioned above,the assembly committee analysis of the bill indicated that the requirement was just nothing more.the amendment was described as a minor technical change to existing law that only requires the court to openly order forfeiture of the bail by stat ing bail is forfeited.assem.com.analysis,supra,at,italics added
