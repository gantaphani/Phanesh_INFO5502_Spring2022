this appeal involves the application of the hanging paragraph in chapter of the bankruptcy code.see a.that paragraph prevents the bifurcation or of a secured claim when the creditor has a purchase money security interest in a motor vehicle acquired for the debtor personal use within days of the debtor bankruptcy filing.id.in this case,we must decide how the hanging paragraph applies to a secured claim when a portion of that claim relates to the financing of negative equity which,in a car transaction,refers to the difference between the value of a vehicle that the buyer trades in and the amount of the buyer preexisting debt on that.
applying the most natural interpretation of the statute,and in turn state law,we conclude that a creditor does have a purchase money security interest for the portion of its claim relating to negative equity.we reach that conclusion because negative equity financing is integral to the debtor acquisition of a new car and because this result effectuates congress intent in the hanging paragraph.the judgment of the district court is therefore reversed.because we hold that the debt in this case was secured by a purchase money security interest,we do not address the proper treatment of a debt that includes money components.
in july,telephius and shawana price bought a lincoln ls from capital mazda in cary,north carolina.the prices purchased the lincoln on secured credit pursuant to a retail installment sales contract the contract.capital mazda subsequently assigned the contract to wells fargo financial acceptance.
the contract stated that the purchase price of the lincoln was.the prices put down in cash.they also traded in their nissan maxima,which earned them a allowance of.the prices had purchased the nissan on credit,and they still owed on the nissan to their previous lender.the contract for the lincoln therefore included financing for in negative equity,or the difference between the amount the prices received for the nissan and the amount they still owed.the contract also included in fees and taxes and for gap insurance,which would cover the difference between the amount the prices owed on the contract and the amount they would receive from an insurer if the lincoln were totaled.the total amount financed in the the purchase price,the negative equity,fees and taxes,and the gap insurance,minus the down.this debt was secured by the lincoln.
almost one year later,in june,the prices filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.wells fargo presented a proof of claim showing that the prices owed,reflecting accrued interest,under the contract at the time the prices chapter plan proposed to invoke a to bifurcate wells fargo claim into two parts a secured claim for the present value of the lincoln,and an unsecured claim for the remainder.wells fargo objected to confirmation of the prices plan,arguing that the bankruptcy code hanging paragraph protected its claim from bifurcation because that claim was secured by a purchase money security interest.see a.
the bankruptcy court noted that many courts have struggled to discern the meaning of portions of the hanging paragraph.in re price,citing in re trejos.courts interpreting the hanging paragraph generally have disagreed on two points relating to motor vehicle transactions.first,courts have disagreed as to whether a purchase money security interest exists in the portion of a car loan relating to negative equity on a vehicle or to gap insurance.and second,even when courts have agreed that a purchase money security interest does not exist for these portions of the car loan,they have disagreed as to whether a purchase money security interest can still exist in the rest of the loan,or whether the hanging paragraph instead requires treating the entire debt as money.see in re graupner,cir collecting cases.
the bankruptcy court in this case determined that the meaning of purchase money security interest in the hanging paragraph depended on state law.at.the court then concluded that,under north carolina law,the negative equity and gap insurance components of the contract between the prices and wells fargo did not give rise to a purchase money security interest.id.at.the bankruptcy court next applied what is known as the transformation rule,under which the money portion of the debt converts the entire lien into a money security interest.id.at.
on appeal,the district court agreed that,under north carolina law,negative equity and gap insurance can not give rise to a purchase money security interest.wells fargo fin,price,wl,at.but the district court then applied the dual status rule and held that wells fargo did have a purchase money security interest for the part of its claim that did not relate to negative equity and gap insurance.id.at.the district court therefore remanded the case to the bankruptcy court to determine the actual amount of wells fargo secured claim.id.at.
wells fargo now appeals the district court conclusion that the negative equity and gap insurance components of the debt did not give rise to a purchase money security interest.the prices the district court application of the dual status rule,arguing that the court should have applied the transformation rule instead.because both of these appeals present only questions of law,we review the district court decision de novo.in re bryson,xviii,cir.
in chapter bankruptcy proceedings,the debtor has the option of retaining his property over the objection of a secured creditor with an interest in that property,as the prices did here.see a b.in return,the secured creditor retains its lien on the collateral,and the debtor must repay the present value of the creditor allowed secured claim over time.id.a assocs.commercial rash,d.section a of the bankruptcy code generally provides that the value of the allowed secured claim is equal to the value of the collateral.see a rash,at.thus,if the secured creditor claim is for more than the collateral value,section a requires the bifurcation of the claim into two components a secured claim for the value of the collateral,and an unsecured claim for the balance.tidewater fin.kenney,cir.bifurcation of the secured creditor claim is sometimes characterized as stripping down the secured claim to the collateral value.drive fin,jordan,cir.
in,congress amended chapter of the bankruptcy code by adding the hanging paragraph so called because the paragraph is unnumbered to section a.see bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,stat,bapcpa.the effect of the hanging paragraph is to prevent the bifurcation of certain secured claims when confirming a debtor plan under section a.see,in re dean,cir.the text of the hanging paragraph provides 
for purposes of paragraph,section shall not apply to a claim described in that paragraph if the creditor has a purchase money security interest securing the debt that is the subject of the claim,the debt was incurred within the period preceding the date of the filing of the petition,and the collateral for that debt consists of a motor vehicle as defined in section of title acquired for the personal use of the debtor,or if collateral for that debt consists of any other thing of value,if the debt was incurred during the period preceding that filing.
the parties here do not dispute that the prices entire debt to wells fargo was incurred within days of their bankruptcy filing and that the collateral for the entire debt the lincoln was a motor vehicle acquired for the prices personal use.the only issue in this case,therefore,is whether the prices debt was secured by a purchase money security interest.a.in particular,the parties dispute whether the portion of the debt relating to the negative equity in the prices gave rise to a purchase money security interest.
the hanging paragraph does not define the term purchase money security interest.indeed,that term is defined nowhere in the bankruptcy code.wells fargo nonetheless argues that we can construct a federal definition of purchase money security interest for purposes of the hanging paragraph.we disagree.
instead,we look to another source containing a definition of purchase money security interest state law.north carolina and the vast majority of states have adopted article of the uniform commercial code,in re air,cir,which expressly defines the term security interest,b.we apply this definition because,when determining the substance of property rights and security interests in bankruptcy,the basic federal rule is that state law governs.butner united states,d see id.at.see also travelers cas.sur.of am.pac.gas,d.indeed,we recently reiterated that state law creates and defines security interests at issue in bankruptcy proceedings if no federal law requires a different result.tidewater,at.because congress did not provide its own definition of purchase money security interest,no federal law prevents our use of north carolina definition of that term here.
moreover,historical practice strongly suggests that congress meant for state law to control the meaning of purchase money security interest in the hanging paragraph.prior to the enactment of the hanging paragraph in,courts had uniformly looked to state law to define purchase money security interest as it appears in section f of the bankruptcy code.in re billings,cir.congress,presumably aware that its prior use of this term of art had led courts to resort to state law once again used this term of art without providing a federal definition or any interpretive guidance.peaslee gmac,llc,cir.thus,we agree with the great majority of other courts state law controls the meaning of purchase money security interest in the hanging paragraph.see,id.at in re graupner,cir.
we therefore turn to north carolina law.in north carolina,a security interest in goods is defined as a security interest in goods that are collateral,and collateral is in turn defined as goods that secure a obligation.a b so the important question for our purposes is the definition of a obligation.to constitute a obligation,a piece of debt must be incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used.id.a.
wells fargo argues that the portion of the debt at issue here the financing of the negative equity in the prices had the necessary close relationship with the collateral the new vehicle to constitute a obligation.in particular,wells fargo claims that the prices incurred the portion of the debt relating to negative equity for value given to enable the prices to acquire rights in or the use of the new car,and that the value was in fact so used.id.applying the same provision of the ucc,the eleventh circuit reached the same conclusion that wells fargo proposes here.see in re graupner,cir.
we think the eleventh circuit view persuasive.under a natural reading of state law,the negative equity financing here created a obligation because that financing enabled the prices to acquire rights in their new car.when a word is not defined by statute,we normally construe it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning.smith united states,d.enable,which is not defined in the ucc,ordinarily means t o supply with the means,knowledge,or chance to be or do something,or t o make possible.webster ii new college dictionary ed see also black law dictionary ed.to give power to do something to make able.under any of these definitions,the value given by capital mazda to pay off the prices negative equity enabled the prices to acquire the new vehicle.that is because the negative equity financing was integral to the whole transaction in which the new vehicle was purchased.all of the prices debt to wells fargo was incurred at the same time,in the same contract,and for the same purpose acquiring the new car.in other words,the negative equity financing enabled the purchase of the new car because the negative equity financing and the purchase were a package deal.graupner,at.
for that reason,it would make little sense to attempt artificial distinctions between portions of a single transaction that enabled the acquisition of rights in the vehicle and portions that supposedly did not.to be sure,some bankruptcy courts have done just that,contending that there is a distinction between enabling a transaction to occur and enabling a debtor to acquire rights in new collateral,and that negative equity financing does only the former.in re sanders,rev,wl.from a practical perspective,that distinction is meaningless.if negative equity financing enabled the transaction in which the new car was acquired,then,in reality,the negative equity financing also enabled the acquisition of rights in the new car.and that was the case here.the itself was essential to the transaction because trading in the old car allowed the prices to obtain value to put toward the new car.but the prices could not have traded in their old car unless they also extinguished their negative equity car dealers are generally unwilling to accept a with an outstanding lien because the lien makes it difficult for the dealer to resell the car.see brief for appellant at gmac horne,t he discharge of the buyer remaining obligation on the vehicle was part and parcel of the buyer ability to use the vehicle to buy the new vehicle.the negative equity financing therefore enabled the completion of the whole transaction and,as a result,the prices acquisition of rights in the new car.
in place of this natural interpretation of state law,the prices propose a formalistic reading of the definition of obligation that would exclude negative equity financing.they argue,based on previously enacted versions of article of the ucc,that price and value given to enable have the same scope in the definition of obligation.see brief for appellees at.they further contend that the negative equity in this case was not part of the price of the new car,and that to conclude otherwise would def y not only our common understanding of the word,but common sense,as well.brief for appellees at.thus,the prices argue,the negative equity funds also were not value given to enable,and the negative equity financing did not constitute a obligation.
these arguments lack merit.regardless of whether price and value given to enable have the same scope,the official comments to section of the ucc do not allow us to rely on the debtors common understanding of the term price.we treat the ucc official comments as instructive.see buettner martin sons,cir.and official comment is particularly instructive here because it provides that both price and value given to enable include numerous expenses that might not come within a common understanding of the term price,namely obligations for expenses incurred in connection with acquiring rights in the collateral,sales taxes,duties,finance charges,interest,freight charges,costs of storage in transit,demurrage,administrative charges,expenses of collection and enforcement,attorney fees,and other similar obligations.as this extensive list of expenses makes clear,neither price nor value given to enable have the strictly cabined meaning in the ucc that appellees suggest.
indeed,when read correctly,official comment supports the determination that negative equity financing of an automobile purchase gives rise to a purchase money security interest.although the comment does not mention negative equity explicitly,it would be a stretch to conclude that the negative equity financing here,which was executed at the same time and in the same contract as the car purchase,was not an expense incurred in connection with acquiring rights in the collateral,official comment.and the context provided by the other expenses included in the comment fortifies that conclusion.gustafson alloyd,d a word is known by the company it keeps the doctrine of noscitur a sociis.like negative equity,the listed as taxes,duties,and best described as transaction costs associated with buying the new car.graupner,at.the prices argue that,unlike negative equity,e very item in the list includes an expense,tax,charge,or fee directly related to the cost of the collateral itself.brief for appellees at.but that argument fails because some of the and storage costs,for nothing to do with the value of the new car.in reality,the pertinent feature shared by all of the listed expens
