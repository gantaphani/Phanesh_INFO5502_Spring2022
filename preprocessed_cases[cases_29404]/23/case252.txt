the significance of this bankruptcy case relates to the nunc pro tunc substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a corporation in bankruptcy and its sole shareholder,not in bankruptcy until afterwards.because the bankruptcy court nunc pro tunc order was an abuse of discretion under the facts of this case,we vacate the district court order and remand.
rehmat peerbhai,an entrepreneur in the automobile industry,owned and managed aig,a holding company in the automobile insurance business,prior to on april,peerbhai incorporated a new company,aia,which sells automobile insurance.a relationship was formed between aig,as parent,and aia,as subsidiary,with peerbhai acting as the sole owner of both companies.aig,aia,and peerbhai are all debtors in bankruptcy proceedings that are at issue in this appeal.
in september,peerbhai,in his individual capacity,and aig approached wells fargo for financing,and wells fargo agreed to enter into loan transactions with both.however,wells fargo required peerbhai,aig,and aia to be independently audited by pricewaterhousecoopers and belew averitt llp before granting the loans.after reviewing the financial statements and audit reports,wells fargo agreed to lend money to peerbhai as an individual,and to aig.wells fargo extended a loan in the amount of million to peerbhai and aig as,and another loan in the amount of million to aig.wells fargo required peerbhai personally to guarantee aig corporate obligations,and peerbhai executed a continuing guaranty on september.
in december,aig breached a material loan covenant with wells fargo.on january,wells fargo filed,in state court,an original petition and restraining order against aig based on this breach.aia and aig both filed petitions for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code on february.on february,wells fargo filed a motion to lift stay to pursue state court litigation in the aig bankruptcy case.the bankruptcy court entered an agreed order partially lifting the automatic stay on march,expressly permitting wells fargo to pursue state court remedies against peerbhai individually.wells fargo began collection activities against peerbhai,and thereafter peerbhai requested that wells fargo forbear from exercising its legal and contractual rights and remedies until april.wells fargo and peerbhai reached an agreement and executed a limited forbearance agreement dated april,and they filed an agreed judgment settling the state court litigation.the state court entered the agreed state court judgment on april,giving wells fargo a consensual lien on peerbhai homestead,as well as a judgment against peerbhai pursuant to the terms of peerbhai continuing guaranty.the total amount of the agreed state court judgment against peerbhai was.
on july,the trustee for aia,ronald sommers,filed an application for substantive consolidation application,seeking to consolidate aia and peerbhai as a single debtor in bankruptcy.at the time of the application,peerbhai was not in bankruptcy,and the application sought essentially to put him into bankruptcy and relate his filing date back to aia february,filing date under the theories of single economic unit and single business enterprise.wells fargo objected to the application.on december,peerbhai filed a chapter bankruptcy petition,which he later converted into a chapter petition.
the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas held evidentiary hearings on the application on may and may.sommers argued that peerbhai and aia were not separate legal entities,and that the finances of aia and aig were commingled by peerbhai so that substantively consolidating all of peerbhai personal assets with the assets of aia and aig was the only way to ensure equitable distribution of the assets to the creditors of aia and aig.
on september,the bankruptcy court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.it determined that peerbhai engaged in a pattern of activity that was aimed at concealing aia proceeds from its creditors and from peerbhai personal creditors,that peerbhai made no meaningful distinction between his funds and those of aia while aia was a going concern,that substantial identity between peerbhai and aia existed and aia creditors dealt with peerbhai and aia as a single economic unit and did not rely on their separate identities in extending credit,that peerbhai and aia did not observe the corporate formalities required by texas law,and that peerbhai treated aia as an alter ego of himself,using the aia corporate status to commit fraud against his and aia creditors.based on these findings,the bankruptcy court concluded that substantive consolidation was appropriate for several reasons first,substantive consolidation would benefit all creditors,and not unfairly prejudice any creditor,because the financial affairs of aia and peerbhai were so entangled that the assets of each could not be segregated second,substantive consolidation would avoid the harm of aia creditors receiving virtually nothing in a bankruptcy that was caused primarily by peerbhai looting aia third,wells fargo would not be unfairly harmed by substantive consolidation because of wells fargo knowledge and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the limited forbearance agreement,and further that any prejudice wells fargo may suffer from substantive consolidation is not unfair,and is substantially outweighed by the benefits to other creditors fourth,the fact that aia and peerbhai were essentially a single financial entity could not have been ignored by wells fargo or any other reasonably diligent party extending credit to peerbhai and fifth,substantive consolidation should be effective nunc pro tunc to the petition date of february,because at all relevant times,peerbhai and aia operated as one financial entity.
wells fargo appealed to the district court the bankruptcy court november,order granting substantive consolidation.in that appeal,wells fargo argued for the first time that the supreme court of the united states effectively abrogated the doctrine of substantive consolidation in grupo mexicano de desarrollo,alliance bond fund,which held that a preliminary injunction,issued prior to any judgment essentially to prevent fraudulent transfer of assets,was an improper use of equity powers,d t he equitable powers conferred by the judiciary act of did not include the power to create remedies previously unknown to equity jurisprudence.even when sitting as a court in equity,we have no authority to craft a nuclear weapon of the law like the one advocated here.the district court,however,determined that substantive consolidation remains an available remedy despite the grupo mexicano holding,reading grupo mexicano narrowly and noting that grupo mexicano did not discuss the remedy of substantive consolidation.
wells fargo further argued that even if substantive consolidation is an available remedy,the bankruptcy court should not have applied it retrospectively to revoke wells fargo interests in peerbhai assets.the district court noted that before a court may exercise its nunc pro tunc powers,that court must make an inquiry to determine whether retroactivity is necessary to achieve some benefit or avoid harm.the district court determined that the bankruptcy court took the proper factors into consideration in determining whether to apply substantive consolidation retroactively,and thus its decision was appropriate.
wells fargo made a third argument to the effect that the bankruptcy court alter ego conclusion was improper under texas law,which requires proof of actual fraud.wells fargo contended that the bankruptcy court did not show that peerbhai had the actual intent necessary to prove actual fraud.the district court held that based on the bankruptcy court findings,the actions of peerbhai prove that his intent to defraud was calculated,not accidental,and thus the bankruptcy court decision regarding alter ego was not erroneous.
wells fargo timely appeals the district court final judgment.
wells fargo argues that the bankruptcy court did not have the power to order substantive consolidation and,in the alternative,that if the bankruptcy court had such pow
