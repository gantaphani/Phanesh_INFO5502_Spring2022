opinion of the court 
judith cunningham,frederick deimler iii,and carol vanover collectively,plaintiffs claim to represent a nationwide class of homeowners who were victims of a captive reinsurance scheme perpetrated by m t bank corporation,m t bank,and m t mortgage reinsurance company collectively,m t.plaintiffs filed this lawsuit several years after the applicable statute of limitations had expired.after allowing discovery related to the timeliness of plaintiffs claims,the district court granted summary judgment for m t.as the court explained,plaintiffs claims were untimely and not subject to equitable tolling.because we agree that equitable tolling does not apply to these claims,we affirm.
plaintiffs obtained residential mortgage loans from m t bank to finance the purchase of their homes.when a borrower seeks a mortgage loan that exceeds of the value of the residence,he or she must ordinarily agree to pay for insurance to protect the lender from the risk of default.private mortgage insurance thus permits lenders such as m t bank to extend credit at lower interest rates and to borrowers who might otherwise not be able to get a mortgage loan.each plaintiff fell into this category and had to buy insurance as a condition of his or her mortgage.each paid premiums to a private mortgage insurer and,in case of default,m t bank would be the beneficiary of the insurance agreement.as is customary in the industry,m t bank selected the insurers with whom the plaintiffs would contract.
companies offering private mortgage insurance will often contract with others for reinsurance of the risk they hold.under a reinsurance agreement,the reinsurance company assumes a portion of the risk associated with default in exchange for a percentage of the mortgage insurance premiums paid by the borrower.reinsurance thus allows the insurer to manage its own risk and offer greater amounts of insurance at lower premiums.many mortgage lenders operate their own captive companies that reinsure mortgages the lenders originated.in this case,m t bank referred plaintiffs to private mortgage insurers who,in turn,reinsured the insurance policy with m t mortgage reinsurance company m t bank captive reinsurer.
beginning in late,counsel sent letters to plaintiffs advising that they were investigating claims concerning m t bank captive mortgage reinsurance.plaintiffs agreed to be part of a lawsuit against m t and filed a putative class action complaint alleging violations of the real estate settlement procedures act respa,and unjust enrichment 
in the complaint,plaintiffs claimed to represent a nationwide class of persons who obtained residential mortgage loans from m t bank that were reinsured by m t mortgage reinsurance company.they alleged that m t bank and its reinsurer colluded with private mortgage insurers,referring customers to the private mortgage insurers and receiving in return reinsurance agreements that required m t mortgage reinsurance to take on little or no actual risk.this scheme allegedly violated respa and provisions.see a b.
m t moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that respa statute of limitations barred the claims of plaintiffs and they were not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period.the district court denied the motion,declining to resolve the issue of equitable tolling until the parties could take discovery limited to that issue.cunningham m t bank,cv,wl,at,see also in re cmty.bank of virginia,cir community bank i noting that the issue of equitable tolling is not generally amenable to resolution on a rule b motion.
after discovery,m t moved for summary judgment and the court granted the motion.with the benefit of a more detailed factual record,it held that the claims were indeed time barred and that plaintiffs could not equitably toll the limitations period.cunningham m t bank,cv,wl,at.this was so because none of them had exercised reasonable diligence in investigating any potential claims under respa.plaintiffs appeal that decision

plaintiffs claims under respa have a statute of limitations.it runs from the date of the occurrence of the violation,which begins at the closing of the loan,community bank i,at.cunningham,deimler,and vanover closed on their home mortgage loans in may,june,and october,respectively.they filed suit in june,several years after the statute of limitations had expired.
plaintiffs nonetheless argue that their respa claims are not time barred because they have satisfied the requirements to equitably toll the statute of limitations.equitable tolling can rescue a claim otherwise barred as untimely by a statute of limitations when a plaintiff has been prevented from filing in a timely manner due to sufficiently inequitable circumstances.santos ex rel.beato united states,cir.we have previously held that the statute of limitations in respa is not jurisdictional and is thus eligible for consideration.in re cmty.bank of virginia mortgage lending practices,cir community bank ii.but e quitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.hedges united states,cir see also wallace kato,d equitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances,not a for an entirely common state of affairs.
plaintiffs basis for tolling,also known as fraudulent concealment,requires them to show three elements that the defendant actively misled the plaintiff which prevented the plaintiff from recognizing the validity of her claim within the limitations period and where the plaintiff ignorance is not attributable to her lack of reasonable due diligence in attempting to uncover the relevant facts.cetel kirwan fin,cir.to demonstrate reasonable diligence which means here,as noted below,to investigate possible claims,a plaintiff must establish that he pursued the cause of his injury with those qualities of attention,knowledge,intelligence and judgment which society requires of its members for the protection of their own interests and the interests of others.mest cabot,cir quoting cochran gaf.
plaintiffs argue that m t bank actively misled them regarding the nature and existence of their claims.but before plaintiffs closed on their respective loans as mortgagors,each person received a disclosure form separate from the mortgage explaining reinsurance in plain language,stating that reinsurance could be with a company affiliated with the lender,that the reinsurance company would receive a percentage of the mortgage,and that the mortgagor had the opportunity to opt out of captive reinsurance.it read 
your lender or a subsequent holder of your loan the lender may,directly or through an affiliated company a reinsurance company,enter into a reinsurance agreement with the primary insurance company that will be providing the mortgage insurance covering your loan.
under a reinsurance agreement,the reinsurance company may assume a portion of the risk associated with such mortgage insurance.in exchange for its assumption of such risk,the reinsurance company receives a percentage of the mortgage insurance premium paid to obtain the mortgage insurance covering your loan.the reinsurance agreement does not increase the amount you have to pay for mortgage insurance or the length of time you must maintain the insurance.
