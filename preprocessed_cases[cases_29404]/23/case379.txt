district court disposition 
initially,the district court recognized that the fdcpa should be construed broadly to protect the unsophisticated consumer.at quoting corporate receivables,cir.nevertheless,the court determined that,in this case,mcmillan wrote a check to a which was returned for insufficient funds and did not cure the bounced check.id.the court therefore held that s tating that the believed her to be honest when credit was extended was not intended to disgrace mcmillan and is not an unfair statement.id.original alterations omitted.

discussion 
we review a district court grant of a dismissal under rule b de novo,accepting as true all factual allegations and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.dawson motors,cir.the plaintiff claims should survive dismissal if relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.id.
when assessing an fdcpa claim,we view the claim through the eyes of an unsophisticated debtor.gammon gc servs,cir stating that such a standard protects the consumer who is uninformed,naive,or trusting,yet it admits an objective element of reasonableness.in the context of a claim,we have stated that h ow a particular notice affects its audience is a question of fact,which may be explored by testimony and devices such as consumer surveys.walker recovery,cir however,as a matter of law,we shall not entertain a plaintiff bizarre,peculiar,or idiosyncratic interpretation of a collection letter.see durkin equifax check,cir pettit retrieval masters creditors bureau,cir.
we believe that our court treatment of claims brought under will be helpful in our analysis of claims brought under and.in several cases,we have focused on the requirements of a claim under,which sets forth mandatory information that a debt collector must provide in a written form to a debtor.if the required information is not communicated to the debtor,or if it is provided in a manner that is confusing to the consumer,has been violated a letter will not be considered to be a violation of,however,unless a significant fraction of the population would be mislead by the letter.durkin,at.we have held that,when a complaint alleges that a dunning letter is confusing,and thus a violation of,the plaintiff has stated a recognizable legal claim no more is necessary to survive a rule b motion.see,at a fdcpa complaint survives a motion to dismiss under rule b simply by alleging that a dunning letter was confusing.walker,at johnson,at.because confusion is a question,dismissal is typically not available under b,which is appropriate only when there is no set of facts consistent with the pleadings under which the plaintiff could obtain relief.see johnson,at.
we have cautioned that a district court must tread carefully before holding that a letter is not confusing as a matter of law when ruling on a rule b motion because district judges are not good proxies for the unsophisticated consumer whose interest the statute protects.walker,at stating that,even if the lawyers and judge involved thought a letter was not confusing,it would be possible to imagine facts that still would support a conclusion that the letter was confusing,such as survey results suggesting that four out of five high school dropouts found it to be confusing.w hat seems pellucid to a judge,a legally sophisticated reader,may be opaque to the unsophisticated consumer.johnson,at.
we can not accept the district court view that claims brought under or are different from claims brought under for purposes of rule b analysis.whether or not a letter is false,deceptive,or misleading in violation of or unfair or unconscionable in violation of are inquiries similar to whether a letter is confusing in violation of.after all,as our cases reflect,the inquiry under,and is basically the same it requires a determination of how an unsophisticated consumer would perceive the letter.see fields wilber law firm,cir applying the unsophisticated consumer standard to claims brought under and turner,cir same jang miller,cir applying the unsophisticated consumer standard to claim gammon,at same.indeed,neither,johnson,nor walker stated that their analysis was limited to only the context.
cpi contends there are no facts imaginable that would support mcmillan claim however,mcmillan submits that she should be allowed to conduct a consumer survey to determine if consumers would find the letter she received to be false or misleading,in violation of,or unfair or unconscionable,in violation of we have stated on several occasions that a carefully designed and conducted consumer survey is one way to create a triable issue of fact as to how an unsophisticated consumer would interpret a collection letter.chuway action fin,cir see also,walker,at how a particular notice affects its audience is a question that may be explored by testimony and devices such as consumer surveys.johnson,at durkin,at.cpi relies on taylor cavalry investment,cir,for the proposition that the court can determine from the face of a letter that not even a significant fraction of the population would be misled by it.at internal quotations omitted.however,that statement was made in taylor in the course of evaluating a district court grant of summary judgment the court was therefore determining whether the record in that case contained a genuine issue of triable fact,a different and significantly more demanding standard than the rule b standard applicable in this case.id.at.therefore,taylor is not apposite to mcmillan present claim that the motion to dismiss was improperly granted 
in sum,the requisite inquiries under and are necessarily.whether characterized as issues of fact or issues of mixed fact and law,district courts must act with great restraint when asked to rule in this context on a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.undoubtedly,there will be occasions when a district court will be required to hold that no reasonable person,however unsophisticated,could construe the wording of the communication in a manner that will violate the statutory provision.in most instances,however,a proper application of the rule will require that the plaintiff be given an opportunity to demonstrate that his allegations are supported by a factual basis responsive to the statutory standard.
with the applicable standard now before us,we must examine the record in light of the requirements of the statute and determine whether it is possible to imagine evidence that would support the allegations of the complaint and establish violations of and.see walker,at.if it is possible that mcmillan might be able to produce such evidence,we shall have to conclude that the district court action was,at best,premature.see id.
fdcpa section 
section states that a debt collector can not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.the statute also enumerates a list of specific practices that are per se false or misleading.id.one action that is specifically barred under this section is t he false representation or implication that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct in order to disgrace the consumer.id.
mcmillan submits that cpi letter questioning her honesty was false or misleading,in violation of the general prohibition found in,because the of a debt does not mean necessarily that the debtor is dishonest.at.she specifically claims that the language stating that you are either honest or dishonest you can not be both,that the creditor believed you to be honest when credit was extended,and that cpi would like to give you this final opportunity to prove your honesty and good intentions is false or misleading.see at emphasis omitted.mcmillan contends there are many reasons why a check might be dishonored that does not involve a lack of honesty,including mathematical error,bank error,or the unexpected delay in the clearing of funds to cover the check.see appellant br.at.further,she argues that the record does not contain any evidence that she actually wrote a check that did not clear or that she did not cure the defect.see id.at.
mcmillan complaint may be read as implying that she had written a check that did not clear,although on appeal she argues that the record contains no evidence of whether or not she wrote the check or whether or not it was honored.see at stating that cpi statements are intended to disgrace her because she did not pay the debt at issue emphasis added.nevertheless,we agree with mcmillan that on the face of the complaint,there is no evidence in the record as to why her check did not clear,or that cpi had any prior communications asking for payment that mcmillan ignored.therefore,the language stating that she committed the injustice of permitting the account to become past due and then ignor ed all request for payment may be false 
cpi submits,however,that the statements at issue are true statements that a person is either dishonest or honest,and that creditors,when extending credit,believe,in good faith,that consumers are honest.appellee br.at.cpi is correct in its assertion that the letter,read literally,does not state that mcmillan is dishonest,but rather that she is either honest or dishonest.although this statement may be literally true,in some cases the literal truth may convey a misleading impression that violates.gammon,at easterbrook,concurring see also avila rubin,cir.
many individuals who write a dishonored check are not necessarily dishonest there are a variety of reasons that a check may be dishonored that do not necessarily indicate that an individual did not have every intention of paying the underlying debt when the check was issued indeed,the legislative history of the fdcpa indicates that congress was aware that not all debtors actually intend to become delinquent on their debts when they take out credit 
one of the most frequent fallacies concerning debt collection legislation is the contention that the primary beneficiaries are deadbeats.in fact,however,there is universal agreement among scholars,law enforcement officials,and even debt collectors that the number of persons who willfully refuse to pay just debts is minuscule t he vast majority of consumers who obtain credit fully intend to repay their debts.when default occurs,it is nearly always due to an unforeseen event such as unemployment,overextension,serious illness,or marital difficulties or divorce.
at,reprinted in.while cpi letter to mcmillan literally says you can either be honest or dishonest,the underlying implication,at least arguably,is that the debtor is being dishonest by allowing the check to be dishonored.by calling into question a debtor honesty and good intentions simply because a check was dishonored,a collection letter may be making a statement that is false or misleading to the unsophisticated consumer.therefore,mcmillan has stated a claim sufficient to survive a rule b motion.
mcmillan also contends that the language in the letter stating you are either honest or dishonest you can not be both,that the creditor believed you to be honest when credit was extended,and that cpi would like to give you this final opportunity to prove your honesty and good intentions violated,the prohibition on statements intended to disgrace.prohibiting t he false representation or implication that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct in order to disgrace the consumer.cpi replies that,because it did not imply that mcmillan committed a crime or that she committed fraud,its statements did not violate.in support of its argument,cpi cites the federal trade commission commentary,which only lists a f alse allegation of fraud or a m isrepresentation of criminal law as violations of.see statements of general policy or interpretation staff commentary on the fair debt collection practices act,fed.trade comm,hereinafter ftc statements.
we begin our analysis with the text of the statute itself,which,as we have stated,is the most reliable indicator of congressional intent.bass stolper,koritzinsky,brewster neider,cir see also mace van ru credit,cir c onstruing the fdcpa in accordance with its plain language may best honor its drafters intent.the statutory language of states that a debt collector can not make t he false representation or implication that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct in order to disgrace the consumer.emphasis added.we believe that this language makes clear that congress intended to proscribe conduct beyond falsely implying that a debtor committed a crime.when the statutory term disgrace is given its normal meaning,it is clear that congress intended that the statute also proscribe conduct that shames or humiliates a debtor.calling into question another honesty,and implying that the individual has dishonest intentions arguably rises to the level of language that could shame or humiliate the reader of the letter 
therefore,we decline to give the restrictive meaning advocated by cpi.when the term disgrace is given its natural meaning,we believe that mcmillan may be able to establish a factual basis that would permit her relief under.mcmillan therefore has stated a claim under,and it is possible that the facts will demonstrate that a significant fraction of the population would find the language in the letter to be disgraceful.
fdcpa section 
mcmillan also alleges that the letter is unfair or unconscionable in violation of.section,like,states a general prohibition on using unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.the provision then lists eight specific violations wi
