maria pintos appeals the district court summary adjudication of her claims under the fair credit reporting act fcra,et.pintos contends that pacific creditors association pca violated the fcra by obtaining,without any purpose,a credit report on her from experian information solutions,a credit reporting agency.pintos also argues that experian violated the fcra by furnishing the report to pca.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,concluding that pca was authorized to obtain pintos credit report under the fcra,which allows for the furnishing of reports in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer and involving the collection of an account of the consumer.a a.the district court determined that the transaction involved the collection of an account,relying upon our decision in hasbun county of los angeles,cir.we conclude that hasbun is more limited,however.because the current case involves neither a transaction for which pintos sought credit nor the collection of a judgment debt,we conclude that a a did not authorize pca to obtain the credit report on pintos.thus,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings regarding the defendants liability.we also vacate the district court order regarding experian motion to seal certain documents and remand for consideration under the proper legal standard.
background 
police officers found a sport utility vehicle belonging to pintos parked on the street in san bruno,california,on may.the vehicle registration was expired.at police direction,the vehicle was towed,and the towing company,p s towing,obtained a lien on the vehicle for towing and impound costs.p s later sold the vehicle when pintos failed to reclaim it or pay the outstanding charges.since the vehicle sale price did not cover the amount owed,p s asserted a deficiency claim against pintos and later transferred that claim to pca,a collection agency 
pca sought and obtained a credit report on pintos from experian on december,in connection with its effort to collect on the debt assigned by p pintos subsequently filed a complaint against pca and experian under the fcra.she alleged that pca violated the fcra by obtaining her credit report without any purpose and that experian was liable for providing the report to pca.
pca and experian filed separate motions for summary judgment.both argued that,under a a,pca had a permissible purpose for obtaining pintos credit report because it was seeking to collect a debt,the towing deficiency claim.experian further argued that it was not liable for a violation because it had fulfilled its obligations under,which immunizes a reporting agency against fcra violations by the agency subscribers so long as the agency takes certain steps.
pintos filed a for partial summary judgment on the issues of permissible purpose and experian alleged negligence.she attached to that motion several experian documents detailing the company internal procedures for complying with its fcra obligations.claiming these documents were confidential and proprietary,experian filed a motion to seal them.
the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment on november.citing hasbun,the court agreed that a a permitted pca to obtain pintos credit report.the court denied experian motion to seal documents,without explanation.
pintos filed a timely notice of appeal on december.experian the district court denial of its motion to seal on december.it also sought reconsideration by the district court of the denial of that motion.on april,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter since experian already appealed the order to this court.nevertheless,the court stated that,if it had jurisdiction,it would grant experian motion under phillips ex rel.estates of byrd general motors,cir,and it stayed its prior order on the subject pending the appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review grants of summary judgment de novo.aclu city of las vegas,cir.crossmotions for summary judgment are evaluated separately under this same standard.id.at hoopa valley indian tribe ryan,cir.
congress enacted the fcra in to promote efficiency in the nation banking system and to protect consumer privacy.trw andrews,d.those two goals lie in tension,and the fcra strikes a balance between them.the act authorizes credit reporting agencies to furnish consumer report s because c onsumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.a,a.at the same time,the fcra requir es credit reporting agencies to maintain reasonable procedures designed to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information contained in credit reports.andrews,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.importantly for this case,the fcra permits agencies to furnish credit reports only for certain statutorily enumerated purposes.id.
the statutory limitation on the furnishing of credit reports is particularly relevant here,as the parties dispute whether pca had a permissible purpose in obtaining pintos credit report.defendants contend that it did,under a a 
a in general 
subject to subsection c of this section,any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other 
to a person which it has reason to believe 
a intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished and involving the extension of credit to,or review or collection of an account of,the consumer 
to qualify under a,the credit transaction must both be a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished and involve the extension of credit to,or review or collection of an account of,the consumer.concluding that the transaction here involved the collection of an account,the district court held that the statute authorized pca to obtain pintos credit report.but the district court did not address whether the transaction was a credit transaction involving pintos.that may have been because hasbun did not separately discuss that requirement,but our court has discussed it in other cases and it is clearly set out in the statute.
one decision in which we discussed that requirement was andrews trw,cir,rev on other grounds,trw,andrews,d,in which we addressed whether the plaintiff,a victim of identity theft,was involved in credit transactions initiated by an imposter posing as the plaintiff.the imposter had obtained the plaintiff social security number and birth date and used that information to apply for credit from various companies.id.at.the companies in turn requested and obtained the plaintiff credit report from trw.id.at.the plaintiff sued trw,claiming that it furnished her credit report without reasonable grounds for believing that she was the consumer whom the credit applications involved.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the district court granted summary judgment in trw favor on this claim,ruling that trw disclosures were made for a purpose permissible under a a,because the plaintiff,even against her will,was involved in the credit transaction initiated by the imposter.id.at.
on appeal,we concluded that the plaintiff was not involved in the credit transaction and reversed the summary judgment ruling.we held that the word involve in this context had to be read narrowly 
the district court held that the plaintiff was involved in the transaction because her social security number was used.the statutory phrase is a credit transaction involving the consumer.a a.involve has two dictionary meanings that are relevant to draw in as a participant or to oblige to become associated.the district court understood the word in the second sense.we are reluctant to conclude that congress meant to harness any consumer to any transaction where any crook chose to use his or her number.the first meaning of the statutory term must be preferred here.in that sense the plaintiff was not involved.
id.at.thus,a person is involved in a credit transaction for purposes of a a where she is draw n in as a participant in the transaction,but not where she is oblige d to become associated with the transaction.see id.
here,pintos did not participate in seeking credit from the towing company.she owned the car that was towed,so she was not as completely distant from the transaction as the victim of identity theft in andrews,but neither was she a participant in the typical transaction where an extension of credit is requested.she had no contact with p s or pca until p s towed her car.she never asked to have the vehicle towed p s simply towed the car by direction of the police then tried to collect the charges.pintos did not initiate the transaction that resulted in pca requesting her credit report.as the seventh circuit held in stergiopoulos first midwest bancorp,cir,a a can be relied upon by the party requesting a credit report only if the consumer initiates the transaction.
the requirement that the consumer initiate the transaction is not satisfied simply because the consumer did something that arguably led to the creditor claim.in mone dranow,cir,a credit report on mone was obtained by his former employer,who sued mone for unfair competition after he quit and established a competing firm.the report was obtained for the purpose of determining whether mone had sufficient assets to pay a judgment.id.at.arguably,it was mone alleged unfair competition that initiated the chain of events,but we held that the request for the report did not qualify as being in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer,under a a.id.
similarly,that pintos owned the car that was towed did not mean that she initiated the credit transaction.like the victim in andrews,pintos was not a participant in the credit transaction,but was oblige d to become associated with it after her car was towed and the towing deficiency claim arose.see andrews,at.
our decision in hasbun did not supersede our prior decisions.the holding of that case is properly understood to be that a judgment creditor is authorized under the statute to obtain a credit report in connection with collection efforts.hasbun.
in hasbun a child support enforcement agency obtained a credit report of a father who had fallen behind in paying child support.we made reference to the nature of the debt on every page of that decision.we also did so in stating the question posed by the case when and how a child support enforcement agency may lawfully obtain the consumer credit report of an individual who has fallen behind in paying child support and in summarizing our holding we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants and hold that child support enforcement agencies need not comply with the certification requirements of a when seeking to collect child support.id.at emphasis added.we explicitly adopted and quoted extensively from a federal trade commission commentary which made repeated reference to the permissible purpose of a judgment creditor to obtain a credit report.id.at a judgment creditor has a permissible purpose to receive a consumer report on the judgment debtor for use in connection with collection of the judgment debt emphasis added.to be sure,our opinion did not include that qualifier in every statement,but our holding involved a debt that had already been adjudicated.if a debt has been judicially established,there is a credit transaction involving the consumer no matter how it arose.the obligation is established as a matter of law,and the statute is satisfied.hasbun extended no further.application of hasbun to permit a credit report to be obtained to assist the collection of a claim that had not yet been adjudicated is not supported by the logic of that decision nor by our other precedents.
pca was not a judgment creditor.its claim against pintos did not result from a transaction initiated by pintos.we conclude,therefore,that a a did not authorize pca to obtain the credit report on pintos.accordingly,we reverse the grant of summary judgment in defendants favor 
we next consider whether experian is also liable for any violation of the fcra committed by pca.the district court did not reach this issue,as it determined that pca had a permissible purpose to obtain pintos credit report.experian argues that because immunizes it from subscribers fcra violations,the statute offers an alternative basis to affirm the summary judgment with respect to its liability.
a credit reporting agency may be liable for its subscriber violation when the agency fails to comply with the statutory obligations imposed by.see guimond trans union credit info,cir.experian argues that because pca gave it a blanket certification a written promise to use experian credit reports only for permissible agency satisfied its statutory obligations under.we disagree.
section requires more from a credit reporting agency than merely obtaining a subscriber general promise to obey the law.after prospective subscribers certify the purposes for which credit information is sought,and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose,the reporting agency must make a reasonable effort to verify the certifications and may not furnish reports if reasonable grounds exist to believe that reports will be used impermissibly.a.under the plain terms of a,a subscriber certification can not absolve the reporting agency of its independent obligation to verify the certification and determine that no reasonable grounds exist for suspecting impermissible use blanket certification can not eliminate all genuine issues of material fact with regard to experian liability.
experian motion to file documents under seal 
two standards generally govern motions to seal documents like the one at issue here first,a compelling reasons standard applies to most judicial records.see kamakana city county of honolulu,cir holding that a party seeking to seal a judicial record bears the burden of meeting the compelling reasons standard foltz state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.this standard derives from the common law right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents.kamakana,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.to limit this common law right of access,a party seeking to seal judicial records must show that compelling reasons supported by specific factual findings outweigh the general history of access and the public policies favoring disclosure.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
second,a different standard applies to private materials unearthed during discovery,as such documents are not part of the judicial record.id.at.rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure governs here,providing that a trial court may grant a protective order to protect a party or person from annoyance,embarrassment,oppression,or undue burden or expense.
the relevant standard for purposes of rule c is whether good cause exists to protect th e information from being disclosed to the public by balancing the needs for discovery against the need for confidentiality.phillips ex rel.estates of byrd motors,cir.this good cause standard presents a lower burden for the party wishing to seal documents than the compelling reasons standard.the cognizable public interest in judicial records that underlies the compelling reasons standard does not exist for documents produced between private litigants.see kamakana,at holding that d ifferent interests are at stake with the right of access than with rule c foltz,at when discovery material is filed with the court its status changes.
the good cause standard is not limited to discovery.in phillips,we held that good cause is also the proper standard when a party seeks access to previously sealed discovery attached to a nondispositive motion.at when a party attaches a sealed discovery document to a nond
