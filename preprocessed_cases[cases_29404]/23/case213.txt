joseph miller miller and his wife,shelley miller,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition and proposed to surrender their vehicle in full satisfaction of the remaining debt to daimlerchrysler dc,which opposed the bankruptcy plan.the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan,and dc appealed directly to this court.we reverse and remand.
miller entered into a contract with a dealership for the purchase of a vehicle.the dealership assigned all its interests in the contract to dc,which perfected its lien on the vehicle with a first priority purchase money security interest pmsi.later,miller filed a voluntary petition for chapter bankruptcy dc filed a timely proof of a secured claim for,the outstanding payoff balance due at the petition date.
miller filed an amended chapter plan in which he proposed to surrender the vehicle in full satisfaction of his debt pursuant to a c.dc objected to the plan,noting that the vehicle was worth less than miller remaining debt.the bankruptcy court affirmed the plan,holding that the addition of the hanging paragraph to the bankruptcy code the code by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer act of bapcpa allowed miller to surrender the vehicle in full satisfaction of the debt.we granted dc request for leave to take a direct appeal from the bankruptcy court to this court.see d a.
the issue is whether the hanging paragraph prevents a creditor with a pmsi in what is termed a vehicle from obtaining a state law deficiency judgment against a debtor for the portion of the debt not covered by the sale of the surrendered vehicle under a c.it does not.
before bapcpa was enacted,a bankruptcy court could confirm a chapter plan in one of three ways the debtor and creditor agreed on a plan the debtor retained the collateral and continued to make payments or the debtor surrendered the collateral tidewater fin.kenney,cir.if the debtor chose the third option,the creditor could pursue an unsecured deficiency claim if it had a right to collect a deficiency under applicable nonbankruptcy law.daimlerchrysler fin.servs.am.llc barrett in re barrett,cir.that deficiency is considered an unsecured claim under a,which reads 
an allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in such property and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor interest is less than the amount of such allowed claim.such value shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property.
bapcpa changed that statutory analysis by adding the hanging paragraph,which states that does not apply to a if 
the creditor has a pmsi securing the debt that is the subject of the claim,the debt was incurred within the sic preceding the date of the filing of the petition,and the collateral for that debt consists of a motor vehicle acquired for the personal use of the debtor 
a the hanging paragraph prevents bifurcation for secured claims that meet its criteria.drive fin,at.miller and dc agree that this case is covered by the hanging paragraph,because the vehicle qualifies as a vehicle meaning that miller purchased it within days of his bankruptcy it was for his personal use we must decide what happens now that no longer applies to a.
numerous courts have examined this issue,but with widely divergent results.traditionally,their outcomes have fallen into the majority view and minority view camps.the majority view holds that a debtor can surrender a vehicle in full satisfaction of his debt regardless of whether the car was worth less than the total amount of debt.see,in re payne,in re ezell.the minority view opines that a creditor can still pursue any remaining debt on a vehicle under state law,regardless of the elimination of.see,in re particka.
the majority and minority labels,however,no longer accurately describe the current state of the jurisprudence.the majority view,although at one time dominant has been rejected by every circuit court of appeals that has examined the question if anything,the majority view has now become the minority position,applied only in bankruptcy courts whose circuits have yet to address the issue thus,instead of using outdated labels,we discuss the earlier cases in terms of the position the old majority view and the deficiency position the old minority view.
miller and amicus curiae the national association of consumer bankruptcy attorneys nacba propose we follow the position reflected in decisions such as ezell and in re pinti.dc proposes we follow the deficiency position and provides us with two models to reach that result the approach of americredit financial services,long in re long,cir and using state law as in in re wright,cir 
we disagree with the reasoning in long,because,even though that court reached the right result,the reasoning violates our longstanding standards for analyzing statutes.the court focused heavily on a bankruptcy treatise and on the sparse legislative history surrounding the hanging paragraph.see long,at.the court acknowledged that earlier decisions and its bankruptcy treatise said that the position complied with the reading of the code,but the court disagreed with their result.id.at.instead,it found that there was a gap in the statute and that reading it literally would produce a nonsensical result not intended by the drafters of bapcpa.id.
the long court considered the solution proposed in wright which we discuss below but rejected it because it fails even to consider that a primary,underlying purpose of the bankruptcy code is to provide a uniform,nationwide system by which claims are handled.id.at.the court insisted that relying on state law would undermine the uniformity the code endeavors to preserve.id.at quoting bibbo dean witter reynolds,cir.
instead of using state law,the court in long determined that its decision regarding the hanging paragraph should be filled by prior bankruptcy law to conform with congress intent and the overriding purposes of the bankruptcy code.id.to return to the code,the court employed the common law principle of interpretation known as the equity of the statute.id.that notion connotes the idea that statutes are an authoritative expression of public policy.that policy should be hospitably received by the courts,and they are free to apply it,absent good reasons to the contrary,in cases within the spirit of the enactment,but not within its letter.id.at quoting north dakota fredericks,cir.
the reasoning in long is flawed.when interpreting the code,courts should begin where they would when interpreting any statute its plain language.see united states ron pair,d.if the statute is clear,the inquiry is at its end,and we enforce the statute on its terms.see id.that rule should inform the reading of code provisions and likewise governs our treatment of the hanging paragraph.
in lamie trustee,d,the court emphasized that the plain language meaning of the code should rarely be trumped.although the code at times is awkward,and even ungrammatical that does not make it ambiguous.id.when presented with an argument that the code would make more sense by read ing an absent word into the statute,the court rejected the idea,stating that w ith a plain,nonabsurd meaning in view,we need not proceed in this way.id.at.
there is a basic difference between filling a gap left by congress silence and rewriting rules that congress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.if congress enacted into law something different from what it intended,then it should amend the statute to conform to its intent.it is beyond our providence to rescue congress from its drafting errors,and to provide for what we might think is the preferred result.id.at.quoting united states granderson,d kennedy,concurring ellipses in original.
bapcpa has been criticized by some judges and commentators as being poorly drafted and has resulted in certain readings of the code that would qualify as awkward under the definition in lamie although we have no reason to pass judgment on the process by which bapcpa became law,we note th
