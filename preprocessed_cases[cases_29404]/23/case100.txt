plaintiff paul kuhne appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york harold baer,judge,entered on march,granting summary judgment in favor of defendants and dismissing kuhne complaint in its entirety.kuhne alleges that defendant midland funding is a debt collection agency under new york city administrative code admin.code or code a and is thus required under to be licensed by the new york city department of consumer affairs dca in order to engage in debt collection activities in the city of new york.he alleges that because did not have such a license,defendants violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,and new york general business law when defendant cohen slamowitz,llp c s filed a lawsuit against him on behalf of seeking to collect from him defaulted consumer debt that had purchased from his original creditor.
until recently,section a of the code defined debt collection agency as a person engaged in business the principal purpose of which is to regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another.admin.code a section,in turn,makes it unlawful for any person to act as a debt collection agency without first having obtained a license from the dca.id.the parties do not dispute that engages in the business of purchasing defaulted consumer debt and authorizes third party debt collection agencies to engage in debt collection activities to collect that debt,including the filing of lawsuits in name in the event that their initial efforts are unsuccessful.the issue on appeal is whether,under these circumstances,is a debt collection agency under the version of admin.code a.
the appellate divisions of new york state supreme court and the new york court of appeals have not addressed this question,and we do not believe the text of the statute provides an unmistakable answer.while the weight of the authority in new york appears to support defendants position that is not a debt collection agency,kuhne position is not without support.moreover,as noted,the city council recently enacted legislation that amends admin.code a,which became effective july,to unambiguously include entities such as within the definition of debt collection agency.see local law council int.the legislative history of local law states that it is a clarification of the law,thereby implying that the version of a treats entities such as as debt collection agencies.under these circumstances,we respectfully believe that the new york court of appeals should have the opportunity to determine whether the version of a includes within its definition of debt collection agency entities such as.if the new york court of appeals accepts this certification and answers this question in the affirmative,then we respectfully request that it also address whether defendants violated bus.law by virtue of status as the named plaintiff in the debt collection suit against kuhne.

kuhne is an individual residing in new york county,new york.sometime in the late,he defaulted on a credit card.years later,kuhne received a letter dated june,from mcm indicating that recently purchased his account and that mcm,a debt collection company,is the servicer of this obligation.
never had contact with kuhne all contact with him was initially made by mcm.mcm sent kuhne several letters attempting to collect the debt,the first of which was its june,letter mentioned above.it offered kuhne a discount off of his current balance if he sent payment to mcm by july.on august,mcm sent a second letter,this time offering kuhne an interest free payment schedule.it sent similar letters on september,november,and january.mcm was unsuccessful in collecting the debt.kuhne does not allege that defendants or mcm violated the fdcpa or bus.law by sending any of these letters.
mcm then retained c s,a debt collection law firm in new york,to pursue collection activities against kuhne on behalf of.c s is and has been at all relevant times licensed by the dca as a debt collection agency.in june,c s filed suit on behalf of in the civil court of the city of new york.was the only named plaintiff in this action.shortly thereafter,c s served kuhne with the necessary summons.c s also sent him several letters indicating,inter alia,that it was willing to settle the matter without appearing in court.on february,and kuhne stipulated to a discontinuance with prejudice 
a few days after the discontinuance,on february,kuhne commenced this action.he filed an amended complaint on may,alleging that,acting together with encore and mcm,directed c s to collect the alleged consumer debt by telephone and mail,and by filing litigation in the new york city civil courts.am.compl.he further alleges that b ecause is not licensed as a debt collector by the dca,it is not permitted to bring suit in the city of new york and that c s knew or should have known this fact.id.kuhne claims that defendants thereby violated the fdcpa and gen bus.law he alleges that,as a result of these violations,he hired an attorney to defend suit and incurred in legal fees.brief for at.he further alleges that h e also suffered from symptoms of emotional distress and had to take time off from work to go to court to meet with his attorney.id.
in january,the parties filed with the district court competing motions for summary judgment.on march,the district court agreed with defendants and held that is not a debt collection agency.kuhne cohen slamowitz,llp,civ.hb,wl.it noted that kuhne claim that d efendants violated the fdcpa and bus.law rests entirely on his assertion that the new york city debt licensing statute required to be licensed before it could sue to collect a debt.id.at.the district court examined the legislative purpose of new york city licensing requirement,new york state case law interpreting a and a letter from dca general counsel opining that entities such as are not debt collection agencies under the code.id.at.it concluded that i n light of the legislative intent,the case law,the administrative interpretation embodied in the dca letter and encore corporate structure,the mere commencement of a lawsuit in the name of a holding company with no employees does not mandate application of the new york city licensing regime.id.at.it emphasized that t o require to be licensed,when it had no direct contact with the consumer,would run afoul of the purpose of the new york city licensing statute and the fdcpa,which are aimed at preventing abusive collection practices.id.the district court entered judgment in favor of defendants shortly thereafter.kuhne timely filed a notice of appeal.
on appeal,kuhne challenges the district court legal determination that is not a debt collection agency as defined under the version of admin.code a.on april,mfy legal services,mfy a organization that provides legal counseling and representation to new york residents who are contacted or sued by debt a motion to appear as amicus curiae in support of kuhne.along with its motion,mfy filed a letter dated march,pursuant to rule j of the federal rules of appellate procedure.the letter informed this court of a local law passed by the new york city council and signed into law on march,by the mayor,which amends,inter alia,admin.code a.it provides,in relevant part,that a debt collection agency shall also include a buyer of delinquent debt who seeks to collect such debt either directly or through the services of another by,including but not limited to,initiating or using legal processes or other means to collect or attempt to collect such debt.local law council int.there is no dispute that entities such as fall within the scope of local law definition of a debt collection agency.the amendment became effective days after its enactment,see id,on july.

discussion 
admin.code a 
the threshold question on appeal is whether is a debt collection agency as defined under the version of admin.code a and is thus required to have a license under to engage in debt collection activities in new york city.this is an issue of statutory interpretation.our cardinal function in interpreting a new york statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.tom rice motors,cir citing abrams ford motor,stat.laww.as the clearest indicator of legislative intent is the statutory text,the starting point in any case of interpretation must always be the language itself,giving effect to the plain meaning thereof.id.at quoting majewski cent.sch.we therefore begin,as we must,with the text of the statute in effect at the time of the alleged conduct,which provides in relevant part as follows 
debt collection agency shall mean a person engaged in business the principal purpose of which is to regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another.the term does not include any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity ii concerns a debt which was originated by such person iii concerns a debt which was not in default at the time it was obtained by such person as a secured party in a commercial credit transaction involving the creditor 
admin.code a.
defendants contend that under this provision,is not a debt collection agency because it does not collect or attempt to collect debts.they emphasize that never once had contact with kuhne,and mcm and c s,both licensed debt collection agencies,engaged in all collection efforts on its behalf.only after mcm and c s collection efforts failed did c s file the debt collection action against kuhne on behalf.defendants emphasize that was the named plaintiff simply because it was the owner of the debt.
defendants position seems to comport with the statute declaration of its legislative purpose.section of admin.code provides 
the council hereby finds the presence of consumer related problems with respect to the practices of debt collection agencies whose sole concern is the collection of debts owed to their clients.while the majority of those engaged in this business are honest and ethical in their dealings,there is a minority of unscrupulous collection agencies in operation that practice abusive tactics such as threatening delinquent debtors,or calling such people at outrageous times of the night.these actions constitute tactics which would shock the conscience of ordinary people.due to the sensitive nature of the information used in the course of such agency sic everyday business,and the vulnerable position consumers find themselves in when dealing with these agencies,it is incumbent upon this council to protect the interests,reputations and fiscal of the citizens of this city against those agencies who would abuse their privilege of operation.it is herein declared that the city should license debt collection agencies.
admin.code.thus,the purpose of the statute is to prevent debt collectors from using unscrupulous collection tactics against the public.because had no dealings with kuhne,other than as the named plaintiff in the debt collection action,and hires licensed debt collection agencies to perform debt collection activities,it does not seem to serve the statute purpose to require to be licensed as well.
although there is no appellate division or new york court of appeals decision on point,there is an opinion letter from dca general counsel dated march,and a decision by the first department appellate term from favoring this position.the general counsel letter states that a debt buyer that merely purchases or acquires defaulted debt but does not engage in collection activities itself does not require a license from the department.letter from marla tepper,general counsel of the dca,to dennis malen,malen,march,tepper letter,available at.because the dca is the agency in charge of issuing the licenses,see admin.code,to,a letter from its general counsel interpreting the meaning of a debt collection agency may be entitled to respect at least to the extent that its interpretations have the power to persuade.christensen harris county,d discussing federal administrative law precedent.the tepper letter provides in relevant part 
the department of consumer affairs issues this letter in response to an inquiry from the consumer credit association of metropolitan new york,a local trade group,as to whether debt buyers that do not themselves engage in collection activities must be licensed by the department.debt buyer is a term commonly used to describe a purchaser or assignee of defaulted debt.
in addressing this question,the department first confirms its position that a purchaser or assignee of defaulted debt whose principal purpose is the collection of that debt,whether for itself or others,is a debt collection agency under new york city administrative code a.debt buyers that engage in debt collection activities must therefore be licensed by the department in order to collect debts in new york city citing admin.code.
a debt buyer that merely purchases or acquires defaulted debt but does not engage in collection activities itself does not require a license from the department in enacting,the city council sought to curb abusive practices of debt collection agencies by requiring licensing of those entities dealing directly with the consumer public in the collection of debts.thus,under the administrative code,a debt collection agency is an entity engaged in actively collecting or attempting to collect debts.

thereafter,the appellate term of the supreme court for the first department came to the same conclusion.see mrc receivables morales,misc d a,wl.term dep t mrc ii.the trial court had held in that case that t here was no showing by the defendant that the plaintiff engaged in collection activities sufficient to require plaintiff to obtain a license from the new york city department of consumer affairs.mrc receivables morales.may,available at.in affirming the trial court,the appellate term relied on the tepper letter.it wrote 
defendant evidentiary submissions were insufficient to demonstrate that plaintiff,as the purchaser of the underlying debt,is a debt collection agency within the meaning of administrative code a,and thus subject to the licensing requirements of administrative code.the record does not conclusively establish that plaintiff principal purpose is to regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another.there was no showing that plaintiff regularly and actively engages in collection activities.
mrc ii,misc d a,wl,at citation omitted.
kuhne counters,however,that purchases debt for the sole purpose of attempting to collect it,and the mere fact that it hires another entity to undertake the collection efforts does not absolve it of its obligations under the admin.code.he cites several lower court decisions in support of this proposition.most of the authority offered by kuhne is,in our opinion,inapposite however,he does cite rushmore recoveries,xi,llc morningstar,index.july,available at,in which the supposed debt collection agency purchased consumer debt and then immediately forwarded it to i
