section requires debt collectors within five days of the initial communication regarding a debt to provide debtors with written notice containing the amount of the debt and the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed.a.that section also requires a written statement to debtors explaining that unless the debtor disputes the validity of the debt within days,the debt collector will assume the debt is valid that if the debtor notifies the collector that she is disputing the debt in writing within the day period,the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt from the creditor and a copy of the verification will be mailed to the consumer and that upon debtor request the debt collector will give him the name and address of the original creditor,if the original creditor is different from the current one.a.if the debtor requests verification of the debt or information on the original creditor,the debt collector must cease collection of the debt until the requested information is mailed to the consumer.b.however,the statute does not require the debt collector to inform the debtor of the obligation to cease collection under these circumstances.compare a with b.
although the text of does not explicitly provide that the disclosures required by it must be made in a manner,courts have held that the statute implies that the required disclosures be set forth in a form and within a context that does not distort or obfuscate its meaning bartlett heibl,cir citing avila rubin,cir terran kaplan,cir russell equifax,cir miller american credits,cir.see also wilson quadramed,cir.in bartlett,at,the seventh circuit explained that most cases in which the literal language of is found to be confusing are cases where other language in the collection letter contradicts,appears to contradict,or overshadows the mandatory language alerting the debtor of his or her statutory rights 
in the present case,plaintiff argues that two sentences in the collection letter stating that full collection activity would continue until peter account was paid in full misrepresented plaintiff rights under,thereby contradicting or appearing to contradict the period for disputing the debt or requesting the name and address of the original creditor.specifically,plaintiff objects to the sentences full collection activity will continue until this account is paid in full to avoid further collection activity,your student loan must be paid in full.when the letter is read as a whole,however,we conclude that these lines do not misrepresent,contradict,or overshadow the language explaining plaintiff debtor statutory rights.
courts have generally found contradiction or apparent contradiction of the printed notice where payment is demanded in a concrete period shorter than the statutory contest period.for example,in bartlett,the offending collection letter demanded the debtor pay his debt,or make arrangements to do so,within one week of the date of this letter,or face legal action.as that court explained,the juxtaposition of the one week and crucial periods is to turn the required disclosure into legal gibberish.bartlett,at.see also swanson,at holding demand for payment in days confuses least sophisticated consumer about statutory contest period.demands for immediate payment or payment now have also been found to appear to contradict the contest period notice,at least where their relationship to the window is not explained.savino,at miller,at.
by contrast,statements that request payment or other actions with no time period specified have been found not to contradict the notice vasquez gertler gertler,concluding request for payment without further delay did not demand payment within a period shorter than days.see also terran,at finding request for immediate phone call did not contradict printed notice.because the challenged language here did not demand payment in a specific time period shorter than days,we conclude that the letter did not violate
