dtex,llc dtex appeals the district court grant of a motion filed by bbva bancomer,grupo financiero bbva bancomer institucion de banca multiple bancomer,to dismiss dtex action on the basis of forum non conveniens in favor of a foreign forum,specifically,mexico.dtex is a south carolina limited liability company bancomer is a mexican banking corporation which is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the district court by virtue of its foreign bank agency located in houston,texas.dtex had formerly sued bancomer in south carolina,but that action was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction,prompting dtex to file the instant action in the southern district of texas.
this controversy commenced in mexico several years ago and involves competing claims to textile manufacturing equipment on the proceeds of its sale on which bancomer held a security interest and dtex claimed ownership through a foreclosure sale,both parties asserting superiority of their respective claims.the long,dramatic,and sordid history of the parties efforts to prevail is laid out in detail in the district court april memorandum and order.and,even this ongoing conflict relatively small chapter in the southern district of texas has produced a record on appeal comprising fourteen volumes,illustrative of the extent of this international brouhaha.
the district court dismissed dtex lawsuit on grounds of forum non conveniens,and we are here today on dtex appeal of that order.we have reviewed it for abuse of discretion,the standard by which we review such an order it will become obvious to any reader of the district court memorandum and order that the facts and the law were considered in excruciating detail by that court before it granted its order,and that the court not only touched all the bases but exhaustively examined each.our review of the record and the arguments advanced by the parties in their appellate briefs not only convinces us that there was no abuse of discretion by the district court,but that it committed no error under any standard of review.we are satisfied that nothing would be gained by our writing anything of substance on this matter in light of the trial court thorough,clear and comprehensive exegesis on the subject of forum non conveniens.we therefore affirm the court dismissal order for the reasons set forth in its analysis of the issues,adopt its memorandum and order by reference as the opinion of this court,and annex it hereto for the edification of our readers.

in,the denimtex plant employees union sued denimtex for unpaid wages.in december,the mexican labor board granted the employees an award and judgment for the workers wage claims.the labor board attached denimtex property,including the textile equipment at the plant,to secure the wage claims and conducted an auction of the equipment.dtex asserts that the wage claims had a first priority lien on denimtex assets,superior to all existing claims,and that the tribunal conducting the auction published written notices of the auction as required by mexican law.docket entry at.
in july,dtex submitted a winning bid at the auction for the equipment,mexican pesos approximately.docket entry at.dtex transferred the funds from its headquarters in south carolina to the labor board in mexico city.on july,dtex entered into a contract to sell the equipment to a third party,gibbs international,for.docket entry,ex.d at.
in august,bancomer filed a legal proceeding with the tribunal that had conducted the auction,challenging the validity of the auction under mexican law.docket entry at docket entry at.bancomer asserted that despite its status as the secured lienholder,it had not received proper notice of the auction and as a result had not submitted a bid.dtex was not a party to this proceeding.dtex alleged that bancomer falsely and fraudulently misrepresented to the labor board that,if it would conduct another auction,the defendant might find a third party to bid more money.docket entry at.on october,the tribunal ruled against bancomer.
on october,bancomer filed a proceeding called an amparo indirecto in a court in mexico city,alleging that the tribunal conducting the auction had violated bancomer rights.docket entry at.at that time,dtex was not a party in the proceeding.in the mexico city amparo proceeding,the court granted bancomer request for a stay preventing any entity,including dtex,from taking possession of the textile equipment pending a full hearing.bancomer was required to post a significant bond as a condition for the stay order the stay was issued on december.on january,the court that had issued the stay ruled against bancomer,dismissing its claim.docket entry at.decisions in subsequent appeals,issued on february and may,affirmed this result.dtex alleges that in the mexico city amparo proceeding,bancomer used its vast financial resources,as well as its tremendous influence and political power throughout mexico to obtain the stay with the knowledge that it was not legally entitled to upset the plaintiff winning bid.docket entry at.dtex acknowledges that despite these efforts,the mexican courts ruled against bancomer.dtex asserts that under mexican law,the may,judgment fully disposed of bancomer challenge to the auction dtex claims the decision is res judicata as to bancomer claim that it owns the textile equipment.docket entry at docket entry at.
dtex alleges that sanchez violated the stay order that had been issued in the amparo and seized possession of the equipment through threats of violence and actual acts of violence.docket entry at.dtex alleges that after may,when the mexican court determined that dtex owned the equipment,bancomer or sanchez kept possession of the equipment by posting security guards and blocking dtex.docket entry at docket entry at.dtex alleges that in december,even after it received an order allowing it to take possession of the equipment,bancomer or sanchez used security guards to prevent that from occurring.docket entry at.
on december,sanchez filed a second amparo action,this one in chihuahua,mexico seeking to invalidate the rulings in dtex favor and asking for a stay to prevent dtex from taking the equipment.docket entry at docket entry at.dtex alleges that bancomer,through sanchez,fraudulently failed to disclose to that court the fact that denimtex was out of business.docket entry at.on january,however,before sanchez had posted the bond required for a stay,the labor board issued orders that allowed dtex to take the equipment and store it in a denimtex storage facility.on january,sanchez posted the bond in the chihuahua amparo case,which prevented dtex from removing the equipment from the denimtex storage facility.dtex alleges that this stay was obtained in bad faith and that bancomer,through sanchez,falsely and fraudulently omitted to disclose to the mexican court the material fact that the equipment had already been purchased by the plaintiff and was the plaintiff property.docket entry at.dtex also alleges that on january,thugs hired by the defendant suddenly and without warning showed up at the denimtex plant and attempted by force to gain entry into the secured denimtex facility where the plaintiff equipment was stored.docket entry at.the police prevented that from occurring.id.at.dtex alleges that the individual that led the mob approached the plaintiff mexican lawyer and offered him a bribe,stating that bancomer would pay the lawyer a monthly bribe if he would allow the bancomer agents to have access to the equipment.id.dtex also alleges that bancomer posted people just outside the equipment site starting on january.id.
on december,the federal labor court denied the chihuahua amparo action sanchez had filed,and the first collegiate tribunal in civil and labor matters in chihuahua denied the appeal on april.docket entry at docket entry at.bancomer asserts that dtex appeared and participated in these proceedings,which ended in dtex favor.docket entry at.dtex denies that it was a party to the proceedings but agrees that the courts ultimately ruled against the judicial administrator who was acting on bancomer behalf.docket entry at.
on november,dtex filed an ancillary action to the mexico city amporo against bancomer,seeking to recover against the bond that bancomer had posted in that case.dtex asserted a right to damages allegedly resulting from its inability to remove and sell the equipment for the period the stay was in effect,december,to may.docket entry at.dtex specifically sought damages resulting from its inability to perform the july contract to sell the equipment to gibbs international,including lost profits.id.dtex claims that despite filing this ancillary motion against bancomer amparo bond,it was not a party to the amparo proceeding under the mexican federal amparo act.docket entry at docket entry at.bancomer argues that under mexican law,dtex became a party in the amparo proceeding.docket entry,ex.b.
dtex attorney in mexico,juan carlos hernandez martinez,stated in his affidavit that he was offered a bribe and threatened in order to induce him to dismiss dtex ancillary motion.docket entry at.he did not dismiss the case.in may,the federal labor court ruled in dtex favor,finding that it was entitled to the equipment as the purchaser at the auction and entitled to damages.the damages compensated dtex for its inability to consummate the gibbs contract but did not include lost investment profits.docket entry,ex.d at.bancomer appealed.in august,the mexican court issued a new decision,ruling that bancomer mexico city amparo action had been groundless and illegal and that dtex had suffered damages because the stay prevented the sale of the equipment under the gibbs contract.id.at.the court awarded dtex damages in the amount of mexican pesos,significantly more than the bond bancomer had been required to post.id.at the court did not award the lost profits sought by dtex for the interest that would have been paid on the principal invested,or mexican pesos.id.at.the court found that these damages were not allowed under article of the mexican federal civil code.id.at.both bancomer and dtex appealed this decision,which was affirmed in november.docket entry at docket entry at.
the parties have presented conflicting affidavits as to whether the mexican court issuing the damages award had jurisdiction to consider certain damages elements.dtex asserts that the damages it sought in the two lawsuits filed in the united states district courts were not within the mexican court jurisdiction.docket entry at,docket entry at.bancomer argues that the august judgment of the mexican court precludes dtex damages claims in this case and supports dismissal on the basis of comity.
the parties have also submitted evidence about the resulting collection of the damages award from the ancillary proceeding.dtex mexican attorney claims that after the november decision,he requested payment from the bonding company,fianzas monterrey,docket entry,ex.at.fianzas is owned by new york life international,which is owned by new york life insurance company.docket entry at.dtex alleges that fianzas sent a letter to dtex about why it was refusing to pay the bond.in that letter,translated by jorge vargas,fianzas states that bancomer advised fianzas that procedural defects in the underlying proceedings should be corrected.docket entry,ex.at.the letter states that fianzas should have been made a party to dtex ancillary action.the letter cites mexican statutory and judicial precedent to support this argument.id.at.dtex characterizes the letter as bancomer using its power and influence in mexico to manipulate the entire justice system.docket entry at.
bancomer denies these allegations but acknowledges that in january,fianzas challenged its duty to proffer the bond in the ancillary proceeding.fianzas challenge was rejected on march.on that date,fianzas wrote to dtex,stating that it would pay immediately.docket entry at.on march,fianzas submitted a check to dtex in the amount of mexican pesos,the full amount of the damages awarded in the ancillary proceeding.bancomer submitted a copy of that check.docket entry,ex.a.dtex confirms that it has received payment.docket entry at 
dtex alleges that in january,while the damages action was pending in mexico,bancomer filed a third amparo proceeding.docket entry at docket entry at.dtex alleges that bancomer started this proceeding in the civil district federal court in mexico city,which lacked jurisdiction in the case.dtex alleges that bancomer agents misled the court about jurisdictional facts.it is undisputed that the mexican court dismissed this amparo action and that the dismissal was upheld on appeal on september.docket entry at.
in july,workers allegedly bribed by bancomer to block dtex sale of the equipment allowed dtex to begin removing equipment.docket entry at.dtex alleges that bancomer,by paying police agents,caused the mexican federal police to stop two of the plaintiff trucks which were attempting to remove some of the equipment the mexican federal police arrested the truck driver,secured their trucks and trailers and ordered the plaintiff not to remove any more of the equipment.docket entry at.
bancomer argues that despite the extensive litigation,title to the equipment remains unclear because of proceedings pending in a mexican bankruptcy court.bancomer asserts that on august,a denimtex creditor not involved in this case,clariant mexico de,began an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against denimtex in mexico.docket entry at.on january,the mexican bankruptcy court found that the denimtex bankruptcy was effective on may,two months before the auction at issue in this case.id.bancomer alleges that the order appointed a receiver for denimtex,jorge abraham gonzalez anchondo,who was to take possession of all denimtex property,including the textile equipment.according to bancomer,the equipment disappeared from anchondo custody in december.on may,the bankruptcy court ruled that anchondo was responsible for the loss.bancomer sought a declaration that the equipment was the property of denimtex bankruptcy estate and that the auction was invalid.the mexican bankruptcy court has not ruled on this issue or on the effect of the may judgment that dtex owns the equipment.bancomer alleges that until the bankruptcy court rules,title to the equipment remains unclear.docket entry at.dtex argues that the bankruptcy proceeding does not involve the issues present in this case,will not deal with the issue of who owns the textile equipment,and that the final judgment issued on may,by the federal circuit court against bancomer is res judicata as to ownership.docket entry at docket entry at.in addition to the mexican civil proceedings,pending and concluded,relating to the equipment,there were also mexican criminal proceedings.on january,dtex attorney in mexico,luis manual millan albarran,filed a criminal complaint against sanchez and a bancomer representative,monica hernandez nyala,alleging robbery,fraud,perjury,and other offenses.the mexican prosecutor investigated these claims but did not file charges.the matter was dismissed on february.docket entry at.
in january or february,sanchez filed felony criminal complaints against two american officers of dtex,jimmy gibbs and brian honeycutt,dtex mexican attorney,hernandez martinez,and one of dtex mexican representatives.docket entry at docket entry at.bancomer claims that these complaints were in response to the criminal complaints dtex had filed.docket entry at.dtex claims that its officers were afraid to return to mexico after sanchez complaint was filed.dtex alleges that in february,bancomer filed additional criminal complaints against dtex american officers and mexican attorney.in may,a mexican federal district court dismissed the criminal charges.dtex argues that its american officers nevertheless feel that they can no longer safely travel to mexico to carry on the business affairs of the plaintiff for fear of being illegally arrested and imprisoned on false and sham charges initiated by or at the behest of the defendant.id.at.bancomer responds that these charges were resolved on november,when the prosecutor request to pursue charges was denied.docket entry at.the parties agree that there is no pending criminal investigation,outstanding warrant,or ongoing criminal proceeding in mexico related to this case.
on july,dtex filed the south carolina suit against bancomer.on october,bancomer moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.after discovery on jurisdiction,the south carolina court dismissed the action on december.the dismissal order was affirmed on appeal on january.docket entry,ex.a.
dtex filed this suit after the federal district court dismissed the south carolina suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.bancomer has moved to dismiss this suit on two grounds international comity and forum non conveniens.much of the evidence and argument the parties presented is focused on comity.because,as set out below,this court grants the motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens,it does not reach comity,the alternative ground for dismissal.
ii.the legal standard for dismissal based on forum non conveniens 
a federal court sitting in diversity applies the federal law of forum non conveniens in deciding a motion to dismiss in favor of a foreign forum.in re air crash disaster near new orleans,cir en banc,vacated on other grounds sub,pan am.world airways,lopez,d,reinstated except as to damages by in re air crash disaster near new orleans,cir en banc de aguilar boeing,cir.the forum non conveniens determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.it may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors,and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable,its decision deserves substantial deference.piper aircraft reyno,d see also mclennan am.eurocopter,cir.
the doctrine of forum non conveniens proceed s from the premise that i n rare circumstances,federal courts can relinquish their jurisdiction in favor of another forum.quackenbush allstate ins,d emphasis omitted.building on its holding in gulf oil gilbert,the supreme court set out the framework for analyzing forum non conveniens in an international context in piper aircraft.first,the court must determine whether there exists an alternative forum.piper aircraft,at.the court considers the amenability of the defendant to service of process and availability of an adequate remedy in the alternative forum.see piper aircraft,at.see also mclennan,at gonzalez chrysler,cir,cert.denied,d.second,the court must determine which forum is best suited to the litigation.see piper aircraft,at.in performing this second step,a court must consider whether certain private and public interest factors weigh in favor of dismissal.mclennan,at.the court must bear in mind that the ultimate inquiry is where trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the interests of justice.in re air crash,at quoting koster am.lumbermens mutual casualty.the defendants bear the burden of proof on all elements of the forum non conveniens analysis.in re air crash,at.
the private interest factors include 
i the relative ease of access to sources of proof ii availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling,and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,witnesses iii possibility of view of the premises,if view would be appropriate to the action iv all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy,expeditious and inexpensive enforceability of judgment and whether the plaintiff has sought to vex,harass,or oppress the defendant.
gulf oil,at.in re air crash,at.
the public interest factors include 
i the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion ii the local interest in having localized controversies resolved at home iii the interest in having a the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is familiar with the law that must govern the action iv the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflicts of law,or in application of foreign law and v the unfairness of burdening citizens in an unrelated forum with jury duty.
see dickson marine,panalpina,cir in re air crash,at.
the defendant carries the burden of persuading the court that a lawsuit should be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds.in re ford motor,north american tire,cir.ordinarily a strong favorable presumption is applied to the plaintiff choice of forum.u nless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant,the plaintiff choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.gulf oil gilbert.
however,the plaintiff choice of forum is not dispositive.see,piper aircraft,at.wilson humphreys cayman limited,cir.judicial concern for allowing citizens of the united states access to american courts has been tempered by the expansion and realities of international commerce.when an american corporation doing extensive foreign business brings an action for injury occurring in a foreign country,many courts have partially discounted the plaintiff preference of a united states forum.as the ninth circuit reiterated in an era of increasing international commerce,parties who choose to engage in international transactions should know that when their foreign operations lead to litigation they can not expect always to bring their foreign opponents into a united states forum when every reasonable consideration leads to the conclusion that the site of the litigation should be elsewhere.contact lumber moges shipping,cir quoting mizokami of,baychem,cir see also lehman humphrey cayman,cir quoting founding church of scientology verlag.
these factors and principles are applied to the record before this court.
iii.analysis 
a.the challenges to the evidence 
the parties have submitted the following evidence affidavits of bancomer attorneys 
faison and juan carlos hernandez martinez a declaration of bancomer attorney jose antonio lechuga vega and vega declaration in opposition to the affidavit of hernandez martinez both parties have submitted affidavits by experts on mexican law.dtex submitted an affidavit of professor jorge vargas and bancomer submitted an affidavit of roberto genis the record also contains the declaration of alvaro meza about bancomer corporate status a letter to dtex translated by vargas a supplemental affidavit by vargas a check to dtex the mexican constitution and an official translation of dtex june,mexican damages award 
b.the adequacy and availability of the foreign forum 
a foreign forum is available when the entire case and all the parties can come within that forum jurisdiction.baumgart,at quoting in re air crash,at.a foreign forum is adequate when the parties will not be deprived of all remedies or treated unfairly,even though they may not enjoy the all the benefits of an american court.id.the substantiative law of the foreign forum is presumed to be adequate unless the plaintiff makes some showing to the contrary,or unless conditions in the foreign forum made known to the court,plainly demonstrate that the plaintiff is highly unlikely to obtain basic justice there.tjontveit den norske bank asa,citing empresa lineas maritimas,cir.
both parties presented experts on mexican law.bancomer expert on mexican law testified that mexican law and judicial system are competent,fair,and adequate to address the claims in dtex complaint.docket entry,ex.b at.in a mexican tort case based on the facts alleged,dtex could pursue monetary damages for property loss,loss of business,loss of use,and other claims.id.at.mexico court system would allow dtex to bring claims for monetary damages based on the facts as alleged.id.dtex expert testified that mexican law would allow some damages,but does not recognize tortious interference with contact,interference with prospective contractual relations,or conversion.docket entry at.under mexican law,dtex could not obtain damages for injury to reputation,operating losses,depreciation losses,equipment maintenance and security costs,attorneys fees,or punitive damages.id.
adequacy does not require that the alternative forum provide the same relief as an american court.a number of fifth circuit cases have held that mexico is an adequate forum for litigation,despite differences in mexican and american substantive and procedural law.see vasquez,cir finding mexico an adequate forum despite limits on damages gonzalez,at affirming the dismissal of suit against american automobile manufacturer on the basis of forum non conveniens in case arising from accident in mexico zermeno mcdonnell douglas,d,seguros comercial americas de american president lines,finding mexico an adequate forum for commercial law dispute de aguilar boeing.dismissing on the basis of forum non conveniens a case involving the crash in mexico of an and manufactured aircraft operated by a mexican airline,aff,cir.
in gonzalez,at,a wrongful death case,the plaintiff argued that the facts that mexican law did not recognize strict liability and capped damages at approximately made the mexican courts inadequate.the court found that mexico,as a sovereign nation,has made a deliberate choice in providing a specific remedy for this tort cause of action.in making this policy choice,the mexican government has resolved a among the competing objectives and costs of tort law.id.at.it would be us to denounce this legitimate policy choice by holding that mexico provides an inadequate forum.id.at.similarly,the fifth circuit has held that the absence of a remedy for civil rico claims does not make a foreign forum inadequate.see kempe ocean drilling and exploration,cir.the absence of a remedy for violating the texas deceptive trade practices act also does not make a forum inadequate.see constructora spilimerg,mitsubishi aircraft,cir.
in this case,mexican law may limit some categories of damages that dtex may recover for the tortious conduct it alleges.but the record makes clear that mexican law recognizes dtex claims for relief and makes significant damages available for those claims.a mexican court has already awarded dtex million mexican pesos in its ancillary action to recover damages sustained as a result of the stay bancomer obtained in the mexico city amparo proceeding.docket entry,ex.d at.dtex argues that the amount of damages would be more limited under mexican as opposed to american law,not that it would have no claim or no ability to recover.courts have consistently rejected such limits as the basis for finding mexican courts an inadequate alternative forum.see gonzalez,de aguilar boeing,aff,cir zermeno mcdonnell douglas,d.
dtex also argues that mexico is not an adequate alternative forum because bancomer has misused the mexican legal system in the past by filing legal actions in bad faith and creating delays that have prejudiced dtex and interfered with its rights in the textile equipment.dtex asserts that conditions in the foreign forum plainly demonstrate that dtex is highly unlikely to obtain basic justice in mexico against bancomer in this dispute.docket entry at.the record does not support this argument as a basis for finding the mexican forum inadequate.mexican tribunals have consistently ruled against bancomer claims to the equipment at issue.a mexican tribunal has awarded,and dtex has collected,millions of mexican pesos in damages against bancomer.dtex has shown no evidence that the mexican courts will treat it unfairly so as to make those courts an inadequate alternative forum.
dtex also argues that bancomer used its political and economic power in mexico with local police and prosecutors to cause mexican authorities to issue totally baseless and fraudulent,but nevertheless very real and intimidating,criminal arrest warrants for dtex two mexican lawyers and two of its key personnel both of whom will be key witnesses in this case.docket entry at.the record shows that all of the criminal proceedings related to this case were dismissed in.there is no evidence of any outstanding warrant or other threat to the dtex agents safety,preventing them from traveling to mexico.the record shows that despite the past criminal complaints,dtex has continued related litigation in mexican tribunals as recently as november.docket entry at docket entry at.the record also shows that mexican tribunals,government authorities,and police repeatedly aided dtex in its attempts to secure the equipment at issue.docket entry at,docket entry at,docket entry at.
dtex also points to allegations and evidence that in early,bancomer agents attempted to bribe and threatened dtex mexican attorney to induce him to drop the ancillary proceeding in which dtex sought damages from bancomer for the stay issued in the mexico city amparo proceeding.the record shows that dtex attorney did not drop the ancillary proceeding.instead,the attorney pursued that claim through the appeal,obtaining and retaining a large damages award against bancomer.this evidence does not support the argument that the mexican courts are not an adequate alternative forum.
the record evidence shows that,as a matter of law,the mexican courts are an available and adequate forum.
c.the private interest factors 
the private interest factors enumerated in gilbert include ease of access to evidence the availability of compulsory process for the attendance of unwilling witnesses the cost of willing witnesses attendance if relevant,the possibility of a view of premises and all other factors that might make the trial quicker or less expensive.at.
ease of access to sources of proof 
the first private interest factor,relative ease of access to sources of proof,supports dismissal.the witnesses dtex identifies in its complaints as having been instrumental in or knowledgeable about bancomer efforts to frustrate dtex rights to the equipment,are primarily in mexico.the events at issue took place in mexico.most of the documents are in mexico.among the documents that bancomer identifies as relevant,based on dtex complaint and affidavits,are transcripts of the relevant mexican court proceedings,the pleadings and evidence bancomer provided to these courts,and court decisions on which dtex bases its assertions that bancomer misrepresented facts and evidence in mexican courts.other examples of relevant mexican documents include the official written testimonial of the denimtex trustee itemizing the pieces of denimtex equipment it seized,docket entry at the official invoice of the assistant secretariat of strikes of special board number of the federal district court of settlements and arbitration the ordinary labor court in chihuahua case no.regarding the denimtex equipment it auctioned to dtex,id.documents concerning the january amparo case brought by bancomer to which hernandez martinez refers in his affidavit,id.at,mexican police records related to the alleged altercation of january,involving agents of dtex and allegedly of bancomer documents supporting dtex claims of maintenance and other expenses incurred by dtex attorneys in mexico,id.at,mexican police records concerning the impoundment of dtex equipment in july,records of the disputed bankruptcy proceedings before the third judge of district a case the mexican bankruptcy court and the january,written report regarding the altercation involving durate sanchez,the judicial administrator,hernandez,and various dtex representatives.
bancomer asserts that it would also have to obtain the contracts governing its lien on the equipment notices,transcripts,and other documentation from the labor board auction and the suspension orders and other decisions rendered in mexico.most of the documents are in spanish obtaining and translating these documents would be burdensome,and costly in this forum.
the relative ease of access to evidence favors mexico as the appropriate forum.
the availability of compulsory process for unwilling witnesses 
the second private interest factor,the availability of compulsory process for the attendance of unwilling witnesses,weighs heavily in favor of dismissal.dtex argues that the significant witnesses are either parties or are under the control of the parties.docket entry at.the record does not support this argument.docket entry.dtex own allegations make it clear that a number of nonparty mexican citizens are likely to be important witnesses in this case.they include the judicial administrator who is not a bancomer employee the denimtex trustee the mexican court judges mexican police officers the alleged accomplices of the judicial administrator who supposedly threatened denimtex workers the individuals who allegedly barred dtex representatives from taking possession of the equipment on november,the ordinary labor court official who accompanied hernandez martinez to the denimtex plant on december,the mexican police who allegedly threatened dtex representatives or interfered with the equipment and the ordinary labor court official who authored the january,letter regarding the dispute at the denimtex plant that occurred on january.docket entry.most of these witnesses are mexican citizens and are not parties or employees of the parties.
this court can not compel attendance by any unwilling nonparty witness who is in mexico.moreover,dtex has not identified key party or nonparty witnesses who are in texas.t o fix the place of trial at a point where litigants can not compel personal attendance and may be forced to try their cases on deposition is to create a condition not satisfactory to litigants.perez compania cataluna,mexico i,cir.
dtex cites two cases to support its argument that a court may deny a motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens even if the evidence and witnesses are located in the foreign forum.in dirienzo philip services,cir,the court declined to dismiss the action despite the fact that many of the witnesses were in ontario.the court found that willing witnesses were within a relatively short distance of new york and could easily travel there.the court acknowledged that unwilling witnesses could not be compelled to appear and that the number of witnesses for whom these accommodations would have to be made and the preference for live testimony weighed in favor of dismissal,despite the availability of videotaped depositions,obtained through letters rogatory.id.at.the court relied on other factors not present in this case to conclude that the balance did not tip in favor of dismissal.this case is distinguishable from the present case,in which the foreign witnesses are scattered in different parts of mexico from chihuahua to mexico city,far from this texas forum many are nonparty witnesses most would be unwilling witnesses whose presence could not be compelled and no witnesses are in texas.the second case dtex cites,wilson humphreys cayman,cir,involved a claim that the plaintiff had been assaulted in a cayman islands hotel.the location of witnesses in the cayman islands did not weigh strongly in favor of dismissal because many of the witnesses were employees of the defendant,which could obtain their cooperation in traveling to testify.in the present case,by contrast,there are a number of nonparty witnesses in mexico.the inability to compel the attendance of numerous unwilling witnesses weighs heavily in favor of dismissal.
the cost of securing the attendance of willing witnesses 
the large number of mexican witnesses in this case and the fact that many are in different locations add to the cost of securing their attendance,even if they were willing to appear in texas.see seguros comercial americas,de american president lines.in this case,this expense and the absence of any texas witnesses contributes to finding that this factor weighs in favor of dismissal.
the ability to view the premises 
the next private interest factor,the ability to view the premises,can only weigh in favor of dismissal.this factor,however,seems unlikely to play an important role and is given scant weight.
other practical factors that make trial easy,expeditious,and inexpensive 
a court is to consider practical factors,including the ability to implead other entities.see piper aircraft,at.the parties dispute whether bancomer is likely to implead any third party.bancomer argues that it may need to implead the judicial administrator and other parties dtex identified as having played a role in delaying its ability to assert its rights to the equipment.a defendant inability to implead a third party is not dispositive,see lehman humphrey cayman,cir,but judicial economy favors resolution of all claims in one trial.litigating all the claims in mexico avoids a scenario in which bancomer must pursue claims for contribution against a third party in mexico while defending the action against dtex in the united states,without compulsory process to obtain key witnesses.see morse sun int l hotels,wl at.if bancomer was found liable in this court,it could seek contribution from third parties in mexico,but this approach runs the risk of inconsistent verdicts.see piper aircraft,at.see iragorri,at inability to implead favors dismissal.this factor weighs only slightly toward dismissal,given the uncertainty that any impleader will be necessary.
