opinion of the court 
richard rosenau claims that a letter he received from unifund corporation unifund ccr partners unifund was deceptive under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.the district court granted unifund motion for judgment on the pleadings.rosenau appeals,arguing that the letter was deceptive because it implied that it came from an attorney and it stated that it came from the legal department.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse the district court order and remand.
unifund purchases old consumer debt.it buys the debt from credit card companies in the form of data files that contain information on thousands of consumer accounts.unifund proprietary software then runs queries to determine which accounts unifund will pursue for collection and which it will resell.once the system has flagged the accounts that will be collected,another automated process generates letters that are mailed to consumers to begin the collection efforts.unifund mails about of these collection letters each day.
on january,unifund sent a collection letter to richard rosenau.the letter demanded payment on a citibank credit card account that had a balance of over.it stated 
if we are unable to resolve this issue within days we may refer this matter to an attorney in your area for legal consideration.if suit is filed and if judgment is rendered against you,we will collect payment utilizing all methods legally available to us,subject to your rights below this communication is from a debt collector.this is an attempt to collect a debt 
in place of a signature,the bottom of the letter read 
legal department 
unifund vice president of legal operations supervises the legal department six employees.neither the vice president nor the legal department employees are lawyers.the legal department maintains a network of contract attorneys throughout the united states to whom it forwards claims for litigation.four of the six legal department employees are legal liaisons who place accounts with attorneys in the network,handle daily disputes,provide documents for litigation,and act as witnesses when necessary.the remaining two legal department employees are a project coordinator and an administrative assistant.
the vice president of legal operations manages the flow of letters out of the office.according to his deposition testimony,his function is akin to controlling a spigot.no one reviews the consumers files before the letters are mailed.
unifund employs a small number of attorneys.three handle internal litigation,that is,litigation against consumers in certain states where unifund does not use contract attorneys.in addition,unifund employs an attorney as general counsel.none of these attorneys work in the legal department.
rosenau filed a class complaint against unifund in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.he alleged that unifund violated the fdcpa by sending him a letter that falsely created the impression that it was reviewed or sent by a legal department,as he defines that term,or by a lawyer.the parties engaged in discovery.unifund then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,or in the alternative,for summary judgment.at the same time,rosenau filed a motion for class certification.
the district court granted unifund motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed rosenau complaint.rosenau unifund,wl,at the court stated that it need not treat unifund motion as one for summary judgment because judgment on the pleadings was appropriate.id.at.the court concluded that the letter was not deceptive and that it would be bizarre or idiosyncratic to infer that it came from an attorney.id.at.
for the sake of completeness,the court also ruled on rosenau motion for class certification.id.at.the court concluded that rosenau satisfied the requirements for class certification,but dismissed the motion nonetheless because of its dismissal of the complaint.id.at.rosenau filed this timely appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction under,and d.we have jurisdiction under.we have explained our standard of review as follows 
our standard of review of a motion for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c is plenary.under rule c,judgment will not be granted unless the movant clearly establishes that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.in reviewing the grant of a rule c motion,we must view the facts presented in the pleadings and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

in,congress enacted the fdcpa,to address abusive debt collection practices.brown card serv,cir.it is a remedial statute that we construe broadly,so as to effect its purpose.id.the fdcpa prohibits the use of deception in the process 
a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.without limiting the general application of the foregoing,the following conduct is a violation of this section the false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.
l communications potentially giving rise to claims under the fdcpa should be analyzed from the perspective of the least sophisticated debtor.brown,at.this standard is lower than the standard of a reasonable debtor.wilson quadramed,cir.a communication that would not deceive or mislead a reasonable debtor might still deceive or mislead the least sophisticated debtor.brown,at.we use the least sophisticated debtor standard in order to effectuate the basic purpose of the fdcpa to protect all consumers,the gullible as well as the shrewd id.quoting clomon jackson,cir.
although the least sophisticated debtor standard is a low standard,it prevents liability for bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations of collection notices by preserving a quotient of reasonableness and presuming a basic level of understanding and willingness to read with care.quadramed,at quoting clomon,at.
rosenau argues that unifund debt collection letter violates because it is likely to lead the least sophisticated debtor to believe that it came from an attorney.unifund responds that the letter is not deceptive because it is not from a law firm and is not signed by an attorney.the district court agreed with unifund position.however,the district court reading of the letter is unconvincing in light of the procedural posture of this case and the least sophisticated debtor standard.
there are no precedential third circuit opinions that discuss the legality of a letter under.the narrower question in this case,whether a letter from a legal department that employs no lawyers is misleading under,appears to be an issue of first impression in the federal courts of appeals.to determine whether the district court properly granted judgment on the pleadings in unifund favor,we look to our opinions that discuss collection letters that were alleged to violate other subsections of the fdcpa.
a debt collection letter is deceptive where it can be reasonably read to have two or more different meanings,one of which is inaccurate.brown,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in quadramed,we concluded that a collection letter was not deceptive under at.the letter began our client has placed your account with us for immediate collection.we shall afford you the opportunity to pay this bill immediately and avoid further action against you.id.at.a few paragraphs later,the letter provided the notice required by unless you notify this office within days after receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of this debt or any portion thereof,this office will assume this debt is valid.id.
we determined that the opening paragraphs of the letter did not overshadow or contradict the validation notice such that the least sophisticated debtor would be confused about his righ
