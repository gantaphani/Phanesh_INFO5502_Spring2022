appellant lives in fairfax county,virginia.in september,she opened a checking account with suntrust bank suntrust,a bank with thousands of branches and atms across much of the south and along the east coast.in the course of opening the account,appellant signed an agreement stating that her banking transactions shall be governed by the rules and regulations for this account.those rules and regulations include a provision addressing the account holder overdraft liability 
you are liable for all amounts charged to your account,whether by offset,overdraft,lien or fees.if we take court action or commence an arbitration proceeding against you to collect such amounts,you will also be liable for court or arbitration costs,other charges or fees,and attorney fees up to percent,or an amount as permitted by law,of the amount owed to us.
as of september,the account held no more than a few hundred dollars.nevertheless,appellant cut herself a check for she cashed the check at a suntrust branch,resulting in a sizeable overdraft.
after its own attempts to collect the money proved unsuccessful,suntrust hired a maryland law firm,mitchell rubenstein associates mr a to bring a debt collection suit.mr a filed suit on suntrust behalf in the general district court of fairfax county,virginia,on june.instead of drafting a detailed complaint,mr a utilized a warrant in debt,a standardized pleading that the virginia courts make available to creditors this standardized pleading provides,in relevant part

appellees filled in the blanks to indicate that appellant owed,plus percent interest in costs and in attorneys fees.
to support the warrant in debt,appellees submitted to the court an affidavit of account,in which a suntrust officer affirmed that t he amount of nine thousand four hundred ninety and dollars plus reasonable attorney fees of and the costs of this proceeding is justly due and owing from debt to suntrust.in addition,mr a submitted its own affidavit,dated june,in support of the claim for attorneys fees.in that document the june revesman affidavit,attorney cynthia kaplan revesman revesman requested an award of percent sic as a just and reasonable fee,which is equal to or less than the actual arrangement with client in this case.id.at.her affidavit attests that her billable rate was per hour and that she spent approximately one hour preparing the warrant in debt.the affidavit further states that revesman will require an additional hours for court appearances and travel,and that,based on similar cases she has handled during her career,counsel anticipates at least additional hours in order to satisfy its judgment by execution.id.
later,in response to a court order,appellees filed a bill of particulars outlining the allegations against appellant.among the exhibits accompanying this filing were two monthly statements for appellant checking account.appellant social security number appeared on both statements.when,in december,appellant attorney complained about the exposure of his client personal financial information,the judge agreed to have the number redacted.
the general district court entered judgment in the sum demanded for the plaintiff on the evidence.later,at a separate hearing,counsel for suntrust submitted an updated affidavit supporting the claim for attorneys fees.in this new affidavit,dated february,revesman reported that she had expended approximately hours on the case.she provided a breakdown of how she spent those hours and,based on that breakdown,calculated a billable amount of.the court explaining that it been the practice of this court normally to award less than what counsel ask s for opted to award only because i think that minimally more than that was spent in this entire matter.id.at.
appellant response to her defeat in the collection suit was to file a complaint against suntrust and mr a in circuit court in montgomery county,maryland.her amended complaint asserted seven claims in all,of which five are at issue in this appeal the first four counts challenged appellees efforts to recover attorneys fees in the virginia suit 
count i accused appellees of violating the maryland consumer debt collection act mcdca,which bars debt collectors from attempting to enforce a right with knowledge that the right does not exist,com.law 
count ii accused suntrust of unfair or deceptive conduct in violation of the maryland consumer protection act mcpa,com.law,a 
count iii accused mr a of making false representations in violation of the fdcpa,and 
count iv accused mr a of using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt that was neither expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt n or permitted by law,in violation of the fdcpa.
lastly,appellant sought to recover for the disclosure of her social security number.specifically 
count vi accused mr a of violating by failing to redact appellant social security number from the bank statements accompanying the bill of particulars.
appellees removed the case to the united states district court for the district of maryland.there,suntrust and mr a separately filed motions to dismiss all claims.broadly speaking,these motions argued that appellant amended complaint did not state a claim.in addition,mr a argued that the rooker feldman doctrine deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the fdcpa claims in counts iii and iv.
preliminarily,the district court rejected mr a rooker feldman argument,reasoning that counts iii and iv were not barred because they do not challenge the propriety of the virginia court order granting a fee award.elyazidi suntrust bank,wl,at.having assured itself of its jurisdiction,the court proceeded to dismiss all of appellant claims pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
first,the court concluded that counts iii and iv,brought under the fdcpa,failed because the warrant in debt and accompanying affidavits did nothing more than supply an estimate of the attorneys fees that would be due at the conclusion of the case,in compliance with virginia state court procedure.see elyazidi,wl,at.next,the court explained that count vi could not survive because the disclosure of appellant social security number was,in all likelihood,a mere oversight that was cured by redaction of the relevant documents.id.at.
finally,the district court acknowledged that,having dismissed all federal claims,it was under no obligation to consider counts i and ii,the state law claims.see elyazidi,wl,at citing c.nevertheless,the court opted to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims i n the interest of judicial economy.id.the court proceeded to dismiss counts i and ii on the ground that the maryland statutes have no extraterritorial effect.id.at.
on appeal,appellees renew their argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over counts iii and iv.the limits of subject matter jurisdiction pose a threshold issue that this court must investigate before addressing the merits of appellant claims.jones am.postal workers union,cir.
appellees argue that the rooker feldman doctrine bars counts iii and iv because these counts both challenging mr a pursuit of attorneys fees in state court are premised on the theory that the state court erred when it awarded suntrust attorney fees in the judgment.appellees br.generally speaking,the rooker feldman doctrine provides that jurisdiction to review state court decisions lies not with the lower federal courts,but exclusively with superior state courts and,ultimately,the united states supreme court.friedman,dunlap,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,a federal court is not stripped of its jurisdiction simply because the claim challenges conduct that was previously examined in a state court action.rather,the restriction on the federal district courts jurisdiction is confined to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d emphasis supplied see davani.dep t of,cir.
the instant appeal poses no challenge to the virginia court judgment.that judgment reflected a determination that suntrust counsel was entitled to in fees for the hours of work put into the case.appellant complaint takes no issue with those figures.her argument,rather,is that appellees representations were unlawful because they insinuated that she owed money that,to that point,suntrust counsel had not yet earned.we hold,therefore,that her claims are independent from the virginia court judgment,and that the rooker feldman doctrine did not bar the federal district court from hearing them.
we proceed now to the merits of appellant arguments in this appeal.
we begin with counts iii and iv,which allege that the virginia warrant in debt and accompanying affidavits wrongfully represented that appellant owed in attorneys fees an amount exactly equal to percent of appellant debt to suntrust.appellant argues that these representations were wrongful in two ways.first,she says,suntrust rules and regulations merely capped her liability for attorneys fees at percent.second,she argues that she could not have owed the full percent at the time appellees filed the virginia suit because,to that point,mr a had not yet performed the hours of work necessary to justify the award.count iii alleges that the firm statements were false or misleading representations in violation of.count iv condemns the statements as an unfair or unconscionable means of debt collection in violation of.
the district court dismissed both counts for failure to state a claim.we review the district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,accepting as true the complaint factual allegations and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.warren sessoms rogers,cir.to survive a rule b motion,the allegations must advance the plaintiff claim across the line from conceivable to plausible.walters mcmahen,cir quoting bell atl.twombly,d.appellant,we conclude,has failed to propel any of her claims across that line.
pursuant to,a debt may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.it is unlawful to make a false representation of a the character,amount,or legal status of any debt or b any services rendered or compensation which may be lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt.id.to violate the statute,a representation must be material,see warren,at,which is to say,it must be important in the sense that it could objectively affect the least sophisticated consumer decisionmaking.powell palisades acquisition xvi,llc,wl,at cir.similarly,in assessing whether a debt collector representation is misleading,we view the representation from the vantage of the least sophisticated consumer.russell absolute collection,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,we consider how a naive consumer would interpret the statement.united states fin,cir.however,we do not give credit to bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations we assume a quotient of reasonableness and a basic level of understanding and willingness to read with care.id.
there is no denying that,as a general matter,litigation activity is subject to the fdcpa.sayyed wolpoff abramson,cir see heintz jenkins,d holding that a car loan borrower could pursue fdcpa claims against the lender counsel for falsely asserting in a letter that the borrower owed money for a particularly broad substitute insurance policy on the car.as always,though,we must view the allegedly false or misleading representations in context.here,where the debt collector sought no more than applicable law allowed and explained via affidavit that the figure was merely an estimate of an amount counsel expected to earn in the course of the litigation the representations can not be considered misleading under.
the september agreement which appellant signed authorized suntrust to request up to percent of any amount owed to the bank.appellees request for in attorneys fees fell within the percent cap.the justification for requesting the maximum amount permissible under contract was supplied in the june revesman affidavit,which detailed the number of hours suntrust counsel expected to devote to the suit.the affidavit explained that the bulk of those hours would be spent endeavoring to satisfy the judgment by execution.though appellant complaint alleges that this estimate had no basis in fact,appellant counsel conceded at oral argument that he had no evidence to support this allegation.
it is true that the standardized form uses the word owe,id.at,suggesting perhaps that the requested attorneys fees were presently due.this language,however,can not be read in isolation.taking the june revesman affidavit into consideration,it is abundantly clear that the prayer for attorneys fees was an estimate of an amount the debtor would owe at the conclusion of the case.the affidavit clarifies that suntrust counsel was simply request ing an award of percent sic as a just and reasonable fee.emphasis supplied.it further explains that suntrust counsel had spent one hour on the case to date,and that counsel anticipated spending at least more hours pursuing and executing a judgment in suntrust favor.under the circumstances,any consumer no matter how sophisticated should have understood the nature of appellees request.
in sum,we hold that appellees prayer for attorneys fees can not,as a matter of law,be a false,deceptive,or misleading representation under.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment that count iii fails to state a claim.
count iv,alleging a violation of,fails for similar reasons.section condemns the use of unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt,and provides a list of proscribed conduct.subsection,which appellant invokes,prohibits t he collection of any amount including any interest,fee,charge,or expense incidental to the principal obligation unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.id.
appellant complaint alleges that the request for in attorneys fees was unauthorized because neither the agreement nor applicable law permit recovery of attorney fees for services not performed.this argument has no merit.by signing the september agreement,appellant agreed that,in the event of a court action to recover a debt,she would be contractually liable for attorney fees up to percent of the amount owed to the bank.id.at.plainly,this agreement authorized suntrust to seek attorneys fees in the virginia debt collection suit.though under virginia law an award of attorneys fees must be reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case,lee mulford,internal quotation marks omitted,it was entirely proper for suntrust to estimate an appropriate fee within the limits prescribed in the september agreement.indeed,the commonwealth encourages plaintiffs to include such estimates when filling out the standardized form,which supplies a blank space for attorneys fees along with the spaces provided for the alleged debt and court costs.though we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff,owens balt.city state attorneys office,cir internal quotation marks omitted,the only reasonable inference here is that appellees sought to enforce their contractual rights in compliance with state court procedure.to claim,as appellant does,th
