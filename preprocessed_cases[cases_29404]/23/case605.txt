in this case we consider the constitutionality of the provision found in a a of the fair credit reporting act fcra,et.the district court,finding that the provision is unconstitutionally vague and excessive,dismissed the complaints with prejudice.for the reasons stated below,we vacate the rulings of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
a.the fcra 
the fcra endeavors to ensure fair and accurate credit reporting,promote efficiency in the banking system,and protect consumer privacy,safeco ins.of america burr,d,by,among other things,compelling merchants to adopt procedures to safeguard consumers credit information.see b.in,congress passed the fair and accurate credit transactions act facta,stat codified at g,amending the fcra.facta,which is aimed at protecting consumers from identity theft,provides that no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.g 
as part of its framework,the fcra authorizes consumers to bring private suits for willful violations of its terms originally,the fcra provided actual and punitive damages for willful violations.in,congress amended this section,adding that victims of willful violations could receive any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or statutory damages of not less than and not more than.pub,div.a,title ii,subtitle d,b,stat.codified at a a emphasis added.in addition,the fcra still allows victims of willful violations to receive punitive damages.see a.
the fcra was further amended by the credit and debit card receipt clarification act of clarification act,stat.codified at d,which was signed into law on june,a few days after the district court decision in the instant case.the clarification act applies to transactions that took place between december,and june,exempting merchants from liability for willful violations of the fcra in cases where the merchant printed credit card expiration dates on customer receipts,but otherwise complied with facta.id.the clarification act applies retroactively to all cases pending as of the time of its enactment.id.this means that to recover for willful facta violations that occurred prior to the enactment of the clarification act,a customer must prove that the merchant printed more than the last five digits of the customer card number on an receipt.simply proving that the expiration date was printed will not suffice.
procedural history 
bobbie harris and julie best grimes collectively the plaintiffs filed separate cases in district court against mexican specialty foods,mexican specialty foods and rave motion pictures,birmingham,llc respectively collectively the defendants,alleging that the defendants willfully violated facta,and seeking statutory damages,punitive damages,costs of suit,and attorney fees,pursuant to a.the plaintiffs complaints also seek class certification on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the proposed classes include every customer who engaged in a credit or debit card transaction with one of the defendants after the date facta became effective and whose receipt included more than the last five digits of the customer card number its expiration date 
the defendants filed motions for summary judgment,alleging that the fcra provision is unconstitutional.the united states the government intervened as a plaintiff pursuant to a to defend the constitutionality of the statute.
the district court issued a single order declaring the fcra provision unconstitutionally vague on its face and unconstitutionally excessive on its face and as applied to the defendants,in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause the claims were dismissed with prejudice.the plaintiffs appealed and we consolidated the cases for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the merits of the excessiveness challenge are not ripe for adjudication the statute is not unconstitutionally vague on its face and the statute is not unconstitutionally excessive on its face.we therefore vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo questions concerning our subject matter jurisdiction,including ripeness.elend basham,cir.we review the constitutionality of a challenged statute de novo.konikov orange county,cir.
iii.discussion 
we first address whether the instant case is ripe for adjudication.ripeness doctrine originate s from the constitution article iii requirement that the jurisdiction of the federal courts be limited to actual cases and controversies.elend,at.for a court to have jurisdiction,the claim must be sufficiently mature,and the issues sufficiently defined and concrete,to permit effective decisionmaking by the court.cheffer reno,cir.the ripeness doctrine protects federal courts from engaging in speculation or wasting their resources through the review of potential or abstract disputes.digital,city of plantation,cir.a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.texas united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.
because the question of ripeness depends on the timing of the adjudication of a particular issue,see atlanta gas light fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir,it applies differently to facial and challenges.a facial challenge asserts that a law always operates unconstitutionally,black law dictionary ed emphasis added therefore,a facial challenge will succeed only if the statute could never be applied in a constitutional manner.da mortgage,city of miami beach,cir.in the context of a facial challenge,a purely legal claim is presumptively ripe for judicial review because it does not require a developed factual record.see treasury employees union chertoff,solantic,llc city of neptune beach,cir roe ogden,cir.an challenge,by contrast,addresses whether a statute is unconstitutional on the facts of a particular case or to a particular party.black law dictionaryy at.because such a challenge asserts that a statute can not be constitutionally applied in particular circumstances,it necessarily requires the development of a factual record for the court to consider.see siegel lepore,cir.
in the instant case,the defendants facial challenges to the fcra are sufficiently ripe for adjudication.the district court found that the statute provides no guidance for juries in determining whether to award damages at the upper or lower end of the to range.as such,it always leaves damages to the whim of the jury and permits inconsistent,willy nilly verdicts.the district court concluded that these attributes render a a unconstitutionally vague.moreover,the court found that because a a provision is expressly not compensatory in nature,its verdicts will always be unconstitutionally excessive.although the district court issued its order prior to trial,we may consider the merits of its two facial rulings because they do not require a detailed examination of the facts of the instant case.
the excessiveness challenge is more problematic.when a damages award is punitive in nature,it is subject to constitutional excessiveness review.see johansen combustion eng g,cir.typically,excessiveness review occurs after a jury has delivered a damages award.see,state farm mut.ins.campbell,d finding that the jury punitive damages award of million was unconstitutionally excessive action marine,cont l carbon,cir upholding a jury punitive damages award of kemp am,cir reducing a jury punitive damages award of to.in its order,however,the district court employed a series of assumptions and found that,based on these assumptions,any verdict awarded by the jury would necessarily be unconstitutionally excessive.the court assumed that the defendants would not oppose class certification in each case,the class would be certified and would include all individuals proposed by the plaintiffs none of the plaintiffs suffered any actual harm and the plainti
