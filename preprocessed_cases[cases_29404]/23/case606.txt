joseph leblanc is a resident of tampa,florida,and a consumer within the meaning of the federal fair debt collection practices act fdcpa and the florida consumer collection practices act fccpa the debt sought to be collected is a consumer debt within the meaning of the acts.unifund is a general partnership organization incorporated under the laws of ohio and is in the business of purchasing and collecting consumer debt.as such,unifund is a debt collector for purposes of the fdcpa credit card receivables fund,ccrf and zb limited partners zb are unifund general partners.aside from the entities relationship with unifund,ccrf and zb are not directly involved in the debt collection activity being challenged.none of the defendants were registered as consumer collection agencies with the state of florida

this communication is from a debt collector.this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.
although leblanc later testified in his deposition that certain aspects of the letter were incorrect,leblanc never took any steps to contact unifund or dispute the crux of the letter.unifund made no additional effort to contact leblanc and filed suit in state court,presumably alleging leblanc contractual obligation to satisfy the debt 
leblanc initiated the instant federal cause of action alleging multiple violations of the fdcpa and fccpa.for summary judgment were filed.the district court granted unifund motion on all of the fccpa claims and granted leblanc partial summary judgment under two provisions of the fdcpa,specifically and.the district court opined that unifund violated the fdcpa because unifund failed to register as an consumer collection agency with the state of florida,as required by the fccpa.the district court held that unifund could not legally sue leblanc to collect the debt without first registering with florida office of financial regulation as required by section of the fccpa.because the court also viewed the dunning as a threat to take legal action,it held that unifund violated the fdcpa for threat ening to take action that could not legally be taken and for using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt.and.

cognizability of fdcpa action for violation of fccpa 
as a matter of first impression in our circuit,we consider whether a federal cause of action pursuant to section of the fdcpa for threatening to take an action that can not legally be taken is cognizable when premised upon failure to register as a consumer collection agency as required by state law,namely,section of the fccpa see discussion,infra,section iii,b,iii determining whether leblanc has pled a federal cause of action for violating state law provides an opportunity to consider the objectives of the fdcpa and the fccpa,as well as the interplay between these state and federal statutes.in light of the statutes congruent purposes,we affirm the district court on this issue and now hold that violation of the fccpa may support a federal cause of action under the fdcpa.
in enacting the fdcpa,congress sought to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e brown budget,cir per curiam.accordingly,the fdcpa prohibits debt collectors from using any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt as well as the use of unfair or unconscionable means of collection.e and.the fdcpa does not ordinarily require proof of intentional violation and,as a result,is described by some as a strict liability statute.see ellis solomon and solomon,cir.available remedies under the fdcpa include actual damages,the potential for additional damages up to subject to the court discretion,and reasonable costs and attorney fees.a.
similarly,the fccpa,florida consumer protection statute,was enacted as a means of regulating the activities of consumer collection agencies within the state.the fccpa is a laudable legislative attempt to curb what the legislature evidently found to be a series of abuses in the area of relations.jur d consumer.the fccpa also defines and protects an individual right to privacy with regards to consumer collections practices in the state.see generally,laughlin household bank,so d.dist.
under the fccpa,no person shall engage in business in this state as a consumer collection agency without first registering in accordance with this part sections and and thereafter maintaining a valid registration.stat.and.section of the fccpa does not itself provide a private right of action.stat.identifying types of fccpa violations that give rise to a private cause of action and omitting.despite the unavailability of a state cause of action,section of the fccpa provides that it is a misdemeanor for any person not exempt from registering to engage in collecting consumer debts in this state without first registering.stat.
in terms of the relationship between the fdcpa and state consumer protection laws like the fccpa,the fdcpa does not annul,alter,affect,or exempt any person or entity subject to its provisions from complying with the laws of any state with respect to debt collection practices,except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the fdcpa see see also hartman great seneca fin,cir describing the fdcpa as extraordinarily broad.this is entirely consistent with the fccpa,which expressly provides 
nothing in this part shall be construed to limit or restrict the continued applicability of the federal fair debt collection practices act to consumer collection practices in this state.this part is in addition to the requirements and regulations of the federal act.in the event of any inconsistency between any provision of this part and any provision of the federal act,the provision which is more protective of the consumer or debtor shall prevail.
stat.emphasis added.the fccpa also makes clear that its remedies are cumulative to other sanctions and enforcement provisions for any violation by an consumer debt collector.stat.
relevant to the question presented here,the fdcpa and fccpa have certain parallels.for instance,section of the fccpa prohibits a debt collector from asserting the existence of a legal right when such person knows that the right does not exist.see.stat.compare.at least one federal district court has held that no state cause of action exists under of the fccpa for failure to comply with the registration requirement of.see conner bcc fin.mgt,d.unifund contends that because an analogous provision of the fccpa does not itself support a private right of action for failure to register,then to premise a federal cause of action upon the same conduct and legal theory would undermine or circumvent the state consumer protection scheme.we disagree.
the fccpa unequivocally states its provide the consumer with the most protection possible under either the state or federal statute.see.stat.in the event of any inconsistency the provision which is more protective of the consumer or debtor shall prevail.further,the fact that the fccpa deemed its remedies cumulative reveals that the florida legislature contemplated dual an debt collector could quite possibly be subject to the sanctions and enforcement provisions of both of the various states or the fdcpa.finally,we attribute significant weight to florida chosen means of enforcement.the florida legislature determination that a debt collector failure to register under.stat.and subsequent pursuit of unauthorized debt collection activity is a misdemeanor criminal act demonstrates the seriousness with which the state of florida intends to address violations of the fccpa.unifund argument to the contrary is not persuasive.we therefore hold that a violation of the fccpa for failure to register may,in fact,support a federal cause of action under section of the fdcpa for threatening to take an action it could not legally take.
as explained herein,we do not hold that all debt collector actions in violation of state law constitute per se violations of the fdcpa.rather,the conduct or communication at issue must also violate the relevant provision of the fdcpa see wade reg l credit ass n,cir ferguson credit mgmt.control,d.the fdcpa was designed to provide basic,overarching rules for debt collection activities it was not meant to convert every violation of a state debt collection law into a federal violation.only those collection activities that use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means,including t he threat to take any action that can not legally be taken under state law,will also constitute fdcpa violations.carlson first revenue assurance,cir see generally,beler blatt,hasenmiller,leibsker moore,llc,cir section creates its own rules or authorizes courts to do so it does not so much as hint at being an enforcement mechanism for other rules of state and federal law.
we turn now to the merits of leblanc claim.
section of the fdcpa prohibits debt collectors from using any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.sparks phillips cohen,d,cir explaining the gist of as a requirement that any aspect of a debt collector explicit or implied that has the purpose or effect of making a debtor more likely to respond is,in fact,true.more specifically,within the list of potential violations of section,subsection prohibits a debt collector from threatening to take action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.
as an initial matter,unifund is subject to the fdcpa.it is undisputed that unifund is a debt collector seeking to recover from leblanc on an outstanding consumer debt.in addition,in light of the state court lawsuit unifund brought to recover on the debt,we summarily reject unifund contention that it has not engaged in collection activity with regards to leblanc as a result,our focus is on whether unifund engaged in any practice prohibited by the fdcpa.
the next issue then is whether,under the fdcpa,unifund dunning letter constitutes a threat to take action which could not legally be,to commence legal proceedings.our framework for analysis is.first,we consider whether the language of the letter constitutes a threat for purposes of.see jeter credit bureau,cir.if so,we consider whether the action threatened is one which could be legally taken.id.
for reasons explained herein,we hold that in the analysis of the debt collection practices at issue here,first and foremost,the question whether unifund dunning letter to leblanc constitutes a threat for purposes of presents a genuine issue of material fact that precludes judgment as a matter of law.
i.the consumer standard 
we employ the consumer standard to evaluate whether a debt collector communication violates of the fdcpa jeter,at.in adopting the consumer standard,we took into account the purposes of the fdcpa,the general jurisprudence concerning of the federal trade commission act ftc act and the prior ftc enforcement in the debt collection area.jeter,at.because we thought the fdcpa sought to grant consumers more protection,we viewed the fdcpa as an expansion of the protections provided by previously existing federal legislation and regulation.id.accordingly,we rejected the reasonable consumer standard in favor of the consumer standard 
because we believe that congress intended the standard under the fdcpa to be the same as that enunciated in the relevant ftc cases and because we believe that the fdcpa purpose of protecting consumers is best served by a definition of deceive that looks to the tendency of language to mislead the least sophisticated recipients of a debt collector letters,we adopt the exposition press standard of least sophisticated consumer 
jeter,at exposition press,ftc,cir.
the consumer standard is consistent with basic principles.jeter,at internal citations omitted clomon jackson,cir the basic purpose of the consumer standard is to ensure that the fdcpa protects all consumers,the gullible as well as the shrewd.as we discussed the ftc act and its jurisprudence in jeter,we noted 
that law was not made for the protection of experts,but for the vast multitude which includes the ignorant,the unthinking,and the credulous and t he fact that a false statement may be obviously false to those who are trained and experienced does not change its character,nor take away its power to deceive others less experienced.there is no duty resting upon a citizen to suspect the honesty of those with whom he transacts business.laws are made to protect the trusting as well as the suspicious.

ii.determining the threshold issue under section whether unifund letter constitutes a for the jury 
determining whether unifund letter could reasonably be perceived as a threat to take legal action under the consumer standard in the circumstances of this case is best left to jury decision.in the summary judgment context,the burden of persuasion is on leblanc to prove that no reasonable jury,viewing the letter through the eyes of a consumer,and making all reasonable inferences in unifund favor,could find that the letter was merely informative as opposed to threatening in this case,if the dunning letter,read as a whole,is not construed as a threat to take legal action,leblanc fdcpa claim under fails regardless of the registration issue.
the fdcpa does not define what constitutes a threat.black law dictionary defines threat as a communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another or another property or an indication of an approaching menace such as the threat of bankruptcy.black law dictionary ed united states silva,cir where a term is not defined within statute analysis begins with term plain and unambiguous meaning.additionally,before enactment of the fdcpa,t he ftc and the federal courts consistently held that it is a deceptive practice to falsely represent that unpaid debts would be referred to a lawyer for immediate legal action.jeter,at internal citations omitted.indeed,in a different context,we explained that a reasonable jury could find potentially deceptive or false use of threats to recommend legal action as violative of.id.at discussing the substantive differences between sections and and of the fdcpa.
in this case,the parties heartily disagree about the nature of the letter,more particularly,whether the letter is in any way threatening.the first paragraph of the dunning letter explains that unifund purchased leblanc charged off debt and provides the particulars of the debt it seeks to collect upon.the second paragraph includes the critical language 
if we are unable to resolve this issue within days we may refer this matter to an attorney in your area for legal consideration.if suit is filed and if judgment is rendered against you,we will collect payment utilizing all methods legally available to us,subject to your rights below.
exhibit b emphasis added.the third paragraph directs leblanc to a website that may be used to resolve his account.special instructions for making payment,how,where,when,are included.the next paragraph contains the validation of debt notice and procedures for disputing the debt required by statute.see generally.then the letter is expressly identified as a communication from a debt collector and leblanc is told 
this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.
the final paragraph reads,please feel free to contact us and provides a telephone number and a website.as already noted,the letter is from unifund legal department.at the very bottom of the letter,an asterisk directs the consumer to see the reverse side for important information regarding his rights.
in our view,reasonable jurors applying the consumer standard could disagree as to the inferences to be drawn from unifund letter to leblanc.the letter clearly serves to inform the.the letter conveys a significant amount of information to the recipient,requests action or response from the debtor,and uses the word please throughout.in terms of consequences,it reads if we are unable to resolve this issue within days we may refer this matter to an attorney in your area for legal consideration.read literally,the letter merely advises that legal action is possible,that it is possible for unifund to refer the matter to an attorney for consideration,that a lawsuit is only one possible outcome or result.moreover,while there is no express statement regarding what is meant by resolve,the fact that this option is set apart from the mechanics of making payment tends to show that something less than immediate payment in full may be acceptable.a consumer could read the letter as offering at least two options for responding.taking the most literal reading,a reasonable juror could find the dunning letter was more informative than threatening and did not threaten imminent legal action.
however,a reasonable juror applying the consumer standard could also view this letter as either an overt or threat of suit.see.order at.unifund mistakenly relies on the use of conditional language such as if and may in an effort to safeguard the letter from being construed as threatening.despite the conditional language,a reasonable juror could read the dunning letter as intimating that a lawsuit will follow immediately after the end of the day grace period.more significantly,in the event of suit,the tone of the letter shifts to more forceful language if suit is filed and if judgment is rendered against you,we will collect payment utilizing all methods legally available to us this portion of the letter supports a reasonable inference that unifund is threatening leblanc with legal action,that it is unifund intent to deprive leblanc of his personal property.finally,although not determinative,another hint or suggestion of intimidation is that the letter is sent from unifund legal department.see,rosenau unifund,cir analyzing identical language and discussing different inferences that could be drawn from fact that collection letter is sent from legal department,including inference that an attorney is already involved 
in jeter we explained that where the parties reasonably disagree on the proper inferences that can be drawn from the debt collector letter,resolution is for the trier of for the court on summary judgment.see jeter,at.for these reasons,this issue is one best submitted to the finder of fact 
iii.as an unregistered consumer debt collector unifund could not legally bring suit against leblanc within the state of florida 
we now consider the second part of the analysis,namely,whether unifund,in its letter,threatened action which could not legally be taken.determining whether unifund could legally initiate a lawsuit against leblanc implicates the underlying florida state statute allegedly violated by unifund.see.stat.
the fccpa requires consumer collection agencies to register as such in accordance with before engaging in debt collection activity within the state.stat.unifund argues that it is not subject to the fccpa registration requirement as an consumer debt collector for various reasons.we disagree.an consumer debt collector is defined by the fccpa as 
any person whose business activities in this state involve both collecting or attempting to collect consumer debt from debtors located in this state by means of interstate communication originating from outside this state and soliciting consumer debt accounts for collection from creditors who have a business presence in this state.for purposes of this subsection,a creditor has a business presence in this state if either the creditor or an affiliate or subsidiary of the creditor has an office in this state.
stat.thus,pursuant to the statutory definition,the business activities of an consumer debt collector must involve both collecting or attempting to collect consumer debt and soliciting consumer debt accounts for collection from creditors who have a business presence within florida.id.consistent with the definition,the fccpa exempts from registration a ny consumer debt collector who does not solicit consumer debt accounts for collection from credit grantors who have a business presence within florida.see.stat.h emphasis added.
unifund business activities clearly involve collecting or attempting to collect consumer debt from debtors located within florida by
