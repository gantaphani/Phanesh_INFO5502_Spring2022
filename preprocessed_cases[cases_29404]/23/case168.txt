opinion of the court 
appellant howard cohen cohen,as plan administrator for the bankruptcy estates of submicron systems corporation,submicron systems,submicron wet process stations,and submicron systems holdings i,jointly and severally,submicron,challenges the sale to an entity created by sunrise capital partners,lp sunrise of submicron assets under b,which authorizes sales of assets other than in the ordinary course of business.sunrise negotiated directly with not submicron creditors before presenting its bid to the district court.these kb mezzanine fund ii,lp kb,equinox investment partners,llc equinox and celerity silicon,llc celerity collectively,the lenders agreed to contribute toward the purchase of submicron assets new capital along with all of their claims in bankruptcy against submicron in exchange for equity in the entity formed by sunrise to acquire the llc akrion.akrion in turn credit bid the full value of the lenders secured claims contributed to it as part of its bid for submicron assets pursuant to k the district court approved the sale in re submicron.
cohen,seeking as plan administrator of the submicron estates to aid unsecured creditors cut out of the deal by the lenders and sunrise,attacks the sale on several fronts.first,he argues that the purportedly secured debt investments made by the lenders and contributed to akrion should have been recharacterized by the district court as equity investments.in the alternative,if the district court did not err in declining to recharacterize the investments as equity,cohen contends that it erred by failing to conclude that the debt was unsecured.even if the district court properly considered the debt secured,cohen challenges the propriety of the district court allowance of the credit bid portion of akrion offer.as a last option,cohen asserts that the district court erred by declining to equitably subordinate the lenders secured claims to those of creditors with inferior claims.for the reasons discussed below,we reject these arguments and affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and procedural posture 
submicron financing 
before its sale in bankruptcy,submicron designed,manufactured and marketed wet benches for use in the semiconductor industry.by,it was experiencing significant financial and operational difficulties.to sustain its operations in the late,submicron secured financing from several financial investment institutions.on november,it entered into a million working capital facility with greyrock business credit greyrock,granting greyrock first priority liens on all of its inventory,equipment,receivables and general intangibles.the next day,submicron raised another million through the issuance of senior subordinated notes the notes to for million and celerity for million secured by liens behind greyrock on substantially all of submicron assets.submicron subsequently issued a third set of notes in the junior notes for million,comprising million of notes and a million note to the boc group.the junior notes were secured but junior to the security for the notes.despite this capital influx,submicron incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year.
a steep downturn in the semiconductor industry made a similarly difficult year for submicron.by august of that year,it was paying substantially all of the interest due on the notes as senior subordinated notes.on december,submicron and greyrock agreed to renew the greyrock line of credit,reducing the maximum funds available from to million and including a million overadvance conditioned on submicron securing an additional million in financing.to satisfy this condition,on december,submicron issued series b notes the notes to for million and celerity for.the notes ranked pari passu with the notes and the interest was deferred until october.submicron incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year,and at year end its liabilities exceeded its assets by million.
submicron financial health did not improve in.by march of that year,its management determined that additional financing would be required to meet the company immediate critical working capital needs.to this end,between march,and june,submicron issued a total of eighteen series notes the tranche one notes for a total of comprising nine notes to totaling and nine notes to celerity totaling.the tranche one notes proved insufficient to keep submicron afloat.as a result,between july,and august,and celerity made periodic payments to submicron the tranche two funding totaling and,respectively.no notes were issued in exchange for the tranche two funding.between the tranche one notes and the tranche two funding collectively,the fundings,and celerity advanced submicron a total of and,respectively.the fundings were recorded as secured debt on submicron filing with the securities and exchange commission.despite the cash infusions,during the first half of submicron incurred a net loss of million.on june,submicron liabilities exceeded its assets by million.
by january,had appointed three members to submicron board of directors.all appointees were either principals or employees of.by june,following resignations of various submicron board members,employees bonaparte liu and robert wickey,and celerity employee mark benham,represented of the board,with submicron ceo david ferran the lone board member not employed by or celerity.
b.the acquisition 
submicron began acquisition discussions with sunrise in july of.by all accounts,it was generally understood that if submicron failed to reach a deal with sunrise,it would be forced to liquidate,leaving secured the exception of pennies on the dollar and unsecured creditors and shareholders with nothing,not submicron management,conducted negotiations with sunrise,developing and agreeing on the terms and financial structure of an acquisition to occur in the context of a prepackaged bankruptcy.
on august,submicron entered into an asset purchase agreement with akrion,the entity created by sunrise to function as the acquisition vehicle.the following day,submicron filed a chapter bankruptcy petition and an associated motion seeking approval of the sale of its assets to sunrise outside the ordinary course of business pursuant to b of the bankruptcy code.
the asset purchase agreement reiterated,inter alia,that and celerity would contribute their secured claims,the notes,the notes and the fundings in order for akrion to credit bid these claims under of the bankruptcy only contingent on the closing of the sale.the agreement also required submicron,at the closing of the sale,to pay immediately to the holders of the fundings.in return,and celerity would receive a interest in akrion received a interest and celerity received a interest.the court and official committee of unsecured creditors the creditors committee were apprised of the terms of this agreement prior to the sale.
at the sale hearing akrion submitted a bid of for submicron.the cash component of the bid totaled and included in cash from akrion,to pay pre and greyrock secured debt,and to cover administrative claims the credit portion of the bid consisted of the outstanding for the notes,the notes,and the fundings all of which and celerity had contributed to akrion,plus in individual secured claims,for a total of.finally,the bid included submicron liabilities that would be assumed by akrion in lease obligations and in other assumed liabilities for a total of.no other bid for submicron assets was made,submicron board and the court both approved akrion bid over the objection of the creditors committee,and on october,the asset sale closed.
on april,the creditors committee brought against the lenders,among others,an adversary proceeding in which it made the claims before us on appeal.cohen was subsequently substituted for the creditors committee.after a bench trial before judge sue robinson in late august,she ruled against cohen,setting out her reasoning in a comprehensive opinion.cohen appeals.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
because the typical reference of bankruptcy cases to bankruptcy courts was withdrawn here by the district court,our appellate jurisdiction stems from,not d.in re pws holding,cir in re marvel entm t group,cir.we review the district court legal determinations de novo,its factual findings for clear error,and its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof.in re pws holding,at citing in re envtl.energy,cir.
iii.recharacterization as equity 
cohen argues that the district court erred by failing to recharacterize the infusion of the fundings as an equity investment.to succeed with this argument,he must demonstrate that the district court abused its discretionary authority or premised its determination on clearly erroneous findings of fact.because he has failed to do so,we affirm the district court recharacterization holding.
recharacterization equitable subordination 
at the outset,it is important to distinguish recharacterization from equitable subordination.both remedies are grounded in bankruptcy courts equitable authority to ensure that substance will not give way to form,that technical considerations will not prevent substantial justice from being done.pepper litton.yet recharacterization and equitable subordination address distinct concerns.equitable subordination is apt when equity demands that the payment priority of claims of an otherwise legitimate creditor be changed to fall behind those of other claimants.see,citicorp venture capital,comm.of creditors holding unsecured claims,cir bayer mascotech,in re autostyle plastics,cir.in contrast,the focus of the recharacterization inquiry is whether a debt actually exists,in re autostyle plastics,at internal quotation marks omitted or,put another way,we ask what is the proper characterization in the first instance of an investment for these reasons,we agree with those courts that have determined that the issues of recharacterization of debt as equity capital and equitable subordination should be treated separately.blasbalg tarro in re hyperion,see,in re autostyle plastics,at explaining that b ecause both recharacterization and equitable subordination are supported by the bankruptcy code and serve different purposes,we join those courts that have concluded that a bankruptcy court has the power to recharacterize a claim from debt to equity and collecting cases aquino black in re atlanticrancher,stating that while once considered solely in conjunction with the doctrine of equitable subordination,bankruptcy courts now consider recharacterization a separate cause of action.
cohen advances both arguments.he argues that the infusion of the fundings is most accurately characterized as an equity recharacterization,in the alternative,that if the infusion is deemed a debt investment,the lenders claims should be equitably subordinated.we turn first to the recharacterization argument,as d etermining an equitable subordination issue prior to determining whether an advance is a loan or an equity investment is similar to taking the cart before the horse.diasonics,ingalls.if a particular advance is a capital contribution,then equitable subordination never comes into play.in re georgetown,at.
recharacterization framework 
in defining the recharacterization inquiry,courts have adopted a variety of tests borrowed from caselaw while these tests undoubtedly include pertinent factors,they devolve to an overarching inquiry the characterization as debt or equity is a court attempt to discern whether the parties called an instrument one thing when in fact they intended it as something else.that intent may be inferred from what the parties say in their contracts,from what they do through their actions,and from the economic reality of the surrounding circumstances.answers lie in facts that confer context.
no mechanistic scorecard suffices.and none should,for kabuki outcomes elude difficult fact patterns.while some cases are easy,a document titled a note calling for payments of sums certain at fixed intervals with interest and these obligations are secured and are partly performed,versus a document issued as a certificate indicating a proportional interest in the enterprise to which the certificate relates,others are hard such as a note with conventional repayment terms yet reflecting an amount proportional to prior equity interests and whose payment terms are ignored.which course a court discerns is typically a commonsense conclusion that the party infusing funds does so as a banker the party expects to be repaid with interest no matter the borrower fortunes therefore,the funds are debt or as an investor the funds infused are repaid based on the borrower fortunes hence,they are equity.form is no doubt a factor,but in the end it is no more than an indicator of what the parties actually intended and acted on.
review of the district court recharacterization holding 
i standard of review 
we must first determine whether the district court recharacterization conclusion is a finding of fact we review for clear error or a conclusion of law over which we exercise plenary review.direct precedent on this issue is lacking but several courts have considered this issue in the tax context.
in tax cases addressing whether for tax purposes a contribution should be treated as debt or equity,courts of appeal are split.the united states courts of appeals for the sixth and ninth circuits have concluded the issue is one of fact to be reviewed for clear error.roth steel tube,at citing smith comm r,cir bauer comm r,cir citing lantz united states,cir.the fifth and eleventh circuit courts of appeals,on the other hand,have held the issue to be primarily one of law subject to de novo review.lane united states in re lane,cir estate of mixon united states,cir in our court,we were called upon to review a debt versus equity determination in the tax context in geftman comm r,cir,but we eschewed entering the thicket of deciding whether we were reviewing a finding of fact or a conclusion of law.see id.at.
as discussed above,the determinative inquiry in classifying advances as debt or equity is the intent of the parties as it existed at the time of the transaction.so framed,we agree with our sixth and ninth circuit colleagues that this is a question of fact that,once resolved by a district court,can not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.lantz,at.
ii the district court determination was not clearly erroneous 
the district court opinion includes ample findings of fact to support its recharacterization determination.because these findings are not clearly erroneous and overwhelmingly support the court decision to characterize the fundings as debt under any framework or test,we affirm its factual determination.
the district court set out numerous facts to support a debt characterization.looking to the lending documents,it found beyond dispute in the record that the name given to the fundings was debt and the fundings had a fixed maturity date and interest rate.in re submicron,at.the court also found evidence of the parties intent to create a debt investment outside the lending documents.for example,it noted that t he notes were recorded as secured debt on submicron sec filing and financing statements.id.at.
the district court could not find,on the other hand,convincing evidence to support an equity investment characterization of the fundings.it rejected cohen argument that the dire financial circumstances surrounding the infusion of the fundings supported an equity characterization.instead,it concluded,with reference to the conflicting testimony and relative credibility of witnesses presented by both parties,that cohen failed to prove that,under submicron dire circumstances,the lenders transactions were improper or unusual as debt investments.id.at.recognizing that w hen a corporation is undercapitalized,a court is more skeptical of purported loans made to it because they may in reality be infusions of capital,id.quoting in re autostyle plastics,at,the district court also noted that when existing lenders make loans to a distressed company,they are trying to protect their existing loans and traditional factors that lenders consider such as capitalization,solvency,collateral,ability to pay cash interest and debt capacity ratios do not apply as they would when lending to a financially healthy company,id.weighing these competing considerations,it did not find submicron undercapitalization greatly supported an equity characterization.id.
similarly,the court found the lenders participation on the submicron board did not,in and of itself,provide support for an equity characterization.again relying on expert testimony,it emphasized that it is not unusual for lenders to have designees on a company board,particularly when the company is a distressed one.id.at.after reviewing conflicting evidence on the issue,the court concluded that cohen did not prove that lenders or their designees controlled or dominated submicron board in any way.id.at.based on these factual determinations,the conclusion was inevitable that the lenders representation on submicron board did not necessarily support an equity characterization.
lastly,the court found unpersuasive cohen argument that submicron failure to issue notes for the tranche two funding should be understood as evidence of the parties understanding that the fundings were,in effect,equity investments.it noted that t he record is clear that submicron accounting department made numerous mistakes and errors when generating notes,concluding that t he fact that notes were generated for some fundings and not others is not sufficient,in and of itself,to recharacterize the fundings as equity.id.at.
in short,the district court found ample evidence to support a debt characterization and little evidence to support a characterization of equity infusion.on the basis of these findings,which comport with the record,it was hardly clear error for the court to conclude that cohen ha d not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the f undings should be recharacterized as equity.id.at.
iv.the fundings were secured debt 
having established that the district court properly concluded the fundings were debt,we turn to cohen assertion that the lenders did not present a valid secured claim.in determining whether claims asserted by creditors in bankruptcy are secured,state law applies.see in re bollinger,cir.cohen concedes that,whether one applies delaware,pennsylvania,california or new york law,the requirements to obtain a security interest are the same.thus each state codification of uniform commercial code and existing in requires a written security agreement in favor of the lender describing the collateral and,for the collateral in question inventory,equipment,receivables and general intangibles,the filing of a properly executed financing statement unless the inventory and equipment are possessed by the lender or its representative,something normally,and here highly,impractical.
cohen contends that the lenders did not comply with state law and thus the requirements for assertion of a secured claim.the main source of contention is that financing statements filed by the lenders only list equinox investment partners,llc,as collateral agent,as the secured party cohen asserts that the listing of equinox solely and not also kb and celerity rendered the financing statement ineffective under the,which stated that a financing statement is sufficient if it gives the names of the debtor and the secured party,is signed by the debtor,gives an address of the secured party from which information concerning the security interest may be obtained,gives a mailing address of the debtor and contains a statement indicating the types,or describing the items,of collateral.official comment to.indicated that article employed a notice filing system whereby financing statements needed only to indicate that a secured party may have a security interest in the collateral described.further inquiry from the parties concerned may be necessary to disclose the complete state of affairs.emphasis added.in this context,t he uniform commercial code does not require that the secured party as listed in a financing statement be a principal creditor and not an agent.indus.packaging prods.fort pitt packaging int l.because the financing statements name both submicron as debtor and equinox as secured party,provide mailing addresses for both entities,and describe the collateral that is subject to the security agreement,we conclude that any interested party would be on notice to communicate with equinox regarding the status of its and its principals interest in submicron assets.this is sufficient for article perfection purposes.id.
we also conclude that,on the record before us,there can be no doubt that kb and celerity were intended secured parties served by their agent,equinox.indeed,in the schedule of liabilities filed with the district court,submicron lists kb and celerity as secured noteholders.the district court found on the basis of overwhelming evidence that kb and celerity were intended secured parties with respect to the fundings and we discern no basis to believe this determination was erroneous.in sum,we conclude that the lenders presented valid secured claims for the fundings.
propriety of credit bid 
having determined that the fundings represented an extension of secured debt,we turn to cohen argument that the k credit bid was improper because the lenders did not and could not demonstrate that some portion of their claims remained secured by collateral as defined in bankruptcy code a the district court determined that there was no collateral available to actually secure the fundings.in re submicron,at.as a result,cohen argues that,because the secured debt had no actual or economic value,it could not be credit bid under k.because that section empowers creditors to bid the total face value of their does not limit bids to claims economic disagree and hold that the district court did not err in allowing the lenders to credit bid their claims.
it is well settled among district and bankruptcy courts that creditors can bid the full face value of their secured claims under k.see,in re suncruz casinos,llc,t he plain language of section k makes clear that the secured creditor may credit bid its entire claim,including any unsecured deficiency portion thereof.emphasis in original in re morgan house,wl,at,holding that secured creditors may bid to the extent of their claim under k in re midway,a secured creditor may bid in the full amount of the creditor allowed claim,including the secured portion and any unsecured portion thereof citing legislative history alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted in re realty.v,same see also criimi mae servs.wdh howell,llc in re wdh howell,llc.
in fact,logic demands that k be interpreted in this way interpreting it to cap credit bids at the economic value of the underlying collateral is theoretically nonsensical.
a hypothetical is illustrative.
assume that debtor has a single asset a truck,lender is a secured creditor that has loaned debtor,taking a security interest in debtor is in chapter bankruptcy and has filed a motion to sell t to bidder for.debtor argues that lender can only credit bid for t and must bid any excess in cash if it wishes to outbid 
this hypothetical reveals the logical problem with an actual value bid cap.if lender bids for t,by definition becomes the value of lender security interest in t.in this way,until lender is paid in full,lender can always overbid bidder.naturally,lender will not outbid bidder unless lender believes it could generate a greater return on t than the return for lender represented by bidder offer.as lender holds a security interest in t,any amount bid for it up to the value of lender full claim becomes the secured portion of lender claim by definition given the weight of reason demand that it must be so,we see no reason to catalog the myriad other arguments that have been advanced to support this interpretation.
cohen is not out of plausible arguments,however,as he claims that because the lenders were not partially undersecured but completely is,because the collateral was found to have no economic case is different.yet nothing about the logic of allowing credit bids up to the full face value of the collateral changes if the collateral has no actual value.because the lenders had a valid security interest in essentially all the assets sold,by definition they were entitled to the satisfaction of their
