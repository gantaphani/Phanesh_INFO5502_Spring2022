a debtor in bankruptcy can not discharge educational loans through the normal channels.congress instead protected the financial integrity of the program by precluding a debtor from discharging these loans unless the debtor would endure an undue hardship in remaining obligated to repay them.see a.the bankruptcy court held that the debtor in this case satisfied the undue hardship requirement,and the district court affirmed.
we hold that the debtor failed to prove undue hardship both because she provided no exceptional circumstances over and above her present inability to pay her debt,and because she failed to seriously consider loan consolidation measures that would greatly reduce her current payments.congress sought to ensure repayment of educational loans through its use of the term undue and the courts are obligated to follow its imperative.we accordingly reverse the judgment of the district court.
the debtor,sandra jane frushour,filed for bankruptcy on december,to discharge her debts under chapter of the bankruptcy code.see et.frushour owed in debt as of march.the original principal on this debt was.the debtholder,educational credit management corporation ecmc,is a corporation that administers student loans.on march,frushour filed an adversary complaint against ecmc to discharge her debt as an undue hardship under a.both parties agree that a is the relevant provision for frushour student loans.
at the time of the adversary proceeding,frushour was in her forties and had a son for whom she received no child support.she had gone to college for several years with the help of her student loans.between and,she attended the university of south carolina coastal carolina college,california state university,and long beach city college.she was an arts major at coastal carolina and obtained an associate degree with an emphasis in tourism from long beach city college in.
frushour has been employed in a variety of different jobs since she obtained her degree in.she worked in restaurant management in california from to.specifically,she managed a tourist restaurant,the queen mary,in long beach,and continued in a similar line of work in huntington beach.during frushour first few years in restaurant management,she made between and per year.after her son was born,however,she made significantly less money per year,between and.in,frushour decided to move to florida.she obtained a florida real estate license,and worked in the resort sales industry.frushour made approximately in and in.sadly,however,tourism sales declined after the events of september.frushour thus moved again.
this time,she decided to return to south carolina to be with her ailing sister and aging mother.she started her own company,and has been ever since.frushour specializes in interior design and decorative painting,returning to her goal of working in the arts and using the art education that she received at coastal carolina.in her current capacity,frushour provides architects and interior designers with artistic backdrops for walls.she is her own marketer,through cold calls and referrals,and does the artistic work herself.in,she made approximately,and in her income increased to.
frushour living situation at the time of the adversary proceeding was anything but desirable.her expenses exceeded her income,even excluding the loan repayments.she earned a gross income of and a net income of per month.her expenses were per month.these monthly expenses included for food,for rent,for clothing,for cable and internet,for electricity,for transportation,for telephone,for car insurance and taxes,and for water and sewer.frushour had no childcare costs because she regularly worked from home.she also had no expenses for medical insurance and she drove a used volvo with over miles on it.
frushour has repaid her student loans on an inconsistent basis.she was obligated to start making payments in,but she was able to obtain forbearance until july.as a result,she started making loan repayments in august.she made about consistent payments from that time until approximately june.the record is ambiguous as to the exact amount of these payments,but it was either or per month.she has not made payments on her own initiative since.nonetheless,the irs seized her tax refund of and applied it to her student loans.frushour believes that it may have done the same in,since she has yet to receive her tax refund of for that year either.
after frushour filed this complaint to discharge her debt,ecmc brought to her attention that she qualified for several consolidation plans through the william ford direct loan program,the federal program that makes available educational loans.one of these plans is income contingent.under this plan,a debtor payment is twenty percent of the difference between her gross income and the federal poverty guidelines for her family size.see a.if frushour consolidates under this plan,she would have a payment of between zero and five dollars per month unless her income increased.she would be obligated to make payments for years,but at the end of that period her remaining debt would be discharged.id.c iv.if her income level rises such that she would have to make larger payments,she could switch to a plan.id.she refused to participate in any of these consolidation plans because she stated they were not right for her and she wanted a fresh start.
the bankruptcy court discharged frushour debt because it held that she proved an undue hardship under a.it applied a test first adopted by the second circuit to determine whether she did so.see brunner state higher educ.servs,cir per curiam.the brunner test requires a debtor to show that she can not maintain a minimal standard of living and repay the loans,additional circumstances exist that illustrate she will not be able to repay the loans for a substantial part of the repayment period,and she attempted to repay the loans in good faith.id.the bankruptcy court held that she proved all three factors.
the district court affirmed.as to the first prong,it noted that frushour maximized her income and minimized her expenses,but her expenses still exceeded her income.with regard to the second,it held that given her employment history,she was not likely to make more money in the future.further,she had testified that she anticipated more expenses for her son,as he grew older,and for her worn automobile,as it required additional repair.it also noted that she has no health care or money for home maintenance,and she would likely have to direct any increased income to these needs.finally,the district court held that frushour satisfied the final prong because,although she did not accept a loan consolidation plan,she paid the loans during years when her income was greater than it currently is.
before reaching the merits of this case,we must resolve a dispute over the appropriate standard of review.we review directly the bankruptcy court decision.banks sallie mae servicing in re banks,cir.all agree that we review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.id.dispute arises,however,over whether we review the ultimate determination of undue hardship under a de novo or clearly erroneous standard.
whether a debtor has met the undue hardship standard is a legal conclusion that is based on the debtor individual factual circumstances.it is thus a mixed question of law and fact.as we have explained in a related context,these types of questions are reviewed under a hybrid standard,applying to the factual portion of each inquiry the same standard applied to questions of pure fact and examining de novo the legal conclusions derived from those facts.dep t of health human servs.smitley,cir internal quotation marks omitted reviewing de novo the bankruptcy court legal conclusion that a debtor met the unconscionable standard required to discharge a health education assistance loan.several of our sister circuits have reached the same conclusion in the undue hardship context.see,tirch.higher educ.assistance agency in re tirch,cir dep t of educ.gerhardt in re gerhardt,cir.we therefore review de novo the determination of whether a debtor has met the undue hardship standard,and we review the factual underpinnings of that legal conclusion for clear error.
a discharge under chapter does not ordinarily discharge debt,because congress expressly excluded this debt from the regular bankruptcy procedures.it provided that 
a discharge under certain sections of the bankruptcy code does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution,or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit,scholarship or stipend,unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.
a emphasis added.
a debtor seeking to discharge educational loans thus faces a difficult burden,because she must show that not discharging the debt would impose an undue hardship.congress,however,neither defined undue hardship nor provided standards for what it entails.see educ.credit mgmt.in re,cir.
nonetheless,the ordinary meaning of undue gives us clear guidance.undue generally means unwarranted or excessive.see the random house dictionary of the english language ed.because congress selected the word undue,the required hardship under a must be more than the usual hardship that accompanies bankruptcy.inability to pay one debts by itself can not be sufficient otherwise all bankruptcy litigants would have undue hardship.the exception would swallow the rule,and congress restriction would be meaningless.as a result,t he existence of the adjective undue indicates that congress viewed hardship as insufficient excuse for a discharge of student loans.rifino united states in re rifino,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in enacting the undue hardship standard,congress had to take into account the viability of the program.that program serves valuable purposes.it affords individuals in all walks of life the opportunity to obtain an education,and with it the mobility and financial stability that an education can provide.indeed,without the program,many people would never receive any higher education,because their credit risks would preclude them from obtaining private commercial loans.brunner state higher educ.servs,aff,cir.the program does not just give loan recipients such as frushour the major benefits of a education.as history has shown,a society is critical to our general welfare and prosperity.
it is thus understandable why congress would exact a quid pro quo for loans by using the undue hardship standard.id.debtors receive valuable benefits from congressionally authorized loans,but congress in turn requires loan recipients to repay them in all but the most dire circumstances.higher educ.assistance agency faish in re faish,cir debtor should not be able to discharge student loans merely because repayment of the borrowed funds would require some major personal and financial sacrifices.this heightened standard protects the integrity of the program and saves it from fiscal doom.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.it also ensures public support for the program by preventing debtors from easily discharging their debts at the expense of the taxpayers who made possible their educations.see hemar ins.of am.cox in re cox,cir.
over the years,the circuit courts have considered the standards that should guide the undue hardship analysis.an overwhelming majority of circuits has now adopted the second circuit brunner test.see,tirch,at educ.credit mgmt.polleys,cir gerhardt,at,at cox,at brightful.higher educ.assistance agency in re brightful,cir rifino,at brunner,at.but see long educ.credit mgmt.in re long,cir adopting test.
this circuit has never explicitly adopted any one test in the chapter context,although we have applied the brunner factors in the chapter context.ekenasi educ.res.inst.in re ekenasi,cir.we now adopt the brunner test for chapter.since congress did not provide express standards to guide the undue hardship analysis,the brunner test best incorporates the congressional mandate to allow discharge of student loans only in limited circumstances.uniformity among the circuits is also important in the bankruptcy context.in order to prove an undue hardship,therefore,a debtor must show 
that the debtor can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans and that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.
brunner,at.the debtor has the burden of proving all three factors by a preponderance of the evidence,at brightful,at.
we do not decide whether frushour has satisfied the first part of the brunner test,because we hold that she has failed to prove the second and third factors.we do note,however,that ecmc is mistaken to suggest that having internet and cable connections requires the conclusion that frushour maintains more than a minimal standard of living.brunner,at.such a per se rule would simply be too harsh.it can not be said that the transmission of information,whether via internet or cable,is always unnecessary to maintain a minimal standard of living,especially for those who work from home.the undue hardship test necessarily requires a approach to determine whether certain expenses are or are not essential for maintaining a minimal standard of living.see,rifino,at holding debtor satisfied first prong even though she had cable television.in short,the mere fact of frushour internet and cable expenses would not disqualify her from an undue hardship discharge.
frushour has not,however,satisfied the second brunner factor,that additional circumstances exist indicating that her state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans.brunner,at.this factor is the heart of the brunner test.it most clearly reflects the congressional imperative that the debtor hardship must be more than the normal hardship that accompanies any bankruptcy.see rifino,at.
the second factor is,therefore,a demanding requirement,brightful,at,and necessitates that a certainty of hopelessness exists that the debtor will not be able to repay the student loans,id.internal quotation marks omitted see also tirch,at same,at same.only a debtor with rare circumstances will satisfy this factor.for example,although not exhaustive,a debtor might meet this test if she can show illness,disability,a lack of useable job skills,or the existence of a large number of dependents.oyler educ.credit mgmt.in re oyler,cir.
frushour fails to meet this test because she has provided no additional circumstances beyond the debt itself that show her hardship is undue.she was in her forties at the time of the adversary proceeding,and has one child.there is no indication she or her son has any physical or mental disabilities,and both appear to be healthy.she is college educated,has a florida real estate license,and has worked in several different areas of employment.every indication is that frushour is an intelligent individual with a range of job skills.
while frushour present financial condition is certainly not desirable,the second brunner factor is prospective in nature and looks for exceptional circumstances beyond the debtor current situation.see gerhardt,at proving that the debtor is currently in financial straits is not enough.internal quotation marks omitted.frushour employment history illustrates that she has held good jobs in the past in which she made almost double her current income.she has provided no indication as to why she could not return to a similar type of work.nor has she indicated any specific steps she has taken to seek employment in other fields.instead,she appears to be content with her present employment as a decorative painter because it was her original goal to work in the arts,the area in which she initially studied at coastal carolina.having a job,however,does not in itself provide undue hardship,especially where the debtor is satisfied with the job,has not actively sought employment,and has earned a larger income in previous jobs.
indeed,frushour points to no circuit court that has held a debtor can voluntarily take a job in her preferred field,and then refuse to repay her student loans by claiming undue hardship.quite the opposite is true.as the fifth circuit has explained,nothing in the bankruptcy code suggests that a debtor may choose to work only in the field in which he was trained,obtain a job,and then claim that it would be an undue hardship to repay his student loans.id.at.this is the case because it is not uncommon for individuals to take jobs not to their liking in order to pay off their student loans,at.for example,the sixth circuit refused to discharge the debt of a married couple where one of the debtors chose to work in a job,as a pastor of a church.oyler,at.it found undue hardship was not present even though the debtors had three children and an annual income of in the previous two years.id.at.
frushour nevertheless suggests that potential childcare costs would outweigh any additional income from working outside the home.but we have no way of knowing whether this would be the case.her contention is founded on little more than speculation,and can not satisfy her burden to prove the second brunner factor by a preponderance of the evidence,at.and since this factor looks to the future,it is not implausible to think that childcare costs will drop as her child progresses in school.see,educ.credit mgmt.carter,no undue hardship where,inter alia,plaintiff failed to show that her childcare costs were likely to remain the same in the future wessels educ.credit mgmt,same kirchhofer direct loans in re kirchhofer,same.
we recognize that frushour circumstances are far from ideal.but given her college education,real estate license,and restaurant management experience,we are not left with the likelihood that her present circumstances will extend for the rest of her repayment period or that she will not be able to pay off her loans at some future date.see brightful,at.
frushour has also failed to meet the third brunner factor,which requires her to show that she has made good faith efforts to repay her loans.brunner,at.this factor looks to the debtor efforts to obtain employment,maximize income,and minimize expenses,at internal quotation marks omitted.further,the debtor hardship must be a result of factors over which she had no control.id.
the debtor effort to seek out loan consolidation options that make the debt less onerous is an important component of the inquiry.see alderete educ.credit mgmt.in re alderete,cir.although not always dispositive,it illustrates that the debtor takes her loan obligations seriously,and is doing her utmost to repay them despite her unfortunate circumstances.see tirch,at see also smitley,at,relying in part on fact that debtor was eligible for income contingent repayment plan to deny discharge under unconscionable standard for health education assistance loans.
frushour has not shown the requisite effort to repay her loans.to be sure,she should be commended for making several payments in the past.but she did not seriously consider the income contingent plan under the william ford direct loan program.see tirch,at debtor did not illustrate good faith when she did not take advantage of the william ford income contingent repayment plan see also alderete,at debtors did not prove good faith when they did not consider applying for the income contingent plan,even though the court was not certain they were even eligible for the plan.both parties agree that frushour could have taken advantage of this plan,and ecmc has provided assurances that she continues to remain eligible.the plan would have allowed her to pay between zero and five dollars per month unless her income increased.after years,any remaining debt would be discharged.see.
frushour only reasons for refusing that option,however,were that it was not suited for her and she wanted a fresh start.it is hard to see why these reasons are not simply shorthand for her lack of interest in repaying her debt.the consolidation plan would allow her both to remain at her preferred job and to maintain her current level of expenditures.accounting for these considerations,frushour has provided insufficient justifications for refusing to take a simple step that would have allowed her to fulfill her commitments in a manageable way.see,tirch,at.she has thus failed to satisfy the third brunner factor of manifest effort to repay her loans.
frushour case,like that of most debtors,is not without appealing and sympathetic elements.but congress,in enacting a,set a high bar for a debtor seeking to discharge educational loans.permitting loan beneficiaries a routine discharge of these obligations through bankruptcy would create the very inequities among loan recipients that congress sought to avoid with its use of the word undue.
to allow frushour claim would force courts to draw almost impossible lines.applying a looser standard,courts would inevitably reach inconsistent results across bankruptcy cases.some loan recipients would obtain discharge while others in similar circumstances would unfairly remain obligated.a looser standard would also be unfair to the vast majority of loan recipients who do not attempt to discharge their loans and meet their obligations even with much.nor would we be faithful to congress if we relaxed the undue hardship standard in a manner that drew increasingly on the public fisc to account for growing shortfalls.
the appellate courts have thus declined to allow debtors to discharge their student loans in cases where their circumstances at the time of the adversary proceeding were similar or even more compelling.see,alderete,at,no undue hardship on debt of for debtors with three children and jobs oyler,at,no undue hardship on debt of for debtors with three children and annual income over last two years brightful,at,no undue hardship for debtor who had one dependent,even though she was forced to live with her sister,had no college degree,and was emotionally unstable with glaring psychiatric problems brunner,at,aff,cir no undue hardship where the debtor was unemployed and on public assistance,had made at most per year over the previous several years,and had sent out over a hundred resumes in her chosen field,without success.
frushour failed to show that she has exceptional circumstances,and she refused to consider loan consolidation programs that would have required from her a monthly payment of near zero based on her current income.she has thus failed to prove that she is in the limited class of debtors for which a meant to allow discharge.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is 
i join part ii of the majority opinion which holds that we review de novo the determination of whether a debtor has met the undue hardship standard of a bankruptcy code a and review the factual underpinnings of that legal conclusion for clear error.however,i am compelled to dissent from the majority opinion reversal of the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court order discharging sandra jane frushour frushour student loan debt pursuant to bankruptcy code a.
after observing frushour demeanor and hearing her testimony,the bankruptcy court found that additional circumstances existed indicating that frushour dire state of financial affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of her student loan debt brunner second prong and found that frushour had made good faith efforts to repay her student loan debt brunner third prong.brunner state higher educ.servs,cir setting forth test for proving entitlement to undue hardship discharge of student loan debt pursuant to bankruptcy code a.that the majority opinion rejects these findings as clearly erroneous an act the majority unsuccessfully attempts to deny,on the record before us and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom,is beyond all reason.such rejection constitutes an excellent example of the folly of courts in the role of philosopher kings.american acad.of pediatrics lungren,cal th,d,brown,dissenting.the supreme court has repeatedly reiterated the extremely deferential nature of the clearly erroneous standard of review a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson bessemer city,d quoting united states united states gypsum.here,a thorough review of the entire record,stripped from any philosophical preconceived notions about the role of and strictures on education in our society,far from leaves one with a definite and firm conviction that the bankruptcy court factual findings with respect to brunner second and third prongs are mistaken.
when the majority opinion is disrobed of its philosophic meanderings,that the majority opinion does nothing more than high handedly second guess the bankruptcy court factual findings on two of the factual issues critical to frushour attempt to discharge her student loan debt pursuant to a is patently obvious.in so doing,the majority opinion has quite blatantly ignored bankruptcy rule,which provides that due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.bankruptcy rule.see also dunning simmons airlines,cir we refuse to the court credibility determinations because the judge has had the opportunity to observe the verbal and nonverbal behavior of the witnesses focusing on the subject reactions and responses to the interrogatories,their facial expressions,attitudes,tone of voice,eye contact,posture and body movements,rather than looking at the cold pages of a transcript.
for these reasons and those that follow,i am constrained to dissent from the majority opinion reversal of the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court discharge of frushour student loan debt pursuant to bankruptcy code a.
quite remarkably,the majority misapplies the proper standard of review regarding the bankruptcy court findings with respect to the brunner prongs.the proper standard of review plainly requires us to review the bankruptcy court findings with respect to the brunner prongs for clear error.in applying the brunner test in the chapter context in ekenasi educ.res,cir,we unequivocally treated the bankruptcy court findings with respect to brunner three prongs as factual findings and held that at least two of those findings were clearly erroneous.id.at w e conclude that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding that debtor met his burden of establishing the brunner factors and,therefore,erred in discharging the student loan obligations based upon the record before it.id.at presented with this evidence,we are satisfied that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding that debtor had sufficiently proven that he would be unable,two years in the future,to maintain a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loan.id.at we also conclude that debtor failed to prove that he has made good faith efforts to repay the loans,brunner,at,and that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding otherwise.
common sense and simple logic support ekenasi treatment of the bankruptcy court findings with respect to brunner three prongs as factual findings subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.for example,the first brunner prong,which asks whether the debtor can maintain,based upon current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay her student loan debt,necessarily asks the bankruptcy court to answer a factual question,albeit in the nature of a factual prediction of the future based upon current and reasonably foreseeable circumstances.juries are routinely called upon to make similar factual predictions of the future based upon the evidence presented.for example,in a personal injury action involving a plaintiff who has suffered permanent injury and established liability,the jury is asked to predict the plaintiff future medical expenses as an element of recoverable damages.
in sum,our role on appeal is to determine with respect to each brunner prong,whether,although there is evidence to support the bankruptcy court factual finding on that prong,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the finding is wrong.anderson,at.carolin miller,cir bankruptcy court ultimate finding that chapter filing was not in good faith constitutes finding of fact subject to clearly erroneous standard of review.indeed,the clearly erroneous standard required the district court as well as requires this court to give great deference to the bankruptcy court with respect to findings of fact.in the matter of love,cir.as the seventh circuit has succinctly stated under the clearly erroneous standard,if the bankruptcy court factual findings are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,a reviewing court may not reverse even if it would have weighed the evidence differently.mungo taylor,cir.
our review under the clearly erroneous standard is similar in nature to a sufficiency of the evidence inquiry,where we routinely give deference to the findings of the trier of fact even though we would reach a different result if we reviewed the evidence on our own in the first instance.see,united states burgos,cir a reviewing court,therefore,may not overturn a substantially supported verdict merely because it finds the verdict unpalatable or determines that another,reasonable verdict would be preferable.rather,we shall reverse a verdict if the record demonstrates a lack of evidence from which a jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
our de novo review comes into play to determine whether the bankruptcy court,having made the factual findings that it did with respect to the brunner prongs,properly discharged or properly refused to discharge the debtor student loan debt.
in footnote of the majority opinion,the majority denies overturning any factual findings of the bankruptcy court as clearly erroneous and asserts that it has accepted every factual finding made by the bankruptcy court.majority op.at.from these premises,the majority goes on to conclude that frushour failed to proffer sufficient evidence to support two of brunner three prongs.
while the majority expressly states that it accepts the bankruptcy court factual findings,its actions speak much louder than its words.in fact,in a sleight of hand,the majority implicitly holds that two critical factual findings of the bankruptcy court are clearly erroneous.so why does the majority engage in this act of legerdemain.the answer the majority position simply does not hold water if any deference is paid to the bankruptcy court factual findings.i will now proceed to analyze the brunner prongs,giving the proper deference that is owed to the bankruptcy court factual findings.
the first prong of brunner three prong test for proving entitlement to an undue hardship discharge of student loan debt,pursuant to bankruptcy code a,asks whether the debtor can maintain,based on the debtor current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the student loan debt.brunner,at.here,the bankruptcy court found that frushour could not maintain even a minimal standard of living for herself and her small child if forced to repay her student loan debt.although the majority opinion does not decide whether this finding is clearly erroneous,the issue is necessarily addressed in my dissent.
