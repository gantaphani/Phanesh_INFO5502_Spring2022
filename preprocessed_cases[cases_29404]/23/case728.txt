howard wright construction wright sought to foreclose a mechanic lien recorded against the property of bbic investors,llc.after a nonjury trial,the court determined that wright recordation of its mechanic lien was premature and the lien was therefore void.on appeal,wright contends this was error.
in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude the trial court erred because wright recorded its claim of lien after its contract was completed,within the meaning of civil code section,upon the anticipatory breach of the other contracting party.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we conclude as an alternative basis for reversal that the trial court key factual finding was not supported by substantial evidence.although wright remaining arguments lack merit,for the foregoing reasons we reverse the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
respondent bbic investors,bbic,owned a former warehouse building located at poplar street in oakland,california.usa,a telecommunications company,leased space in the premises from bbic.retained wright to perform the construction work necessary for installing in the leased space a facility for internet business.to this end,wright and entered into a written agreement.meanwhile,bbic posted and recorded a notice of nonresponsibility at the premises,intending to prevent the attachment of any mechanic lien to its interest in the real property.
a.the agreement 
the project covered by the agreement was referred to as the oakland pop site.the contract described a work of improvement involving structural alteration of about square feet for use as a pop site for computer servers.essentially,it involved converting a warehouse into a modern internet facility,with seismic upgrades,upgraded power,generator,dry sprinklers,waterproofing,and more.the budget for the project was approximately million.under section of the agreement,however,could make changes by additions,deletions,or revisions.
wright customarily maintained separate contracts for separate projects under separate job numbers.as explained by wright comptroller,dawn stephens,wright followed the practice of the construction industry generally,which is dominated by job cost accounting,wherein costs are accumulated and coded to particular projects depending on the type of contract.wright work under the agreement was assigned job number.indeed,wright billed all of its work at the site under job number.
modification of the agreement 
wright began work under the agreement in march.by may,however,it became clear that was having serious financial trouble.in a letter dated may,project manager,jeff garren,advised wright project manager,hanno nehrenheim effective immediately has decided to place the oakland pop site on hold.all necessary actions shall be taken to reduce capital expenditures at this time.garren also requested nehrenheim to do what was necessary to leave the site safe,secure and in compliance with all applicable codes.
wright advised its subcontractors that the project had been placed on hold.a few days later,nehrenheim sent an to garren and bbic representative foraker,with an attached punchlist of items wright plan ned to work from in getting the site ready for our departure.
on may,nehrenheim sent garren a letter with a subject line of authorization for final work.the letter set forth the final costs and work to be completed on this project and requested formal authorization for this additional work.the estimated price for the closeout work was.in an internal the next day,garren noted the mothballing of the project,construction of which was only about percent complete.
garren responded to nehrenheim may letter with an on may.in the,garren authorized wright to proceed with the work described in nehrenheim letter.specifically,he stated please proceed with the items listed in your authorization for final work letter of.the cost of this work should be completed in four weeks and be billed in addition to and separately from hsw may application for payment.as will be seen,bbic contends this may evinced the parties modification of the agreement,while wright the first time on the confirmed the parties abandonment of the agreement and a separate closeout contract.
on june,nehrenheim sent an message to tom gallagher,wright and regional manager,stating stock dropped below a today,closing at cents.may want to lien a little early.italics added.
an inspection for the closeout work was set for june,according to a june from garren,which bore the subject line of oakland pop inspection of closeout work.
on or about june,however,advised wright that it was not going to pay wright any more money.wright chief financial officer,john tremper,memorialized the conversation by correspondence dated june this letter is to confirm our phone conversation yesterday at which time you informed me that does not intend to make any payments on any of our contracts for at least days even though certain amounts are due.you were unable to give me any assurances that payments due would be made after the period.that conversation indicates intention to breach the terms of our agreements.if any of the above statements are incorrect,please contact me immediately,otherwise we will take appropriate action.the record contains no response from to tremper letter.
also on june,wright laborers and tradesmen left the construction site.according to wright,no more work was done at the site under any contract with.
wright records its claim of lien on june 
wright on june,recorded its claim of mechanic lien against the subject improved real property,in the amount of,for work,labor,materials and supervision for the renovation of that space,furnished by wright to be used and actually used in that certain work of improvement consisting of the renovation of said property under contract with usa inc.wright later recorded a partial release of its mechanic lien claim in the amount of,resulting in a claim of.
work after june 
according to nehrenheim testimony at trial,wright work,including the mothball or work,was substantially completed on june,since that was the last day subcontractors pulled material or did any work on the project.
from wright job diary,however,the last work performed under job number did not occur until june,when wright moved some ductwork.similarly,when asked at trial when construction stopped,nehrenheim replied that the last entry was on june,in regard to moving out materials,while the last entry referring to subcontractors was on june.in addition,nehrenheim acknowledged,the closeout inspection meeting took place at the site on june as scheduled.
files bankruptcy 
on june,filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.
wright foreclosure action 
wright filed its complaint to foreclose the mechanic lien on august.soon thereafter,wright recorded a notice of pendency of its foreclosure lis pendens.
writ on participating owner doctrine 
bbic,citing the notice of nonresponsibility it had filed,brought a motion for removal of wright mechanic lien and expungement of its lis pendens.in response,wright invoked the participating owner doctrine,by which it claimed that a lessor notice of nonresponsibility is without effect if the lessor caused the work of improvement to be performed by requiring the lessee to make improvements.based on bbic notice of nonresponsibility,the trial court ordered wright mechanic lien removed and its lis pendens expunged.
in july,wright petitioned this court for a writ of mandate in case number,seeking to set aside the trial court orders removing its mechanic lien and expunging its lis pendens.we issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate the orders and to conduct further proceedings in the foreclosure action.howard wright construction superior court th,d.the matter was remanded for trial.
in january,the issues of liability and damages were bifurcated for trial.in september,trial to the court commenced on the issue of liability.
after presenting the evidence summarized above,as well as evidence relevant to the participating owner doctrine,wright announced its intent to rest its case.the trial court pointed out that wright had neglected to address the issue of licensure or establish one of the elements of its cause of validity of the mechanic lien.the court observed that wright claim may be premature,and if wright rest s now and bbic says,i want judgment under code of civil procedure section,it get it.
wright decided not to rest its case.instead,it again called nehrenheim as a witness,among others.this time,led to some extent by wright attorney,nehrenheim testified there was not simply a project for construction of the oakland pop site project,but also a closeout project.according to nehrenheim,abandoned the original construction project as of its may letter,the closeout project began on may,and the may confirmed that was abandoning the construction project and wright was performing just closeout or mothballing work.
in addition,nehrenheim elaborated on the work performed at the site after june.as of that date,he explained,the project trailer remained on site and was full of documents.over the next few days,nehrenheim and project superintendent vince wright emptied out the trailer and sent files back to wright san francisco office.they spent some time at the trailer working on other matters as well,but did no work for.
nehrenheim also accounted for the entries in wright job diary for june and,which indicated that wright had moved ductwork at the site on those dates.nehrenheim asserted that bbic dennis henry had asked if the ductwork could be moved from the second floor,where it would have been installed if the closeout work had been finished,to a secured area on the first floor.nehrenheim agreed,and he and vince wright used a truck to move the ductwork as requested.the record does not state exactly how long this took,but nehrenheim testified they loaded and drove the truck three to four times from the second floor to the first floor.according to nehrenheim,the fact that the work was recorded as the only entry on the job diary for four days did not mean the work was being done all day,or even every one of those days,but just that the task was started on june and the last load had not been run until june.nehrenheim testified that no one was billed or charged for this work.
on,nehrenheim did not identify any formal contract for the purported closeout project,referring instead to just the may letter from wright and the may from.he acknowledged that wright closeout work fell within the fixed general conditions provision of the agreement under job number,covering demobilizing the field office,final cleaning,and site was included in wright mechanic lien.and although nehrenheim asserted there were two projects at the site,he never claimed the work was performed under more than one contract.
bbic motion for judgment 
after wright rested its case,bbic moved for judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section,asserting that wright lien,recorded on june,was recorded prematurely in light of wright work at the site after that date.see.
at the hearing,the parties agreed that timely recording of the claim of lien turned on section which provides that a lien must be filed after the contractor has completed the contract,and section,which the court and parties understood to define completion.wright maintained that its claim of lien was timely recorded,in part because there were really two for construction and the other for abandonment of the construction project on may constituted actual completion under section.the court stated that it was struggling with wright notion that there are two projects,because wright had lumped them together in the same lien claim under the agreement.to wright assertion that it is obvious from the facts it is not one project,the court responded,i guess the trier of fact is seeing the obvious.i think this is one project.alternatively,wright argued,its lien was timely recorded,because under section a lien could be filed days after labor ceased on june.
the trial court postponed its ruling on the motion until after the close of evidence.see code civ,subd.a.
in its,bbic introduced evidence regarding wright purported premature recordation of the lien claim,as well as the participating owner doctrine.among the exhibits were subcontracts and subsequent settlements with subcontractors which,bbic contended,disclosed wright understanding that it entered into subcontracts with subcontractors for a single job,namely,job number for the oakland pop site project under the agreement.
the parties submitted posttrial briefs addressing,among other things,the issue of premature recordation.the trial court took the matter under submission.
order granting bbic motion for judgment 
the court tentative decision indicated its intent to grant bbic motion for judgment based on wright failure to timely record its claim of lien.the court explained that wright june recordation was premature,because the lien could not be recorded until after the contract was completed,completion occurs days after cessation of labor,subd.c,and since wright claimed that work ceased on june,the contract was not completed until around august,long after the recordation of the claim of lien.in addition,the court concluded,wright recordation was premature in light of its factual finding that work on the project did not actually end until june,six days after the claim of lien was recorded.wright filed a request for additional statement of decision.see cal.rules of court,rule code civ.
on march,the court issued a final statement of decision,which repeated the findings and conclusions from its tentative decision and added,in partial response to wright request for an additional statement,some public policy reasons for its order.judgment was entered in favor of bbic.
this appeal followed.
pending writ 
after entry of judgment dismissing the foreclosure action,bbic obtained an order from the trial court expunging the lis pendens that wright had recorded based on the mechanic lien.wright in turn petitioned this court for a writ of mandate appeal number,seeking to set aside the expungement order and requesting a stay of the order pending appeal.we granted the stay.we will rule on the petition by separate order.
ii.discussion 
at issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting bbic motion for judgment,on the ground that wright had recorded its mechanic lien prematurely.to begin,we embark on a cursory overview of mechanic liens.
a mechanic in this context is one who has supplied materials or labor for the improvement of real property other than the property owner,and includes a contractor.to secure obligations owed by the owner to the mechanic pursuant to contract,the mechanic may file a lien on the improved property,which is sometimes referred to as the work of improvement.see generally cal,art.xiv,et miller starr,cal.real estate ed.mechanics liens,miller starr.
as a requirement of enforcing the lien,the mechanic must record a claim of lien in the appropriate recorder office within a statutory time period.see.after the claim is recorded,the mechanic may initiate an action to foreclose the lien against the owner of the real property interest.
to prevail in a foreclosure action,the plaintiff bears the burden of proving,among other things,the validity of the lien.basic modular facilities,ehsanipour th,d.for the lien to be valid,the claim of lien must have been timely recorded in compliance with the applicable statute.remington mulholland,see arthur gensler,associates,larry barrett,cal d.
as relevant here,the timeliness of the recording of a claim of lien is governed by section,which provides both an earliest date and a latest date for timely recording.section reads each original contractor,in order to enforce a lien,must record his claim of lien after he completes his contract and before the expiration of a days after the completion of the work of improvement as defined in section if no notice of completion or notice of cessation has been recorded,or b days after recordation of a notice of completion or notice of cessation.italics added.the parties do not dispute that wright was an original contractor for purposes of sections and.see miller starr,supra,cal.real estate,mechanic
