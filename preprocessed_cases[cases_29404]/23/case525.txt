iii.discussion 
legal backdrop of fdcpa claims 
congress passed the higher education act of hea,et,to keep the college door open to all students of ability,regardless of socioeconomic background.pelfrey educ.credit mgmt,d,see a.among other things,the hea established the federal family education loan program ffelp administered by the department of education doe.see.the doe has promulgated regulations to implement the ffelp.see college loan slm,cir a.
under the hea,eligible lenders make guaranteed loans on favorable terms to students or parents to help finance student education.the loans are typically guaranteed by guaranty agencies and are ultimately reinsured by the doe.pelfrey,d at.a guaranty agency is defined in the ffelp regulations as a state or private nonprofit organization that has an agreement with the secretary under which it will administer a loan guarantee program under the higher education act.see also id.a in order to participate in the ffel programs,a guaranty agency shall enter into a basic agreement with the secretary.in essence a guaranty agency is an intermediary between the united states and the lender of the student loan.the united states is the loan guarantor of last resort.the guaranty agency assists the united states in performing that function.great lakes higher educ.cavazos,cir.
one of the functions assigned to lenders and guaranty agencies under ffelp regulations is collection on defaulted student loans.when a borrower defaults on a loan,the lender is required to engage in a series of due diligence activities to try to get the borrower to repay the loan.if the lender is unable to collect the debt despite complying with its due diligence requirements,the lender files a claim with the guaranty agency.id.e.the guaranty agency acts as a guarantor,paying the lender the unpaid balance of the defaulted loan.the guaranty agency is then assigned the loan by the lender.id.b vi a.in turn,guaranty agencies have various agreements with the doe.
depending on the precise agreement between a guaranty agency and the doe,the agency can recover from the doe to percent of its losses resulting from a defaulted loan,provided that the guaranty agency engages in due diligence in seeking to recover on the defaulted loan.c.a guaranty agency due diligence requirements include locating the defaulting borrower,offsetting federal and state tax refunds against money owed by the borrower,initiating administrative garnishment proceedings against the borrower,and filing suit against the borrower.b i iv.within days of paying the default claim of a lender,a guaranty agency must notify the defaulting borrower that if he or she does not make repayment arrangements acceptable to the agency,the agency will promptly initiate procedures to collect the debt.id.b v.the agency must notify the borrower of the various measures the agency may take at the discretion of the agency,including offset of a tax refund,administrative garnishment and civil suit.id.
the fdcpa,et,was enacted to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.the fdcpa regulates the collection of debts by debt collectors by regulating the number and type of contacts a debt collector may make with the debtor.the requirements imposed on a guaranty agency under the hea and on a debt collector under the fdcpa are not entirely consistent.
analysis of fdcpa claims 
the question before us is whether ecmc is a debt collector within the meaning of the fdcpa.
the fdcpa defines debt collector as 
any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts,or who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.
the fdcpa provides for a number of exceptions from the term debt collector.among them are 
c any officer or employee of the united states or any state to the extent that collecting or attempting to collect any debt is in the performance of his official duties 
f any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity i is incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation or a bona fide escrow arrangement or ii concerns a debt which was originated by such person.
c,f i ii.further,a creditor is not a debt collector under the fdcpa.a montgomery huntington bank,cir.
ecmc contends that it is a guaranty agency under the hea.based on this conclusion it argues on three grounds that it is not a debt collector and that its collection activities are therefore not subject to the fdcpa.first,ecmc argues that its collection activity is incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation.f i.the district court held for ecmc on this ground.second,ecmc argues that its collection activity concerns a debt which was originated by ecmc.id.f ii.ecmc made this contention in the district court,but the court did not reach that issue.third,ecmc argues that it is a creditor rather than a debt collector.id,a.ecmc makes this contention for the first time in this court.the united states has submitted an amicus brief in this court in support of ecmc arguing only the first two grounds.for the reasons that follow,based on the allegations in the complaint,we disagree with the district court conclusion that ecmc was not covered by the fdcpa because its collection activity was incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation.we do not reach ecmc second and third arguments and remand to the district court.
