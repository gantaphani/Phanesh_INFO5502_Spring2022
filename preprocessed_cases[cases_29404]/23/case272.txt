this appeal is the second in this case.the republic of congo is attempting to avoid its undisputed debt by claiming sovereign immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,notwithstanding that,in the lending contract,it pledged as collateral all of its assets and properties,and expressly waived its sovereign immunity.the district court concluded that the congo was entitled to claim immunity under the provisions of the fsia because the property at issue was not used for commercial purposes in the united states.we disagree and reverse and remand.
on december,the republic of congo entered into a lending contract with equator bank limited to provide funds necessary for the construction of a highway in that country.to obtain the loan,the congo pledged as collateral all of its assets and properties,wherever located.in the lending contract,the congo expressly waived any right to claim foreign sovereign immunity either from suit or from attachment or execution on its property.
the congo defaulted in.connecticut bank of commerce the bank,an assignee of the lending contract,obtained a default judgment against the congo in a london,england court.in order to turn this foreign judgment into a united states judgment,the bank filed suit in a new york state court.the congo did not appear and the court entered a default judgment in the amount of in favor of the bank.the new york court also entered an order of attachment,authorizing the bank to execute against any assets or other property of the congo of any nature,irrespective of the use or intended use of such property including any payments or obligations due to the congo from any oil and gas exploration and development companies 
on january,the bank registered the new york judgment in a texas state court.it then filed garnishment actions there against,inter alia,cms nomeco congo,cms,nuevo congo company nuevo,and nuevo congo collectively the garnishees.it sought to garnish intangible property purportedly belonging to the congo,namely,the garnishees obligations to pay taxes and royalties to the congo.the garnishees are to a joint venture the convention between a congolese company,now known as the societe nationale des petroles du congo snpc,and several oil companies for oil production in the congo.currently,cms is the operator of the joint venture while nuevo,nuevo congo and snpc possess working interests.under the terms of the convention,the congo permitted the joint venture to extract oil in exchange for the payment of royalties and a variety of taxes related to the garnishees activities.the mining royalty can be paid in cash or in kind from the oil lifted from the wells.the choice regarding the form of payment belongs to the congo,although it usually elects to have the royalties paid in kind the convention also obligates the garnishees to make periodic tax payments to the congo based on the net income from covered activities.the remaining profits are split among the convention members in proportion to their working interests.the garnishees obligation to make these tax and royalty payments to the congo is the property at issue in this case.
following the bank filing of its garnishment action in texas state court,the congo and the garnishees collectively the congo defendants removed the case to federal court.there,the congo defendants moved for dismissal,arguing that the congo was entitled to sovereign immunity from the garnishment action under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia.in response,the bank contended that the congo had expressly waived sovereign immunity in the lending contract.the bank also argued that the texas court was bound by the earlier attachment order issued by the new york court.
the district court dismissed the action,rejecting both arguments of the bank.first,the court rejected the claim that the new york judgment had any preclusive effect on the present case.the court also rejected the bank claim that in the lending contract,the congo had waived sovereign immunity even though it was express and in writing the court held that such a total waiver was ineffective under a of the fsia,which recognizes only conditional waivers.specifically,the court found that even when a foreign state purports to waive completely its immunity,the fsia only permits execution on property that is commercial.the court concluded that the royalty and tax payments to the congo were in nature,and thus the property was immune from attachment under a.
the bank then appealed to this court.we affirmed the district court holding that the new york attachment order had no preclusive effect.connecticut bank of commerce republic of congo,cir.we also agreed that,under the fsia,a waiver of immunity only applies against property that meets two statutory criteria,namely,that the property in question be in the united states and used for commercial activity in the united states.id.at quoting a.we concluded,however,that the district court had erred in applying these statutory criteria by incorrectly focusing on how the property was generated instead of fully considering what it is used for.we further clarified this point in an amended opinion issued on rehearing we remanded the case to the district court with the narrow and specific instructions that it resolve 
the dispositive factual question what the royalty and tax obligations are used for.if it turns out that the royalties and tax obligations are not used for any commercial activity in the united states,the district court should dissolve the writs of garnishment and dismiss the action.
on remand,the district court ordered discovery to determine whether the tax and royalty obligations were property used for commercial activity in the united states,who had succeeded the bank in interest during the pendency of the bank appeal,vigorously pursued that discovery,receiving thousands of pages of responsive documents and deposing numerous witnesses from the congo,the garnishees and.

in this appeal,makes two arguments.first,it contends that the district court erred in disregarding the congo express waiver of immunity contained in the lending contract.second,it asserts that the district court erroneously concluded that the royalty and tax payments were not used for commercial activity.
we first consider argument that the district court erred in failing to enforce the explicit waiver of sovereign immunity in the lending contract.this argument,however,has already been made and rejected in the earlier appeal.in the first appeal,predecessor cited the same language in the lending contract,arguing that it permitted execution against any property whatsoever,irrespective of its use or intended use.it argued that even if this violated the express restrictions under the fsia,these restrictions were inapplicable because the congo signed a contractual waiver in the lending contract and the new york court order should be given preclusive effect.although most of our opinion in the earlier appeal focused on rejecting the latter of these claims,we explicitly rejected the former claim as well.we noted 
the foreign sovereign immunities act provides foreign sovereigns with immunity from execution against their property to satisfy an adverse judgment.this statutory immunity is subject to several exceptions.one exception is that,if a foreign sovereign waives its immunity from execution,courts may execute against property in the united states used for a commercial activity in the united states.a.even when a foreign state completely waives its immunity from execution,courts in the may execute only against property that meets these two statutory criteria.

our mandate on remand also showed that we had rejected this argument.we gave narrow and specific instructions to the district court,directing it to decide the dispositive factual question of whether the congo property is used for any commercial activities in the united states,and to dismiss the action if it was not.id.at.
contends that this interpretation of the fsia is incorrect and that the fsia does in fact permit a complete waiver of sovereign immunity.whatever the validity of that claim,however,we are obligated to accept the ruling of the earlier panel.on second appeal following remand,the only issue for consideration is whether the court below reached its final decree in pursuance of this court previous mandate.burroughs ffp operating partners,cir.thus,this court will not reconsider issues decided by the prior panel.id.under the law of the case doctrine,an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined either by the district court on remand or by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal.paul mercury ins.williamson,cir.accordingly,the only question properly before this panel on this second appeal is whether the court below reached its final decree in pursuance of this court previous mandate.burroughs,at that is,our present authority is limited to examining whether the district court correctly determined that the tax and royalty obligations at issue here are not used for commercial purposes in the united states.we now turn to this question.
as discussed previously,in our earlier opinion following the first appeal in this case,this court held that under a of the fsia,a court is prohibited from executing against the property of a foreign state unless that property is in the united states and used for commercial activity in the united states.connecticut bank,at.we first turn to an analysis of the district court determination that these tax and royalty obligations were not used for commercial purposes in the united states.
before doing so,we must first make clear the applicable standard of review in this case.determining whether property is used for commercial purposes requires a court to both make factual findings concerning how the property was used and to reach legal conclusions concerning whether that particular use was for commercial purposes.when a district court decision involves such mixed questions of law and fact,we review the district court factual findings for clear error,and its legal conclusions and application of law to fact de novo.in re liljeberg enterprises,cir.
we find no clear error in the district court material factual findings concerning the congo past use of these royalty obligations.the district court found,and the congo concedes,that it has,in the past,utilized these tax and royalty obligations for an explicitly commercial purpose.in,the national union fire insurance company nufi obtained a judgment against the congo after the congo defaulted on a loan.two years later,in,nufi sued the congo in federal court in an effort to collect its judgment by garnishing the same tax and royalty obligations that are at issue in this case.nufi and the congo eventually entered into a settlement agreement under which the congo assigned nufi fifty percent of these tax and royalty obligations until such a time as the underlying debt was fully paid.significantly,this money was paid by the garnishees directly to nufi the garnishees would then pay the remaining amount of royalties due to the congo.this arrangement went on for over eleven august the dollar debt was paid.the congo has also acknowledged that,although these tax and royalty obligations were actually used in this fashion only once,the congo seriously contemplated using these obligations in a similar manner on at least one other occasion.around the time the nufi settlement was set to expire,the congo entered into settlement discussions with another creditor wherein a similar assignment of debt was proposed,albeit ultimately not adopted.
because we find no clear error in the district court material factual findings,the question before this court is a strictly legal one whether such past commercial use is sufficient to render these obligations property used for commercial purposes for purposes of the fsia.the congo defendants argue that it is not.they contend that an exceptional and singular past commercial use at one point in time is insufficient to establish that this specific property is used for commercial purposes under the fsia.instead,they contend that the fsia warrants a more comprehensive approach to the question of commercial use,focusing not on isolated and unusual uses,but instead on what the property is essentially used for.
the district court agreed that the congo defendants recommended approach was consistent with the legislative purpose of the fsia.the court noted that there was little case law delineating precisely how a court should analyze property to determine whether it was being used for commercial purposes under the fsia,but reasoned that evidence of a single commercial use in the past could not,by itself,render the property in question now and forever subject to garnishment.instead,the district court applied a form of the congo defendants recommended essential use test,focusing on determining the predominant or essential use of the property in question.concluding that the single instance of tax and royalty obligations being used to satisfy a commercial debt was not enough to render the property essentially commercial in nature,the district court dismissed the action.
we have no major disagreement with the analytical approach that the able district court adopted in determining whether these tax and royalty obligations were commercial in nature.like the district court,we have similar reservations about defining property use as commercial in nature solely by reference to past single exceptional commercial uses.instead,we agree that determining the commercial or status of a property use requires a more holistic approach.specifically,we think that an analysis applied to such a question should examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the property.this analysis should include an examination of the uses of the property in the past as well as all facts related to its present use,with an eye toward determining whether the commercial use of the property,if any,is so exceptional that it is an out of character use for that particular property 
this holistic approach is also consistent with the reasoning in our earlier decision in this case.there,predecessor argued that courts should look at the source as opposed to the use of the property to determine its commercial nature.in rejecting this contention,we utilized the following analogy 
consider an airplane owned by a foreign government and used solely to shuttle a foreign back and forth for official visits.if the plane lands in the united states,it would not be subject to attachment or execution.the plane is not used for any commercial activity,in the or elsewhere.it plainly would not matter how the foreign government bought the plane,raised the purchase price,or otherwise came into ownership.even if the government received the plane as payment from a company in an obviously commercial transaction,that would not somehow transform the use of the plane into a commercial use.regardless of how the government came to own the plane,a court could never under the terms of the fsia confiscate a plane used solely to transport a foreign on official business.attaching the plane and selling it in execution of a judgment would go too far in interrupting the public acts of a foreign state.
connecticut bank,at.
tweaking this analogy a bit,consider that the airplane had been used on rare occasions for commercial example,it was temporarily used to fill in for a disabled plane in the foreign country commercial fleet.it would strain reason to conclude that these limited,emergency usages rendered the plane subject to garnishment now and forever irrespective of the fact that its use was otherwise almost exclusively.indeed,permitting the attachment and selling of such a plane in execution of a judgment would also go too far in interrupting the public acts of a foreign state.thus,we conclude that under the fsia,foreign property retains its immunity protection where its commercial uses,considered holistically and in context,are bona fide exceptions to its otherwise noncommercial use 
that said,although we are fairly in agreement with the form of the analysis applied by the district court,and dispute none of its underlying fact determinations,we disagree with its legal conclusion that these tax and royalty obligations were not used for commercial purposes.instead,we think that the facts relating to the past and present use of these obligations,examined broadly and in context,establish the opposite.
as the facts of the nufi settlement indicate,for nearly half of the years that these obligations existed,the congo has used at least fifty percent of them to repay a commercial debt.the amount of the debt repaid was not insignificant during the course of this extended period of time,over was diverted from these obligations to the congo commercial creditor.such a continuing,extended and monetarily significant use is neither exceptional nor de minimis.moreover,it is difficult to say that execution on this obligation would be so unusual that it would shock and disrupt the public affairs of the congo 
indeed,on at least one other occasion,the congo contemplated engaging in the same type of use again.although such contemplated use is not actual use it is strongly suggestive that the proceeds of these tax and royalty obligations were not cordoned off for use of the congo in its sovereign capacity.instead,it indicates the availability of this property for whatever or congo deems appropriate.such property seems hardly the type of foreign property the fsia was designed as a shield to protect,funds so central to a nation operations as a sovereign that uses thereof would interrupt the public acts of this foreign state.id.at.accordingly,we conclude that these tax and royalty obligations are used for commercial purposes for purposes of a of the fsia.
we now turn to the question of the situs of these tax and royalty obligations.as noted previously,for foreign property to be stripped of its immunity under the fsia,a not only requires that the property in question be used for commercial purposes,but also that the property be in the united states.id.at 
determining the situs of the property at issue here poses a special problem because this property is intangible in nature.this court and others have noted the inherent difficulty of assigning a location to property that by its very definition lacks a physical existence.see black law dictionary ed.the third circuit has observed that attaching a situs to intangible property is necessarily a legal fiction therefore,the selection of a situs for intangibles must be,embodying a common sense appraisal of the requirements of justice and convenience in particular conditions.industries,gregg,cir citations and quotations removed.this court has also recognized the nature of an inquiry into the situs of intangible property.in tabacalera severiano jorge,standard cigar,cir,after noting that t he situs of intangible property is about as intangible a concept as is known to the law,we affirmed that the situs of intangible property will vary,depending on the context.thus 
the situs may be in one place for ad valorem tax purposes,it may be in another place for venue purposes,garnishment it may be in more than one place for tax purposes in certain circumstances it may be in still a different place when the need for establishing its true situs is to determine whether an overriding national concern,like the application of the act of state doctrine is involved.
id.at citations omitted.
we think a common sense appraisal of the requirements of justice and convenience in this particular context yields the conclusion that the situs of these royalty obligations is the united situs of the garnishees.this conclusion is consistent with the application of the rule ordinarily applied to determine the situs of debtor obligations like these tax and royalty obligations.specifically,courts consistently hold that the situs of a debt obligation is the situs of the debtor this is certainly true in texas,where this garnishment proceeding commenced.see.ry.of swartz,no writ holding that the situs of a debt obligation is the situs of the debtor.this same rule is also applied in other states.see,alliance bond fund grupo mexicano de desarrollo,cir recognizing this rule generally applies under new york law great falls transfer storage pan am.petroleum,cir recognizing the same under the laws of montana and wyoming.furthermore,this rule general operation has been recognized by the supreme court.see,harris balk.
we acknowledge that in these foregoing cases,the courts were determining situs for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction over property subject to a garnishment action,whereas in this case we are considering situs for purposes of determining immunity under the fsia.the congo defendants seize on this distinction,arguing that a different sort of situs calculus should apply in the fsia context as questions that purely concern jurisdiction do not implicate delicate issues concerning the availability of foreign sovereign immunity and comity between nations 
while we agree that the two contexts implicate different issues and interests,we think that these differences are immaterial for present purposes,as we see nothing about the general rule regarding the situs of debt obligations that would frustrate the purpose of the fsia,which is to limit as much as possible disrupting the public acts or jure imperii of sovereigns.connecticut bank,at.specifically,we fail to see how permitting to execute against intangible commercial debt obligations owed by business entities formed and headquartered in the united states interrupts the congo public acts,particularly when the congo has proven more than willing to divert these obligations directly to its commercial creditors in the united states.id.indeed,in an earlier case,we rejected the notion that enforcing general rules like the rule establishing the situs of debtor obligations here against the commercial activities of foreign nations would inappropriately interfere with their sovereignty.we stated 
in their commercial capacities,foreign governments do not exercise powers peculiar to sovereigns.instead,they exercise only those powers that can also be exercised by private citizens.subjecting them in connection with such acts to the same rules of law that apply to private citizens is unlikely to touch very sharply on national nerves.

finally,the interests for which the congo urges protection from interruption are in fact protected by the fsia the property is used for sovereign purposes and not for commercial use,then there can be no action for garnishment in the united states.
seeing no conflict between the application of this ordinary situs rule and the purposes and goals of the fsia,we conclude that this same rule should apply in this context relating to property used commercially.accordingly,we hold that the situs of these tax and royalty obligations is the united states 
to sum up we hold that the district court correctly applied the law of the case doctrine to reject argument that the congo waived fully its claim of sovereign immunity pursuant to the lending agreement.we further hold,however,that the district court erred in concluding that the tax and royalty obligations at issue in this case were not used for commercial purposes in the united states.we also hold that the situs of these obligations is the united states.we have thus determined that both these fsia conditions have been satisfied.these tax and royalty obligations therefore are not protected by sovereign immunity.it follows that the district court erroneously dismissed cause of action and dissolved the writs of garnishment obtained by against the garnishees.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
