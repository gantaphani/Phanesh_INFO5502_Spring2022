in this original proceeding,we address whether the stay on all discovery proceedings code civ,subd.g imposed upon the filing of an motion extends to discovery motions.the proceeding arises by petition for a writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order granting real party plaintiff motion to compel production of documents and the occurrence of a deposition finding a waiver of petitioners objections to the discovery and imposing sanctions of for the petitioners failure to have responded to the discovery.petitioners did not file opposition to the discovery motion but instead filed an motion on the day the opposition was due.the motion was still pending in another department of the superior court when the discovery motion was later heard,when the order was subsequently entered,and on the date petitioners were to comply with the order by providing discovery responses and paying sanctions days later.
as provided under section,subdivision g,upon the filing of an motion,all discovery proceedings in the action are stayed until notice of entry of the trial court ruling on the motion.the parties to this writ proceeding do not dispute that the term discovery proceedings in this context includes the various processes authorized by the civil discovery act,et such as the propounding of interrogatories and document demands and the taking of depositions,or that these proceedings are indeed stayed when a special motion to strike is filed in an action.but they do dispute whether a discovery motion that is pending when an motion is filed is also stayed,and whether the discovery stay imposed by section,subdivision g,generally applies to discovery motions.
we hold that the language of the statute,which we construe broadly and in light of the statute legislative goals and history,must be read to mean that discovery motions,including those that are pending,are also stayed upon the filing of an motion.the trial court here proceeded with the pending discovery motion and issued an order against petitioners compelling discovery,deeming their objections waived,and imposing sanctions against them after their motion was filed and the discovery stay invoked.we accordingly grant petitioners request for writ relief.
statement of the case 
on july,real party in interest plaintiff below berg berg enterprises,llc berg brought an action against petitioners david britts,tony daffer,barry eggers,diana everett,john gerdelman,cliff higgerson,joseph kennedy,and bob williams,as well as another codefendant,john boyle,alleging a single cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.the complaint alleged that petitioners and boyle were former directors of an entity known as pluris,of which berg was a creditor.when pluris,became insolvent,petitioners and boyle allegedly breached their fiduciary duty to berg by liquidating the company through an assignment for the benefit of creditors,rather than through bankruptcy proceedings.
in response to petitioners demurrer to the complaint,berg filed a first amended complaint,which again pleaded the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action and added causes of action for negligent and intentional misrepresentation as species of fraud.berg also served a demand for production of documents on petitioners under section.petitioners responses to both the amended pleading and the demand for production were due on january.on that day,berg also served a notice of taking deposition of petitioner bob williams under section.the notice set the deposition to take place on january,and also demanded the production of documents at the deposition.
in lieu of responding to the complaint or the discovery requests,on january,petitioners filed a special motion to strike under section at berg negligent and intentional misrepresentation causes of action.they also separately demurred to the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action.all parties agreed that the filing of the motion effected a stay on berg pending discovery efforts under section,subdivision g.prior to the hearing on petitioners motions,berg voluntarily dismissed its causes of action,apparently recognizing that the motion to strike those causes of action was well taken.
on february,the trial court randall schneider,by written order,sustained petitioners demurrer with leave to amend.the court determined that berg could not state an individual claim for relief but could amend to plead the claim derivatively.finding that it would have granted the motion had berg not dismissed the fraud causes of action,the court also determined that petitioners were entitled to an award of attorney fees under the statute,the amount thereof to be determined by separate motion,subd.c.also on february,berg renoticed the deposition of bob williams to take place on march.
on march,petitioners served their responses to berg demand for production of documents.the responses were composed of objections,which nevertheless constituted a response under section.on march,berg served by hand delivery notice of entry of the court february order.at the same time,berg contended that the discovery responses served by petitioners the previous day were untimely and that all objections had consequently been waived.berg argued that the responses had been due on february,since the court order indicating how it would have ruled on petitioners motion and finding that they were entitled to attorney fees had been served by the clerk that day,effectively terminating the discovery stay under section,subdivision g.the parties met and conferred on the timeliness and adequacy of petitioners responses,but were unable to resolve their dispute.
on march,petitioners served their objections to the renoticed deposition of bob williams under section.although berg had served the day before a notice of entry of the court order stating how it would have ruled on petitioners motion,the grounds for objection to the deposition included that the stay was still operative.on march,berg for a third time noticed the deposition of bob williams to take place on march.petitioners again objected to the deposition on numerous grounds,which this time did not include that the discovery stay was still in effect.
on march,berg filed its second amended complaint,again pleading a single cause of action against petitioners for breach of fiduciary duty.
on april,berg filed a motion to compel petitioners further responses to its demand for production,to compel williams deposition,and for discovery sanctions.the hearing was set for may.
on april,petitioners applied ex parte for an order extending time to respond by demurrer or motion to the second amended complaint and setting a briefing and hearing schedule for those proceedings.berg opposed the application but expressly requested that if the court were to grant additional time for the petitioners to respond to the amended pleading and petitioners were to file another motion,that the court also allow berg discovery motion to proceed notwithstanding the discoverystay that would be imposed by the statute.the trial court john herlihy issued an order directing petitioners to file their response to the second amended complaint and any intended motion on or before may,with the hearing to take place on june.the court order did not address berg pending discovery motion but,according to petitioners,judge herlihy said at the ex parte hearing that he did not believe that the court had the power to issue berg requested order concerning its pending discovery motion because the legislation was to the contrary.
in compliance with the court order,on may,petitioners filed their demurrer and second motion.but they filed no opposition to berg discovery motion to compel,which was due that same day under section.petitioners claimed they were relieved from filing an opposition due to the stay on discovery proceedings,which was reimposed under the statute upon the filing of their second special motion to strike,subd.g.from may to may,petitioners repeatedly requested berg counsel to notify the court of the discovery stay and to take the discovery motion off calendar.berg counsel refused to do so,asserting that discovery pending before the may filing of petitioners new motion remain ed viable.
on may,two days before the hearing on the discovery motion,petitioners counsel wrote a letter to the discovery judge socrates manoukian informing him of the filing of the motion and of their position that that filing had resulted in a stay on all discovery proceedings,including the pending discovery motion.berg counsel responded the next day by sending his own letter to judge manoukian,which stated counsel belief that the hearing on the motion to compel should proceed.later that day,petitioners counsel wrote another letter to the court responding to berg counsel letter and reasserting that the discovery stay prevented the discovery motion from going forward and relieved them from filing opposition thereto.
meanwhile,on may,the trial court randall schneider heard petitioners motion for an award of fees incurred as a result of their first motion.petitioners had sought fees in the amount of but at the hearing,the court stated its intention to award only.the court rationale in reducing the amount of fees to be awarded was that petitioners had not met and conferred with berg before filing the first motion,which had resulted in berg voluntary dismissal of the targeted fraud causes of action to which the motion had been directed 
on may,the trial court heard berg motion to compel discovery and for sanctions.at the hearing,the judge socrates manoukian expressed irritation that petitioners had not informed him earlier about the filing of the second motion and at a time before he had devoted considerable effort to his evaluation of the motion merits.the court would not allow petitioners to speak to the merits,but instead inquired,repeatedly,why they had elected to file an motion instead of an opposition to the discovery motion.the judge then twice directed petitioners counsel to provide him with authority holding that where a motion to compel has already been filed,the filing of a slapp motion in all circumstances stays the proceedings on the motion to compel.
counsel was unable to do so,but did note that the statute itself states that all discovery proceedings are stayed upon the filing of the motion to strike.the court acknowledged that berg had not filed a motion to allow discovery under section,subdivision g,which permits the court,for good cause,to allow specified discovery while an motion is pending and in order for the plaintiff to respond to it.the court then expressed its belief that petitioners tactic in filing the motion instead of an opposition to the discovery motion was in bad faith and took the matter under submission 
on june,the trial court neal cabrinha heard petitioners second motion and demurrers.at the hearing,the judge orally stated that the motion will be denied.he also said that the c omplaint probably needs some further work but he did not indicate just how he intended to rule on the demurrers.the court then asked counsel for berg to prepare an order denying the motion and took the demurrers under submission.but no written order on the motion was immediately forthcoming.
on august,the trial court socrates manoukian issued a written order,served by the clerk that day,granting berg motion to compel further responses to the demand for production of documents,compelling petitioner williams to appear for deposition,and imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of against petitioners.the order noted that berg motion was not opposed and,further,that petitioners o bjections to discovery are deemed waived.petitioners were ordered to pay the sanctions and to comply with the order within calendar days,by august.
on august,after berg refused to stipulate to a stay of enforcement of the august,discovery order,petitioners applied to the court socrates manoukian ex parte for a stay of enforcement to allow them to request writ relief from this court.that application was denied.
on august,petitioners filed their petition for alternative or peremptory writ of mandate prohibition in this court.they also sought an immediate stay of the discovery order,which this court granted in order to permit further consideration of the issues raised by the petition.this court also requested preliminary opposition from berg as the real party in interest.
on august,the superior court clerk served the trial court neal cabrinha written orders on petitioners second motion and demurrers.the court sustained the demurrers with leave to amend and in light of that ruling,denied the motion as moot.
we issued an order to show cause why the relief prayed for in the petition should not be granted and the matter has now been fully briefed.
discussion 
petitioners contentions and standard of review 
the issue presented by the petition for writ is whether the statute stay on a ll discovery proceedings applies generally to discovery motions,and in particular,those motions already pending at the time the motion is filed,subd.g.petitioners contend that it does and that the trial court erred in proceeding with berg discovery motion to compel and for sanctions while their motion was pending in the action.they assert that even though the statute allows a plaintiff to engage in specified discovery on noticed motion and for good cause shown,berg made no such motion here.petitioners also urge that they have been further prejudiced because while the stay was still in effect,the trial court issued its order directing them to respond to berg discovery requests,imposing monetary sanctions,and finding that petitioners had failed to oppose the motion to compel and had waived their objections and assertions of privilege.
