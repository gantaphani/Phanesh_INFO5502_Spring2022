chepstow filed a lawsuit in the district court alleging that marshall hunt had fraudulently transferred millions of dollars of his assets in order to avoid payment on a prior judgment held by chepstow against him.the complaint alleged that hunt,with some assistance from a georgia company of which he was ceo,transferred a large portion of his assets to his wife,children,and a of whom are also defendants in the violation of georgia fraudulent transfer statutes,ann.repealed july,and the uniform fraudulent transfer act,et effective july.the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and entered final judgment against chepstow.this is chepstow appeal.
in a previous action filed in february,chepstow predecessor in interest,tapir investments bahamas,brought a breach of contract action in the district court against hunt in order to collect on a promissory note.during the pendency of that between february and may acquired all of tapir rights in the action and was substituted as the plaintiff.in may,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of chepstow,and entered final judgment along with a writ of execution against hunt in the amount of.hunt did not appeal.despite chepstow best efforts at collection,its judgment against him remains unsatisfied in an amount exceeding million.
in november,chepstow filed a complaint alleging that hunt,with the knowledge and assistance of the other named defendants,engaged in numerous fraudulent transfers of his assets in order to defeat chepstow efforts to collect its judgment.count of the complaint alleged that hunt had transferred assets to his wife,martha hunt to his children,marshall blair hunt,calvin hunt,hastings hunt,paul hunt,and mary hunt to a georgia limited partnership of which hunt and his wife are general partners,hunt family investments,hfi and to hunt business associate and friend william peterson,all in violation of ann.and the ufta.count also alleged that horizon medical products,horizon,a public company of which hunt is ceo and in which he owned more than of all outstanding shares,aided and abetted hunt in making some of the fraudulent transfers.in count of the complaint,chepstow alleged that hunt,martha,hfi,peterson,and horizon conspired to defraud chepstow and to hinder and delay chepstow collection of its outstanding judgment against hunt through the transfers.
the complaint specifically alleged that hunt fraudulently transferred the following property all of his right,title,and interest in his home valued at million to his wife,martha hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets to martha and his children shares of his stock in horizon to hfi and,assets in a bank account jointly held by both hunt and peterson to an account held solely by peterson.
the defendants filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.they asserted that chepstow complaint failed to state a claim under ann,because that code section had been repealed without reservation by the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta,ann,et.the defendants further asserted that chepstow complaint failed to state a claim based on the ufta because the complaint did not allege any fraudulent transfers occurring after the july,effective date of the ufta.
the district court issued an order dismissing count of the complaint on the ground that the enactment of the ufta without a savings clause preserving not only repealed that provision insofar as future events were concerned,but also cut off all pending claims brought under it.the district court ruled in the alternative that even if were not repealed by the ufta,chepstow had failed to state a claim against horizon in count.the court reasoned that because horizon was neither a debtor nor a transferee,it was not subject to liability under an aider and abettor theory for claims brought pursuant to,because that statute explicitly imposes liability only on debtors and transferees.the district court also dismissed chepstow conspiracy claims in count based on its belief that the underlying count claims alleging fraudulent conveyance failed.having thrown out both counts against all of the defendants,the district court entered final judgment dismissing chepstow complaint.

this case requires us to examine issues concerning the substantive law of georgia.in rendering a decision based on state substantive law,we must decide the case the way it appears the state highest court would.where the state highest court has not spoken to an issue,we must adhere to the decisions of the state intermediate appellate courts absent some persuasive indication that the state highest court would decide the issue otherwise.ernie haire ford,ford motor,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
we first address the question of whether the repeal of ann,which was effected through the enactment of the ufta,retroactively extinguished all pending claims under.the district court thought so,but we think not.
the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta.laws,as codified at to,became part of the georgia code when the governor signed it into law on april.it became effective on july.the ufta repealed and replaced some of the existing georgia fraudulent transfer provisions that had been in effect before its enactment.importantly for this case,the ufta repealed former,which defined the conveyances by debtors that are per se fraudulent.however,the ufta left intact,which provides that the rights of creditors are favored in the courts,and,which provides creditors with the right to attack judgments or conveyances which interfere with their rights.
the district court reasoned that since the ufta repealed and contained no savings clause explicitly preserving causes of action that had already arisen under the provision,it extinguished them one and all.as authority,the district court cited fulton bag cotton mills williams,and gold pioneer fund.the court cited both of those decisions for the proposition that the repeal of a statute without reservation takes away all remedies given by it and even defeats all actions and proceedings pending under it at the time of its repeal,and this is especially so where the statute repealed is one creating a cause of action.gold,at.
the district court was correct about the ufta repealing however,we do not agree with the district court that the repeal extinguished causes of action that had arisen under the repealed section but had not yet made it to final judgment.that is a question of state law,and there is a strong line of georgia precedent establishing that the state constitution forbids the result the district court reached.
article i,section,paragraph x of the georgia constitution provides that n o bill of attainder,ex post facto law,retroactive law,or laws impairing the obligation of contract or making irrevocable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be passed.that provision was construed and applied in dennington mayor of town of roberta.
in dennington,a statute enacted in required the town council of roberta to levy a tax for the purpose of supporting the public schools,including teacher salaries,when the school board recommended that such a tax be levied.id.at.the town council failed to levy the necessary ad valorem tax for the school year beginning in and ending in the summer of.id.at.as a result of that failure,a teacher employed by roberta board of school commissioners was not paid for his services because insufficient funds were available to do so.id.in,the georgia general assembly repealed the statute authorizing the tax levy,and the repealer act did not contain a savings clause.id.at.
in a lawsuit filed by the teacher who had not been paid for his services during the school year,the georgia supreme court held that the repeal of the taxing statute could not constitutionally be given retroactive effect to defeat the vested contractual right of the teacher.id.at.in order to avoid an unconstitutional result,the court construed the repealer legislation to apply prospectively only.id.at.the absence of a savings clause was not a problem for the court because the general rule is that repeal of a statute has no retroactive effect.id.at.as the court explained 
there is a general statute in force in this state,which declares that laws prescribe only for the future they can not impair the obligation of contracts nor generally have a retrospective operation,and we might well treat this code section as the equivalent of a saving clause that a repealing act shall not be given a retrospective operation,so as to destroy vested rights or impair the obligation of contracts.
id.at.in other words,there was a general savings clause in the georgia code that was applicable to all enactments,which made it unnecessary for the general assembly to include a separate savings clause in every piece of legislation.that free standing savings clause is still standing and still has the same effect.see ann.containing materially identical terms to.
the dennington decision has a big impact on the present case for two reasons.first,it establishes that where a right has vested through the occurrence of events giving rise to a claim under a statute,the georgia constitution forbids the legislature from snuffing out that right through the retroactive application of a repealer provision.second,it establishes that a separate savings clause is not necessary in these circumstances,because of the presumption expressed in a georgia statute of general application that a retroactive effect is not intended where vested rights are concerned.
both of these points were reconfirmed in bank of norman park colquitt county.colquitt county deposited in a bank at a time when a georgia statute gave a county deposits precedence for repayment over other depositors in the event the bank became insolvent.id.at.subsequent to the deposit,the statute was repealed with no indication of whether the repeal was to have retroactive effect.id.the bank then failed.id.in a lawsuit by the county to establish priority for its claim,the georgia supreme court held that the county had a vested right under the old statute,the repeal of which should not be given retroactive effect 
the settled rule for the construction of statutes,is not to give them a retrospective operation,unless the language so imperatively requires.furthermore,a repealing act will not be given a retroactive operation,so as to divest previously acquired rights,or to impair the obligation of a contract lawfully made by virtue of and pending the existence of the law repealed.paragraph of section of article of the constitution of this state declares that no retroactive law shall be passed.

in the more recent case of enger erwin,enger brought suit for alienation of affections pursuant to a georgia statute.id.at citing ann.while his suit was pending,the general assembly enacted the family and domestic relations law.laws,which entirely superseded the statute upon which enger claim was based.id.not only that,but the new act abolished the cause of action for alienation of affections,and the act explicitly provided that the abolition would apply to any future proceedings in any pending cases.id.relying on that provision of the new act,the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint.id.the trial court found that retrospective application of the new statute to cut off claims brought pursuant to the previous statute was unconstitutional,and it denied the motion to dismiss.id.the defendant filed an interlocutory appeal to the georgia supreme court.id.
the georgia supreme court in enger cited the general rule that l aws usually may not have retrospective application.id.citing ann,which is currently codified at ann.the court held that when events giving rise to a substantive claim occur prior to the repeal of the statute upon which the claim is based,the plaintiff has a vested right.id.at.the court also held,as it had in the dennington and bank of norman park cases,that vested rights under a statute can not be constitutionally extinguished through the retroactive application of a repealing statute 
a constitutional act of the legislature has been found to be the equivalent of a contract and the rights created thereby may not be impaired by subsequent legislation.although legislation which involves mere procedural or evidentiary changes may operate retrospectively,legislation which affects substantive rights may operate prospectively only.
id.internal citation omitted.consistent with those principles,the enger court held that enger right to bring an action for alienation of affections was a substantive right which had vested at the time of the repeal of this cause of action by the general assembly.therefore,the portion of the statute which made the repeal of the cause of action for alienation of affections retrospective as to pending actions was unconstitutional.id.at see also brown hauser,holding,also in the context of an alienation of affections claim,that a cause of action accrues,and therefore becomes a vested right,not when a suit is filed but when the events occur that give rise to the cause of action citing enger,at.
another case close to point is mullins first general insurance company.there was a georgia statute authorizing the filing of personal injury protection pip claims in excess of the stated amount of pip coverage in an automobile insurance policy if the insurer had failed to inform the insured of the statutory right to accept or waive that coverage.id.at.the georgia general assembly subsequently enacted a repealing statute which eliminated claims for pip coverage in excess of the stated amount of policies regardless of the insurer failure to inform.id.the repealer explicitly stated that it applied to claims based on insurance policies in effect on the date of the repeal and therefore to failures to inform that had occurred prior to the repeal.id.citing enger,the georgia supreme court held that notwithstanding its explicit terms,the repealing statute could not constitutionally be applied retroactively to defeat a claim for the additional pip benefits if the claim was based upon facts that had occurred prior to the effective date of the repealing statute,even where the claim was brought after that effective date.id.at.
from dennington to bank of norman park to enger to mullins,georgia law is clear.repealer legislation is not to be construed to impinge upon vested substantive rights,and no savings clause is necessary to put into effect the strong presumption that repeals are not intended to affect those rights.where the general assembly makes clear its intent to interfere with the vindication of a vested right,that intent will not be given effect,because the georgia constitution forbids it.we do not believe that the general assembly made clear that it intended the repeal of the prior statutes defining creditor rights to apply retroactively,but even if it had expressed that intent,the result would be the same.under georgia law,if a right is substantive and it is vested,it can not be extinguished.
the district court in this case attempted to distinguish the enger and brown decisions on the basis that they and any others involving common law causes of action are different.the court cited no decisions to support that theory of distinction,nor did it explicate a rationale for it.most likely,what the court had in mind is this when a statute that codifies a common law cause of action is repealed,the general rule in some states is that the cause of action continues to exist as it had under the common law in place before the codification.see statutes a right which is embodied in statutory terms exists as an enforceable right exclusive of any statute declaratory of it,and such a right therefore is not abrogated by repeal of the statute.citing jessen state.because the present case involves a statutory right,it is different,or so the reasoning would go.
the problems with that reasoning are several and insurmountable.first,the interests that weigh against the retroactive repeal of statutory rights are just as heavy as those that weigh against retroactive repeal of common law rights.second,there is no hint of support in the georgia supreme court decisions for any theory that vested statutory rights are entitled to less protection under the georgia constitution than vested common law rights.third,mullins involved a vested statutory right,not a common law right,so that decision stands foursquare against any notion that statutory rights are different from common law ones for these purposes.
as we said earlier,the question georgia law poses is whether chepstow rights under ann.were vested and substantive.the answer is yes.they were vested rights,because the alleged actions of the defendants occurred prior to the july,effective date of the ufta and its repealer provision.they were also substantive rights,because s ubstantive law is that law which creates rights,duties,and obligations.polito holland.section provided and still does that c reditors may attack as fraudulent a judgment,conveyance,or any other arrangement interfering with their rights,either at law or in equity.section,before it was repealed by the ufta,defined the conveyances that were considered fraudulent under georgia law.that section,when read along with,gave a creditor a substantive right to overturn a conveyance included in that provision definition of fraudulent conveyance because chepstow rights under were both substantive and vested,under georgia law they could not be extinguished by retroactively applicable legislation.
the two decisions the district court cited to support its ruling on this bag and not support it.
fulton bag involved the general assembly repeal of a statute allowing the deduction of federal income taxes for purposes of calculating state income taxes.at.the repealing statute,which was enacted on december,provided that it was to be applied to all tax years ending on or after february.id.the issue was whether that retroactive application violated the georgia constitution by impinging on vested substantive rights.id.at.the georgia supreme court held that it did not,because a taxpayer has no vested right in tax exemptions which are mere statutory privileges granted as a matter of legislative grace.id.this is the core of the holding in that case 
a person has no vested right in statutory privileges or exemptions an exemption which exists by statute may be reduced or withdrawn by statute exemption is but a statutory or constitutional shield,which being removed,the exposure to process is the same as if it had never been interposed a llowances and deductions of federal income taxes paid is not a right,but a privilege accorded to the taxpayer as a matter of legislative grace.
id.citations and quotation omitted.
the holding of fulton bag that there is no vested right,which is to say no right that can not be retroactively repealed,in a statutory exemption on state income taxes is a one in georgia law.see,motors acceptance jackson,whether and to what extent deductions to a taxation plan are allowed is a matter of legislative grace seaboard coast line blackmon,w here a provision as a matter of grace confers a benefit then there must be strict construction against the taxpayer.brosnan undercofler,deductions on which an income tax is imposed,are allowed as a matter of legislative grace and are authorized only where there is a clear statutory provision for them.internal quotation and citation omitted oxford chance,t he allowance of a deduction or exemption in computing state income tax is a privilege granted by legislative grace.
the present case is different from fulton bag and those other cases involving tax deductions,because the creation of tax deductions is an exercise of legislative grace under which no substantive rights may vest.this case involves the substantive rights of creditors under,and substantive rights can vest and give rise to state constitutional rights against retroactive repeal.thus,this case is like the dennington,bank of norman park,enger,and mullins cases,and it is controlled by those georgia supreme court decisions.see,spengler employers commercial union ins,distinguishing fulton bag on the basis that it involved rights,and holding that the statute in spengler,because it involved a vested right,could not constitutionally be applied retroactively to cut off vested rights.
the second decision relied upon by the district court is the georgia court of appeals decision in gold.there the appellate court rejected the plaintiff argument that the defendant consent to constructive service of process under a repealed procedural statute provided a basis for personal jurisdiction.gold,at.it was an easy decision to make,because the statute under which the plaintiff claimed the right had been repealed long before his cause of action had arisen.id.that is obviously different from the situation we have here where the events giving rise to chepstow claim occurred before was repealed.
gold can also be distinguished on an additional ground.georgia statutes addressing procedural and remedial rights may be retroactively applied.see,polito,at w here a statute governs only procedure of the courts,including the rules of evidence,it is to be given retroactive effect absent an expressed contrary intention.allrid emory,the legislature can constitutionally provide for the retrospective application of a remedial statute provided a time be fixed subsequent to the passage of the statute which allows citizens affected by it a reasonable time to protect their rights.quotation and citation omitted.the gold case falls within that exception because it involved purely procedural rights.
because chepstow rights under were substantive in nature and vested prior to the repeal of that provision,unlike the rights at issue in fulton bag and gold,chepstow rights fall under no recognized exception to georgia constitutional prohibition against the retroactive elimination by statute of vested substantive rights.
in a recent case,miller lomax,the georgia court of appeals indicated that transfers could be challenged under the ufta itself.neither party had suggested that approach in the miller case,and the opinion offers little by way of explanation for it.the only reasoning given by the georgia court of appeals for its statement that the ufta applies,and does not,to events occurring before the effective date of the ufta,id.at,is contained in a,which says 
in their briefs in the superior court,lee miller and the other plaintiffs specifically rely on ann.and,but ann,entitled,conveyances by debtors deemed fraudulent,was repealed effective july.i t is the general rule that the appellate court shall apply the law as it exists at the time of its judgment,absent impairment of vested rights under the previous law.id.quoting pine pointe housing,lowndes county bd.of tax assessors.
id.at.unless there is a decision by the state supreme court on point,we follow decisions by the intermediate appellate court of the state except where there is strong indication that the state supreme court would decide the matter differently.see ernie haire ford,at.
we asked for the views of the parties in this case on the miller court statement about the ufta substantive provisions applying to this case,and this is one matter about which they agree they collectively urge that we not follow that statement in miller,which they characterize as dictum because the result would have been the same in that case regardless of whether law or the ufta substantive provisions themselves applied the parties are united behind the position that miller does not mandate the application of the ufta new substantive provisions to the events in this ca
