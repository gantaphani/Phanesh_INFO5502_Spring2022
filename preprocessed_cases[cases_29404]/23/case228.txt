sobranes recovery pool i,llc sobranes,as assignee of the federal deposit insurance company fdic,sought to execute on a judgment entered against todd hughes construction company thcc and randall hughes collectively,defendants in favor of the fdic under the federal debt collection procedures act fdcpa the district court held that sobranes could not invoke the fdcpa.we affirm,although on grounds different from those relied on by the district court.
in june,thcc executed an all inclusive deed of trust note the note in favor of western savings association for million.the note matured on june.in june,thcc executed an extension of real estate note and lien,renewing the note and extending the maturity date to july.when thcc renewed the note,hughes,gordon todd,and thomas todd each guaranteed the note.in july,thcc,western savings association,and bbc olympic agreed to an assumption and consent agreement and modification of real estate note and lien,under which bbc olympic assumed without recourse the note and obligations of thcc.the assumption note was to mature on june.
however,in september,western savings association was placed into receivership and its the notes and guarantees involved transferred by the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic to western federal savings and loan association western federal.then,in august,western federal was placed into receivership,and its including the notes and guarantees involved transferred to sunbelt savings,fsb,by the fslic.sunbelt savings transferred the notes and guarantees back to the fslic in december.thcc and the guarantors defaulted on their obligations under the notes and guarantees.
in august,congress abolished the fslic and appointed the fdic as manager of the fslic resolution fund the fdic thus came into possession of the notes and guarantees,and in august,the fdic brought suit against thcc,todd,todd,and hughes to recover on the note and guarantees.the fdic filed an amended complaint in march,adding todd todd development company as a defendant and asserting additional claims against todd,todd,and hughes,in order to recover on another promissory note and guarantee agreements the district court entered judgment in favor of the fdic in october,and an abstract of judgment was filed in january.
the fdic did not execute on the judgment itself,but rather assigned the judgment to recoveredge,lp.recoveredge then assigned the judgment to lawyers recovery litigation services.on october,lawyers recovery assigned the judgment to sobranes the district court received notice of the assignment on january.during the series of assignments,a writ of execution issued in april.
on july,sobranes,turning to enforcement of the judgment,filed a motion requesting declaratory judgment,appointment of a receiver,or an accounting.sobranes sought a declaration that assets held by hughes wife,melanie hughes,pursuant to an agreement partitioning community property,were subject to execution to satisfy the judgment.it also sought to have the successor entities to thcc placed in receivership,and in the alternative requested an accounting of assets held by hughes,his wife,and the successor entities.hughes and the successor entities were not parties to the fdic judgment.
hughes and the successor companies argued,inter alia,that even though a writ of execution issued in april,it came too late as texas law required the writ to issue within ten years from entry of judgment to prevent it from going dormant,and that sobranes could not invoke the fdcpa to evade the state.sobranes countered that execution of the judgment in the hands of the fdic would face no limitations period under the fdcpa,and as the fdic assignee,it should have the same benefit.the district court referred the requests to a magistrate judge.
the magistrate recommended denying sobranes motion,concluding that the judgment is not a debt under the fdcpa because the underlying notes and guarantees were between private parties that under federal rule of civil procedure a,state law governed the time limits on execution,and execution was under texas law because no writ of execution issued within ten years of the entry of judgment and there were no grounds for revival.
the district court agreed with the recommended denial of relief,but on different grounds.the court explained that sobranes has not identified and the court has not located any instance where a private party such as sobranes,as assignee or otherwise,has been held to be entitled to recover judgment on a debt,or otherwise to assert rights or benefits under the fdcpa.rather,the court concluded that the case law indicated that the united states was the proper party to invoke the benefits of the fdcpa.the court thus adopt ed the magistrate judge recommendation to deny sobranes motion on the limited ground that sobranes has failed to demonstrate that it is a proper party to invoke fdcpa and that it therefore can not rely on the fdcpa to establish that the judgment is not dormant under texas law.sobranes appeals.
before turning to the merits,we address three preliminary issues.
although neither party questions our jurisdiction,we have an independent duty to consider it,and given the unusual procedural history of this case,we pause on the issue gives this court jurisdiction to review final decisions of the district courts.a final decision generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.
sobranes brief and reply brief are in not over whether the district court order is a final decision.in its statement of jurisdiction,sobranes writes,the parties in the underlying proceeding agreed,and the trial court agreed,that the judgment is dormant if texas law applies,and it is not dormant if the fdcpa controls.thus,sobranes explains,because the judgment is dormant under texas law,the district court ruling that the fdcpa is inapplicable is dispositive.in its reply brief,sobranes comes about face,arguing that the issue of dormancy was never decided below,the issue of dormancy is not before this court,and this court should remand on the issue.but if this be so,then this court is without jurisdiction because the district court never reached the dispositive issue remaining in the case.rather,the district court only made an antecedent ruling on the applicable law,and the applicability of the fdcpa is not effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.
a close reading of the district court ruling,the magistrate recommendation and report,and the parties filings persuade us that the district court did rule that the judgment is dormant under texas law.
in recommending that sobranes motion be denied,the magistrate specifically considered whether the judgment is dormant,concluding that it is.thus,the magistrate decision squarely placed the issue before the district sobranes objections to the magistrate decision explicitly made the argument that the judgment is not dormant because of the fdcpa.
before analyzing the applicability of the fdcpa,the district court framed the issue before it as sobranes objection to the magistrate judge conclusion that the judgment is dormant,and noted that the parties also agree that the judgment is dormant if texas law applies.the district court adopted the magistrate recommendation,concluding that sobranes therefore can not rely on the fdcpa to establish that the judgment is not dormant under texas law.the district court specifically limited its departure from the magistrate recommendation to the fdcpa analysis,leaving untouched the magistrate analysis of the dormancy issue.it is not surprising that the district court did not include a detailed analysis of whether the judgment is dormant under texas law as the parties conceded that it is,a concession sobranes again makes in its statement of jurisdiction in its opening brief.
as the district court in substance held that sobranes is from executing on the judgment,its order is a final decision,and we have jurisdiction.
the central question is whether sobranes is entitled to invoke the fdcpa.as this is a question of statutory interpretation,our review is de novo 
sobranes argues that resolving the issue of whether the judgment is a debt within the meaning of the fdcpa would not properly dispose of this appeal because the district court did not address it.it is an elementary proposition,and the supporting cases too numerous to cite,that this court may affirm the district court judgment on any grounds supported by the record which we elect to do.
congress passed the fdcpa to create a comprehensive statutory framework for the collection of debts owed to the united states government.congress sought to alleviate the burden on the federal government of navigating the different collection schemes in each state and lessen the effect of delinquent debts on the massive federal budget deficit now undermining the economic of the nation.
important as these concerns are,congress did not create a statutory scheme without limit,but rather cabined the types of the parlance of the statute,debts that trigger the fdcpa.the statute provides the exclusive civil procedures for the united states to recover a judgment on a debt.the statute is specific in that it applies only to debts,as c makes clear this chapter shall not apply with respect to an amount owing that is not a debt or to a claim for an amount owing that is not a debt.the statute defines a debt as 
a an amount that is owing to the united states on account of a direct loan,or loan insured or guaranteed,by the united states or 
b an amount that is owing to the united states on account of a fee,duty,lease,rent,service,sale of real or personal property,overpayment,fine,assessment,penalty,restitution,damages,interest,tax,bail bond forfeiture,reimbursement,recovery of a cost incurred by the united states,or other source of indebtedness to the united states,but that is not owing under the terms of a contract originally entered into by only persons other than the united states 
defendants argue that the judgment is not an fdcpa debt.they explain that the underlying notes were agreements between private parties that the fdic acquired only through the failure of a private savings and loan institution.neither the acquisition of the notes by the fdic nor the fdic obtaining a judgment on the notes,they continue,created fdcpa debts.
sobranes briefs did not address the merits of the issue.during oral argument,sobranes counsel conceded that subpart b was not applicable,but urged that the judgment is a debt within the meaning of subpart a.however,in its objections to the magistrate recommendations,sobranes argued that the judgment is a debt under subpart b.as sobranes explained in its objections brief,
the text of the fdcpa is clear and unambiguous,a debt is an amount owing the united states on account of fine,assessment,penalty,restitution,damages,interest or other source of indebtedness to the united states.as found by the fifth circuit,a judgment entered in the name of the united states is an amount owing the united states,and therefore is a debt subject to the provisions of the fdcpa as a judgment entered in the name of the fdic is only owed by the judgment debtor to the fdic a judgment entered in the name of the fdic is an amount owing to the united states and is therefore a debt 
to be clear,we address the definition of debt under both subparts a and b.
the starting point of our analysis is,as always,the text of the statute itself we begin with an observation regarding the phrase an amount that is owing to the united states on account of,a phrase which appears in both subparts.the phrase is not a freestanding definition of what constitutes a debt.if the phrase were,then there would be neither a need for a two part definition nor any of the other language that appears in either subpart.we can not interpret a statute in such a way as to render significant portions of it a nullity rather,the amounts owing to the united states that are qualifying debts are defined by reference to the language following the phrase as indicated by the qualifying language on account of.
subpart a contemplates two separate types of amounts owing to the united states those that result from direct loans by the united states and those that result from loans insured or guaranteed by the united states.the former is not implicated here as the government did not make any loans.
nor is the latter applicable.the phrase insured or guaranteed by the united states indicates that the types of loans covered are those where the federal government has agreed to cover a lender losses in the event the debtor defaults this common sense reading is supported by the definitions of insure and guarantee black law dictionary defines,in relevant part,insure as t o secure the payment of a sum of money in the event of a loss,and guarantee as an assurance that a contract or legal act will be duly carried out.sobranes points to no evidence,nor have we found any,that the government insured or guaranteed the underlying loan to thcc,that this was anything but a private loan by a private institution.and,of course,the judgment entered against defendants is not a loan at or otherwise.
sobranes has argued that because western savings association was a federally insured institution,the note fell within the ambit of loans insured or guaranteed by the united states.this,however,misreads the definition.the definition does not focus on whether the lending institution itself is federally insured,but rather focuses on whether the united states has insured or guaranteed the loan.nor does it matter,as sobranes has suggested,that the fdic took possession of the note through receivership.as the holder of the note,this meant that the fdic might bear the loss if the debtor defaulted,but it does not mean that the fdic began to insure or guarantee the note the government did not alter the terms of note and guarantee to pay anyone for losses suffered in the event the debtor defaulted.
nor can sobranes find succor under subpart b of the definition.the bulk of subpart b is written in broad language,capturing numerous forms of debt indeed,the definition contains a final,provision for other source of indebtedness to the united states.however,the final clause of the subpart contains important limiting language but that is not owing under the terms of a contract originally entered into by only persons other than the united states.the most natural reading of the definition is that the final clause limits all of subpart b and not simply the provision.
although under the last antecedent rule,a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows,it is not an unyielding rule there is a grammatical corollary when there is a serial list followed by modifying language that is set off from the last item in the list by a comma,this suggests that the modification applies to the whole list and not only the last item the parallel phrasing in the subpart confirms this reading.the list of qualifying types of debts begins with the phrase an amount that is owing and the limiting clause begins with the parallel language but that is not owing.the final clause,therefore,pulls out from the definition those amounts owing to the united states that find their genesis in contracts where the united states was not an original party.
the subpart b limitation is directly applicable to this case the note underlying the fdic judgment was originally entered into by only private parties.thus,even though a judgment obtained by the government can fall within the scope of subpart b,the final clause prevents the judgment here from being an fdcpa debt.the limitation does not give way because the fdic came into possession of the note,sued to recover on it,and obtained a judgment.the judgment does not create an obligation between the debtor and holder that is independent of the note.that is,the note establishes the rights and liabilities of the parties,what is owed and to whom.a subsequent lawsuit and judgment enforce the terms of the note.the subpart b limitation captures this relationship and applies it where the united states was not a party to the underlying contract.
other provisions of the statute support this interpretation.the sc
