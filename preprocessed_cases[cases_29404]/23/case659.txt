dennis wise and joan macfarlane together the wises were represented by the law firm,defendant dla piper llc us that aided them in obtaining a judgment in against william cheng.however,dla did not advise the wises of the necessity to renew the judgment,and after the judgment became unenforceable.the wises brought this action alleging malpractice and obtained a judgment against dla.on appeal,dla contends the evidence is insufficient to support the judgment against it because there was no evidence the wises judgment against cheng would have been collectable even had it been renewed.dla also contends on appeal there was no substantial evidence the statute of limitations on the malpractice claim had been tolled by continuous representation,the special verdict form was fatally flawed because it did not submit to the jury the issue of whether there had been continuous representation within four years of filing the complaint,and even assuming the judgment as to liability and damages was proper,there was no legal basis for the award of attorney fees against dla.we do not reach these contentions because of our conclusion that there was no substantial evidence the judgment against cheng was collectable.
factual backgrounda.dla representation of the wises in the cheng matter 
in,the wises loaned to cheng,who signed two promissory notes.however,cheng defaulted on the notes,and later filed for bankruptcy.
the wises retained their attorney,robert copeland,for assistance.copeland,a dla attorney,referred the matter to breslauer a fellow dla attorney to handle the bankruptcy issues.dla filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court contesting the dischargeability of the debt owed by cheng,alleging the loans were intended to be used for cheng business but cheng had embezzled the money for his own use.the wises and cheng ultimately settled the complaint,with cheng agreeing to reaffirm the debt,to commence making payments on the new obligation commencing in mid,and to stipulate that a judgment be entered against cheng in state court in the event he defaulted on his new payment obligations.
cheng made no payments on the debt.accordingly,dla obtained a state court judgment against cheng,entered on august,for.dla attorney breslauer,who represented the wises in obtaining the judgment,told them we have got this judgment,it good forever,until the cows come home.breslauer also told the wises w e will keep our ears to the ground and we can come back and bring in cheng for examinations from time to time,every six months,or surely once a year,if we want,just for harassment purposes even,if you want to.however,dla did not inform the wises the judgment would become invalid if not renewed within years.
in,dla pursued collection efforts but determined cheng was dead broke,and a report from an asset search firm reported cheng had no assets,had numerous other creditors,had been sued in numerous other proceedings,and had state and federal tax liens filed against him.breslauer sent the asset search report to the wises,and stated that if they were aware of any banking relationships not reflected in the report,they should contact breslauer and dla would follow up.the wises did not ask dla to do anything further to collect the judgment,because there was nothing else to do unless something new came up.
copeland left dla in mid and took some of the wises matters with him to his new firm.however,the wises instructed that the cheng bankruptcy issues were to remain with breslauer at dla.when breslauer left dla at the end of,the cheng bankruptcy matters apparently remained with dla,because dla attorney rubin wrote to the wises in april explaining the status of the cheng bankruptcy and told them they would receive a final distribution check later in the year,and that the remainder of your judgment will survive this bankruptcy and is enforceable against cheng assets.rubin stated she would continue to monitor this case but told the wises it is likely you will not receive any further notices except the one to allow the creditor distribution.
in late,dla attorney zander sent a letter to the wises enclosing a check from the bankruptcy trustee for,representing the final distribution on your claim in the cheng bankruptcy case.dla sent no further bills to the wises on the cheng matter,although rubin did send another letter to them in march that enclosed a small check from the bankruptcy trustee and stated a pparently,this is the final distribution give me a call if there is anything else we can do for you.
the wises had no further contact with dla until.although dla closed the cheng file administratively,dla did not notify the wises it had ceased representing them.
subsequent events 
the wises divorced in.when dividing their marital assets,they contacted copeland at his new firm to help accomplish the division and assignment of the cheng judgment,with each receiving.copeland new firm appeared as counsel of record for the wises in the state court lawsuit in which the judgment against cheng had been obtained and accomplished the division and assignment later in.copeland did not advise the wises of the need to renew the judgment within years.
in,the judgment expired as a matter of law.at trial,dla stipulated its representation of the wises fell below the standard of care because it did not inform them of the need to renew the judgment or calendar the year expiration date on the judgment.in,the wises discovered the judgment had been allowed to expire,and filed the present action against dla within one year of that discovery.
evidence of collectability cheng postbankruptcy financial condition 
at trial,cheng testified he has not owned any bank accounts,real estate,or any other assets since his bankruptcy proceedings.he previously was licensed as a cpa,but relinquished that license in the in part because he could not afford to pay for the continuing education requirements.he had not filed a personal tax return in years since his bankruptcy,the only money he has received to support his lifestyle was derived from three sources financial support from his parents until they passed away six years before trial without leaving any estate to cheng,social security payments of approximately per month,and funds from investors in corporations cheng had formed.cheng also testified that,for the foreseeable future,the only money he would have coming to him would be social security payments and proceeds from investors in the corporations.although cheng also stated he would be paid from ibm sales,he testified he had a nonexclusive arrangement to market ibm products and services and would be paid only if he sold an ibm product,had no commitments from any customers to purchase ibm products,and had been working with ibm for years and had never been paid anything by ibm.
cheng has a proven ability to convince investors to invest in corporate entities he has formed.between and,he raised at least million from investors in oscn and its subsidiaries,although cheng estimated it was closer to million.all of these investment monies,in return for which the investors received stock in the entities,were paid into the corporations and were spent on operating expenses for the entities.the operating expenses paid for by funds invested in oscn included the rent on the la jolla house where cheng lived,and his multiple trips to china.none of the funds were given to cheng personally.by the time of trial,oscn had less than in its bank account.cheng biggest investor,white,had invested approximately over the years and,although he had put other investors in contact with cheng,he cautioned them they had to be willing to take a risk on any funds invested.by the time of trial,white had written off most of his investments because t here was no viable evidence that it was worth anything at that point,and white had told an investigator that nothing has happened since the beginning of the stock,so i consider it worthless.cheng agreed the stock was worthless and could be used to wallpaper bathrooms.
cheng testified that,if any of these businesses takes off and makes money,he would receive millions in back salary.however,none of the companies have any contracts or agreements,and cheng described the companies as dead without an infusion of new investment funds.since the stock market crash of,cheng has had difficulty raising money from investors.cheng was specifically asked about solicitation materials he gave to a potential investor in seeking to persuade new investments in his companies.cheng conceded the companies listed in those solicitation materials were dead,dormant,or had never even been formed.until or thereabouts the only money cheng could count on receiving was from social security.
expert opinions on collectability 
plaintiff expert 
joel selik,a collection attorney,testified for the wises that the cheng judgment could have been collected in the past and might be collectable in the future.selik premised his opinion on past collectability on several facts.first,selik testified it appears that cheng had at least million dollars,probably more since he gave a million to ohio state,because white had invested approximately so it was absolutely uncontroverted that cheng had money that could have been reached by piercing the corporate veil and all that money we be able to collect,and piercing would have been very easy in this particular case.
second,selik testified that although he had seen neither the deed to nor lease for the la jolla home in which cheng lived,there was a probability based on the length of time cheng had lived there and the amount of rent paid he had an ownership interest in the home on which a creditor could levy.third,selik relied on cheng statement that he donated million to his alma mater as indicative that cheng had substantial assets after the bankruptcy,although selik conceded he did not independently verify either the accuracy of cheng claim,or whether donations were made after rather than before cheng bankruptcy.cheng,a graduate of ohio state university,testified he donated over million to the university o ver the years,and had also raised significant funds for ohio state.however,there was no evidence these funds were donated after the wises judgment had lapsed.indeed,although cheng received a pacesetter award from ohio state fisher college of business,that award was conferred in,and cheng testified he had left the board of an ohio state alumni group after the bankruptcy.
fourth,selik relied on cheng testimony that he cheng had made multiple trips to china after the bankruptcy as indicating he was spending a lot of money.the only evidence for the funding of these trips was that cheng used investor money for them,and selik testimony contained no mention of any factual basis for his belief that cheng used personal resources for them.indeed,selik conceded he had not conducted an asset search on cheng,but nevertheless stated when asked how cheng could have paid the judgment in response to pressure from his investors that w e have a few possible sources and a few out there in the ether that i suspect.
fifth,selik expressed the opinion that cheng had money hidden in foreign bank accounts,although he conceded we have no evidence of that.finally,selik believed a determined collections effort could have included subpoenas requiring cheng investors to appear at debtor examinations,and these examinations would have induced the investors either to put pressure on cheng to pay the judgment or,alternatively,to loan cheng the money to pay the wises.
on appeal,the wises claim without citation to the record cheng testified that if he had been aggressively pursued,he would have come up with enough money to fully satisfy the judgment.we disregard this testimony in our analysis for several reasons.first,the wises malpractice claim was not that dla should have aggressively pursued collection efforts before the judgment expired in late,and therefore cheng purported ability to raise funds to pay the judgment before that date has no relevance to whether the wises showed the judgment would have been collectable had it not expired.
second,cheng what if surmises are doubly speculative,because it asks him to speculate both as to what he would have done,and to how others would have reacted to what he might have done sargon enterprises,university of southern california cal th,d,and speculation is not evidence,less still substantial evidence.people berryman cal th,d,disapproved on other grounds bypeople hill cal th,fn,d.
finally,and most importantly,cheng did not testify he would have come up with enough money to fully satisfy the judgment had he been pursued after.instead,the wises apparently refer to a declaration not included in the record on appeal prepared by their counsel and signed by cheng that stated i am certain that if i had asked,i could have and would have obtained stock equity investments from oscn investors to satisfy the entire judgment cheng actual testimony,however,was that by the time he signed the declaration he was not getting much money anymore from investors because of the recession.moreover,when specifically asked about the statement that he would have obtained money from investors to pay the judgment,cheng actually testified he would ask my investors to take their money and satisfy the judgment italics added,nor would he have gotten anywhere with such a request,nor would he have used investments made in the corporations to pay the wises because t hat what ponzi schemes do.
selik opinion on future collectability was based on a single overarching theme because cheng had been able to convince some very important men to invest in his business proposals in the past,cheng would likely be able to obtain investors in his new business schemes in the future.after describing the various business schemes being touted by cheng as future avenues for investors selik stated cheng is either the person to make them go or he is a scam artist and i do know the answer to that question.although selik conceded there are a lot of indices of scam artistry by cheng,selik explained it made no difference to his opinion on future collectability whether or not cheng is a scam artist or if he for real,because i f he really going forward,then we might have something in the millions and millions and millions to go after.if he just a scam artist,it probably just a few million dollars in investments that we will be going after.specifically,selik explained i f he scamming people for business deals,my obligation as a collection attorney is to the client.i will be there to get the money that he scamming from somebody else.
defendant expert 
miles grant,a collection attorney,testified for dla that the judgment could not have been collected in the past or in the future.grant conducted an extensive investigation of cheng assets,which selik described as excellent,and determined that cheng has been broke and has never had any assets since.cheng owns no bank accounts in his name,drives a car registered in the name of one of his companies against which debt is owed,and lives in a rental unit in which he had no ownership interest not in good condition and furnished with quite old furniture.
grant explained that a primary theme of selik opinion regarding collectability a creditor may use reverse alter ego to reach corporate assets to satisfy debts incurred by a shareholder of the corporate entity is an incorrect theory because the theory is no longer available to creditors.grant also testified selik theory that the creditor could have subpoenaed cheng investors for debtor examinations and thereby pressured his investors to lend money to cheng or pressured cheng to pay the judgment faced numerous factual and legal obstacles first,the identities of the investors would be unknown to the creditor unless cheng cooperated with the creditor second,many judges would not permit a creditor to subpoena investors because of the statutory limitations on such subpoenas finally,it is purely speculative that investors would then have given or loaned cheng an additional million with which to pay the judgment.
relevant legal principlesa.substantive law the issue of collectability 
the elements of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence are the duty of the professional to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence.budd nixen cal d.a showing of the last element of damage requires the plaintiff to prove that careful management of a lawsuit would have resulted in a favorable judgment and collection thereof because there is no damage in the absence of these latter elements.campbell magana d.accord,dipalma seldman th,d dipalma where alleged malpractice consists of mishandling a client claim plaintiff must show proper prosecution would have resulted in favorable judgment and collection thereof.
the element of collectibility requires a showing of the debtor solvency.w here a claim is alleged to have been lost by an attorney negligence,to recover more than nominal damages it must be shown that it was a valid subsisting debt,and that the debtor was solvent.citation.quoting lally kuster cal,italics added by dipalma citations.the loss of a collectible judgment by definition means the lost opportunity to collect a money judgment from a solvent defendant and is certainly legally sufficient evidence of actual damage.quoting jackson johnson th,d,dis.opn.of johnson,dipalma,supra,th at,d.
the plaintiff in a malpractice action must establish that the underlying judgment lost as the result of the attorney error could have been collected.garretson harold miller th,d.as this court explained in hecht,solberg,robinson,goldberg bagley,llp superior court th,d 
although such a plaintiff is not required to offer proof that establishes causation with absolute certainty,a plaintiff is still required to introduce evidence which affords a reasonable basis for the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the result.citation.quoting viner sweet cal th,d.in this sense,collectibility of the hypothetical underlying judgment against the named defendant is a component of the plaintiff current case relating to damages,as caused by the current negligent attorney defendant,and is a inquiry.
it is useful to consider the various factors bearing upon the issue of collectibility of an underlying judgment,to establish the proper guidelines for discovery.collectibility is part of the plaintiff case,and a component of the causation and damages showing,rather than an affirmative defense which the attorney defendants must demonstrate.citations.collectibility is not a question only of the solvency of the defendant in an underlying case,such as in bankruptcy,but rather pertains to the defendant ability to pay a judgment or some part of it.citing mallen smith,legal malpractice ed.collectibility thus looks to the actual circumstances to determine whether the judgment would have been collectable.id.at,fn.it is not enough for a plaintiff to present speculation or assumptions about an underlying defendant ability to respond in damages,as opposed to proof of same.citation.admissible evidence on collectibility can include information about the basic solvency of the defendant in the underlying case,as shown by its assets,net worth or available proceeds from investments.italics added.
when the plaintiff does not introduce evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude,to a reasonable degree of certainty,the judgment would have been collectable,a verdict in favor of the plaintiff must be reversed.filbin fitzgerald th,d accord,garretson harold miller,supra,th at,d affirming grant of jnov where no evidence of collectability introduced.
standard of appellate review 
on appeal,a jury findings on collectability are reviewed for substantial evidence.garretson harold miller,supra,th at,d.we review the evidence most favorably to the findings,resolving all conflicts and indulging all inferences in support of the judgment.in re marriage of mix cal d.although it is true that the testimony of a single witness,including the testimony of an expert,may be sufficient to constitute substantial evidence leslie perry associates th,d,when an expert bases his or her conclusion on factors that are speculative,remote or conjectural,or on assumptions not supported by the record,the expert opinion can not rise to the dignity of substantial evidence and a judgment based solely on that opinion must be reversed for lack of substantial evidence.pacific gas electric zuckerman d.pacific gas accord,leslie perry associates,supra.similarly,a n expert opinion that assumes an incorrect legal theory can not constitute substantial evidence.corrales corrales th,d corrales.
a demonstration of collectability here whether cheng was able to pay some or all of the judgment required the wises to introduce admissible evidence rather than speculation or assumptions as to the actual circumstances to determine whether the judgment would have been collectable and can include information about the basic solvency of the defendant in the underlying case,as shown by his or her assets,net worth or available proceeds from investments.hecht,solberg,robinson,goldberg bagley llp superior court,supra,th at,d.it appears the only evidence concerning cheng personal net worth,income,or other assets came from the testimonies of cheng,grant,and selik.grant asset search revealed cheng owns no bank accounts in his own name,has been broke since,and has had no assets since.cheng trial testimony,confirming this assessment,also verified he has not filed a personal income tax return in years,and has funded his lifestyle over those years from social security,gifts from his parents,and money invested by third parties in his various corporate entities.the wises contrary showing contained no affirmative evidence cheng has owned any assets in his own name since.on appeal,the wises argue the testimony of one witness can be substantial evidence and the jury could have decided that cheng was lying when he denied having any assets or any current ability to pay the judgment.true as that may be,disbelief of his testimony does not constitute affirmative evidence of the contrary proposition viner sweet th,d,and hence the determination that cheng was not credible simply means his testimony has no more effect than if it had not been given.it disappears from the case hicks reis cal d.
the wises rely principally on selik testimony that the judgment against cheng was collectable in the past and would be collectable in the future,to assert there was substantial evidence to support the finding of collectability.we have examined all of the bases on which selik relied for his opinions and conclude,for the following reasons,his opinion does not provide substantial evidence to support the finding of collectability.
the principal thrust of selik testimony regarding past and future collectability was that the wises could have used reverse piercing and obtained funds placed in the corporate entities by investors to satisfy the judgment against cheng.on appeal,the wises assert reverse piercing was not the only,or arguably not even a significant basis,for selik opinion.however,the first example they cited on appeal for selik other bases for his opinion on collectability was selik testimony that a creditor can file a motion to amend the judgment to include the corporate entity or file a separate lawsuit.selik did not state those were alternatives to reverse corporate piercing,but instead testified those were the methods he would have employed to effect a reverse corporate piercing.moreover,it is irrelevant to our analysis whether reverse piercing was the principal predicate for selik opinion,or was merely one of many bases for his opinion,because our evaluation of whether substantial evidence supports the judgment requires an examination of whether he had some basis for concluding the judgment would have been collectable.
however,as dla appellate brief convincingly argues,the law precludes the wises from employing reverse piercing to obtain funds paid by third party investors into cheng corporate entities to satisfy cheng personal debts.postal instant press,kaswa th,d a third party creditor may not pierce the co
