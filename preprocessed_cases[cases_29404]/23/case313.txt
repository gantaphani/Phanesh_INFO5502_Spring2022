this is a case of first impression in this circuit,involving the question of whether michigan state correctional facility reimbursement act scfra,in conjunction with other michigan laws and with directives from the michigan department of corrections mdoc,runs afoul of the federal employee retirement income security act erisa in cases where prisoners refuse to inform their pension plans of a change of address.the combined effect of the michigan laws requires wardens to notify pension plans that they should send the prisoner benefit payments to the institutional address of that prisoner.when a pension payment is received at the prison,it is deposited into the prisoner institutional account.scfra then allows the warden to garnish up to of each deposit to reimburse the state of michigan for the costs of caring for the prisoner.
in this case,the daimlerchrysler corporation,as the fiduciary of its pension plan,brought a declaratory action to void orders and notices,issued pursuant to scfra,that informed daimlerchrysler that it should send benefit payments to the prisoners institutional addresses.the district court invalidated the orders and notices as violations of erisa provision,but only to the extent that daimlerchrysler is required to send or make payments of pension plan benefits to any address or account other than as designated by the participants of the pension plan,under pension plan terms.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
michigan reimbursement laws 
in michigan,inmates are permitted to receive mail only at the correctional facility where they are incarcerated.a directive issued by the mdoc also prohibits prisoners from possessing accounts at financial institutions,so prisoners must keep all of their assets in their institutional accounts.of corrections policy directive.funds credited to a prisoner account may be used only in accordance with this directive.id.
michigan enacted scfra to reimburse the state for the costs of detaining and providing for its prisoners.under scfra,the attorney general may seek reimbursement for expenses incurred during a prisoner incarceration by filing a complaint against the prisoner in the state trial court.comp.laws.the court,after considering any legal or moral obligations of the prisoner to support any dependents,may order the prisoner to reimburse the state for the costs of incarceration in an amount up to of the prisoner assets.comp.laws.a prisoner assets include his pension benefits.comp.laws a a.
scfra also provides mechanisms for ensuring that a prisoner assets are used to reimburse the state.pursuant to of the michigan compiled laws,the state court may order any person,corporation,or entity having custody of a prisoner assets to appropriate and apply the assets or a portion thereof toward reimbursing the state.but this specific provision of scfra is not applicable where,as in the present case,a prisoner assets are held by a private pension plan.application of in those cases would violate erisa provision,which states that each plan must provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.d.instead,in order to recover a prisoner benefits held by a private pension plan,the state utilizes scfra in conjunction with other michigan laws and with mdoc prison directives.this combination of laws and directives is at issue in the present case.
under scfra,the attorney general first pursues a judgment against the prisoner and is awarded a percentage of the prisoner pension payments.see.comp.laws.the court then orders the prisoner to inform his or her pension plan that any benefit payments should be sent to the institutional address.if the prisoner refuses to comply,the warden of the prisoner institution must send a copy of the order to the pension plan.the order serves to notify the pension plan of the prisoner institutional address.once payments are received at the prison,they are automatically deposited into the prisoner institutional account.
orders and notices at issue 
in the present case,four michigan cotter,alvin jenkins,jessy matthews,and harold receiving benefit payments from the daimlerchrysler pension agreement pension plan.after jay rising,the state treasurer,filed actions against the prisoners for reimbursement pursuant to scfra,the prisoners were each ordered by the court to notify daimlerchrysler that their pension benefit payments should be mailed to them at their new institutional address.each order then stated,in slightly modified form,the following 
if the defendant prisoner shall fail or refuse to notify daimlerchrysler corporation of his current legal prison address,or any future prison address,the warden or his representative of the correctional facility where the prisoner is confined shall serve a copy of this order,along with certification of the address of the correctional facility upon the daimlerchrysler corporation,and this shall serve as notification to daimlerchrysler corporation of the prisoner legal address where the prisoner is to receive his pension benefits.
the orders then require the warden to make monthly distributions to the state of michigan in the amount of of any monies deposited into the prisoner account.
three of the,matthews,and not comply with the court orders requiring them to inform daimlerchrysler to send their benefit payments to their prison addresses.the fourth prisoner,cotter,was the only daimlerchrysler beneficiary who gave daimlerchrysler this requisite notification.mike cox,the michigan attorney general,therefore sent daimlerchrysler three notices pursuant to the respective court orders for the three noncomplying prisoners,informing daimlerchrysler where future benefit checks should be mailed.the warden notice of alvin jenkins legal address pursuant to final court order of may,for example,reads as follows 
alvin jenkins has refused to sign the certification of his legal address as required by the attached court order.
therefore,according to the order,i am notifying you that alvin jenkins legal address is 
alvin jenkins,
parnall correctional facility 
jackson,mi 
please make his monthly pension benefit checks payable to alvin jenkins and mail them to him at his above legal address.if alvin jenkins moves to another prison facility,i will notify you of his new address for purposes of receiving his pension benefit checks according to the court order.
the three notices were signed by the warden of each prisoner correctional institution.
daimlerchrysler did not comply with the three notices received from the michigan attorney general,but instead followed the plan terms and specifications for sending payments to the prisoners according to the mailing address each prisoner had given daimlerchrysler in accordance with plan documents.it did,however,change cotter address pursuant to his direct request.
proceedings below 
in september of,daimlerchrysler brought a declaratory action against attorney general cox and state treasurer rising,seeking a determination that state officials are precluded from enforcing the orders against the prisoners to the extent that they contravene erisa or the pension plan,and the orders,requests for reimbursement,and the notices issued pursuant to scfra are void to the extent that they compel the prisoner,or require the warden,to direct daimlerchrysler to make payments to an account that is not voluntarily designated by the prisoner.
daimlerchrysler argued that scfra is preempted by erisa because scfra conflicts with several provisions in the pension plan.first,as mandated by erisa,the pension plan provides that a ny attempt to alienate,sell,transfer,assign,pledge,or otherwise encumber benefits payable under the pension plan,whether presently or thereafter payable,shall be void.pension plan.the pension plan further states that benefits can not devolve upon anyone else.id.daimlerchrysler also pointed to language from the pension plan and the summary plan description spd regarding address changes.in particular,the spd provides that if a participant address changes,he should notify benefit express at a confidential pin is also required to access daimlerchrysler benefit express phone system.
the state officials then filed for summary judgment,arguing that the orders and notices issued pursuant to scfra violate neither erisa provision nor the corresponding language in the pension plan.they further argued that scfra,and its methods of securing a prisoner change of address,impose only an incidental burden on the pension plan and is therefore not preempted by erisa general preemption provision.
after a hearing in may of,the district court granted daimlerchrysler request for declaratory relief.the court held that the orders notifying daimlerchrysler of the change in address,and the notices themselves,are preempted by erisa provision based on an earlier district court decision in roberts baugh.because the court found that these orders and notices did not burden the pension plan,however,the court declined to hold that they were also preempted by erisa general preemption provision.
although daimlerchrysler originally sought to void all of the orders,including the order requiring cotter to inform daimlerchrysler of his address change,it limited its position after the district court judgment.daimlerchrysler now claims that the orders and notices are void only to the extent that they require the warden to inform daimlerchrysler that it should change the addresses of the three noncomplying prisoners.the district court therefore entered an amended declaratory judgment,pursuant to a stipulation by daimlerchrysler,holding that the orders,notices,and state treasurer requests for reimbursement under scfra are preempted by erisa,but only to the extent that daimlerchrysler is directed to send or make payments of pension plan benefits to any address or account other than as designated by the participants of the pension plan,under pension plan terms.any future actions by the state of michigan for reimbursement under scfra were also invalidated to the extent that they directed daimlerchrysler to send payments to an account not personally designated by a plan beneficiary in the pension plan.the state officials timely appealed the amended declaratory judgment that invalidated the warden notices to jenkins,matthews,and swanson.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court decision to grant a motion for declaratory judgment.kelley dupont de nemours,cir.whether erisa preempts a state law is a question of law and is therefore also reviewed de novo.ramsey formica,cir.
erisa preemption framework 
erisa,is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.shaw delta air lines,d.the statute does not require employers to provide any particular benefits to their employees,but sets forth uniform,federal standards that control their administration.id.at.the supreme court has frequently reviewed cases involving erisa preemption of state laws due to the comprehensive nature of erisa,the centrality of pension and welfare plans in the national economy,and their importance to the financial security of the nation work force.boggs boggs,d.
in the present case,daimlerchrysler argues that scfra is preempted by erisa in two distinct ways.first,erisa contains an provision that requires each pension plan to provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.d.the pension plan,pursuant to this provision,prohibits any alienation,transfer,sale,or other encumbrance of plan benefits.pension plan.if scfra effectuates an assignment or alienation in violation of d,then erisa preempts its application.see branco.cal.employers joint pension plan,cir holding that the language of the court order that was before it conflicts with erisa provision and is therefore.the other erisa provision relied on by daimlerchrysler is found at a,which invalidates any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.
c.the parties prior litigation 
before reaching either of its preemption arguments,however,daimlerchrysler contends that prior litigation between the parties in the case of roberts baugh,controls the outcome here based on the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel,and stare decisis.the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel prevent parties from relitigating issues that they had a full and fair opportunity to litigate in another forum.kremer chem.constr,d barring a plaintiff claims under title vii in federal court because the proceedings had provided a full and fair opportunity to litigate those claims.daimlerchrysler argues that after the baugh decision,which involved the same parties and the same issues present in this case,daimlerchrysler should not have been forced to seek relief in this action or any other action where the state officials seek to circumvent baugh holding.appellee br.at emphasis omitted.
we respectfully disagree.the district court in baugh confronted different provisions of scfra that allow the state to appoint the pension plan as a receiver to control the prisoner assets and ultimately transfer them to the state.at.in provisions that are inapplicable to the present case,scfra gives the state the power to appoint a receiver to protect and maintain assets pending resolution of an action under scfra.comp.laws a.as a further distinction between baugh and the present case,the state officials in baugh sought an order directly compelling daimlerchrysler to send a prisoner pension benefits to his institutional account pursuant to provisions of sfcra that the state now concedes are preempted by erisa in cases involving private pension plans.at.
the present case,in contrast,concerns provisions of scfra that order the warden to notify a pension plan of a prisoner new address.daimlerchrysler is therefore not being directly compelled by a order to change participants addresses,but instead is being informed by the wardens that it should do so.because baugh concerned provisions of scfra inapplicable to the present case,the state did was not required the issues involved in the present case.we therefore hold that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not bar the state from opposing daimlerchrysler declaratory action.although the district court in this case adopted,in large part,the reasoning of baugh,it understood that it was in not bound by that decision.
daimlerchrysler also argues that the doctrine of stare decisis required the district court to follow baugh.this contention is without merit for the same reasons stated above.
erisa provision 
daimlerchrysler next argument,and the one that ultimately persuaded the district court,is that the orders and notices requiring the warden to direct daimlerchrysler to send benefit payments to a prisoner institutional address violates erisa provision.the scfra scheme,daimlerchrysler asserts,accomplishes an involuntary transfer of benefits into the hands of a state representative without the permission of the plan participant,in contravention of both erisa provision and daimlerchrysler corresponding pension plan terms.
erisa provision reflects a policy choice on the part of congress to safeguard a stream of income for pensioners and their dependents,who may be,and perhaps usually are,blameless,even if that decision prevents others from securing relief for the wrongs done them.patterson shumate,d citations and quotation marks omitted.to that end,the provision requires that every pension plan include a prohibition on assigning or alienating benefits provided under the plan.d.the treasury regulations,which interpret this provision and are entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,define the terms assignment and alienation as including 
any direct or indirect arrangement whether revocable or irrevocable whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforceable against the plan in,or to,all or any part of a plan benefit payment which is,or may become,payable to the participant or beneficiary.
in interpreting erisa provision and its corresponding regulations,the courts have vigorously enforced erisa prohibition on the assignment or alienation
