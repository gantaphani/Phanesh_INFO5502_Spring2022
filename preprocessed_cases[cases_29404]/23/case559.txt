parties and proceedings 
interpleader was begun on september,by merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith,merrill lynch,the custodian of the assets of arelma,arelma,now amounting to approximately million.the merrill lynch account was found by the district court to have been established in by a deposit of million by ferdinand marcos,then the president of the republic.the shares of arelma,a panamanian corporation,are now held in escrow by the philippine national bank,pending an ownership determination by the philippine courts.
the republic was made a defendant in the interpleader and successfully asserted its sovereign immunity.in re republic of the,cir.the republic now maintains that it is an indispensable party inasmuch as the republic asserts that the arelma assets were acquired by marcos illegally and never lawfully belonged to him but from the beginning of his acquisition belonged to the republic.see an act declaring forfeiture in favor of the state of any property found to have been unlawfully acquired by any public officer or employee and providing for the proceeding therefor,act forfeiture act.in the appeal here,we ruled that the republic was a necessary party but declined to rule that the republic was indispensable.we stayed the action.republic of the,at.
pimentel is the representative of persons who brought suit against marcos after his fall from power and in won a judgment against his estate of nearly billion.hilao estate of marcos,cir.this class,composed of victims of a rough and rapacious ruler,who often exercised arbitrary power,is a group whose sufferings naturally evoke sympathy.the district court dissolved the stay and awarded all the arelma assets to them.
arelma,that is the corporation itself,and the philippine national bank,the escrow holder of its stock,have filed a single brief contending that arelma is an indispensable party and that the district court lacked jurisdiction over arelma.
the estate of roger roxas and the golden budha sic corporation have similar interests.the yamashita treasure was discovered by roxas and stolen from roxas by marcos men.roxas was tortured and imprisoned,giving rise to human rights claims valued at million.roxas formed a corporation to which he assigned his rights in the treasure the corporation,for reasons connected with the warrants issued to roxas,carries a misspelled name.the estate of roger roxas and the corporation collectively roxas won an initial judgment against imelda marcos and the estate of ferdinand marcos.roxas marcos.the supreme court has allowed roxas judgment against imelda marcos to stand,while holding that the estate of ferdinand marcos could not be bound by that judgment.id.at.roxas claims the arelma assets both as a creditor of marcos and on the basis that the million used by marcos to set up the merrill lynch account were most probably derived from the yamashita treasure and can be traced to the property stolen from roxas.
other parties named in the caption of the case have not pursued the appeal.
the case is governed by federal rule of civil procedure.the first section of the rule speaks of persons needed for just adjudication.the republic falls within this section because,as the rule puts the matter,the republic 
claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in its absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede its ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of its claimed interest.
a.such a party should be joined to the action.
the rule goes on to prescribe what a court should do whenever joinder is not feasible.in such a case,
the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed,the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.the factors to be considered by the court include first,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
fed.civ.b.indispensability can only be determined in the context of particular litigation.provident tradesmens bank trust patterson,d.in determining indispensability,we apply the criteria supplied by rule b itself,viewed through the lens of equity and good conscience.id.at.
we have determined that the republic is a necessary party in this proceeding.that determination appears to mean that for a just disposition of the assets it is necessary that the republic participate.in ordinary speech,a necessary party would be an indispensable party.rule b,however,distinguishes between necessary and indispensable parties.rule b indicates that indispensability must meet a higher standard than necessity.only if equity and good conscience require it is a necessary party also indispensable.
in an appeal from the district court dissolution of the stay,we came close to saying that the republic was not indispensable.we said 
the district court held a hearing and entered findings of fact regarding the impact of the philippine litigation and the propriety of going forward in the absence of necessary parties,the republic and pcgg.we conclude that the district court ultimately acted within the spirit of this court mandate and properly exercised its discretion.
merrill lynch pimental,sic,at cir,per curiam.pimentel argues that implicitly our decision found no parties to be absent but indispensable.we,however,were addressing only the decision to lift the stay.our decision does not have res judicata effect on the question of indispensability here presented.
accordingly,we must apply the factors set forth in rule b,in the context of this particular litigation.provident bank,at.the phrase equity and good conscience in our judicial usage is coterminous with the early opinions of the united states supreme court.see elmendorf taylor,wheat.undoubtedly in its earlier usage,equity brought to mind a fairness sought by the chancery courts that transcended statutory law and good conscience referred to an interior moral arbiter regarded as the voice of god.as the phrase has become domesticated and invoked in modern times,see montana crow tribe of indians,d,the distinction of its two elements has blurred,and it has a secular rather than religious cast.still,its unique appearance in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure emphasizes the flexibility that a judge may find necessary in order to achieve fairness in the judge choice of solutions,a choice to be marked by mercy and practicality.hecht bowles.
prejudice to the republic 
first,we must consider whether a judgment rendered in the absence of the republic might be prejudicial to it or to those already parties.b.followin
