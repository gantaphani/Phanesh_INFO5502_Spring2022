facts and procedural history 
plaintiff suffered a injury at her home on february,when she tripped over some loose linoleum tile.plaintiff had rented the premises from laperle clemons,and sued clemons for negligence she included theories of premises liability,breach of the implied warranty of habitability,and similar allegations.plaintiff eventually reached a settlement with clemons insurer.the insurer agreed to pay the policy limits of,and plaintiff agreed to dismiss the action.plaintiff filed the request for dismissal on january.
plaintiff had received treatment for her injuries at the county hospital.the problem here is the nature of the county claim,if any valid claim exists,against the proceeds of plaintiff suit against clemons.there are three potential sources of the county right to recoup the costs of medical care it has provided.
first,plaintiff qualified for the mia program.the state administers health care for public assistance recipients largely through the program.health care for individuals ineligible for,but unable to afford medical care,however,is the responsibility of the counties pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.citation.in,the legislature excluded from most individuals who do not fall within the following categories those at least years of age blind or disabled persons and individuals eligible for afdc.the excluded individuals,referred to as medically indigent persons,meet income and resource eligibility requirements for,but do not fall within the specified categories.the legislature transferred state funds to the counties for the purpose of providing health care services to these individuals.
the funds transferred do not fully cover the costs of providing care to medically indigent persons.thus,persons who qualify for the mia program are required to sign an agreement to reimburse the county for the medical services provided,from the proceeds of any litigation or settlement they may receive from a third party,such as a tortfeasor,liable for the injury.plaintiff executed such an agreement at the time she applied for medically indigent services.
in addition to the contractual agreement for reimbursement under the mia program,the county hospital was eligible to assert a lien against any judgment or settlement plaintiff obtained,pursuant to the hospital lien act,under civil code section et.
third,government code section gives a county a first lien,for the cost of medical care it has provided to an injured person,against any judgment the injured person recovers from a third person who is responsible for the injury 
at the time plaintiff negotiated the settlement with defendant clemons,the parties discussed the possibility of a structured settlement for paying the policy limits,to take account of any lien the county may have.in december of,plaintiff agreed with the insurer to issue the policy limits without a structured settlement clemons insurer indicated,however,that the county medical center was asserting an ostensible lien for.plaintiff proposed that the insurer should issue two checks one for the amount that undisputedly belonged to plaintiff,and a second check,payable jointly to plaintiff,her counsel and the county,for the amount of the alleged lien.
the insurer did send two checks.the first,payable to plaintiff,was for less than half the policy proceeds.the second,apparently for the county asserted lien,was in the amount of,and made payable jointly to plaintiff,her counsel,and the county.plaintiff discussed the matter with the county the county refused to reduce the amount of its lien,even though the amount demanded exceeded percent of the total settlement proceeds.
plaintiff thereafter moved to set aside its dismissal of the clemons action,and to expunge the county purported lien,in whole or in part.plaintiff asserted a number of theories upon which the lien should be expunged 
first,the county claim was improper as one under the mia program.while plaintiff signed a contractual agreement to reimburse the county for mia expenditures from the proceeds of any litigation or settlement she might recover on account of her injury,the county remedy is to sue to enforce the contractual agreement there is no provision for asserting a lien.
second,the claim was improper under government code section.that provision establishes a first lien for the county for the cost of medical care provided,when the injury is caused by a third party.the lien provided in government code section also includes the full amount of the medical expenses incurred.this court has held in mares baughman however,that the lien applies against judgments,but does not apply to settlements.accordingly,the lien under government code section is inapplicable here.
third,the claim under the hospital lien act was invalid,at least in part.unlike the lien provided in government code section,a hospital lien under the hospital lien act applies to both judgments and settlements.however,as plaintiff pointed out,the california supreme court,in mercy hospital medical center farmers ins.group of companies had held that a hospital lien asserted under civil code section was limited to an amount which could be satisfied from percent of the settlement proceeds.the county asserted lien here,of over,exceeded the percent limit,when the settlement proceeds amounted at most to.
plaintiff also claimed that the county lien was limited by another provision of the hospital lien act that is,the lien applies only for emergency and ongoing medical or other services.plaintiff urged that only approximately of medical services had been furnished for emergency or ongoing medical treatment.she claimed that there had been an interruption in services while she sought chiropractic treatment for her injuries.plaintiff acknowledged that the initial treatment she received at the county facility was for emergency medical care.she argued that the remainder of the treatment she received at the county facility was not ongoing,however,because of the gap in treatment while she sought chiropractic therapy.
the county opposed the motion to set aside the dismissal and to expunge its lien.its arguments did not make the subtle distinctions among the different theories of recovery rather,the county simply asserted that plaintiff had signed the reimbursement agreement for the mia program,the county had an enforceable lien under civil code section,the percent limitation under civil code section did not apply because the county was not suing the insurance carrier,the county retained statutory and common law rights to sue the patient for the full amount of the medical services provided,and the county did not rely on government code section.the county further asserted that plaintiff was liable to the county for breach of the mia reimbursement agreement,and that its lien should not be reduced by any amounts attributable to plaintiff attorney fees an issue not,so far as we can determine,asserted by plaintiff in her motion.
the trial court took the matter under submission.ultimately,it denied plaintiff motion plaintiff argues that the lien is valid only to the extent of of the emergency treatment rendered to plaintiff.however,under,as amended in,the lien includes treatment beyond the emergency care and includes ongoing care.counsel suggestion that the section remains applicable only to emergency care and care related to the emergency admission is without authority and is counter to the plain meaning of the statute.mercy hospital and medical center farmers insurance group cal th,d,dealt with the statute in its form.the court specifically noted in,sections,and were amended to in part expand the lien scope to include emergency and ongoing medical or other services,these amendments do not affect the resolution of the issue before us.moreover,is only one of the lien sections asserted by the c ounty.mares,therefore,does not defeat the lien under.the motion to vacate the dismissal and expunge the lien is denied.underscore in original.
plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal from this ruling.
standard of review 
by and large,we are called upon here to determine the meaning of the relevant statutory provisions,and to apply the legal pronouncements of the courts explicating those statutes.the underlying facts are undisputed.we are thus concerned with questions of law,which we review de novo 
ii.a lien under government code section does not apply against settlements 
plaintiff argued below that the county purported lien could not properly be based upon government code section.
government code section,subdivision a,provides in relevant part i n any case in which the county is authorized or required by law to furnish hospital,medical,surgical,or dental care and treatment to a person who is injured or suffers a disease,under circumstances creating a tort liability upon some third person to pay damages therefor,the county shall have a right to recover from said third person the reasonable value of the care and treatment so furnished,or shall,as to this right,be subrogated to any right or claim that the injured or diseased person has against such third person to the extent of the reasonable value of the care and treatment so furnished 
subdivision b goes on to provide the county may,to enforce such rights,institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third person who is liable for the injury or disease in the appropriate court,either in its own name or in the name of the injured person in the event that the injured person brings an action for damages against the third person who is liable for the injury or disease,the county right of action shall abate during the pendency of such action,and continue as a first lien against any judgment recovered by the injured or diseased person against the third person who is liable for the injury or disease,to the extent of the reasonable value of the care and treatment so furnished when the third person who is liable is insured,the county shall notify the third person insurer,when known to the county,in writing of the lien within days following the filing of the action by the injured or diseased person 
this court interpreted these provision in mares baughman,supra,th,d.we there stated that government code section provides for an independent action by a county against any third party such as clemons liable for the injury that necessitated medical care.a county independent action is abated only during the time that the injured person pursues an action against the third party.once the injured person action is no longer pending,should an amount remain due and owing to county for those services,it may pursue its own action.
in the meantime,while the injured person action is pending,and a county right of action is abated,that right of action continue s as a first lien against any judgment recovered by the injured person.while there are no limits on the amount of the,the extent of the lien includes the full reasonable value of the services lien applies only to judgments,not to settlements,recovered by the injured person from the third party 
plaintiff argued below that this court decision in mares baughman,supra,made clear that the county could not recover its lien under the rubric of government code section,inasmuch as plaintiff recovery was by way of settlement rather than in a judgment.the county apparently conceded the point,stating in its opposition to the expungement motion that it did not rely on government code section.the trial court agreed.the court noted,however,that the county lien was asserted under theories in addition to government code section thus,the court held,that government code section and mares did not necessarily preclude all lien recovery.
we agree.although the county can not recover its lien under government code section,that provision does not defeat a lien asserted under another,proper,theory.
iii.plaintiff agreement to reimburse the county for benefits under the medically indigent adult program may give rise to a contractual right,but does not impose a lien 
plaintiff did sign an agreement,as a participant in the mia program,to reimburse the county for the costs of her medical care from the proceeds of any litigation or settlement resulting from such act that she might receive.such act refers to any act causing the accident or injury,for which medical care was provided to the mia applicant,and for which a third party has been found liable,through litigation or settlement.in such cases,the mia applicant must reimburse the costs of the medical care from the proceeds of the litigation or settlement.
the question is,what is the county remedy if an mia applicant fails to honor the reimbursement agreement plaintiff asserts that the county remedy is to sue for breach of the agreement.the county implicitly concedes the point,as it offers no statutory or other authority demonstrating that the mia agreement imposes a lien on the proceeds of any litigation or settlement.indeed,the county briefing acknowledges that plaintiff signature on the mia application constitutes a written contractual obligation,and that failure to comply with the written promise could subject plaintiff to a separate enforcement suit by the county.as the county explicitly notes,plaintiff potential liability under the mia agreement is in addition to her lien obligation,and not identical to the lien obligation.it may very well be true that a ny failure by plaintiff to pay the lien will result in additional actions by the county for breach of contract and common counts,italics added but the county is indeed relegated to those additional actions.it can not simply bypass the necessity of filing a separate enforcement suit.no such action has yet been filed,much less proven and reduced to judgment.the mia agreement does not,in itself,provide any justification for enforcing the lien claim,in the absence of a separate contract action.
iv.the county lien is based exclusively on civil code section 
the county brief makes explicit that it relies exclusively on the hospital lien act,civil code section et,for its claimed lien.plaintiff argues that the asserted hospital lien is subject to certain limitations the county disputes the applicability of those limitations.
taking up the simpler point first,we address plaintiff contention that the hospital lien is limited to emergency and ongoing medical care,but that only of the charges sought come within that description.that is,plaintiff agrees that her initial treatment qualified as emergency care,and amounted to in medical expenses.the remainder of plaintiff medical expenses for the injury were not initial emergency medical expenses neither can they be considered ongoing medical expenses,she argues,because there was a gap in treatment at the county hospital,while plaintiff received chiropractic therapy for her injuries.only after the course of chiropractic treatment failed to resolve her condition did plaintiff return to the county facilities.
in addition,plaintiff asserts that many of the expenses included in the claimed lien are not proper because they are attributable to independent health care providers.these other health care providers had billed the county for services rendered,but the services were not directly provided by the county hospital.
the county briefing as to these contentions is singularly unhelpful.to the contention that the county claimed lien charges were not proper,to the extent they were not emergency or ongoing medical services,the county simply insists,with no coherent argument or citation to authority,that reducing a claimed lien by percent was unjustified.the county baldly states that plaintiff seeks to cut the county lien by more than percent,without providing a scintilla of authority for such a drastic reduction.the county chides plaintiff for arguing,i n effect,that she should receive free medical care at the expense of the tax payers sic despite having received a settlement that included damages for medical care.the county urges us simply to summarily reject plaintiff arguments.contrary to the county cavalier remarks,however,plaintiff contention is at least arguable,based upon the language of the relevant statute.plaintiff points out,correctly,that civil code section applies only to hospital liens,and only for qualifying emergency or ongoing medical or other services.her reliance upon the language of the statute itself,in the absence of any extant case law,is proper.indeed,the canons of construction which courts employ in determining questions of statutory interpretation,require resort first to the language of the statute itself.if that language is clear on its face,no further construction or authority is required,or even permitted plaintiff argument also looks to the plain language of the statute she suggests that the county lien was improper,not only because her treatment did not satisfy the definition of ongoing medical care,but also because many of the claimed charges did not properly relate to the allowable subject of the lien,hospital charges.
we shall overlook the latter suggestion,however even if plaintiff has,contrary to the county position,articulated a plausible issue,we do not consider it for the more fundamental reason that it was never presented to the trial court as a ground for expunging a portion of the hospital lien.consequently,the factual questions upon which such an issue depends have never been resolved.i t is fundamental that a reviewing court will ordinarily not consider claims made for the first time on appeal which could have been but were not presented to the trial court.thus,we ignore arguments,authority,and facts not presented and litigated in the trial court.generally,issues raised for the first time on appeal which were not litigated in the trial court are waived.citations.
plaintiff argues that the lion share of the expenses incurred for treatment at the county facility are not properly subject to the hospital lien act.plaintiff went to the emergency room for treatment on three occasions immediately after her fall.the expenses for these visits totaled plaintiff concedes that this amount is proper.plaintiff asserts that she was then treated,however,by a chiropractor outside of the county medical treatment system,for approximately one month,from march,to april.plaintiff asserts that all the remaining charges included in the county claimed lien are for treatment that resumed with various county health facilities on a basis,after the chiropractic treatments proved unsuccessful.although plaintiff admits that she completed her chiropractic treatment without resolution of her sy mpto ms,she nevertheless insists that the treatment she resumed at the county facilities was not ongoing treatment,but rather a new and different treatment.
formerly,civil code section provided a hospital lien to every municipal corporation which furnished emergency medical or other services of a reasonable value in excess of one hundred dollars to any person injured by reason of an accident or wrongful act not covered by workers compensation.civil code section also formerly provided expressly that,f or the purposes of this section,the emergency period shall not exceed a period of hours.
in,the provision was amended to abolish the emergency period limit,and the floor on the value of services provided.as amended,and as in force for purposes of this action,civil code section allowed a hospital lien for emergency and ongoing medical or other services provided to an injured person by reason of an accident or negligent or other wrongful act,if the act is not covered,by the workers compensation law.
so far as our research has revealed,no case has definitively construed the meaning of ongoing treatment,which is now included as part of the lien charges.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary defines ongoing as being actually in process,or continuously moving forward growing.plaintiff has not proffered a definition which differs materially from these.
whatever else ongoing may mean or not mean,we do not consider a brief,unsuccessful,attempt at other treatment modalities sufficient to defeat a claim of ongoing treatment.plaintiff suffered continuously from the original injury and its consequences.that she may have tried more than one kind of treatment does not mean that the treatment provided by the county was not ongoing.by whatever means,including treatment at the county facilities,plaintiff course of medical care was actually in process and continuously moving forward.her condition remained unresolved and required,in commonsense terms,ongoing treatment.we reject plaintiff argument,therefore,that the bulk of the claimed lien amounts were not for ongoing treatment.
the final point remains,however the percent limitation of civil code section.plaintiff urges that,under mercy hospital the county may only recover so much of its charges,as a hospital lien,as may be satisfied from percent of the insurance proceeds.because the policy limit was here,the county may recover,as a lien,only.the balance of its lien claim of must be expunged.
the county response is,again,useless.the county simply asserts that the percent limitation of civil code section does not apply.the county unblushingly avers that t here is no such percent limitation in the statute,but that the statute instead states that the payor insurance carrier is liable for the amount of the lien if it did not pay the lienholder at least of the settlement remaining after payment of other lienholders.the county,irrelevantly,insists that t he statute does not limit the responsibility of the patient for the lien.instead,it establishes a maximum liability to a lienholder by a payor who paid the patient,but failed to pay the hospital underscore in original italics added.the county asserts that a s there is no action pending against the insurance carrier who made the payment for defendant laperle clemons,civil code does not apply.further,the county declares that mercy hospital does not apply because it was an action by a lienholder against the insurance carrier after the insurance carrier failed to pay the lien.in the present action,the insurance carrier has not failed to pay and the lienholder county has not sued the insurance carrier.the county facile argument fails to take account of the nature of a hospital lien.
as the california supreme court pointed out in mercy hospital,supra,civil code section creates a statutory nonpossessory lien in favor of a hospital against third persons liable for the patient injuries.
a lien is a charge imposed in some mode other than by a transfer in trust upon specific property by which it is made security for the performance of an act.a lien may be created by contract,or by operation of law.there are various types of personal property liens the one at issue in this case,a hospital lien is a statutory nonpossessory lien.such liens are generally nonconsensual,and enacted to compensate a person who,pursuant to express or implied contract,furnishes services or materials in the improvement of a chattel,or stores it.citation.the hospital lien act compensates a hospital for providing medical services to an injured person by giving the hospital a direct right to a certain percentage of specific property,a judgment,compromise,or settlement,otherwise accruing to that person.italics added.
civil code section establishes the ce
