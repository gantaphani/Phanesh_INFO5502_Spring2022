opinion of the court 
after he defaulted on a loan and his car was repossessed,appellant heiko goldenstein brought suit against appellees repossessors,and shady oak enterprises,premier finance adjusters and their individual owners,alleging the repossession was unlawful and seeking treble damages,attorney fees,and costs.specifically,goldenstein claimed violations of various state and federal consumer protection statutes,as well as the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.because we conclude that the district court erred in the basis on which it granted summary judgment against goldenstein on his rico claim and two of his state law claims,we will affirm in part and reverse and remand in part for the district court further consideration of those claims.
factual and procedural 
in april,goldenstein,a resident of pennsylvania,obtained a online loan from sovereign lending solutions,llc,title loan america.as a consumer lending company wholly owned by the lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians and incorporated under chippewa tribal law,sovereign was authorized to issue loans secured by vehicles at interest rates far greater than permitted under pennsylvania law.app.vol.goldenstein pledged his car as collateral and was charged percent interest for his loan 
accounting for the interest due,sovereign,after deducting a transfer fee and wiring the remaining of the loan to goldenstein bank account,withdrew monthly installments of from goldenstein bank account in june and again in july.the district court found for the purposes of summary judgment that goldenstein removed his funds from the account because he did not recognize the account activity on his bank statements.as a result,when sovereign attempted to collect a third installment payment in august,it was rejected for insufficient funds.sovereign then contracted with repossessors,to forfeit goldenstein collateral,and repossessors,in turn,contracted with shady oak enterprises,premier finance adjusters premier,which took possession of goldenstein car.when goldenstein attempted to recover his car a few days later,app.vol,premier informed goldenstein that his payment would not be accepted nor his car returned unless he signed release documents.after conferring with his attorney,goldenstein paid premier to satisfy the loan and in repossession fees and signed the releases.
goldenstein filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania in a complaint.in the first count,goldenstein claimed violations of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,and pennsylvania fair credit extension uniformity act pfceua.stat.and.ann.based in part on alleged violations of pennsylvania uniform commercial code ucc.the fdcpa claim was premised on the notion that appellees had no present right to possession of goldenstein car because the loan was usurious under pennsylvania law.as for the pfceua and ucc claims,goldenstein alleged that the appellees made false,deceptive,or misleading representations and engaged in unfair or unconscionable means of debt collection when,among other things,they required goldenstein to sign the releases before recovering his car.app.vol.the second and third counts of the complaint claimed that repossessors,and premier,both individually and jointly,constituted a rico enterprise and that the repossession of goldenstein car involved the collection of unlawful debt,in violation of c,and gave rise to a rico conspiracy,in violation of d.app.vol.
the district court granted appellees motion for summary judgment and entered judgment against goldenstein on all claims.goldenstein repossessors,cv,dist.lexis,at.july.as to the fdcpa claim,the district court held there was no violation because the appellees had a right to possess the car as collateral for the unpaid loan.id.at.as to the rico claim,the district court held that the repossession of collateral could not constitute the collection of unlawful debt as a matter of law it therefore did not address any other element of the rico claim.id.at.nor did the district court address goldenstein claims for violations of the pfceua and the ucc relating to the releases this appeal followed.

we exercise plenary review of a district court grant of summary judgment.reedy evanson,cir citing horn thoratec,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.thomas cumberland,cir quoting.a internal quotation marks omitted.when deciding a motion for summary judgment,a ll reasonable inferences from the record must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party and the court may not weigh the evidence or assess credibility.mbia ins.royal indem,cir citations omitted.
in a motion for summary judgment,it is initially the moving party burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact.mathews kidder,peabody,cir citing celotex catrett,d.a factual dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.conversely,where a party fails sufficiently to establish the existence of an essential element of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial,there is not a genuine dispute with respect to a material fact and thus the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.blunt lower merion sch,cir.
iii.discussion 
we agree with the district court that,although the loan may have been usurious under pennsylvania law,appellees nonetheless had a present right to possession of goldenstein car and their repossession of it therefore did not violate the fdcpa.we can not agree,however,that forfeiture of collateral can not amount to the collection of unlawful debt under the rico statute.and as the district court did not address the merits of goldenstein claims alleging violations of the pfceua and the ucc,we decline to do so in the first instance.we address these issues in turn.
goldenstein fdcpa claim 
goldenstein raises two challenges to the district court holding that,because goldenstein defaulted on his loan,appellees had a present right to possession of his car as collateral and therefore did not violate the fdcpa.
first,he contends that no present right to possession could attach to his car because the loan it secured was made at a usurious rate of interest in violation of pennsylvania loan interest and protection law lipl.stat.and.ann.even when the interest rate is usurious,however,the lipl does not void the entire loan or the legal interest,nor does it make it illegal for a lender to collect an unpaid debt.instead,the lipl only makes voidable the interest specified beyond the lawful rate.dep t of banking ncas of,llc,emphasis omitted quoting mulcahy loftus,and pennsylvania law expressly permits a secured party to take possession of the collateral after default,without judicial process if it proceeds without breach of the peace.thus,having admittedly defaulted on his loan including removing the funds from his bank account without further communication with the lender and failing to make three monthly payments before his car was repossessed goldenstein can not now contest sovereign right to repossess the collateral he posted in the event of just such a default.
second,goldenstein argues that the repossession was unlawful because his arrearage assuming he had been accruing interest at a six percent rate as permitted by pennsylvania law and deducting sovereign first two deductions from his bank account from his overall balance would have been a mere,and his failure to make this de minimis payment could not constitute a material breach of the loan contract.that argument,however,finds no support in the lipl.while that statute provides important protections to borrowers who fall victim to usurious loans,it does not empower borrowers to recalculate what they owe by construing interest paid in excess of the legal rate as paid principal,nor does it preclude lenders from reposs
