appellant diana adams,united states trustee the trustee,appeals from a judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge that affirmed a decision of the bankruptcy court adlai hardin,bankruptcy judge rejecting the trustee application under to appoint a trustee to manage the bayou entities bayou,or the bayou entities after the bayou entities filed for chapter protection.prior to the bankruptcy,the district court had appointed jeff marwil marwil as receiver to manage bayou.on appeal,the trustee argues,as she did below,that marwil duties as receiver ended upon bayou filing for bankruptcy protection,and therefore the bankruptcy court should have appointed a trustee.
we agree with the district court that the district court order effectively appointed marwil as both receiver and manager of bayou,and thus conclude that there was no management vacancy for the trustee to fill.because the trustee has provided no reason,based on marwil performance or qualifications,to replace him,we affirm the judgment of the district court that affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of the trustee petition.
background 
the bayou entities are a group of hedge funds and related entities that were operated as fraudulent schemes,and are now in chapter proceedings under the bankruptcy code.following bayou collapse in august,bayou managers pled guilty to various federal criminal fraud charges,and were ordered to forfeit bayou assets.
on march,the unofficial creditors committee the committee,bayou creditors holding more than million in claims,sought to mitigate the massive losses suffered by the creditors and others through the appointment of a federal equity receiver to pursue the litigation claims.see adams marwil in re bayou group,internal quotation marks omitted.the committee asked the district court to appoint marwil as both federal equity receiver and exclusive managing member for the bayou entities.id.at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.following a hearing that fully discussed the subject of bayou corporate governance,id.at,the district court,without objection entered an order the order authoriz ing,empower ing,and direct ing marwil to perform a number of duties and responsibilities,including the responsibility for corporate governance.order e.marwil was directed to be the sole and exclusive managing member and representative of each of the bayou entities,possessing without limitation,the authority to petition for protection under the bankruptcy code,et id.the order specified that the appointment was warranted under section b of the securities exchange act of and sec rule thereunder,state law claims of fraud and breach of a fiduciary duty,federal rule of civil procedure,and the facts and circumstances of this case.id.at introduction.the order further stated that the district court authority to appoint marwil was p ursuant to and,federal rule of civil procedure and the c ourt inherent authority.id.
following the april order,marwil undertook his responsibilities as managing member of bayou.on may,marwil caused each bayou entity to file a separate voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.at.thereafter marwil brought more than adversary proceedings seeking disgorgement from redeeming investors that have resulted in excess of million in recovered assets.marwil efforts have been endorsed by all of bayou creditors,including the official committee of unsecured creditors the official creditors committee,which was organized by the trustee shortly after marwil appointment.
on june,approximately eight weeks after marwil appointment,the trustee moved in the bankruptcy court for an order appointing a chapter trustee to replace marwil and oversee bayou bankruptcy proceedings.the bankruptcy court orally denied the trustee motion,both as an impermissible collateral attack on the order,and because the district court had appointed marwil not only as receiver of the bayou entities,but also as new management of the debtors with the authority and capacity to manage the bankruptcy proceedings as the.at internal quotation marks omitted.the bankruptcy court said 
marwil is not simply a custodian i t is crystal clear that the purpose of judge mcmahon order was to appoint somebody who was in fact and law the equivalent of a new board of directors,new ceo,new president,new cfo as a i t is perfectly clear to me that he really not just a receiver or a custodian 
id.alterations and second and third omissions in original,and internal quotation marks omitted.
on february,the district court,affirming the bankruptcy court,held that the order clearly contemplated appointing marwil as both a receiver and as bayou corporate management,and that marwil corporate management appointment was not merely derivative of his receivership appointment but instead was made pursuant to federal receivership statutes as well as federal securities law s and the district court inherent authority.id.at.the district court found that marwil,as the sole and exclusive managing member and representative of bayou,had the sole and exclusive power and authority to manage and direct the business and financial affairs of bayou,including without limitation,the authority to petition for protection under the bankruptcy code and in connection therewith be and be deemed a for bayou.order e.the district court further held that,by filing for bankruptcy,marwil transformed his status from corporate governor to,and therefore,that marwil was under no obligation to turn over bayou property to a bankruptcy trustee.at.
the trustee then appealed to this court.
discussion 
on appeal,the trustee argues that the district court misinterpreted its own order by permitting marwil to continue as managing member of bayou after he caused the bayou entities to file for chapter protection.according to the trustee,both the bankruptcy court and the district court were wrong to conclude that marwil was not a custodian merely because he had been granted the corporate governance powers of a managing member and representative of the bayou entities.appellant br.the trustee further contends that,because marwil was only appointed by the district court to be the custodian of the bayou entities,and because custodians are prohibited under the bankruptcy code from managing a debtor property after commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding,see a there was a vacuum of lawful management at bayou to oversee the bankruptcy proceedings,appellant br,and therefore,appointment of a bankruptcy trustee is necessary in this case.for the following reasons,we disagree.
standard of review 
where,as here,a district court acts in its capacity as an appellate court in a bankruptcy case,the district court decisions are subject to plenary review by this court.dairy mart convenience stores,nickel in re dairy mart convenience stores,cir.we thus review independently the factual findings and legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court,accepting its findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous and reviewing its conclusions of law de novo.babitt vebeliunas in re vebeliunas,cir.
as an initial matter,the parties dispute whether the interpretation of the order by the courts below constituted a finding of fact or conclusion of law.the trustee claims that,because the case hinges on a legal interpretation of the order,the bankruptcy and district court conclusions must be reviewed de novo,see appellant br.citing lebovits scheffel in re lehal realty assocs,cir,while the official creditors committee asserts that the scope of marwil authority is a question of fact,reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard,see br.of appellee official committee of unsecured creditors in opp official creditors committee br,at citing fisher first stamford bank trust,cir.we have no need to resolve this dispute,however,because we agree with the determinations of the courts below.
ii.appointment of a trustee is not warranted under a.
upon request of the trustee,the court shall order the appointment of a trustee to oversee chapter proceedings.a.however,the court may appoint a trustee only in certain circumstances.see smart world,llc juno online
