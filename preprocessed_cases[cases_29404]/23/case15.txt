this is one of the relatively rare occasions on which we have been asked,in a setting,to visit the precincts patrolled by the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.specifically,we are tasked with determining whether a particular collection letter satisfies section b of the fdcpa,which requires that a debt collector collection activities and communications not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumer right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor.id.b.the district court concluded that the collection letter at issue here fell short of this mark.
we hold that,for fdcpa purposes,a collection letter is to be viewed from the perspective of the hypothetical unsophisticated consumer.applying this standard,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
the raw facts,memorialized by the parties pleadings,are undisputed.at some indeterminate point in time,plaintiffappellee robbie pollard,who is a consumer within the meaning of,allegedly incurred a debt of approximately.the law office of mandy spaulding,the defendant and appellant here,subsequently was retained to collect the debt.in carrying out this assignment,the defendant was operating as a debt collector as defined in section.
on october,the defendant sent the plaintiff a collection letter a copy of which appears as an appendix to this opinion.this letter was typed on the defendant letterhead over the signature mandy spaulding,the letter explained that the defendant had been retained to collect the monies allegedly owed and was not inclined to use further resources attempting to collect this debt before filing suit.it further explained that the defendant planned to collect the debt through whatever legal means are available and without the plaintiff cooperation.it went on to inform the plaintiff that the defendant was obligated to its client to pursue the next logical course of action without delay and described how the plaintiff could make payments.
below the signature block,in smaller print,were several paragraphs preceded by the caption notice of important rights.these paragraphs contained the statutorily mandated notice of consumer rights.see id.a.
following her receipt of this collection letter,the plaintiff contacted the defendant to dispute ownership of the debt and request validation.approximately one month after the collection letter arrived,the plaintiff sued.in her complaint,she asserted that the defendant had violated sundry provisions of the fdcpa,including section.the defendant answered and,several months later,moved for judgment on the pleadings.see.c.the district court concluded,among other things,that the collection letter violated section as a matter of law see pollard law office of mandy spaulding,d.the parties thereafter agreed upon the damages and attorneys fees recoverable by the plaintiff.a final judgment entered,which preserved the defendant right to appeal from the ruling that the collection letter transgressed section.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
congress enacted the fdcpa to eliminate the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices.a.the act not only proscribes certain invidious methods of debt collection but also requires debt collectors to furnish to consumers a notice,commonly called a validation notice,limning certain rights and information.see id.a.among other things,a debt collector must inform the consumer that she has thirty days from receipt of the validation notice within which to dispute the debt before it is assumed to be valid and that if she disputes the debt,the debt collector will provide her with verification of the debt validity.see id.a.if the consumer either disputes the debt or requests information concerning the identity of the original creditor within this period,the debt collector must suspend collection efforts until it supplies such data.see id.b.
prior to,the fdcpa did not expressly require that the validation notice convey the consumer rights in a nonconfusing manner.courts nevertheless glossed the statute with such a requirement and routinely interpreted section to bar the use of collection letters that overshadow or contradict the validation notice.see mcmurray procollect,cir.the financial services regulatory relief act of removed any lingering doubt on this score it amended the fdcpa to make pellucid that a ny collection activities and communication during the day period may not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumer right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor.see,c,stat,codified at b.
against this backdrop,we turn first to a issue that implicates our jurisdiction.after clearing that hurdle,we address the defendant other claims of error.
the defendant argues for the first time in its reply brief that the plaintiff lacks article iii standing.in most cases,an argument advanced so late in the day and in so perfunctory a fashion would be forfeit.see,merrimon unum life ins,cir,slip op.at mccoy.inst.of,cir.but there are exceptions to this general rule,and the defendant lack of standing argument comes within such an exception.after all,whether a plaintiff has article iii standing implicates a federal court jurisdiction and,thus,must be resolved no matter how tardily the question is raised.see merrimon,at slip op.at see also vander luitgaren sun life assurance,cir,slip op.at comparing constitutional and statutory standing.we turn to that task.
federal courts are constitutionally empowered to adjudicate only actual cases and controversies.see const.art.iii,hollingsworth perry,d.a case or controversy exists only when the party soliciting federal court jurisdiction normally,the plaintiff demonstrates such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends.katz pershing,llc,cir quoting baker carr,d.to demonstrate that she has standing,a plaintiff must establish each part of a familiar triad injury,causation,and redressability.id.citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
the defendant suggests that the plaintiff lacks a constitutionally cognizable injury because she was not flummoxed about her statutory rights after reading the collection letter,as evidenced by the fact that she exercised those rights.but this suggestion gives too short shrift to the proposition that t he injury required by art.iii may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing.warth seldin,d quoting linda richard,d see lujan,at havens realty coleman,d.
in cases in which a plaintiff injury stems solely from the violation of a statute,the nature of the right that the statute confers is of paramount concern.see warth,at merrimon,at slip op.at tourgeman collins fin,cir slip op.at.this principle is leavened by the corollary principle that congress can not confer standing beyond the boundaries of article iii,that is,upon individuals who have not suffered a concrete injury.see summers earth island,d.as a result,a plaintiff always must be able to demonstrate that she suffered some personal and tangible harm.hollingsworth.at.
section prohibits debt collectors from sending collection letters that overshadow or are otherwise inconsistent with the required validation notice.debt collectors who transgress that prohibition are liable to consumers for actual and statutory damages.see.refined to bare essence,the fdcpa bestows upon consumers a right not to receive communications that overshadow or are inconsistent with the validation notice.tourgeman,at slip op.at,characterizing analogous right conferred by section as the right not to be the target of misleading communications.
the invasion of a statutorily conferred right may,in and of itself,be a sufficient injury to undergird a plaintiff standing even in the absence of other harm.see havens,at holding that plaintiff suffered cognizable injury when defendant violated statutory right to truthful housing information,notwithstanding plaintiff lack of any intention to rent or purchase home.that is the case here the fdcpa does not require that a plaintiff actually be confused.see jacobson healthcare fin,cir.seen in this light,the absence of confusion is irrelevant to the standing inquiry.
the short of it is that the plaintiff adequately alleged that her personal right was violated when she received the collection letter.that comprised an injury attributable to the defendant actions an injury that will be redressed by an award of damages.no more is exigible to confirm the plaintiff article iii standing.
b.the merits.
the defendant protests that its collection letter neither overshadows nor contradicts the validation notice the district court thought otherwise,and we review that court entry of judgment on the pleadings de novo.nurses ass adams reg l,cir.
this court has not previously had the occasion to consider from whose perspective a collection letter should be viewed for fdcpa purposes.in confronting this question,we are not navigating uncharted waters.two of our sister circuits have addressed this issue and concluded that a collection letter is to be viewed from the perspective of the hypothetical unsophisticated consumer see peters serv.bureau,cir gammon gc servs,cir.we think that this reading captures the spirit of the statute.accordingly,we hold that,for fdcpa purposes,a collection letter is to be viewed from the perspective of the hypothetical unsophisticated consumer.
the standard protects all consumers,including the inexperienced,the untrained and the credulous.taylor perrin,landry,delaunay durand,cir see clomon jackson,cir.even so,the standard remains an objective one,which preserves an element of reasonableness.a debt collector will not be held liable based on an individual consumer chimerical or farfetched reading of a collection letter.see taylor,at.
with this holding in place,we turn to the question of whether the collection letter sent by the defendant,when viewed through the eyes of the unsophisticated consumer,overshadows or is inconsistent with the validation notice.we note at the outset that,in the section milieu,courts do not always distinguish between violations based on the overshadowing of a validation notice and violations based on inconsistencies.overshadowing is a phenomenon that can take diverse forms.typically,however,overshadowing is based upon the visual characteristics of a collection letter,such as when a letter demands payment in large,type and relegates the validation notice to fine or otherwise print.see mcmurray,at bartlett heibl,cir.
inconsistencies,too,can occur in various shapes and sizes.they may be either literal or apparent.see,peter gc servs,cir bartlett,at.most frequently,material inconsistencies arise when a collection letter demands immediate payment or payment in a definite period shorter than thirty days.see,mcmurray,at peter,at.
whether the controversy centers on overshadowing or inconsistency,the inquiry reduces to whether a particular collection letter would confuse the unsophisticated consumer.see bartlett,at.this inquiry is to be conducted with a recognition that confusion can occur in a myriad of ways,such as when a letter visually buries the required validation notice,contains logical inconsistencies,fails to explain an apparent inconsistency,or presents some combination of these or similar vices.see id.in the last analysis,a collection letter is confusing if,after reading it,the unsophisticated consumer would be left unsure of her right to dispute the debt and request information concerning the original creditor.see russell equifax,cir.the emphasis,then,is on practical effect.see graziano harrison,cir explaining that statutory notice must not only explicate a debtor rights it must do so effectively.
in conducting the requisite inquiry,we examine the entire collection letter.see peter,at mcstay,cir.doing so,we conclude as did the court below that the collection letter in this case is confusing.the letter conveys the message that the defendant is not inclined to do anything other than file a lawsuit and that it plans to pursue such a course of action without delay.at bottom,the letter seems to threaten immediate litigation.we think that,implicit in this threat,is the idea that litigation can be avoided only if payment is made forthwith.that idea is reinforced by the fact that the letter appears on law firm letterhead and bears the signature of an attorney.
to be sure,the letter does contain the required section a disclosures,including a statement that the consumer may dispute the debt in writing within thirty days.while congress for some reason did not require that the notice actually explain what the effect of disputing a debt would be putting the brakes on collection efforts until a proper response is sent by the debt collector,see b,we have no doubt that a debt collector is not allowed to suggest that the effect of disputing a debt is different than what the fdcpa provides.to give the required notice of a right to dispute the debt while simultaneously and inaccurately disparaging the benefit of the right is to cause the consumer to think that the right to dispute has less benefit than is actually the case.
here,this is precisely what the unsophisticated consumer would read the letter as doing.the letter clearly and repeatedly implies that debt collection actions are going to proceed forthwith,come what may.of utmost significance in this regard is the notice of rights itself.although the notice is arguably legible,it nonetheless contributes greatly to the incipient confusion.critically,the second sentence of the second paragraph of the notice reads we further inform you that despite the fact that you have a thirty day period to dispute the debt may not preclude sic the filing of legal action against you prior to the expiration of the period.with its hopelessly scrambled syntax,this sentence is easily read as suggesting that a lawsuit is going to proceed without delay whether the consumer disputes the debt or not.the other affirmative statements in the text of the letter to the effect that the writer is not inclined to use further resources attempting to collect this debt before filing suit and is going to pursue the next logical course of action without delay reinforce this reading.
in this manner,the letter effectively overshadows the disclosed right to dispute by conveying an inaccurate message that exercise of the right does not have an effect that the statute itself says it has.we believe that when congress required a debt collector to give notice of this right and provided that conduct overshadowing the disclosure of such right shall not be undertaken,it prohibited conduct such as this conduct that would dupe the unsophisticated consumer into believing that disputing a debt could not forestall a suit.
the defendant vigorously resists the conclusion that its collection letter is confusing.we have examined the defendant arguments and find them wanting.
to begin,the defendant points out that the validation period is not a grace period.this is true as far as it goes,but it does not get the defendant very far.the fdcpa makes plain that a debt collector right to seek payment coexists with a consumer right to notice.see b stating that c ollection activities and communications that do not otherwise violate this subchapter may continue during the day period unless the consumer exercises her validation rights.the coexistence of these rights create s a breeding ground for claims for confusion because consumers are often faced with two seemingly contradictory statements that they may dispute the debt and that they must pay immediately.durkin equifax check,cir.
but the fdcpa pairs a debt collector right to pursue payment with a corresponding obligation to ensure that its communications are not confusing.consequently,when undertaking collection,a debt collector bears the burden of apprising the consumer of her validation rights in an effective manner.
next,the defendant asseverates that its collection letter is not confusing because it does not contain an express demand for payment within thirty days.in support of this asseveration,the defendant draws upon case law distinguishing between letters that demand payment i
