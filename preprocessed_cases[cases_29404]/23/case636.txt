discussion 
the question of federal jurisdictional authority to enforce contracts in settlement of federal litigation was discussed by the supreme court in kokkonen guardian life insurance company of america,d.the court explained that for disputes arising out of a settlement agreement that produces a stipulation of dismissal,when the terms of settlement are not included in the judgment the federal court normally does not have power to enforce the settlement terms.the court distinguished the situation where the settlement terms are included in the court judgment 
the situation would be quite different if the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of by separate provision such as a provision retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.in that event,a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order,and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.
kokkonen,at.the court explained that jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement is present 
even when,as occurred here,the dismissal is pursuant to rule a ii which does not by its terms empower a district court to attach conditions to the parties stipulation of dismissal we think the court is authorized to embody the settlement contract in its dismissal order or,what has the same effect,retain jurisdiction over the settlement contract if the parties agree.absent such action,however,enforcement of the settlement agreement is for state courts,unless there is some independent basis for federal jurisdiction.
the ninth circuit,in which this case arose has elaborated on the application of kokkonen.see,colvin,cir the settlement terms must be part of the dismissal in order for violation of the settlement agreement to amount to a violation of the court order.without a violation of the court order,there is no jurisdiction.hagestad tragesser,cir same linebarger united states,the order of dismissal plainly sets forth the obligations of the parties under the settlement agreement the terms were incorporated as part of the dismissal order and this court therefore retains jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement.
the court also explained the circumstances in which assertion of ancillary jurisdiction may be appropriate,inter alia,to vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees 
generally speaking,we have asserted ancillary jurisdiction in the very broad sense in which that term is sometimes used for two separate,though sometimes related,purposes to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are,in varying respects and degrees,factually interdependent,and to enable a court to function successfully,that is,to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees,see,chambers nasco,d power to compel payment of opposing party attorney fees as sanction for misconduct united states hudson,cranch.contempt power to maintain order during proceedings.
kokkonen,at.citations omitted.
totalaxcess states that such jurisdiction is precluded by peacock thomas,d,wherein the court reaffirmed that due process protects those who were not parties to litigation from liability for judgments rendered against others.while the court stated that the authority to exercise ancillary jurisdiction to enforce federal judgments is limited,id.at,it has recognized this exercise in attempts to guarantee eventual executability of a federal judgment.id.the court in peacock explained in determining the reach of the federal courts ancillary jurisdiction,we have cautioned against the exercise of jurisdiction over proceedings that are entirely new and original,or where the relief sought is of a different kind or on a different principle than that of the prior decree.id.at.citations omitted,brackets in original.in peacock the court found that there was no jurisdiction because the second suit alleged civil conspiracy and fraudulent transfer of assets occurr ing after the erisa judgment was entered all involved new theories of liability not asserted in the erisa suit.other than the existence of the erisa judgment itself,this suit has little connection to the erisa case.at.
in distinction,cygnus is raising no new theories of liability,but seeking jurisdiction to enforce the stipulated judgment against the merged successor to justice as of the time of the judgment.a federal court has inherent power to enforce its judgments,as discussed in peacock 
we have reserved the use of ancillary jurisdiction in subsequent proceedings for the exercise of a federal court inherent power to enforce its judgments.without jurisdiction to enforce a judgment entered by a federal court,the judicial power would be incomplete and entirely inadequate to the purposes for which it was conferred by the constitution.in defining that power,we have approved the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over a broad range of supplementary proceedings involving third parti
