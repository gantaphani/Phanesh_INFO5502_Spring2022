in this case,we are confronted with the knotty question of what an appellate court should do about an order expunging a lis pendens where a real property claimant is appealing from an adverse judgment in the trial court and files a writ petition asking the court of appeal to stay the expungement until the appeal is decided.the issue is complicated by a drastic change in lis pendens law enacted in.
the new law places the burden on the party filing a lis pendens to show the probable validity of his or her real property claim before trial,but says nothing about what standard the trial court should apply when confronted with a motion to expunge the lis pendens after the claimant suffers an adverse judgment.moreover,while the new legislation permits the aggrieved party to seek appellate review of an expungement order by petition for writ of mandate,it does not tell the reviewing court what standard to apply in deciding whether to issue the writ.
we shall conclude that the standard for deciding whether to issue a writ of mandate vacating a postjudgment expungement order is whether a petitioner real property claim has probable validity.we do this by assessing whether the petitioner has made out a prima facie case for reversal of the judgment,based on the record in the trial court and the arguments of the parties.this however,is not equivalent to a resolution of the underlying appeal.
applying this standard,we find no probable validity to petitioners claim.this determination is based primarily on our conclusion that petitioners herein have no standing,under the statutory scheme,to set aside a judicial foreclosure on the ground of irregularities in the conduct of the sale.we therefore decline to interfere with the trial court expungement order,and shall deny the writ.
background 
this petition for writ of mandate was brought after sacramento county superior court judge loren mcmaster issued an order granting the motion of real parties corinthian homes rancho murieta,rkb communities,llc,bruce palmbaum,and winncrest homes,collectively palmbaum to expunge a lis pendens filed by petitioners amalgamated bank,formerly first interstate bank,as corporate cotrustee for pension trust fund for operating engineers,and pension trust fund for operating engineers collectively ptf.ptf filed an action to set aside a judicial foreclosure sale conducted by the sacramento county sheriff of acres of undeveloped land in the southern part of the county.the property was sold pursuant to a judgment of foreclosure against the judgment debtor winncrest homes,winncrest.corinthian homes is a development corporation formed by palmbaum,who was the successful and only bidder at the foreclosure sale.palmbaum bought the entire parcel at the sheriff sale for.judge mcmaster ordered the lis pendens expunged after another judge granted summary judgment in favor of palmbaum.ptf now seeks relief from the expungement order.
factual and procedural history 
ptf held a security interest in the real property commonly known as parcel owned by winncrest.winncrest ceased making payments on the property in.ptf commenced an action against winncrest for judicial foreclosure of parcel and others.the trial court entered judgment allowing a sale of the property with a right of redemption,specifying the amount of the debt as slightly more than million.winncrest appealed,and this court affirmed the judgment in.first interstate bank winncrest homes,consol.case nos,wl nonpub.opn.
as judgment creditor,ptf requested that the sacramento county sheriff issue a writ of sale to execute upon parcel and sell it to the highest bidder.a public auction was scheduled for february,at palmbaum arrived there with million in available funds.the property was worth approximately million,and ptf intended to place an opening bid of million.
the sheriff commenced the sale around the exact time is the subject of intense dispute and palmbaum submitted an opening bid of.palmbaum bid turned out to be the only bid because ptf designated bidders got stuck in traffic on the morning of february on their way from the bay area to sacramento,arriving at the auction room sometime after.after the sheriff gavel fell confirming a sale to palmbaum for,the bidders vociferously objected,demanding that the sale be rescinded.the officer replied that bidding was closed and the property had been sold to palmbaum.
ptf filed the instant action to set aside the foreclosure sale,cancel the sheriff deed and restrain palmbaum from disposing of the property.ptf also recorded a notice of lis pendens,effectively tying up parcel during the pendency of the lawsuit.although it had a year in which to do so,winncrest did not exercise its right of redemption.the redemption period expired on february.
following extensive discovery,palmbaum filed a motion for summary judgment.code civ.in granting the motion,judge jeffrey gunther found that ptf was barred from setting aside the sale,since section,subdivision a provides that a judicial foreclosure sale pursuant to article may not be set aside for any reason,a statute that abolished equitable grounds for rescission the sheriff conducted the sale according to law and without irregularities winncrest did not exercise its right of redemption an action to set aside a foreclosure sale for irregularities may be commenced by the judgment debtor only if the purchaser was the judgment creditor neither of which applied here and the sheriff did not have discretion to postpone the sale absent a joint request from both the judgment debtor and judgment creditor,which did not occur here.
ptf filed a notice of appeal from the summary judgment.that appeal is pending in this court.several months after the judgment was entered,palmbaum made a motion to expunge the lis pendens.judge mcmaster issued a tentative ruling granting the motion and directing palmbaum to prepare a formal order.at that point,ptf filed the first of two petitions for writ of mandate amalgamated bank superior court the stated primary purpose of the petition was to preserve this court jurisdiction by staying the expungement order.ptf claimed that if the lis pendens were allowed to be expunged,palmbaum would be able to sell the property to a third party,thus rendering the summary judgment appeal essentially moot.
we issued two alternative writs and and a stay of the expungement order,pending our resolution of the petition.
discussion 
i.a stay of the expungement order was unnecessary 
section provides that an order expunging a lis pendens is not appealable but is reviewable upon petition for writ of mandate filed within days of service of written notice of the order,during which time the expungement order may not be recorded.ptf timely filed a petition here.section provides in pertinent part no order expunging a notice of pendency of action shall be effective,nor shall it be recorded in the office of any county recorder,until the time within which a petition for writ of mandate may be filed pursuant to section has expired.no order expunging a notice of pendency of action shall be effective,nor shall it be recorded in the office of any county recorder,after a petition for writ of mandate has been timely filed pursuant to section,until the proceeding commenced by the petition is finally adjudicated.italics added.therefore,the expungement order is stayed by statute until our final disposition of this writ petition.a stay of the expungement order was superfluous 
ii.evolution of the lis pendens statutes 
law and peery 
a party who asserts a claim to real property can record a notice of lis pendens,which serves as notice to prospective purchasers,encumbrancers and transferees that there is litigation pending that affects the property.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,miller and starr.a lis pendens acts as a cloud against the property,effectively preventing sale or encumbrance until the litigation is resolved or the lis pendens is expunged.miller starr,supra.
before,a lis pendens was very easy to record and very difficult to remove.under former section,as long as a lis pendens was filed for a proper purpose and in good faith,the trial court could not remove it until the litigation was finally terminated against the party filing the lis pendens.see malcolm superior court cal d,malcolm mix superior court th,d mix.
in peery superior court cal d,peery,the california supreme court addressed the standard the trial court should apply when ruling on a motion to expunge after summary judgment has been granted against the claimant,and the judgment has been appealed.peery ruled that the court should deny the motion thus keeping the lis pendens on the property during the appeal if the appeal presents a substantial issue for review.id.at.peery thus reflects a judicial and legislative predisposition toward keeping the status quo if there is any reasonable chance the party recording the lis pendens might ultimately prevail.
legislation 
lis pendens law was substantially revised in.see stats,ch.the old good faith and proper purpose standard of section was jettisoned in favor of section,which says in proceedings under this chapter,the court shall order that the notice be expunged if the court finds that the claimant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.section defines probable validity as more likely than not that the real property claimant will prevail against the defendant in the action.
this represents a sea change in the law.now a claimant must prove more than that he recorded the lis pendens in good faith and without ulterior motives.he must make a showing that he is likely to prevail on the merits,in much the same fashion as one seeking an attachment must show the probable merit of the underlying lawsuit.see,subd.a.
the code comment following section code comment explains that the lis pendens had evolved from a simple method of giving notice of a lawsuit into a de facto injunction against transferring or encumbering the property while litigation is in progress,without the procedural safeguards that normally attend the granting of injunctive relief.see code comment,par,foll.west annot.code civ.proc.ed,par.the financial pressure created by a recorded lis pendens provided the opportunity for abuse,permitting parties with meritless cases to use it as a bullying tactic to extract unfair settlements 
the code comment thus states that section is intended to disapprove malcolm,supra,cal d,and other cases which have held that the court on a motion to expunge may not conduct a minitrial on the merits of the case.this section is intended to change california law and to require judicial evaluation of the merits.code,west ann.code civ,supra,foll,par,italics added.
mix and behniwal 
while the revision of the law left no doubt that the recorder of a notice of lis pendens now has the burden of persuading the court that he will likely prevail when resisting an expungement motion,the language of section is manifestly targeted at motions to expunge before trial property claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the claim,not expungement motions made after judgment has been entered and while an appeal is pending.as was the case under the former statutes,the legislature failed to articulate a standard for ruling on a motion to expunge a lis pendens made after judgment against the claimant.
it took years for such a case to be decided.in mix,supra,th,d,the buyer sued the seller for specific performance and recorded a lis pendens against the property.in a bench trial,the court agreed with the seller.after winning the judgment,the seller moved to expunge the lis pendens before the time for appeal had expired.the trial court denied the motion,applying case law that held a lis pendens should not be expunged unless appellate review would be patently unmeritorious.id.at fn,d.
the mix court issued a writ commanding the trial court to expunge the lis pendens.the court concluded that the legislation abrogated the peery substantial issue for review standard.the probable validity test governs instead.mix,supra,th at,d.the court continued that while t he phrase probable validity in section was obviously written from the perspective of a trial court judge trying to forecast,at some point before trial,the probable outcome in the trial court,t he statute is silent as regards the context of a trial court judge trying to forecast the probable outcome in the appellate court.id.at,d.it would be anomalous,mix declared,if the test postjudgment were to be less rigorous than the test before all,the court need not forecast the probable merit of the case,since it has already entered a judgment adjudicating the merits.ibid.mix therefore held that a trial court confronted with an expungement motion after judgment against the claimant may deny the motion only if the court believes that its own decision will be reversed on appeal.since there was no indication the trial judge believed this to be the case,it should have granted the expungement motion.id.at,d.
in a section entitled harsh results can be tempered,the mix court purported to offer a consolation prize to the claimant who loses in the trial court,files an appeal and faces an expungement motion that is virtually certain to be granted.mix noted that expungement orders are reviewable by writ and that appellate courts can issue stays pursuant to california rules of court,rule c when they receive writ petitions.the court then pointed out that the appellate court could stay the expungement order effectively keeping the lis pendens on the property if it concluded there was probable validity to the appeal.mix therefore ordered the trial court to expunge the lis pendens,while inviting the buyer to file a writ petition and request a stay of the expungement order.mix,supra,th at,d.
the outcome in the sequel to mix,behniwal superior court th,d behniwal,is truly ironic.accepting mix invitation,the buyer filed a petition for writ of mandate and asked the appellate court to vacate the expungement order or alternatively to stay it by writ of supersedeas until the appeal was decided.id.at,d.but instead of embarking on the intermediate probable validity review,the appellate court simply expedited the appeal and decided its merits.lo and behold,the buyer appeal had merit,the judgment had to be reversed,and the appellate court wound up vacating its own order directing the expungement.id.at,d.
iii.expungement orders under the legislation 
a.the standard of review in the trial court 
in ruling on the postjudgment expungement motion here judge mcmaster,following mix and declin ing to forecast the reversal of his own decision on appeal,granted the motion to expunge.ptf contends that mix was wrongly decided.because the legislation was silent about forecasting the probable validity of a result in the appellate court,ptf reasons,the peery standard appeal presents substantial issue for review should survive.ptf points out that while the code comment declares the legislature intent to overrule malcolm,the comment said nothing about overruling peery.
the argument fails.malcolm and peery were decided within three months of each other.the main difference between the two cases is that malcolm arose in the context of a pretrial expungement motion,while peery was decided after the claimant suffered a summary judgment and his appeal was pending.in peery,the state supreme court noted that prior to trial,the sole issue was the subjective intent of the recording party and thus a minitrial on the merits was inappropriate.peery,supra,cal d at,citing malcolm,supra,cal d at.
looking at the expungement motion in a postjudgment context,peery observed that in some instances the patent lack of merit of a lawsuit may strongly suggest that the plaintiff has not filed the action for a proper purpose or in good faith.peery,supra,cal d at,quoting malcolm,supra,cal d at,italics added.thus,peery declared,although expungement will often be appropriate after summary judgment,the appellant should be given the opportunity to prove that the summary judgment raises substantial issues for appellate review and to otherwise demonstrate his good faith.peery,supra,cal d at,italics added.
a careful reading of the discussion in peery compels the conclusion that the rule it fashioned was rooted in the old good purpose test that predated the legislation.but the code comment makes absolutely clear that that standard is no longer relevant therefore,when the code comment said that the legislation was intended to overrule malcolm and other cases,we have no difficulty concluding that peery is one of those other cases targeted for obsolescence.
we agree with mix that on a motion to expunge a lis pendens after judgment against the claimant and while an appeal is pending,the trial court must grant the motion unless it finds it more likely than not that the appellate court will reverse the judgment judge mcmaster did not err in following mix and granting the expungement motion.
b.the standard of review in the appellate court 
having determined that the trial court committed no error in granting the expungement,we are left with the novel question remaining to be decided in this proceeding by what standard should an appellate court decide whether to issue a writ of mandate relieving the losing real property claimant from the effect of an expungement order while his appeal is pending 
the procedural posture of this case is analogous to the one the appellate court faced in mix and behniwal,except that here the trial court granted summary judgment instead of deciding the case after trial on the merits.however,mix and behniwal do not pose fully satisfying solutions.
first,by touting the prospect of asking the appellate court to issue a stay while it considers the petition,the mix court overlooked the fact that a stay upon the filing of a petition for writ of mandate is section,an expungement order is not effective until the proceeding commenced by the petition is finally adjudicated.
second,although it implied that a probable validity standard should govern whether to grant the losing claimant writ petition,the behniwal court avoided the issue by forging ahead and deciding the merits of the underlying appeal,thereby using a certain validity rather than a probable validity yardstick.behniwal,supra,th at,d as far as we are concerned,the real property claim is not just probably valid,it is definitely valid.
having rejected ptf invitation to follow the obsolete peery standard of substantial issue for review,we face a statutory lacuna that we must fill with our own divination of legislative intent.although the legislature failed to create a statutory standard,the legislation left behind enough clues to enable us to find our way to the coveted portal.
in section,the legislature told the trial court exactly what to do when faced with an expungement motion before trial deny the motion unless the claimant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.we know from the code comment that this section contemplates a minitrial on the merits in an abbreviated proceeding that parallels the procedure long used by a trial court in deciding whether to issue a writ of attachment or possession,or to grant a preliminary injunction.see code,west ann.code civ,supra,foll,pars,citing,cohen board of supervisors cal d.
section tells us the aggrieved claimant should have an opportunity for appellate review of the trial court expungement ruling by petition for writ of mandate,but not by way of appeal.the legislature also granted the loser a temporary reprieve by mandating that the trial court order be stayed until the writ petition is finally resolved.
ptf asserts that we must conduct a searching assessment of the merits for purposes of determining whether the lis pendens should remain in place pending appeal.we disagree.in our mind,a searching examination of the merits is hardly distinguishable from resolving the appeal itself.processing an appeal takes time.and,as long as the lis pendens remains,the passage of time prejudices the successful property owner who has secured the expungement order.as our sister court in the court of appeal,first appellate district,division five,noted,the apparent legislative purpose for making an order expunging a notice of lis pendens reviewable only by writ was to expedite the review process so as not to tie up title conveyances.if we were to wait for an appeal to be perfected on the order removing the lien so as to decide the two matters together,the delay would defeat the purpose of speedy writ review.howard wright construction superior court th,d howard wright.
by enacting a significant overhaul of lis pendens law,the legislature has signaled its intent that,unless a real property claim is likely to succeed in court,a lis pendens should not remain in place while the litigation wends its way to final disposition.applying the probable validity standard in the court of appeal as well as the trial court best serves that goal.we therefore conclude that,in deciding a writ petition under section after judgment and pending appeal,an appellate court must assess whether the underlying real property claim has probable validity as that term is used in section,whether it is more likely than not the real property claim will prevail at the end of the appellate process.this is,in fact,the same standard the appellate court applied in howard wright,although in that case the court was deciding whether to grant mandamus relief from a pretrial,rather than a postjudgment,expungement order.howard wright,supra,th at,d.
in mix,the court declared that an appellate court deciding whether to issue a stay of an expungement order pending resolution of the appeal should do so only in those cases where the miscarriage of justice may so radiate from the record that the appellate court,at least,is willing to prophesy ultimate reversal at the beginning of the appellate process.mix,supra,th at,d.we find this formulation useful not to the issuance of a stay,which is automatic by operation of law,but to the resolution of the writ petition itself.
where an unsuccessful real property claimant appeals a judgment of the trial court and petitions for interim mandamus relief from an expungement order in the appellate court,we will conduct prima facie review of the probable success of the underlying appeal.while this might place us in the somewhat awkward position of attempting to forecast our own resolution of the underlying appeal,we must let the chips fall where they may.it is not unheard of for a trial court to issue a preliminary injunction or a pretrial attachment,only to conclude,when all is said and done,that the defendant should prevail in the end.such a result should not be considered heresy simply because it occurs in a court of higher jurisdiction.
iv.application of the standard to this petition 
in order to resolve the petition,we return to the evidence adduced on the motion for summary judgment.the evidence showed there was a sheriff auction of parcel scheduled for,pursuant to a judicial foreclosure sale noticed by judgment creditor ptf and approved by its attorneys.sergeant paul spreitzer of the sacramento county sheriff department,who calibrated his watch biannually according to the naval observatory atomic clock,started the auction at according to his watch.
although they were stuck in a traffic jam on their way to the sale,ptf representatives did not contact the sheriff to request a postponement of the sale.neither of ptf representatives were present at the start of the sale.
after sergeant spreitzer opened the auction,palmbaum submitted a bid of.this bid was accepted as the last and highest bid.after spreitzer struck the table signifying the property was sold to palmbaum,ptf representatives entered the room,protesting that they had been delayed in traffic and stating their desire to place a bid.spreitzer replied that the sale was over and the property had been sold to palmbaum.the sheriff issued palmbaum a certificate of sale two days later.the judgment debtor,winncrest,did not exercise its right of redemption within the statutory time limit.
ptf brought this action to set aside the sale based on certain irregularities and on equitable grounds.however,section,subdivision a provides except as provided in paragraph of subdivision c,a sale of property pursuant to this article is absolute and
