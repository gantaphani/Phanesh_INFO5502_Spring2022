introduction 
this is an interlocutory appeal from a district court order denying the motion of dana jarvis to release funds.at issue is the propriety of two notices of lis pendens filed under new mexico state law by the united states on substitute property potentially subject to criminal forfeiture under.
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.united states musson,cir.applying an exception to the usual rule that issues not presented below are forfeited on appeal,this court concludes the use by the united states of the new mexico lis pendens statute was improper.the order of the district court denying jarvis motion to release funds is,therefore,reversed and this case remanded to the district court with instructions to order the lis pendens notices removed.
ii.background 
jarvis,along with twenty other defendants,was charged in initial and superceding indictments with conspiracy to distribute kilograms or more of marijuana,in violation of conspiracy to launder money and knowing conduct of a financial transaction involving proceeds of unlawful activity,in violation of and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,in violation of and.
the initial indictment contained a criminal forfeiture allegation stating that,upon conviction for one or more of the substantive offenses,all defendants would be jointly and severally liable for a money judgment of just over million in proceeds allegedly derived from or involved in the indicted offenses.the forfeitures were to be carried out pursuant to and.the superseding indictment contained the same criminal offense charges as the initial indictment,but named a different combination of defendants and broadened the alleged time frame of the conspiracy and continuing criminal enterprise by twelve years.as a result,the superceding indictment increased the demand for money judgment from million to million.
bank accounts,several parcels of real property,conveyances of personal property,and a liquor license were listed in the initial and superceding indictments as forfeitable property connected to the defendants criminal conduct the superceding indictment added seized united states currency as forfeitable property.both the original and superceding indictments listed two pieces of real property titled to jarvis among the substitute assets to be forfeited pursuant to p in the event other property directly connected to the alleged criminal activity was unavailable for forfeiture these two parcels are collectively known as the mora properties,located in mora county,new mexico.
the united states recorded notices of lis pendens on the mora properties with the mora county clerk,see stat.ann,and filed the notices with the district court.the notices include the language,the property located in mora county,new mexico,was criminally indicted in this case and the united states is seeking the forfeiture of all that lot or parcel of land,together with its buildings,appurtenances,improvements,fixtures,attachments,and easements thereon.the united states did not attempt to use the criminal forfeiture statute to seek a federal protective order on the mora properties 
claiming the united states lis pendens notices on the mora properties prevented him from liquidating these properties to pay for retained defense counsel,jarvis moved the district court to release his property.jarvis explained to the court that he had no other assets with which to retain counsel.he argued the mora properties,which were purchased well before the initiation of the criminal activity charged in the indictment,were substitute assets within the meaning of p.looking to the federal protective order provision of the criminal forfeiture statute,e,as well as most federal courts of appeals interpretations of that statute,jarvis contended there was no legal basis for the restraint of substitute assets without a conviction and forfeiture order.because the united states restraint of the mora properties prevented him from hiring the counsel of his choice and deprived him of his sixth amendment right,jarvis argued,a due process hearing was required before the united states could effectively freeze his assets.
the united states responded to jarvis motion by contending that a lis pendens is not a legal restraint,but merely functions as constructive notice to prospective purchasers.even if a lis pendens were a restraint,however,the united states argued that substitute assets such as the mora properties may be restrained consistent with the statutory scheme provided for in,especially in light of the guidance in o that the criminal forfeiture statute be liberally construed to effect its objectives.
drawing heavily on the united states arguments,the district court denied jarvis motion,concluding the filing of a lis pendens does not constitute a restraint of property within the meaning of.based on the reasoning in united states register,cir,and aronson city of akron,cir,and borrowing language from united states james daniel good real property,d,the court determined that a lis pendens did not interfere with any legal incidents of property ownership such as the right of sale,the right of occupancy,the right to unrestricted use and enjoyment,and the right to receive rents and,therefore,did not constitute a property deprivation triggering due process concerns.the court also rejected jarvis argument that the nature of the properties as substitute assets,rather than forfeitable assets,should affect the court analysis.
jarvis moved the court to reconsider,again attempting to draw a distinction between forfeitable property under a and substitute property under p.he argued that new mexico law classifies a lis pendens as a restraint and that a restraint can not apply to substitute property until a court has issued an order of forfeiture and the government is unable to satisfy the order with forfeitable a property.he contended the lis pendens notices on the mora properties were,therefore,a violation of state law.the united states,in response,maintained that because a lis pendens does not affect the owner legal right to alienate his property,it is not a restraint.it again also argued that restraint of substitute assets is permissible under the federal statutory scheme.after holding an evidentiary hearing,which included testimony by a realtor on the effect of a lis pendens notice on a seller practical ability to alienate his land,the court rejected jarvis motion to reconsider,concluding in a single sentence that jarvis had not presented any new arguments regarding his motion to release funds.
jarvis timely appealed the district court denial of his motion under the collateral order doctrine.see musson,at recognizing an exception to the final judgment rule in a federal criminal forfeiture case where the disputed issues involving the propriety of a restraining order are collateral to and separate from the issue of the defendants guilt or innocence.on appeal,in addition to reviving the argument that a lis pendens constitutes an unlawful restraint on substitute assets under,jarvis introduces a theory not presented below regarding the nature of substitute assets in a criminal forfeiture proceeding.jarvis contends that,under the new mexico lis pendens statute,a notice of lis pendens is only proper where the underlying litigation involves a dispute affecting title to the same real property upon which the notice has been filed.he argues p substitute property can never be the subject of such underlying litigation.rather,he argues,the united states seeks a money judgment for the more than million allegedly attributable to jarvis criminal activities and that,under new mexico law,a lis pendens can not be used to secure a money judgment in an action unrelated to the property upon which the lis pendens has been placed.see hill dep t of the air force,cir.jarvis alleges the district court erred when ruling on his motion by concluding the threshold issue was whether a lis pendens constituted a restraint within the meaning of.instead,jarvis argues,the court should have considered in the first instance whether the lis pendens notices were lawful as a matter of new mexico state law 
the united states responds that jarvis state law argument was forfeited by his failure to present this theory to the district court on the merits,the united states asserts the lis pendens notices were proper because title to the mora properties could be affected by jarvis conviction and,therefore,the criminal action against jarvis is one affecting title to real property within the meaning of the new mexico lis pendens statute.as to jarvis argument regarding the prohibition on filing of a lis pendens in anticipation of a money judgment,the government contends hill is distinguishable because it involved a lis pendens filed in anticipation of a money judgment in a civil tort suit rather than in a criminal forfeiture proceeding.
iii.discussion 
forfeiture of argument raised for first time on appeal 
at no point in the proceedings below did jarvis ever fully articulate the theory he relies upon now,that new mexico lis pendens notices are improperly utilized in an in personam criminal forfeiture action where the real property itself is not the subject of the litigation or connected to the defendant criminal activity.the united states,similarly,never addressed this argument,nor did the court make any findings or reach any legal conclusions responsive to jarvis isolated reference to this theory.this court would,therefore,ordinarily decline to consider jarvis argument under the principle that issues not presented below are forfeited on appeal,comm r,cir propounding new arguments on appeal in an attempt to prompt us to reverse the trial court undermines important judicial values.
exceptions to the forfeiture principle 
although a litigant failure to raise an argument before the district court generally results in forfeiture on appeal,forfeiture is not jurisdictional.singleton wulff,d.whether to address the argument despite the litigant failure to raise it below is subject to this court discretion based on the circumstances of the individual case.id.for example,the supreme court has indicated appellate courts might be justified in resolving an issue for the first time on appeal where the proper resolution is beyond any doubt or where injustice might otherwise result.id.at.citation and quotation omitted.this court has characterized its willingness to exercise its discretion to hear issues not raised below only in the most unusual circumstances.lyons jefferson bank trust,cir.we have consistently stated that a party may not lose in the district court on one theory of the case,and then prevail on appeal on a different theory.id.
nevertheless,this court has recognized an exception where the argument involves a pure matter of law and the proper resolution of the issue is certain.geddes united staffing alliance employee med.plan,cir united steelworkers of am.or.steel mills,cir considering new statutory argument for the first time on appeal proctor gamble haugen,cir exercising discretion where district court error in statutory interpretation was purely legal issue with a certain resolution sussman patterson,cir exercising discretion where issue not raised below was purely legal issue,had been fully briefed by the parties,and involved important public policy concerns grubb fdic,cir exercising discretion because issue presented only a question of law.we have justified our decision to exercise discretion in these situations because no additional findings of fact or presentation of evidence were required for the issue disposition and both parties had the opportunity to address the issue in their appellate briefing.see,trierweiler croxton trench holding,cir grubb,at.
application of the forfeiture exception 
under the circumstances presented here,this court determines an exercise of our discretion is warranted to permit us to consider whether the federal government use of a lis pendens was appropriate under new mexico law.the issue before us is purely legal in nature and the relevant statutory language and case law dictate a certain result this,therefore,is one of the unusual cases in which it is proper to apply the forfeiture exception.
pure issue of law 
none of the traditional functions unique to a trial court are necessary to the development of the issue jarvis presents for the first time on appeal.the facts are not in dispute and there is nothing the trial court could have done to facilitate resolution of the issue.had the trial court been given the opportunity to rule,our review would be de novo,just as it is now.the issue presents a pure question of law and both parties have fully briefed and argued the issue before this court.
certainty of proper resolution 
the purpose of recording a notice of lis pendens on a piece of real property is to provide constructive notice to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers of litigation affecting the title to the real property.title guar.ins.campbell,app utsunomiya,moomuku country club,haw,stating the purpose of a lis pendens notice is to provide notice of pending litigation and not to make plaintiffs secured creditors of defendants.in new mexico,a lis pendens notice is essentially a republication of the pleadings filed in the pending judicial proceedings.title guar.ins,at.under the new mexico lis pendens statute,a notice of lis pendens may only be recorded by plaintiffs in actions affecting the title to real estate.stat.ann.superior,linnerooth,a notice of lis pendens may be properly filed only if plaintiff pleads a cause of action which involves or affects the title to,or any interest in or a lien upon,specifically described real property.emphasis added quotation omitted.
to be eligible to record a lis pendens notice on a piece of real property,however,the party recording the notice must assert a present claim to the property title or have some other present interest in the subject property.see richard powell,powell on real property,at wolf,hereinafter powell.the notice is intended to preserve the property rights in existence at the time the litigation commences,but does not create new or additional property rights.id.p ublic policy underlying a lis pendens notice requires that the property interests existing at the time the court action is initiated be preserved until the court judgment can be enforced in favor of the prevailing party.emphasis added.in new mexico,a lis pendens can not be filed in anticipation of a money judgment.hill,at.a lis pendens also generally can not be used as a substitute for a prejudgment attachment,the cadle.ii,superior constr.contracting,in re rice,or to create a constructive trust on property to satisfy a potential monetary judgment,flores haberman.
for the united states to record a notice of lis pendens,it must establish that the underlying action,a criminal forfeiture proceeding,is one affecting the title to real estate,stat.ann,specifically,the mora properties.criminal forfeiture is an in personam action in which the forfeiture of and the vesting of title in the united states in the defendant tainted property is imposed as a punishment against the defendant.see united states nichols,cir c riminal forfeiture was designed both to penalize and to deter criminal activity.united states in canadian currency,cir.the government interest in and right to the defendant property is defined in.assets constituting,or derived from,any proceeds of the defendant criminal action and property used,or intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of the defendant criminal action shall be forfeited upon conviction.a.by virtue of the statute provision,the united states obtains a vested right,title,and interest in such tainted a property superior to that of third parties upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture.id.c.the government,furthermore,has the ability to seek a protective order to restrain tainted assets prior to trial in order to ensure the availability of the tainted property in the event of the defendant conviction.see id.e.
