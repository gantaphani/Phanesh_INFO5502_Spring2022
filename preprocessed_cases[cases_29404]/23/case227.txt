facts and proceedings below 
the facts of this case are not in dispute.on july,the jordans purchased a chevrolet silverado pickup truck the truck.in order to finance the truck,the jordans entered into a texas vehicle retail installment contract with drive financial.the contract provided drive financial with a properly perfected,security interest in the truck.the contract provided for an interest rate of.
on or about december,the jordans filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court,eastern district of texas when the jordans drafted their chapter plan,they elected to retain possession of the truck and to pay drive financial secured claim in installments with an interest rate of six percent.on january,drive financial filed an objection to the jordans chapter plan on the grounds that the proper interest rate to apply to its secured claim was the contract rate of.the bankruptcy court held a hearing on drive financial objection on march.at this hearing the bankruptcy court ordered additional briefing on the applicability of the decision in till scs credit,d,to the determination of the interest rate the jordans were to pay on drive financial secured claim.

discussion 
the central question in this case is what is the proper rate of interest to be paid on a secured claim that is paid in installments pursuant to a chapter plan.the bankruptcy code states that a chapter plan should only be confirmed if,for each allowed secured claim the holder of that claim accepts the plan the holder of the claim retains the lien securing the claim and the chapter plan provides that the value,as of the date of the plan,of property generally cash to be distributed under the plan to the holder of the claim is not less than the allowed amount of such claim or the debtor surrenders the property securing the claim.see a.in this case,drive financial did not accept the plan and the jordans are not surrendering the truck,so in order for the plan to be confirmed,the jordans plan must provide for distribution to drive financial of property that has no less value than the amount of drive financial secured claim the bankruptcy code reference to paying value is generally understood to incorporate the principle of the time value of money,so payments made pursuant to a chapter plan must incorporate an interest rate to account for the fact that a dollar paid today is worth more than a dollar paid tomorrow.till.at thomas,concurring in judgment.the bankruptcy code,however,provides little guidance as to how the interest rate should be set,so we look to past precedent to determine whether the bankruptcy court applied the correct interest rate to drive financial secured claim.
standard of review 
when directly reviewing an order of the bankruptcy court,we apply the same standard of review that would have been used by the district court.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.fed.
ii.does bapcpa hanging paragraph supercede till 
the supreme court recently addressed what rate of interest needed to be paid to an objecting secured creditor whose claim was paid in installments under a chapter plan.see till.at stevens,plurality holding that the approach should be used to determine the proper interest rate.after till,congress enacted bapcpa,which made significant changes to the bankruptcy code.so before examining till,we must determine whether it has been superceded by any provisions of bapcpa.
bapcpa added an unnumbered paragraph following section a.this paragraph is commonly referred to as the hanging paragraph.the hanging paragraph provides that section of the bankruptcy code,shall not apply if 
the creditor has a purchase money security interest securing the debt that is the subject of the claim,the debt was incurred within the sic preceding the date of the filing of the petition,and the collateral for that debt consists of a motor vehicle as defined in section of title acquired for the personal use of the debtor 
a.section permits a debtor to bifurcate a secured creditor claim into a secured and an unsecured portion if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of the claim.the portion of the claim that is greater than the value of the collateral is unsecured and the portion equal to the value is secured.this bifurcation process is known as stripping down a secured creditor lien,and it is commonly used by debtors in conjunction with the cram down option to retain depreciated collateral on significantly better terms the hanging paragraph prevents this bifurcation for secured claims that meet its criteria,so the entire claim remains secured,regardless of the value of the collateral 
drive financial argues that since the hanging paragraph makes section inapplicable to its claim,the supreme court opinion in till is distinguishable because it dealt with a and it was decided before the hanging paragraph was added to the bankruptcy code if till is distinguishable,drive financial contends that this court should follow its prior precedent and mandate that the jordans chapter plan use the contract rate to pay off its claim.green tree fin.servicing smithwick,cir adopting the presumptive contract rate approach to determine the interest rate to be paid on a secured chapter claim.
