the instant appeal raises a problem that arises frequently in bankruptcy proceedings.the question before us is whether the court should permit the modification of a chapter plan after confirmation pursuant to of the bankruptcy code,or instead allow the secured creditor to repossess its security,a ford truck,because under the modified plan the value of the security will fall faster than the creditor receives payments.in resolving this dispute,we look to the procedure outlined in our court previous case of memphis bank trust whitman,cir dividing a secured claim in chapter proceedings into the allowed secured claim and allowed unsecured claim and requiring the payment in chapter of the allowed secured claim and a reasonable interest rate on that amount as the allowed unsecured claim.as discussed below,applying the procedure and standard set out in memphis bank,we affirm the decision of the courts below denying the motion to lift the stay and permitting the modification of the chapter plan.
background 
the payment schedule under the modification in the instant case does not seem to require the rate of payment by the debtor to keep pace with the depreciation of the truck,thereby allowing the value of the retained lien in the truck to fall below the amount owed by the chapter debtors.section provides in relevant part 
modification of plan after confirmation 
a at any time after confirmation of the plan but before the completion of payments under such plan,the plan may be modified,upon request of the debtor,the trustee,or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim,to 
increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by the plan 
extend or reduce the time for such payments or 
alter the amount of the distribution to a creditor 
b sections a,b,and c and the requirements of section a apply to any modification under subsection a of this section.
in turn,a using general the circumstances under which a modification may be approved by the bankruptcy court to situations in which the secured creditor is allowed to retain the lien securing such a claim.judge keith lundin in his treatise on chapter bankruptcy cases explains in a general way how these provisions must be interpreted to insure the value of the secured creditor retained lien 
lien retention in a b i has been interpreted to require that payments through the plan must at least equal depreciation in the value of collateral during the repayment period.not to be confused with adequate protection before confirmation or with the payment of present value interest after confirmation,lien retention avoids constitutional problems only if periodic payments under the plan equal or exceed the value lost through depreciation and use of collateral by the debtor after confirmation.put another way,even if the plan recites that secured claim holders retain liens,if the payments proposed by the plan are insufficient to stay ahead of depreciation,the retained liens will erode faster than the allowed secured claim is paid,contrary to the intent of a b i.
the power to modify a secured claim is limited to the extent that the debtor must propose payments that equal or exceed the depreciation in value of the collateral that secures the claim.otherwise,the delay in payments through the plan would take value from the lien without compensating the creditors for its loss.
l ien retention is implicated when the order of payments to creditors under the plan delays or interrupts the payment of a secured claim such that the value of the collateral falls more quickly than the lienholder receives payments.
keith lundin,chapter bankruptcy to ed emphasis added.
the supreme court has recognized,as did the common law,that the secured creditor has two types of rights the contractual right to obtain repayment of its debt with a fair rate of return in the form of interest payments and the property right the creditor has in the collateral that secures the debt.these two types of rights together constitute the bundle of rights held by the secured creditor.bankruptcy laws have long been construed to authorize the impairment of contractual obligations.united states security indus.bank,d citing hanover bank moyses.the power of the bankruptcy laws,however,is subject to the fifth amendment prohibition against taking property without just compensation.this distinction creates the also tension between permitting the impairment of contractual obligations while maintaining the integrity of the property rights.security indus.bank,at.citing louisville joint stock land bank radford.
courts constantly struggle with this balance in bankruptcy proceedings.for example,in armstrong united states,d,subcontractors delivered material to the prime contractor for use in constructing navy vessels,obtaining liens in the vessels as required by state law.the prime contractor defaulted on its obligation to the navy and the united states took possession of the uncompleted hulls and unused materials,making it impossible for the subcontractors to enforce their secured interest in the property in the form of liens.the supreme court held this action constituted a taking due to the total destruction by the united states of all value in the liens.the court found the liens to be compensable personal property susceptible to a taking and not a mere consequential incidence of a valid regulatory measure id.at.while the bankruptcy laws allow interference with contractual arrangements and some diminution of property rights,if the interference goes so far as to constitute total destruction of the value in the property held by a creditor,it violates the fifth amendment and may not stand.
we note that in the instant case,americredit has not directly made a fifth amendment takings argument.because americredit clearly has a property interest in the collateral,we must decide whether the modification to the plan so interferes with its economic rights in that property to result in an unconstitutional taking.we do not find such a harm because the modified plan approved by the bankruptcy court leaves americredit in the position for which it bargained a fixed amount for a fixed period.the only difference is the delay before americredit will receive its final payment,and,under the circumstances here,we do not find that the delay unduly impairs the value of its lien or encroaches on its fifth amendment rights.
ii.motion to lift the automatic stay 
in this case,the debtors,dwight and peggy nichols,purchased a used ford truck in for,putting down and taking out an installment loan of from lender americredit.as a term of the loan,americredit had a first lien and security interest in the truck.the loan,with interest,was to be paid back in monthly installments of over five years,totaling.on june,debtors filed for bankruptcy under chapter.although the record is not clear on exactly how much had been paid on the installment loan at the time of the bankruptcy filing,debtors had made monthly payments for about or months totaling approximately.
a chapter plan was approved in august whereby americredit became one of several secured creditors.the plan called for the debtors,over a period,to pay the trustee,not americredit,a certain amount each week and the trustee would then distribute the money to creditors based upon priorities set out in the plan.at the time of confirmation of the original plan in august,americredit agreed to a value on the truck of and a lien amount of,leaving debtors with in equity in the truck at that time.under the original chapter plan as approved by the bankruptcy court,the remainder of the truck loan would have been repaid over the term of the plan 
dwight nichols lost his job in and the debtors ceased making the required payments to the trustee in full as required under the plan.the nichols missed payments to the trustee between august,and january.as a result,the trustee did not make regular payments to the creditors during this time,including americredit.in response,americredit filed,in december after about four months of missed payments,a motion for relief from the automatic stay pursuant to with the intent to repossess the truck if the stay was lifted.
in order to lift the stay and repossess the truck,it is americredit burden to demonstrate that the value of the collateral has fallen below the amount owed.g.as far as we can tell from the record,americredit has failed to establish that at the time of its motion to lift the stay,or even at the time of the plan modification shortly thereafter,that the value of the truck had fallen below what was owed.although the bankruptcy court did not make clear findings on the value of the truck or the amount still owed or the number and amount of missed payments,the parties agree that the value of the truck,according to the national automobile dealers association,was at the time of filing the motion to lift the stay in addition,americredit stated in its motion for relief from the stay that the amount in arrears is.based on americredit own numbers,the equity in the truck at the time of the filing of the motion for relief from the stay was.therefore,the record indicates that while americredit was close to being undersecured when it filed its motion to lift the stay,a small equity cushion still existed.an equity cushion exists when the appraised value of the collateral is greater than the amount owed on the loan.a lender seeks to lend on an equity cushion,among other reasons,in order to hedge against the depreciation in the value of the collateral.it was undoubtedly close,but it is undisputed that the debtors still had equity in the truck so that relief under section d was not warranted.
in addition to a lack of equity,creditors may also seek to lift the stay for cause.d.americredit primary argument supporting its motion to lift the stay for cause was that the value of the truck had fallen,or would soon fall,below the amount owed on the loan.a majority of courts that have construed the for cause provision of section d have found that a debtor failure to make payments to the creditor after confirmation of the plan can constitute cause to modify or lift an automatic stay.the failure to make payments,standing alone,however,does not usually constitute cause to modify or lift the stay,especially where failure to pay resulted from circumstances beyond the debtor control,such as illness or job loss.when there is still equity in the collateral,courts are not inclined to lift the stay.in re mathews,listing cases holding that where there was equity in the collateral,the stay was not lifted or modified,despite missed payments after confirmation in re raymond.generally,before modifying or lifting a stay,a court should first weigh the equities by conducting a analysis of the circumstances surrounding the default.in re mendoza,cir citations omitted.
after a hearing before the bankruptcy judge on the motion for relief from the automatic stay,the bankruptcy court ordered that the stay would be lifted unless the nichols either paid the amount in arrears within two weeks of the hearing or filed a motion to modify its chapter plan to explain how it planned to pay what it owed to americredit and the other creditors.see transcript of hearing held january.under the circumstances,we find no abuse of discretion in the bankruptcy court decision to deny the motion to lift the stay and allow debtors to file a proposed modification of the plan.
iii.modification of the plan 
the debtors chose to modify the plan pursuant to.as stated above,section a provides that prior to completion of payments under the plan,the debtor may request a modification of the plan to increase or decrease the amount of payments or extend or reduce the time for payments.modification of the plan is one way a debtor may cure a default,provided that the plan,as modified,conforms with the requirements of a and b contents of plan,and a requirements for confirmation of plan.b in re hoggle,cir in re davis,but see in re nicholson,disallowing modification to cure arrearages.
a new modified chapter plan was drawn up whereby debtors would increase the weekly payments to the trustee,but,in accordance with the class priorities set out in the original plan,the arrearage on the debtors home mortgage was to be paid up before the other secured creditors in lower classes,such as americredit,would get any further payments.americredit objected to this modified plan,arguing that it would not receive payments on the truck for approximately a year and during that time the value of the truck would fall below the amount owed,thereby prejudicing its lien rights in violation of.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing concerning americredit objections to the modified chapter plan.see transcript of hearing held.americredit stated at the hearing held on the plan modification on february,that the plan modification severely prejudices the collateral the truck in violation of its lien rights under a b i,which requires,as stated above,that for each secured claim under the plan,the plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the lien securing such claim the bankruptcy court overruled americredit objections to the plan modification,ruling,among other things,that the lack of adequate protection for the truck was not sufficient reason to deny modification of the plan and,moreover,the evidence did not demonstrate that the value of the truck had fallen below the amount owed.
americredit appealed the denial of its motion to lift the automatic stay and the order modifying chapter plan to the district court,which held a hearing on july.the district court issued a order affirming the bankruptcy court and did not issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law.we sympathize with the district court stated frustration during the hearing the parties have not presented me with the clearest record in terms of exhibits,and the bankruptcy court has used different figures.but i am prepared to rule based on the figures that you just gave me,which i think are in the record i not finding whether the bankruptcy judge was right or wrong.i finding the bankruptcy judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for relief from the stay and approving the plan modification and on the record as presented in this case.see transcript of july,hearing at.
iv.analysis 
although often left unstated in bankruptcy cases,the concept behind the treatment of secured claims like americredit is fairly simple.the total allowed claim of the secured creditor is divided into two parts the allowed secured claim and the allowed unsecured claim.
in order to clarify this distinction,a procedure was set out by this court almost years ago for handling a secured claim in a chapter plan.memphis bank trust whitman,cir.in memphis bank we held that section a requires the bankruptcy court to assess interest on an allowed secured claim for the present value of the collateral in order to avoid dilution of the value of the claim through the delay in payment.as we explained 
the concept behind the treatment of secured claims under the then new chapter is fairly simple.the total claim of the secured creditor which is to be allowed is divided into two parts,the secured portion of the claim and the unsecured portion.these two are called in section the allowed secured claim and the allowed unsecured claim.the secured portion of the total claim represents the present value of the collateral and the unsecured portion is the remainder,the amount the allowed claim exceeds the value of the collateral.
memphis bank,at.
the advantage to the creditor of this approach is that it knows the plan will require the debtor to repay the debt to the extent of the value of the security.but we also held in memphis bank that if this amount will not be paid immediately,interest should be assessed on the amount which the debtor will repay to compensate the creditor for the use of its money.we recognized in memphis bank that under section,the creditor is required,in effect,to make a new loan in the amount of the value of the collateral rather than repossess it,but the creditor is entitled to interest on his loan.see also united states arnold,cir.
the procedure in memphis bank should be applied in the original plan as well as any later modifications to the plan,which includes the case before
