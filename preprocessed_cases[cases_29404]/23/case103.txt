this sentencing appeal primarily concerns a loss calculation under the provision of the sentencing guidelines governing an intended loss for fraud offenses.see.the appeal also presents a challenge to an enhancement for offenses committed while released on bail.see id.gary confredo appeals from the june,amended judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york leonard sand,district judge sentencing him to imprisonment for months following his plea of guilty to various offenses involving fraudulent loan applications.we remand for reconsideration of the intended loss amount.
background 
criminal conduct and guilty plea.doing business through an entity called granite financial services,confredo and his associates coordinated the submission of more than fraudulent loan applications to new york city area banks,including approximately applications seeking in excess of million from citibank,on behalf of hundreds of small businesses who were his customers.confredo customers knew that the loan applications were fraudulent.
to carry out the scheme,confredo exploited his educational training in finance and his experience as a former loan officer for a bank he knew what banks looked for when deciding whether to extend a business loan and he drafted or procured the drafting of the fictitious loan applications,tax returns,financial statements,and other supporting documents accordingly.on paper,the loan applicants were and profitable businesses in reality,many of them were not even going concerns but merely vehicles concocted by confredo and his associates for the sole purpose of securing loans for their customers.
the majority of confredo customers were not,and would not have obtained loans without the false information supplied to the banks by confredo and his associates.defense counsel alleged at a proceeding before judge sand in may,without dispute from the government,that in the majority of instances,individuals institutions with good credit the loan applications.however,there is no indication that any of the approximately million in loans that were ultimately granted were secured by bona fide assets pledged as collateral.
for the services provided by confredo and his,granite financial services received a fee that typically amounted to between ten and fifteen per cent of the loan amount.customers paid a portion of the fee up front if the bank denied a customer loan application,confredo or his associates would sometimes return the customer payment and sometimes retain it.the presentence report psr estimates that,after payments to his associates and staff,confredo personal share of the proceeds from the scheme was approximately.
while on bail following his arrest,confredo purported to give truthful information during proffer sessions with the government,but the government became suspicious and enlisted a cooperator to meet with confredo and record their discussion.during that meeting,confredo told the cooperator that he was still arranging fraudulent loan deals while on bail,had been lying during the proffer sessions,and had been involved in loan sharking.
in light of his criminal conduct and his discussion with the cooperator,the government presented additional evidence to the grand jury,which returned a superseding indictment the indictment in october,certain counts of which related to offenses confredo had committed while released on bail.
in february,pursuant to a plea agreement,confredo pled guilty to one count of bank fraud,two counts of false statements on a loan application,one count of false statement to a federal law enforcement officer,and one count of witness tampering b.the last four offenses were committed after confredo initial arrest and release in november.the plea agreement includes no stipulations as to amount of loss or the applicable sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines.
the loss calculation.the psr calculated the loss amount to be the total amount requested in the various loan applications involved in confredo scheme,which it estimated to be million.citibank was the target of the majority of the fraudulent applications more than,and it loaned approximately million to confredo customers.the psr noted that the actual loss to the banks was extremely difficult to ascertain due to the amount of loans involved,the continual loan payments received by the banks from the customers of the loans and the negotiations of settlement agreements between the banks and these customers.but the probation office did obtain loss statements from a few banks.one citibank official reported payments of about million,and hence an expected actual loss of million but another citibank official reported a total loss of million.the combined actual loss reported by the other banks from whom the probation office obtained statements was slightly higher than million.confredo did not file any objections to the psr.
the first sentencing.using the guidelines,applicable to confredo offense conduct,judge sand began with a base offense level of,see a,added levels not challenged on this appeal,added levels for an intended loss of more than million but less than million,see b q,and added more levels because four counts of confredo conviction involved offenses he committed while on release after his arrest,see.the adjusted offense level of in criminal history category i yielded a sentence range of to months 
with respect to the loss enhancement,the government argued,and the probation officer agreed,that judge sand should determine the enhancement based on the intended loss attributable to confredo conduct,which they contended was represented by the combined face value of the loan applications,million.confredo conceded that the actual loss caused by his scheme was in excess of million,but less than million judge sand ruled that intended,rather than actual,loss was the proper measure of the amount of loss under b q,and that the amount of the intended loss was the total of all the loan applications.judge sand also adopted the psr restitution recommendation,ordering restitution in the amount of.
although confredo did not dispute the amount of intended loss for purposes of determining the appropriate loss enhancement,defense counsel did discuss the amount of loss at the first sentencing in the context of confredo request for a downward departure.among the grounds advanced to justify a departure was a claim that the amount of loss calculation overstated the true amount of loss for various reasons,including confredo alleged intention that the loans would be paid for the most part.
the enhancement for offenses committed while on release was not discussed at the first sentencing,but is challenged on appeal under apprendi new jersey,d,decided after the sentencing.
judge sand denied confredo request for a downward departure and orally announced a sentence of months,which was the top of the applicable guidelines range.judge sand also entered months as the total term of imprisonment on the judgment form.however,judge sand distribution of the sentence among confredo five counts of conviction yielded a total of only months,as reflected in the summary order disposing of confredo prior appeal.see united states confredo,cir.confredo i.in addition,with respect to the four counts to which the section enhancement applied,judge sand did not apportion the sentence between the underlying offenses and the enhancement,as required by.
first appeal.confredo appealed,raising numerous claims.as to two of the issues raised on the first confusion about whether the total sentence was or months,and the absence of a section government conceded that a remand for resentencing was necessary.as additional grounds for resentencing,confredo presented the two claims that are the subject of this appeal the district court loss calculation was erroneous and the section enhancement was unlawful under apprendi,decided after the first sentencing,because the indictment did not charge that he had committed offenses while on release.
on the first appeal,we remanded for resentencing on the first two grounds just discussed.see confredo i.at.as to confredo apprendi claim,we declined to consider it,stating,we find it more appropriate to allow the district court to consider it in the first instance on remand.id.at.as to confredo claim regarding the loss amount,we noted that confredo did not object to the loss calculation in the presentence report or object to the district court loss calculation at sentencing.id.at.however,because the loss amount issue had been discussed in connection with confredo request for a downward departure,we deemed it appropriate to permit the district court to revisit the issue on remand.
confredo conviction in the eastern district of new york.the united states attorney office for the eastern district of new york prosecuted confredo for laundering some of the proceeds generated by his fraudulent loan application scheme.confredo pled guilty,and,in march,the late judge jacob mishler imposed a sentence.judge mishler ordered this sentence to run concurrently with whatever sentence judge sand would impose on remand in this case.
resentencing.in june,judge sand resentenced confredo at the resentencing hearing,the only disputed issues as to the applicable sentencing range were the loss amount calculation and the section enhancement.as to loss amount,the government argued that judge sand should follow the probation office recommendation of a enhancement for a loss amount of between and million.the government position was based entirely on the loan applications it maintained that because confredo customers had applied for a combined value of more than million in loans,the intended loss was more than million.confredo argued for a enhancement on the theory that his intended loss was between and million he contended that he did not intend a loss in excess of million to occur because he expected the banks to reject some of the loan applications and expected at least some of his customers to pay back all or some of their loans.confredo cited evidence that many applications were denied and some loan repayments had occurred,leaving the actual loss between million and million,and in fact closer to million.
as he had at the first sentencing,judge sand agreed with the government loss calculation.as a threshold matter,judge sand ruled that confredo had waived his loss amount argument by not raising it at the first sentencing,but then rejected confredo argument on the merits.in summary,judge sand found the point unpersuasive because 
confredo undertook no obligation himself to pay off the loans he secured.his cut was paid when the loans were secured it did not matter whether they were paid back.confredo is not a borrower who used fraud to obtain a loan which he then paid back in full.see generally united states schneider,cir.confredo secured loans for dozens of entities and he retained no control whether those loans were paid off,nor did his remuneration change depending on whether the borrowers paid any of the funds back.
consequently,judge sand again ruled that in this case the intended loss was the combined face value of all the loans for which confredo customers had applied,which the psr estimated to be million.he stated that he had rejected all of confredo arguments,including the statutory and apprendi objections to the section enhancement,and was staying with the original month guidelines range.confredo counsel asked the judge to impose a sentence at the low end of the range,taking into account various mitigating factors,including the fact that several million dollars of loans provided to confredo customers by citibank had been repaid,reducing the bank losses.
judge sand then orally delivered a formal opinion explaining his reason for giving a sentence,consistent with what he understood his obligations to be under united states rattoballi,cir.because judge mishler lacked authority to have the eastern district sentence run concurrently with a sentence that had not yet been imposed,santa tippy,cir citing mack nelson,judge sand implemented judge mishler intent by subtracting months,which confredo had already served,from the top of the applicable guideline range,months,which judge sand would otherwise have used.he then imposed a sentence of months,resulting in the same amount of time to be served as if he had imposed a sentence of months to which judge mishler sentence would have run concurrently 
discussion 
amount of loss 
availability of claim.as noted,judge sand ruled at the resentencing that confredo had waived more accurately,forfeited his challenge to the loss amount calculation by failing to raise it at the first sentencing.it is true that confredo filed no objections to the psr,and his counsel appeared to concede at the first sentencing both that the intended loss controlled and that the amount of this loss was more than million.but it is also true that confredo sought a departure in part on the ground that he intended some of the loans to be repaid,which in fact they were.even if the loss claim was not properly asserted in the district court,we will entertain the claim under all the circumstances on the somewhat relaxed application of plain error review that we and other courts have on occasion deemed appropriate for unpreserved sentencing errors.see united states simmons,cir united states,cir united states sofsky,cir.
merits.confredo challenges the aggregation of all the loan applications to arrive at the intended loss amount for two reasons based on his experience as a loan officer,he did not expect that all of the loans for which he prepared applications would be granted,let alone at the full amounts sought,and he expected some of the loans to be repaid by his customers.conceding an intended loss of more than million but less than million,he contends that the loss enhancement should have been levels,see b p,instead of.although the dispute concerns only one level of enhancement,the difference between the resulting maximums of the two arguably applicable ranges is months.
in considering confredo claim,we encounter some uncertainty as to the standard of review,arising from uncertainty as to whether judge sand enhancement was based on a finding of fact,which we would review only for clear error,see united states rubenstein,cir,or was based,at least in part,on an interpretation of the relevant guideline,which we would review de novo,see united states rutkoske,cir court of appeals has obligation to determine if trial court method of calculating loss was legally acceptable.even though a sentence was imposed in order to effectuate judge mishler attempt to make his sentence concurrent,any error in making the initial calculation of the applicable guideline range will normally undermine the validity of the resulting sentence,especially in a case like confredo where the sentence is calculated precisely with reference to what a guidelines sentence would have been.see united states fagans,cir.
if judge sand found as a matter of fact that confredo intended to cause a loss equal to the face amount of all of the loans,such a finding would likely be affirmed on review only for clear error.similarly,if judge sand concluded that confredo had failed to present evidence putting his intent in issue,we would likely affirm a conclusion that the aggregate amount of the loans was the intended loss.however,the rationale for judge sand decision appears to be based,at least in part,on his view that a presenter of fraudulent loan applications will be deemed as a matter of law to have intended a loss equal to the aggregate amount of the loans whenever the presenter is not the borrower.whether that is a correct interpretation of the fraud guideline requires consideration of the somewhat varied case law on the subject.
prior to,we had stated that the proper measure of intended loss was the total value of the loan obtained or sought,without regard to whether the defendant had intended to repay the lender.see united states brach,cir.the rationale was that the defendant crime was analogous to theft,see united states kopp,cir,a rationale supported by the version of application note of the fraud guideline,which appeared to treat fraud offenses like theft offenses when calculating the loss amount,see,comment.commentary to guideline for theft offenses,brach,at.
in,the sentencing commission amended application note.see app.c,amend,at.the note had instructed the sentencing court to determine loss based on a probable or intended loss,comment.the amended version deletes the word probable,but preserves the general rule,applicable in both fraud and theft cases,that the sentencing court should use the loss amount that the defendant intended if that amount exceeds the actual loss and can be determined.see,comment.it also acknowledges that f requently loss in a fraud case will be the same as in a theft case.id.but the amended version recognizes that there might be types of fraud where an analogy to theft would not be appropriate in such cases additional factors are to be considered in determining the loss or intended loss.id.
among such cases are fraudulent loan application and contract procurement cases,which are treated in subsection b of note.the version of note b,applicable here,provides the general rule for loss calculation in fraudulent loan application cases 
in fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases,the loss is the actual loss to the victim or if the loss has not yet come about,the expected loss.for example,if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his assets,the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered,reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered or can expect to recover from any assets pledged to secure the loan.however,where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss,the intended loss is to be used.
comment.b emphasis added.thus,amended note b gives the defendant credit for objective prior to discovery of fraud and assets pledged to secure the might alter a loss calculation if based solely on face amounts of loan applications.
although note b sensibly takes into account differences between theft offenses and fraudulent loan applications,it does not specifically provide a method for determining intended loss in a case like the present one,where a no collateral is involved,and b the defendant is not a borrower but a preparer of fraudulent loan applications who claims to have expected that a number of loans would be denied and at least some portion of the loans granted would be repaid.
in brach,a case governed by the version of section,we upheld the use of the face value of a fraudulently obtained loan as the loss amount,even though the defendant,who was the borrower,had in fact repaid the entire loan,and we assumed that he had intended to repay the loan when he applied for it.see brach,at.consistent with the version of note,we applied the commentary to the guideline for theft offenses,concluding that a defendant intent to repay a fraudulently obtained loan was immaterial to the loss calculation because loss includes the value of all property taken,even though all or part of it was returned.id.based on the text of the version of the note,we also observed that loss in a fraud case may consist of the probable loss resulting from the fraud,id.internal quotation marks omitted,which we equated with the potential loss that the defendant conduct could have caused,see id.
brach was rejected by several courts,notably the third circuit in a thoughtful opinion by the late judge becker.see united states kopp,cir united states moored,cir united states shaw,cir.kopp involved a defendant who had fraudulently procured a million loan that was secured by real property.see id.at.the defendant claimed he had intended to repay,but the loan went into default when the bank sold the property securing the loan,it recovered more than the value of the loan.see id.nevertheless,the district court ruled that the face amount of the loan was the appropriate measure of the loss intended by the defendant,and sentenced him accordingly.see id.at.
judge becker opinion disagreed with brach and sided with a seventh circuit opinion authored by judge posner,see id.at,which had observed that it was simple but irrational to treat all frauds as equivalent to thefts,preferring an approach that took account of whether the defendant actually intended to pocket the face value of the amount he had fraudulently procured,see united states schneider,cir.in addition,based on a careful analysis of the version of section,judge becker rejected an approach that equated the measures of probable or intended loss with the worst case scenario of potential loss here,the face value of the loan.kopp,at see also id.at.finally,judge becker observed that the approach taken by brach was inconsistent with the amendments to note.see id.at.
after kopp,the third circuit has consistently held that i ntended loss refers to the defendant subjective expectation,not to the risk of loss to which he may have exposed his victims.united states yeaman,cir see united states geevers,cir.judge becker opinion in geevers devised a sensible approach for district courts to use in determining the defendant intended loss in cases where the government seeks to equate possible loss with intended loss the district court may presume that the defendant intended the victims to lose the entire face value of the instrument,but the defendant may rebut the presumption by producing evidence to demonstrate that he actually intended to cause a lesser loss.see id.at.
since the commission amended note,we have left open the possibility that a defendant is free at sentencing to present evidence of his intent regarding the issue of loss.in united states ravelo,cir,where the defendant made numerous unsuccessful attempts to get cash advances on credit cards in excess of cash advance limits,we approved use of the aggregate amounts he would have obtained if he had succeeded on each attempt in the absence of evidence of contrary intent.see id.at.ravelo cited geevers as having adopted a similar approach in analogous circumstances.see id.at.
in united states singh,cir,a doctor caused his office to submit to medicare and medicaid insurers bills that were higher than the fixed rates established by the government for the services provided.see id.at.the district court determined intended loss based on the combined total of the face value of the bills.see id.at.the defendant argued that he never intended to receive full reimbursement because he knew the rate schedules were carved in stone.consistent with the geevers approach,singh held that the defendant should have a further opportunity on remand to show,if he can,that the total amount he expected to receive from the insurers was indeed less than the amounts he actually billed.id.at.
we conclude that,after adoption of amended note,the defendant should have an opportunity to persuade the sentencing judge that the loss he intended was less than the face amount of the loans.a defendant who applied for,or caused someone else to apply for,a million loan,fully expecting at least to be repaid,intended a loss of no more than although,if no repayment is made,he would be subject to punishment for an actual loss of million.similarly,a defendant who applied for,or caused others to apply for,ten million loans,expecting at least three to be rejected,intended a loss of no more than million although,if all were accepted and none was repaid,he would be subject to punishment for an actual loss of million.
we will therefore remand to afford judge sand an opportunity to reconsider the intended loss in accordance with this opinion.either on the present record,or after receipt of additional evidence in the judge discretion,the judge should determine the extent,if any,to which confredo has proven a subjective intent to cause a loss of less than the aggregate amount of the loans,in which event the applicable loss calculation should be based only on the intended loss,unless the actual loss is higher.as with all loss calculations,absolute precision is not required.see comment.
ii.the section enhancement 
the version of section which was applied here to enhance confredo offense level by three levels,provided 
if an enhancement under applies,add levels to the offense level for the offense committed while on release as if this section were a specific offense
