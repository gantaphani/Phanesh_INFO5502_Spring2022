opinion of the court 
rcs capital development llc appeals from an order of recognition of an australian insolvency proceeding under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and an order staying actions against the debtor,abc learning centres,and its property in the united states.we must determine whether the australian insolvency proceeding should be recognized as a foreign main proceeding under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and whether the debtor property in the united states is subject to the automatic stay under.
abc learning centres is a australian company that provided child care and educational services in australia,the united states and other countries through its subsidiaries.it conducted business in the united states principally through its subsidiaries,abc developmental learning centres usa abc delaware and the learning care group.in june,rcs capital development llc contracted with abc delaware to develop child care facilities in the united states,and abc guaranteed abc delaware loan obligations.rcs won a million verdict on a breach of contract claim against abc delaware in arizona state court on may.rcs is a defendant to a nevada lawsuit brought by abc learning and abc delaware,seeking million.
in november abc directors entered into voluntary administration in australia,and appointed administrators to determine whether abc could be restructured to address its insolvency,or whether it had to be liquidated entering into voluntary administration breached abc loan agreements with its secured creditors.this breach triggered the secured creditors rights to realize their assets through the receivership process prescribed by australia corporations act.corporations act austl.hereinafter corporations act.the secured creditors exercised that right and appointed a receiver.abc was entirely leveraged,so the value of all its assets was encumbered by its secured creditors charges 
abc directors voted to enter liquidation proceedings on june,and appointed two of the administrators as the liquidators to wind up the company.the receivership continued through the commencement of liquidation proceedings,and operated in tandem with the winding up.abc liquidators granted the receiver permission to manage and operate abc.a liquidator realizes assets for the benefit of all the creditors,investigates charges claimed by the secured creditors,takes an accounting and payment of the value of assets the receiver realized beyond the amount of the debenture,and distributes assets on a pro rata basis among creditors of the same priority.
on may,the petitioned the bankruptcy court of delaware as abc foreign representatives for recognition of the australian insolvency proceedings under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the petition was filed before the arizona verdict was rendered into judgment,and the immediate focus of the stay was abc suit against rcs in nevada state court.the bankruptcy court found the liquidation was a foreign main proceeding that met the recognition requirements and did not manifestly contravene public policy.the bankruptcy court ordered recognition and an automatic stay of actions against abc and abc property within the united states jurisdiction.the bankruptcy court granted rcs motion to lift the stay for the purpose of rendering its arizona verdict to judgment,and applying the judgment against the nevada action.the district court of delaware upheld the bankruptcy court orders,noting that rcs was granted all the relief it initially sought.rcs appeals from the district court order.

congress enacted chapter to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of insolvency with the following objectives 
cooperation between courts of the united states,and the courts and other competent authorities of foreign countries involved in insolvency cases 
greater legal certainty for trade and investment 
fair and efficient administration of crossborder insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors,and other interested entities,including the debtor 
protection and maximization of the value of the debtor assets and 
facilitation of the rescue of financially troubled businesses,thereby protecting investment and preserving employment.
see also uncitral model law on cross border insolvency preamble stating nearly identical purposes.title viii is intended to provide greater legal certainty for trade and investment as well as to provide for the fair and efficient administration of insolvencies,which protects the interests of creditors and other interested parties,including the debtor.in addition,it serves to protect and maximize the value of the debtor assets,at reprinted in.the statute adopts,nearly in its entirety,the model law on cross border insolvency promulgated in by the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral.id.
uncitral developed the model law on transnational insolvency in response to the challenges of multinational bankruptcies where multiple insolvency regimes lacked effective mechanisms for coordination.multiple systems limited the ability of any one bankruptcy regime to protect assets against dissipation,and allowed creditors to skip ahead of their priority by seizing assets in foreign jurisdictions.the uncitral legislative guide explains the model law was designed to address 
inadequate and inharmonious legal approaches,which hamper the rescue of financially troubled businesses,are not conducive to a fair and efficient administration of insolvencies,impede the protection of the assets of the insolvent debtor against dissipation and hinder maximization of the value of those assets.moreover,the absence of predictability in the handling of insolvency cases impedes capital flow and is a disincentive to investment fraud by insolvent debtors,in particular by concealing assets or transferring them to foreign jurisdictions,is an increasing problem,in terms of both its frequency and its magnitude.

the american law institute global principles for cooperation in international insolvency cases elaborates the overriding objective is to enable courts and insolvency administrators to operate effectively and efficiently in international insolvency cases with the goals of maximizing the value of the debtor global assets,preserving where appropriate the debtors business,and furthering the just administration of the proceeding.american law institute,global principles for cooperation in int l insolvency cases t he emphasis must be on ensuring that the insolvency administrator,appointed in that proceeding,is accorded every possible assistance to take control of all assets of the debtor that are located in other jurisdictions.id.at cmt.to global principle.chapter creates an ancillary proceeding in the united states to provide support to the foreign insolvency administrator.jay lawrence westbrook,chapter at last,am.the goal is to direct creditors and assets to the foreign main proceeding for orderly and fair distribution of assets,avoiding the seizure of assets by creditors operating outside the jurisdiction of the foreign main proceeding.
the model law reflects a universalism approach to transnational insolvency.it treats the multinational bankruptcy as a single process in the foreign main proceeding,with other courts assisting in that single proceeding.westbrook,supra,at.in contrast,under a territorialism approach a debtor must initiate insolvency actions in each country where its property is found.id.this approach is the grab rule where each country seizes assets and distributes them according to each country insolvency proceedings.see also andrew guzman,international bankruptcy in defense of universalism.
chapter embraces the universalism approach.the ancillary nature of chapter proceedings emphasizes the united states policy in favor of a general rule that our courts act in aid of the main proceedings,in preference to a system of full bankruptcies in each state where assets are found,at reprinted in.congress rejected the territorialism approach,the system of full bankruptcies,in favor of aiding one main proceeding.id.the purpose is to maximize assistance to the foreign court conducting the main proceeding.in re fairfield sentry,citing in re condor ins,cir.thus,a chapter court in the united states acts as an adjunct or arm of a foreign bankruptcy court where the main proceedings are conducted.id.
chapter supplanted section of the bankruptcy code,which authorized courts to stay actions against companies or property subject to a foreign insolvency proceeding.repealed by.title viii,d.section relief was largely discretionary.see in re treco,cir explaining that section by its terms requires an exercise of judicial discretion.chapter improved predictability by mandating recognition when a foreign proceeding meets section recognition requirements.leif clark,ancillary and other cross border insolvency cases under chapter of the bankruptcy code.before the model law,many countries did not assist insolvency proceedings,even though the united states opened its courts to foreign representatives.in re condor,cir.one of the reasons congress changed so little of the wording in the model law was to endorse it wholesale,and encourage wide adoption by other nations.westbrook,supra,at.mandatory recognition when an insolvency proceeding meets the criteria fosters comity and predictability,and benefits bankruptcy proceedings in the united states that seek to administer property located in foreign countries that have adopted the model law.
chapter also encourages communication and cooperation with foreign courts,and authorizes our courts to communicate directly with foreign courts.foreign representatives can access courts to request enforcement of orders of the foreign proceeding and to stay actions against foreign debtors property in the united states.id.chapter ancillary proceedings bring people and property beyond the foreign main proceeding jurisdiction into the foreign main proceeding through the exercise of the united states jurisdiction.
in australia a company directors may determine the company is insolvent and initiate liquidation proceedings.corporations act.here,abc went into voluntary administration,where the appointed administrators determined whether the company was salvageable.id.in this case,the administrators decided abc should be liquidated,and two of the administrators became the liquidators,responsible for collecting and distributing the company assets to the company creditors.id.ss,australian sec.invest.comm,liquidation a guide for creditors available at.only unsecured creditors are barred from initiating or continuing legal proceedings against the company.corporations act secured creditors have their own proceeding where they may appoint a receiver to realize the secured assets,and distribute the proceeds to satisfy the debts that the property secured.id.

under chapter an order recognizing a foreign proceeding shall be entered if such foreign proceeding for which recognition is sought is a foreign main proceeding and the petition meets the administrative requirements of section.a.f oreign main proceeding means a foreign proceeding pending in the country where the debtor has the center of its main interests.id.
the term foreign proceeding means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign country,including an interim proceeding,under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court,for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation.
id.this definition can be broken down into seven elements i a proceeding ii that is either judicial or administrative iii that is collective in nature iv that is in a foreign country v that is authorized or conducted under a law related to insolvency or the adjustment of debts vi in which the debtor assets and affairs are subject to the control or supervision of a foreign court and vii which proceeding is for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation.
the bankruptcy court in this case thoroughly evaluated these elements and found they were met.rcs does not challenge that abc has met the section administrative requirements,nor that the liquidation is an administrative proceeding in a foreign country for the purpose of liquidation,authorized under a law which relates to insolvency,and is subject to the supervision or control of australian courts.the only other court that has considered australian liquidation found it was a foreign main proceeding.in re betcorp.
the bankruptcy court recognized the liquidation proceeding as the foreign main proceeding.rcs acknowledges that the liquidation is a collective proceeding,because the liquidator must consider the rights of all the creditors in distributing assets,and must distribute assets according to priorities on a pro rata basis.in this case,the practical effect of the receivership leaves little for the liquidator to administer,aside from investigating the charges claimed by the secured creditors.
rcs contends that only the receivership benefits from chapter recognition,so that only the receivership was effectively granted chapter recognition.the receivership is not a collective proceeding,because the receiver only represents the interests of the secured creditors.at oral argument,rcs conceded that an australian liquidation proceeding operating parallel to a receivership could be granted chapter recognition in a case where the secured creditors only have a portion of the assets.oral argument at.nevertheless,rcs asserts the receivership dominates the liquidation proceeding in this case because abc assets are entirely leveraged,leaving nothing for the liquidator to distribute to the unsecured creditors.but that does not affect the collective nature of the australian liquidation proceeding.instead,it turns on the particular facts of abc debts.
chapter makes no exceptions when a debtor assets are fully leveraged.subject to the public policy exception,chapter recognition must be ordered when a court finds the requisite criteria are met replacing the section list of guiding principles we do not find any exception to recognition based on the debtor debt to value ratio at the time of insolvency.moreover,we find such an exception could contravene the stated purposes of chapter and the mandatory language of chapter recognition.
nothing in chapter prevents the court from refusing to take an action governed by this chapter if the action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the united states.rcs contends we should not recognize the liquidation proceeding or uphold the stay,because the receivership would gain all the benefits of the ordered relief,and because it is a proceeding which contravenes our public policy in favor of collective insolvency proceedings.
the public policy exception has been narrowly construed,because the word manifestly in international usage restricts the public policy exception to the most fundamental policies of the united states,at reprinted in u,see also in re ephedra prods.liab,explaining why the exception is a narrow one.the purpose of the expression manifestly,is to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that the exception is only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting state.comm on int l trade law,guide to enactment of the uncitral model law on cross border insolvency,doc.
the public policy exception applies where the procedural fairness of the foreign proceeding is in doubt or can not be cured by the adoption of additional protections or where recognition would impinge severely a constitutional or statutory right.in re qimonda ag.an israeli insolvency proceeding was found to be manifestly contrary to public policy in in re gold honey,because the receivership initiated in israel after chapter proceeding began in the seized the debtor assets,violating the bankruptcy court stay order.this conduct hindered two fundamental policy objectives of the automatic stay preventing one creditor from obtaining an advantage over other creditors,and providing for the efficient and orderly distribution of a debtor assets to all creditors in accordance with their relative priorities.id.at discussing serious ramifications if future creditors followed suit and seized assets under a united states court jurisdiction in violation of its orders.in in re ephedra prods.a canadian insolvency proceeding was challenged under the public policy exception because it did not afford a right to a jury trial.at.despite our constitutional right to a jury,canada lack of a right to a jury trial did not contravene a fundamental policy because the canada proceedings afforded substantive and procedural due process protections,and nothing more is required by or any other law.id.at.
the collective proceeding requirement reflects policy to provide an orderly liquidation procedure under which all creditors are treated equally.in re schimmelpenninck,cir quoting,at ultimately,the interests of all creditors,foreign and domestic,are to be put on a level playing field,with claimants being treated equally.it is undisputed that the australian liquidation proceeding is a collective proceeding.the liquidator must distribute assets on a basis to creditors of the same priority.secured creditors are entitled to recover the full value of their debts by realizing the value of the assets securing those debts and submitting an accounting to the liquidator.
rather than contravene public policy,recognition advances the policies that animate the collective proceeding requirement.rcs seeks to attach assets before the secured creditors can realize them.without chapter recognition,rcs could skip ahead of the priorities of the secured creditors.at oral argument,rcs contended this was fair to the other unsecured creditors,because they too could bring suits in the united states to attach abc assets.oral argument at.rcs approach would eviscerate the orderly liquidation proceeding,and ignores all priority of debts.efficient,orderly and fair distribution are not only the policies behind the collective proceeding requirement,but are some of the chief purpose s of the bankruptcy laws,at,reprinted in,katchen landy,d.without bankruptcy proceedings,creditors would race to the courthouse to collect from a troubled entity,depleting assets and enabling some creditors to collect fully on the debts and others not at all,and with no regard for priority.accordingly,it would contravene our policy to provide an orderly liquidation procedure under which all creditors are treated equally if rcs could evade collecting its debt through the australian liquidation proceeding.
moreover,we are unconvinced the australian insolvency proceeding conflicts with our own rules.the united states bankruptcy code prioritizes secured creditors,as does australia corporations act.collier on bankruptcy ed.several courts have refused to turn over assets under section to foreign insolvency proceedings that did not prioritize secured creditors.in re treco,cir refusing to turn over assets to a bahamian liquidation proceeding because it prioritized administrative expenses over secured creditors,and summarizing other cases denying turnover because the foreign proceeding failed to sufficiently protect prioritized secured interests.the sole difference here is that australian law allows secured creditors to realize the full value of their debts,and tender the excess to the company,whereas secured creditors in the united states must generally turn over assets and seek distribution from the bankruptcy estate.
the dutch bankruptcy system also exempts secured creditors from surrendering their interests to the liquidation process.in re schimmelpenninck,at.the court of appeals for the fifth circuit reviewed the dutch proceedings under the precursor to chapter,section.id.at.to enjoin actions against a foreign debtor property,section required the estate to be distributed in manner substantially similar to chapter preferences.id.at.the fifth circuit found the dutch proceeding distributed assets in a manner substantially in accordance with title even though it allowed a secured creditor who holds either a mortgage or a pledge encumbering that asset to exercise his rights irrespective of the authority of the curator.id.dutch bankruptcy law clearly is not repugnant to title.the court further found if the unsecured creditor was permitted to bring suit he would unjustly gain a preference,and the remaining creditors would suffer a concomitant disadvantage which would oppugn the very equitable foundation on which bankruptcy is built.id.at.
australia corporations act prioritizes secured creditors with a mechanism similar to the dutch bankruptcy regime,both allowing independent enforcement of secured interests outside the insolvency proceeding.despite the different method chosen to create the priority,the fifth circuit found the dutch proceeding was not repugnant to laws and policies.id.at finding sufficient congruity between dutch and american bankruptcy laws to eschew such repugnance.the australian legislators selected a different method to prioritize secured creditors.rather than manifestly contravene our policy,australian law established a different way to achieve similar goals.recognition of the australian liquidation proceeding does not manifestly contravene public policy.on the contrary,allowing rcs to use courts to circumvent the australian liquidation proceedings would undermine the core bankruptcy policies of ordered proceedings and equal treatment.
upon recognition of the foreign main proceeding,the automatic stay under section applies to multinational bankruptcies with respect to the debtor and the property of the debtor that is within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.a.section provides for an automatic stay of actions against the debtor or against property of the estate.a rcs seeks to enforce its state court verdict against abc property located in the united states.rcs contends the secured creditors,not abc,effectively own the property because the property is entirely leveraged,and the rece
