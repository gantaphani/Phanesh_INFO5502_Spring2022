defendants kurt johnson and dale scott heineman were indicted for conspiracy and multiple counts of mail fraud related to their illegitimate business.they were adamant in their desire to represent themselves and assert an absurd legal theory wrapped up in uniform commercial code gibberish.both defendants were examined by a psychiatrist and found to have no diagnosable mental disorder.thereafter,the district court conducted hearings spanning several days in which the defendants were extensively advised of their right to counsel and the disadvantages of.the judge practically begged them to accept counsel but they refused.the district court found that the defendants were competent to represent themselves and that such was their constitutional right.defendants now contend that indiana edwards,decided by the supreme court after their trial concluded,required the district court to terminate their because of what they describe as their nonsensical legal antics after the trial began.they say they may have been competent to stand trial but not to represent themselves.
the record clearly shows that the defendants are fools,but that is not the same as being incompetent.under both faretta and edwards,they had the right to represent themselves and go down in flames if they wished,a right the district court was required to respect.there was no legal or medical basis to foist a lawyer on them against their will.we also hold today that there was no basis for the recusal of the district judge nor error in any of the jury instructions.
background 
in,kurt johnson and dale scott heineman started a program.the premise of their program was that banks had an unfair advantage over borrowers the program purportedly provided a mechanism for borrowers to eliminate their mortgage debt.the program was entitled the dorean process and consisted of several steps.homeowners first transferred their interest in their properties to a trust,naming the defendants as trustees.the defendants then sent demand notices to the lenders questioning the validity of their lending practices.when banks failed to respond or prove that their lending practices were valid,the defendants recorded bogus documents with county clerks offices ostensibly establishing that the homes were no longer subject to a mortgage.the homeowners then refinanced with a different bank using their supposedly unencumbered homes as collateral.in addition to up front fees,heineman and johnson also took as a fee a significant portion of the proceeds of the new loans the homeowners thus obtained.by their own admission,the defendants made over three million dollars in this scheme.
because the homeowners stopped making their mortgage payments,the initial lenders started sending notices of default and eventually foreclosure notices.in response,johnson and heineman sued the banks that were initiating foreclosures.johnson and heineman filed fifteen such lawsuits against different,all in the northern district of california.judge alsup dismissed the defendants first case under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see frances kenny family trust world sav.bank fsb,no.c,wl,at.cal.judge alsup also entered an order for johnson and heineman lawyer to show cause why he should not be sanctioned for filing multiple frivolous cases.the lawyer filed a response and also filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and a declaration under seal in support of his motion.he explained in his sealed declaration that some of johnson and heineman statements to customers were false.he expressed concern that he had been employed in an effort to supply credibility to the possibly illegitimate dorean process.judge alsup sanctioned the attorney and referred the matter to the united states attorney office.
johnson and heineman were indicted on september,and the case was assigned to judge alsup because it related to the defendants prior civil case.the defendants filed a writ of mandamus and prohibition in which they moved to recuse judge alsup.the motion was referred to judge susan illston.judge illston found that the rulings made by judge alsup during the prior civil proceedings regarding the defendants debt elimination scheme were,in effect,all in a day work,nothing out of the ordinary,contained nothing uncalled for,and did not evince a design to hurt the defendants.she also found that judge alsup referral of the matter to the attorney office only demonstrated his belief that the law may have been broken,not that he harbored a and unequivocal antagonism that would render fair judgment impossible.the recusal motion was thus denied.judge alsup then held a series of faretta hearings in which he patiently and thoroughly addressed the issue of with the defendants.at the first hearing,judge alsup addressed defendant johnson first 
the court now,johnson,you entitled to a lawyer and if you ca afford one we will appoint one at no expense to you.do you understand that 
johnson i understand your offer,yes.
the court and do you want a lawyer 
johnson absolutely not.
judge alsup then explained the significance of the right to counsel 
you entitled to a lawyer here to help you get through this and to help you identify all the issues and to make the best arguments possible on your behalf,that important and it a right you have under the constitution.you do want to give that up without thinking very hard about it 
my job is to try my best get you a fair trial and a fair procedure and right off the bat we need to get you a lawyer and you should have a lawyer.
you do have a right to represent yourself if you really want to,but a part of my job is to help you understand why you should not do that and you should have a lawyer,but if at the end of all that you insist on it you can represent yourself if you want to.
the defendants requested a continuance to allow them to research whether they should accept outside representation and the court granted the continuance.
at the defendants next hearing the court had an assistant federal public defender present to demonstrate to the defendants that they could in fact have counsel appointed for them.the court explained the advantages of having a lawyer and the disadvantages of not having one 
if you do have a lawyer then you have to conduct the case yourself.by that,i mean,you have to make your motions,do legal research,respond to motions made by the government and to come in and argue them.and it conceivable someone who not a lawyer can do an okay job at that,but it very unlikely because it helps to have the experience of being a lawyer 
so you must abide by the same rules of the court as the lawyers do.and if you make mistakes,i ca give you special privileges or benefits,and the judge ca help you.the government is represented by a trained,skilled prosecutor experienced in criminal law in the court procedures and the procedures you face in this case.
judge alsup again asked the defendants if they wanted a lawyer 
the court now,do you want to give up your right to have a lawyer represent you in this case 
heineman sir,i not looking to be represented by anybody.
the court then asked heineman if he would like to consult with the assistant public defender regarding representation 
the court before you make it clear to me you understand in making that you want to talk to cohen back there from the public defender office 
heineman i do have anything to say to him at this time.
the court then addressed johnson who requested another continuance so that he could look into whether he would have access to a law library prior to deciding whether he wanted counsel appointed.the court granted the request and continued the hearing.
because the defendants were considering representing themselves and because they had made some strange comments in court,the district judge ordered that the defendants undergo mental examinations.james missett,evaluated the defendants separately at the federal corrections institute in dublin,california.both defendants were less than cooperative during their evaluations,but missett engaged them for approximately one hour each and filed written reports in which he opined that neither defendant was suffering from any mental disorder.the court held a competency hearing at which missett testified in person.the court found the defendants competent to represent themselves based on missett reports and testimony and based on the court own observations.
the court held one final faretta hearing,advising the defendants once again of the implications of proceeding without an attorney 
the court i want to now turn to the two paths that you can go down here.one path is you have a lawyer at no expense to you.we will appoint a lawyer.each of you will have a separate lawyer,a lawyer who will be yours not representing the public defender or whatever it would be,representing you and your interest in the case.that would be effective immediately and going all the way through the end of trial.that one road we can go down.
another road we can go down is you say,no,i do want a lawyer and that you want to appear in court and conduct your own defense.you have the right under the constitution to do that,but i need to make sure that you exercise that right,that you understand you have the right to the lawyer and,also,what some of the advantages and disadvantages are for each of these courses 
that lawyer would help conduct the investigation.that lawyer would review the discovery that been provided to you,but,also,would follow up on leads.that lawyer would make possible motions to compel further information from the government.the lawyer would have an investigator working with him to go out and ask questions,dig up evidence,try to poke holes in the government case,and do investigations into some of the witnesses the government may want to bring at trial so that the by the lawyer would be the best possible examinations 
all right.i want to give you another opportunity.i am suggesting very strongly to you that you both should have a lawyer to make out the case here in court in your defense and to poke holes in the government case and to make motions and so forth.it can only help you and it ca hurt you and i suggest that you should do that.will you let me appoint a lawyer 
johnson like i say,your honor,if you want to appoint one for the defendant,you are more than welcome to i do not want one.
the court heineman 
heineman that is correct,i do not want one.appoint one sic the defendant.
despite the defendants refusal to accept appointed counsel,the district judge did appoint advisory counsel to assist the defendants solely on issues of procedure and courtroom protocol.
on the first day of trial,the court yet again asked the defendants to consider appointment of counsel despite the additional delay that would result again,both defendants refused.after a jury trial,the defendants were convicted of one count each of conspiracy and counts each of mail fraud,in violation of.
johnson and heineman argue that the district court should not have permitted them to represent themselves.first,they argue under faretta california,and illinois allen,that their should have been terminated because their own courtroom behavior rendered their trial unfair.second,they argue that under indiana edwards,regardless of whether their behavior required termination under faretta,they were in fact not competent to continue representing themselves.as evidence in support of these two similar,but distinct,claims that the district court should have forced counsel upon them,they cite their reluctance to provide the court with their names or dates of birth,their campaign of filing meaningless and nonsensical documents,their insistence on wearing their prison garb in front of the jury,and their comments such as johnson statement in his opening that he wanted the jury to enter a guilty plea for us,which he subsequently apologized for,explaining that he was trying to make a very quick remedy to this procedurally.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
a defendant right to is clearly established.faretta,at.but before electing to represent himself a defendant must be advised of his right to counsel and the dangers and disadvantages of.id.at.further,a defendant waiver of the right to counsel must be knowing and voluntary.id.if a defendant persists in his choice to represent himself,that choice must be honored even if it is to his own detriment.id.at.here,there is no question but that the court more than adequately ensured that faretta was satisfied.it is hard to imagine what else the court could or should have said to have explained the hazards of.
nonetheless,the right to is not absolute the constitutional guarantee to a fair trial permits the trial judge to terminate by a defendant who deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct.id.at citing allen,at.it is an open question what standard of review this court should apply to a district court decision to permit an obstreperous defendant to represent himself under faretta when there is a risk the trial will violate due process,but we need not decide the applicable standard here because these defendants claims fail under any of the possible standards of review.it is clear that johnson and heineman did not engage in such serious obstructionist conduct that the fairness of their trial was jeopardized,requiring the district court to terminate their.defendants argue that termination of is required when defendants engage in serious misconduct,are unwilling to abide by courtroom protocol,or are extremely disruptive and defiant.but the behavior of the defendants during the trial in this case,while occasionally wacky,was not disruptive or defiant.the defendants filed numerous nonsensical pleadings,were uncooperative at times,and chose to wear their prison garb during trial,but they did not exhibit a blatant disregard for courtroom rules or protocol and did not make it impossible for the court to administer fair proceedings.in fact,they made opening statements,closing arguments,witnesses,argued jury instructions,and testified on their own behalf.they did not disrupt the proceedings or have to be gagged,shackled,or removed from the courtroom.see united states mack,cir holding should have been terminated where defendant behavior led to the trial court exclusion of the defendant from the courtroom and the denial of the defendant right to call witnesses and conduct closing argument.the defendants courtroom behavior,although eccentric at times,would not have justified,let alone required,the involuntary deprivation of their constitutional right to represent themselves.
defendants next argue that they were not competent to represent themselves,faretta notwithstanding,under the supreme court decision in indiana edwards.until recently,if a defendant was determined to be competent to stand trial he was also deemed competent to represent himself.godinez moran.the supreme court clarified in edwards,however,that a trial court may insist on representation for a defendant who is competent to stand trial but who is suffering from severe mental illness to the point where he is not competent to perform the more arduous task of representing himself.edwards,at.at.the court concluded that the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial permits a district court to override a faretta request for defendants whose mental disorder prevented them from presenting any meaningful defense.id.
as an initial matter,we have not yet articulated the applicable standard of review to be applied to edwards challenges.see united states thompson,cir assuming abuse of discretion united states ferguson,cir.because edwards holds that the constitution permits interfering with a faretta request for gray area defendants,it suggests an abuse of discretion standard.see united states berry,f d,cir united states deshazer,cir.however,that does not directly affect the question raised by the defendant here,which is when,if ever,the constitution requires a court to impose counsel on a gray area defendant despite a voluntary and knowing waiver.given the nature of the distinction between that which is constitutionally required and that which is merely constitutionally permitted,see edwards,at,ct at noting relevance of that distinction,the standard of review to be applied to edwards challenges in which a faretta request was gra
