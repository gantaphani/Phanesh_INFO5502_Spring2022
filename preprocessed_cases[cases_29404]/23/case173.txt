piper moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of pla liability as a debt collector under the fdcpa.the plaintiffs argued that the delinquent water and sewer bills qualified as debt under the fdcpa,and,therefore,pla attempts to collect those debts are governed by the requirements of the fdcpa.pla argued that its decision to execute on the municipal lien rather than proceed in personam against the individuals removed its collection efforts from the purview of the fdcpa.the district court granted piper motion by order dated july,but certified for interlocutory appeal the issue of whether the fdcpa applies to defendants practice.app.at.we granted petitions for permission to appeal
