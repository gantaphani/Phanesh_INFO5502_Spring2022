patricia appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the united states and its corresponding denial of for summary judgment.acting on behalf of the department of health and human services hhs,the government brought the action against to collect the amount of health education assistance loan health education loan indebtedness that had incurred while she was a student at tufts university school of dentistry tufts.after considering the parties for summary judgment and supplemental briefing as to the amount of indebtedness,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment in the amount of plus interest accrued from august.we affirm.
patterned after the united states guaranteed student loan student loan program,the health education loan program was enacted to meet the needs of health profession students who had to borrow substantially more than the borrowing limit under the student loan program.health education loans were made available to students in certain health profession schools.administered by the public health services of hhs,the health education loan program employs a structure private lenders make the loans,the schools administer their application and disbursement and hhs guarantees the loans.lenders often sell their health education loans to the student loan marketing association sallie mae,a secondary loan market established by statute.
after the borrower graduation or departure from school,the lender establishes a repayment schedule that begins the first day of the tenth month after the borrower ceases to be a student at a health education loan school and allows the borrower up to years to repay the loan.after the repayment period begins the borrower may request a forbearance,which provides an extension of time for making loan payments to avoid the borrower default on his or her payments.
in the event of the borrower default,death,total and permanent disability or bankruptcy,hhs will pay off the lender loss in principal and interest if the lender has complied with the terms of the health education loan insurance contract,the statute and the regulations.hhs is then assigned the borrower notes.
while was a student at tufts,she applied for and obtained six health education loans,and tufts approved all the requests.signed promissory notes for the health education loans,and bay bank norfolk trust company bay bank approved for all six loans on september,on december,on august,on august,on january,and on october.
sallie mae later purchased health education loans from bay bank.following five periods of forbearance from april,to may,sallie mae provided with repayment schedules on or about june,and notified her that payments were to begin on july.filed for chapter bankruptcy on july,and on september,she filed an adversary proceeding to seek an undue hardship discharge of the health assistance loans.although she was discharged from bankruptcy on october,her health education loan debt was not discharged.
as a result of the adversary proceeding,sallie mae filed an insurance claim with hhs on september.about a week later hhs paid the claim in the amount of and received an assignment of promissory notes.on september,hhs sent a letter telling her that the promissory notes for her health education loans had been assigned to the government.
hhs informed about march,that her health education loan debt had been referred to payco american corporation for collection and that her account would be referred to the united states department of justice doj if she failed to either remit payment in full or enter into a repayment agreement.did not comply.
then hhs wrote a march,letter stating that it intended to refer her health education loan debt to other federal agencies for the purpose of administrative offset under the debt collection improvement act of.was advised that a written response and repayment agreement or payment in full within days from the date of the letter would terminate administrative offset action.again did not respond.
six years passed without full compliance by as indicated later,she made some payments on account during that period.then in an april,letter hhs notified her that she had days to resolve her delinquent debt.she was further advised that if she was unwilling to establish a repayment agreement,her case would be referred immediately to the office of the inspector general for exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs.hhs also told that her debt would be transferred to the doj for enforced collection if she did not enter into a repayment agreement.once more did not respond.
hhs thereafter warned letters dated july,april,september,and january,if she did not enter into a repayment agreement her debt would be referred to the doj.still remained unresponsive.hhs finally referred health education loan debt to the doj for enforced collection on may.
had made payments totaling to sallie mae on her health education loans from september,to april.sallie mae refunded to account on april.although not pursuant to any repayment agreement,also made payments totaling on the loans from october,to november.thus the total amount paid on account by over the years came to.according to the government,as of august,outstanding debt on her health education loans totaled.
on august,the government filed an action in the northern district of ohio on behalf of hhs to recover the asserted amount of health education loan indebtedness.as stated earlier,both the government and then filed motions for summary judgment.on october,the district court granted the government motion as to the existence of indebtedness but denied summary judgment to the government as to the amount of that indebtedness.
just a few weeks november,district court held a telephonic conference during which it vacated its partial order denying summary judgment as to the amount of indebtedness and allowed to file a supplemental motion on that issue.after permitting the government to file a response,the district court then reconsidered the government motion for summary judgment on the issue of the amount of indebtedness,and on november,it granted the government motion.timely filed her notice of appeal from the district court orders and judgment on december.
we review the district court order granting summary judgment de novo sigler american honda motor,cir.in reviewing a grant of summary judgment on seeking such relief,we apply the same legal standards as the district court whether,with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact,so that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law relford urban county gov t,cir.
to recover on a promissory note the government must first make a prima facie showing that the defendant signed it,the government is the present owner or holder and the note is in default united states macdonald,wl,at cir.may,per curiam united states lawrence,cir.for that purpose the government may introduce evidence of the note and a sworn transcript of the account or certificate of indebtedness united states davis,cir.once such a prima facie case is established,defendant has the burden of proving the nonexistence,extinguishment or variance in payment of the obligation id.
first,argues that the government can not establish a prima facie case of indebtedness because it has not established that she signed the promissory notes at issue.although she acknowledges that the government gave her copies of the alleged notes,contends that she does not recognize the copies with her alleged signature on them.according to,without presenting the original notes the government has not produced any admissible evidence that signed the notes on which the government seeks to recover.
at the outset,argument is wholly disingenuous.in its opinion denying motion for hardship discharge in her bankruptcy proceedings,the bankruptcy court noted that testified that she did review the loan documents before signing them and understood that the documents represented loans that she would have to repay kline educ.loan serv.in re kline,case,slip op.at.in light of those admissions,amnesia regarding her health education loan debt can scarcely be credited as establishing a genuine issue of material fact.
but even aside from that,argument fails on its own merits.united states williams,wl.may,the only case on which seeks to rely,is not at all comparable to this case quite apart from the fact that,as a district court opinion,it is.in williams the government sought to collect an alleged student loan debt from defendant based on promissory notes that defendant claimed he had never signed.williams found that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the notes were in fact signed by defendant,so that the court denied the government motion for summary judgment id.at.on that score the defendant there presented evidence that the social security number and middle initial of the kenneth williams on the alleged notes were different from his own id.considering that evidence in the light most favorable to defendant,williams concluded that an ambiguity existed regarding the identity of the kenneth williams on the promissory note id.at.
nothing of the sort is presented here.no evidence even suggests that is not the patricia petroff who signed the promissory notes introduced by the government.indeed,admits that she attended tufts as did the patricia petroff who signed the promissory notes.all that she advances is an amorphous disclaimer that she does not recognize the notes containing that signature,insisting that the government must therefore produce the original promissory notes.but it is well established that p hotocopies are allowed into evidence as if they were originals buziashvili inman,cir,invoking.rule.thus the district court properly concluded that the government established,as a matter of law,the first element of its prima facie case.
next contests the third element of the government prima facie case,arguing that the declaration offered by the government to establish the fact and amount of her indebtedness is unauthenticated and is inadmissible hearsay under rule.but an analysis of the applicable evidentiary rules confirms the bogus nature of that contention as well.
in support of its summary judgment motion the government presented a declaration declaration by barry blum blum,the chief of the referral control section of the debt management branch of hhs.contends that because blum lacks personal knowledge about the loan documents,default,amount of payments and calculation of matters generated by bay bank and sallie the declaration does not qualify as a business record under rule 
a memorandum,report,record,or data compilation,in any form,of acts,events,conditions,opinions,or diagnoses,made at or near the time by,or from information transmitted by,a person with knowledge,if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity,and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum,report,record or data compilation,all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness,or by certification that complies with rule,rule,or a statute permitting certification,unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.the term business as used in this paragraph includes business,institution,association,profession,occupation,and calling of every kind,whether or not conducted for profit.
in that respect this case is parallel to lawrence,at,where the debtor also challenged the district court grant of summary judgment to the united states in its action to enforce promissory notes.with its motion the united states had submitted copies of the notes,certificates of indebtedness,computerized loan records and an affidavit from a government loan analyst authenticating the loan records.debtor lawrence asserted id.at that the certificates of indebtedness were not competent evidence because they were not based on personal knowledge and did not affirmatively show that the affiant was competent as required by rule e and that the statements of lawrence indebtedness constituted conclusory hearsay statements.
those contentions were flatly rejected on the ground that any claimed defects in the certificates were cured by the affidavit of the loan analyst that she is familiar with how the department of education maintains records related to students,that she was in custody and control of lawrence student loan records,that these records are kept in the course of doe regularly conducted student loan business and that the promissory notes were true copies of the original documents id.lawrence,id.at concluded that the affidavit satisfies the requirements of both rule e and the business records exception to the hearsay rule,so that the district court had properly granted summary judgment to the united states on that basis.
here too the government filed the declaration in addition to a certificate of indebtedness.as the district court noted,the declaration was similar to the affidavit that the lawrence court found satisfied the requirements of rule and.e 
blum declaration sets forth that,as chief of the referral control section rcs,he is authorized to examine the records and claims of the hhs and to execute a declaration of facts based on these examinations that all documents attached hereto and referenced above are true and correct copies of official records maintained by hhs that these files are kept in the ordinary course of hhs regularly conducted activities and are made at or near the time by,or from,information transmitted by a person with knowledge and that hhs took assignment of the loans from sallie mae,and sallie mae took assignment of the loans from bay bank.
indeed,to qualify under the business records exception to the hearsay rule a witness need only have knowledge of the procedures under which the records were created,not knowledge of the actual entries in the records united states wables,cir.
also contends that the declaration is inadmissible because it was not properly authenticated.but that is wholly at odds with the provision of rule,which the declaration tracks directly.hence the declaration was clearly admissible and was properly considered by the district court as part of the government prima facie case.
in sum,the government established each of the three elements essential to a prima facie case as to indebtedness as a matter of law.we turn then to effort to escape the vise of that indebtedness.
first argues that purported judicial admissions by the government bar any recovery as a matter of law.on may,issued her initial discovery requests asking that the government admit paragraphs in her amended answer that would have relieved her of liability for her alleged indebtedness.it was on june,that the government filed its responses.because that was days after the requests were days beyond the day timetable prescribed by.a maintains that the requested admissions must be deemed to have been admitted and that the district court erred by granting the government leave to withdraw those admissions without any formal motion.
it must be said at the outset that has a skewed perception of,which is essentially intended to facilitate proof at trials by obviating the need to adduce testimony or documents as to matters that are really not in controversy.thus.a a permits requests for admissions as to facts,the application of law to fact,or opinions about either.as summarized in moore federal practice at ed footnotes omitted 
requests for admission may relate to the application of law to fact.such requests should not be confused with pure requests for opinions of law,which are not contemplated by the rule.nor are requests seeking legal conclusions appropriate when proceeding under rule.
to the same effect,see charles wright,arthur miller and richard marcus,federal practice and procedure,at ed and cases cited there,especially cases in the pocket part.
yet,for example,sought to have the government admit such statements as plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,plaintiff claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations laches and defendant does not owe money to plaintiff.plainly the first of those requests
