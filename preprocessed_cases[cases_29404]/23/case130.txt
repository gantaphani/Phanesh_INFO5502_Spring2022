opinion of the court 
under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,a debt collector is liable to a consumer for contacting third parties in pursuit of that consumer debt unless the communication falls under a statutory exception.one of those exceptions covers communication with a third party for the purpose of acquiring location information about the consumer but,even then,prohibits more than one such contact unless the debt collector reasonably believes that the earlier response of such person is erroneous or incomplete and that such person now has correct or complete location information.in this appeal following a jury verdict and judgment entered against a debt collector for repeated contact with third parties,we consider a matter of first impression among the courts of appeals whether the burden in such a case is on the debt collector to prove or the consumer to disprove that the challenged communications fit within exception for acquisition of location information.we conclude that the debt collector bears that burden and will therefore affirm.
facts and procedural history 
in,patricia evankavitch executed a mortgage against her property so that she could,in turn,lend money to her son,christopher in order for evankavitch to repay the loan,christopher regularly deposited checks into her bank account,and she then paid the mortgage company.eventually,however,christopher had financial difficulties and stopped depositing his checks.as a result,evankavitch fell behind on her loan payments.in may,with evankavitch four months behind,the mortgagee rights were assigned to green tree servicing,llc green tree 
green tree and evankavitch had periodic conversations about the loan over the next several months.evankavitch initiated one of those discussions by calling green tree from a cell phone belonging to her daughter,cheryl,which apparently led green tree to record cheryl number as an additional number where it could reach evankavitch.thus,towards the end of,green tree made numerous unsuccessful calls to evankavitch at both evankavitch and cheryl numbers.
in january,green tree reached cheryl on her cell phone.cheryl said that she would ask her mother to call green tree.a month later,evankavitch called green tree again from cheryl cell phone.this time,she informed green tree that the number was her daughter and instructed green tree to stop using it.instead,over the next several months,representatives from green tree continued to call both evankavitch and cheryl numbers and left several messages on cheryl voicemail requesting that evankavitch call green tree.
in august,after failing to reach evankavitch,green tree began calling evankavitch neighbors,robert and sally heim.after a green tree employee asked heim to have evankavitch call green tree,heim passed green tree contact information on to evankavitch after two more months without hearing from evankavitch,green tree made at least three more calls to the heims,leaving two messages and speaking with heim once more.heim told green tree in that final call that christopher had moved to california and that green tree should stop calling the heims.after learning of these communications,evankavitch brought suit,claiming,among other things,that green tree impermissibly contacted heim in its debt collection efforts,in violation of of the fdcpa.
a.the district court challenged rulings 
with limited exceptions,the fdcpa forbids a debt collector from contacting third parties in its attempts to collect a consumer debt,b,and makes the debt collector liable in an individual action for statutory damages up to,over and above any actual damages,id.at a.in both an in limine ruling and in its jury charge,the district court took the position that when a debt collector alleges that it made a contact that falls within the exception for acquisition of location information,the debt collector has the burden to prove the exception as an affirmative defense.specifically,the district court advised the jury that evankavitch and green tree agree that the fair debt collection practices act is violated in the sense that they agree that the defendant contacted third parties and did so multiple times,which is generally a violation of the act.app.it went on to state that the burden is on the defendant to determine and establish that it sought location information.app.thus,the district court instructed 
t he issues for you to decide are one,whether the defendant has established that it contacted the third parties to obtain location information and two,whether the defendant contacted the third party multiple times because the defendant reasonably believed that the earlier response of the third party is incorrect or incomplete,and that the third party now has the correct or the complete location information.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of evankavitch.the district court entered judgment in her favor for,and this appeal ensued.green tree argues on appeal that both the in limine ruling and the jury instructions were improper,such that the verdict should be vacated and this matter with the burden of proof on evankavitch to disprove that any exception applied.

iii.discussion 
a.the fdcpa and its general prohibitions on third party contacts 
the fdcpa was enacted in in response to the abundant evidence of the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors.lesher law offices of mitchell kay,pc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the purpose of the act is both to eliminate abusive debt collection practices and to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged.id.quoting e.as remedial legislation,the act is construed broadly to effectuate those purposes.caprio healthcare revenue recovery,llc,cir.
t he invasion of privacy,we recently explained,is a core concern animating the fdcpa.douglass convergent outsourcing,cir accord a stating that unfair debt collection practices lead to,among other things,invasions of individual privacy.one way congress addressed this concern was to prohibit a debt collector from communicating with third parties about the consumer debt.edwards niagara credit solutions,cir citing b.legislative history indicates this prohibition was considered an extremely important protection,at,reprinted in.
in recognition of a debt collector legitimate need to seek the whereabouts of missing debtors,id.at,however,the act provides an exception to this general prohibition for communications made for the purpose of acquiring location information about the consumer.in other words,a debt collector may contact third parties to ascertain where it may locate the consumer.that exception is itself limited,however,as debt collectors may not communicate with any such person more than once unless the debt collector reasonably believes that the earlier response of such person is erroneous or incomplete and that such person now has correct or complete location information.id.at.
none of our sister circuits has yet addressed the question whether the consumer has the burden of disproving this exception as part of its,or whether the debt collector carries the burden of proving the exception as an affirmative defense,and the district courts have taken divergent approaches it is to this question we now turn.
determining burdens of proof 
we generally start our analysis with the plain text of a statute.but where,as here,that text is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion,we begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast.this,rule stems from the understanding that t he burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have been and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure of proof or persuasion.mccormick on evid.ed.
green tree essentially asks that we end our inquiry at this point and treat the default rule as an absolute one.we decline,for when both a statute and its legislative history are silent on the question of the burden of proof,i t is common ground that no single principle or rule solves all cases by setting forth a general test.schaffer,at stevens,concurring citing alaska dep t of envtl.conservation,
beyond the ordinary default rule that a plaintiff bears the burden of proving her claims,we glean from decisions of the supreme court,this court,and other courts of appeals a number of factors relevant to our analysis here,including whether the defense is framed as an exception to a statute general prohibition or an element of a prima facie case whether the statute general structure and scheme indicate where the burden should fall whether a plaintiff will be unfairly surprised by the assertion of a defense whether a party is in particular control of information necessary to prove or disprove the defense and other policy or fairness considerations.we address each factor below.
statutory exceptions 
the supreme court has instructed that while the default rule applies to most disputes about burdens,schaffer,at,another general rule of statutory construction provides that the burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits,ftc morton salt,see also meacham knolls atomic power lab,repeating the familiar principle that w hen a proviso carves an exception out of the body of a statute or contract those who set up such exception must prove it quoting javierre cent.altagracia,united states taylor,cir compiling numerous supreme court decisions for the proposition that where the statute contains an exception,the defendant bears the burden of proving it.this longstanding convention is part of the backdrop against which the congress writes laws,and we respect it unless we have compelling reasons to think that congress meant to put the burden of persuasion on the other side.meacham,at.
here,b states that e xcept as provided in section a debt collector may not communicate,in connection with the collection of any debt,with third parties.b.thus,the fdcpa generally prohibits a debt collector from contacting third parties,with the debt collector ability to seek location information framed as an exception to this general prohibition.repeat contacts made pursuant to that exception are even further limited,with telltale language likewise indicative of an affirmative defense 
any debt collector communicating with any person other than the consumer for the purpose of acquiring location information about the consumer shall not communicate with any such person more than once unless requested to do so by such person or unless the debt collector reasonably believes that the earlier response of such person is erroneous or incomplete and that such person now has correct or complete location information.
emphasis added see united states franchi forlando,cir breyer,stating that introducing provisions with the words unless and except may indicate an affirmative defense.
moreover,in assessing which party has the burden of proof under this rule,courts often focus on the relationship between the defense in question and the plaintiff primary case,and on whether a defense raises factual or legal issues other than those put in play by the plaintiff cause of action.in re sterten,cir.put differently,as we recently held in the criminal context,w hether a particular statutory phrase constitutes a defense or an element of the offense turns on whether the statutory definition is such that the crime may not be properly described without reference to the exception.taylor,at internal quotation marks omitted.if that is the case,the exception is an element of the crime if not,the exception is an affirmative defense.id.
in the case of the fdcpa,no reference to the act exceptions is necessary to discern that calls to third parties in pursuit of collecting a consumer debt are prohibited.instead,what constitutes a violation is apparent from the plain language of b.thus,we find no compelling reason to reverse the longstanding convention that a party seeking shelter in an exception here,the debt collector has the burden to prove it.meacham,at.
the statutory scheme 
the structure of the statute,another useful indicator of congressional intent,also leads us to place the burden of proof on the debt collector.see united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest,a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,analyzing statutory language in a way that is in accord with the language and structure of the section of law at issue.
we find persuasive in this regard that the language and interaction of the general prohibition in b and its exception for location information in closely track the language and interaction of,which imposes civil liability for fdcpa violations,and its two exceptions,which are widely recognized as affirmative defenses.see jerman carlisle,mcnellie,rini,kramer ulrich lpa,citing c and e for the proposition that t he act contains two exceptions to provisions imposing liability on debt collectors.the first of these is the good faith error defense,which explicitly places the burden on the debt collector to prove that it acted unintentionally and had procedures in place to avoid such an error.c the second provides a safe harbor for a debt collector that seeks and receives legal opinions from the consumer financial protection bureau before they proceed.e although this second exception lacks the explicit language of the first,both are delineated as affirmative defenses by a general statement that a debt collector shall be held liable e xcept as otherwise provided by this section,with the particular affirmative defenses described in separate subsections.a,c,e.
the exception at issue in this case qualifies b general prohibition against contacts in almost identical terms,providing that contacts are forbidden e xcept as provided in section,and setting off the description of the exception in that separate section.such placement of the exception and the general prohibition in different parts of the statute has been recognized by the supreme court as indicative of an affirmative defense.see meacham,at,concluding that an exception for employer conduct otherwise prohibited by the age discrimination in employment act constituted an affirmative defense based in part on how the statute reads,with exemptions laid out apart from the prohibitions.thus,the statutory structure and the parallels between the language of b,with its exception for in,and a,with its affirmative defenses in c and e,strongly indicate that also was intended to be an affirmative defense.see kirtsaeng john wiley sons,w e normally presume that words carry the same meaning when they appear in different but related sections.gwaltney,at interpreting statute in accord with its general language and structure.
green tree attempts to differentiate on the ground that its exceptions require a showing of subjective intent or good faith and thus are appropriately deemed affirmative defenses because the proof is in the possession of the debt collector.in contrast,green tree argues,one of subsections,the provision that allows for calls to obtain location information if the debt collector reasonably believes the third party did not originally provide and now has complete or accurate information,imports an objective test into,such that the exception can and should be disproven by the plaintiff green tree argument proves too much,however,for the sine qua non of any communication that qualifies under,whether initial or follow up,is that the communication was for the purpose of acquiring location question of subjective intent that is appropriate,even by g
