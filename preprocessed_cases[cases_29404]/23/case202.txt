for the second time,we hear an appeal in a dispute between appellees discover bank and discover financial services,a servicing affiliate of discover bank dfs,and,together with discover bank,discover,and appellant betty vaden vaden.this case arises from vaden failure to pay a credit card balance and dfs resulting suit against her in state court.vaden responded with several counterclaims against dfs.discover bank then filed suit in federal district court under of the federal arbitration act faa,seeking to compel arbitration of vaden counterclaims.
in the first appeal,we decided as a threshold matter that the federal courts possess subject matter jurisdiction under of the faa if the underlying dispute presents a federal question.on remand,we directed the district court to decide whether such a federal question exists here.more specifically,we asked the district court to determine whether discover bank or dfs was the real party in interest with respect to vaden state court counterclaims.if discover bank were found to be the real party in interest,then the federal deposit insurance act fdia,et,would be implicated because discover bank is a,federally insured bank.in that event,we asked the district court to determine whether the fdia completely preempted vaden state law usury claims.if the district court found that the claims were completely preempted and therefore a federal question existed,it then had to determine whether there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of an arbitration agreement between vaden and discover bank.
the district court found that this case presented a federal question and accordingly denied vaden motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and stayed her counterclaims pending arbitration.we agree that a federal question exists here and that the district court properly compelled arbitration.therefore,we affirm.
in,vaden obtained a discover credit card.the card was issued by discover bank,a,federally insured bank.dfs is a servicing affiliate of discover bank.according to the servicing agreement between dfs and discover bank,dfs performs such functions as marketing and servicing discover bank loan products and collecting on accounts pursuant to instructions from discover bank.in june,discover mailed vaden a new platinum discover card.discover claims that vaden account was automatically converted to platinum status at this time.vaden cardmember statements,however,identified her as a regular cardmember until september.in july,discover mailed vaden a notice of amendment to discover platinum cardmember agreement the notice of amendment.this notice,which applied only to platinum cardmembers,included a provision requiring arbitration of disputes.
in july,on behalf of discover bank,dfs sued vaden in maryland state court for nonpayment of a card balance in excess of.vaden then filed counterclaims based solely on maryland law against dfs.these counterclaims include a claim and claims that certain fees and interest rates were charged in violation of applicable maryland statutes that regulate finance charges,late fees,and compounding of interest on consumer credit accounts.in that proceeding,dfs was identified as discover financial services,discover,svc affiliate of discover bank,greenwood trust,a de chartered state bank and issuer of the discover card.
shortly after vaden filed these counterclaims,discover filed a petition in federal court seeking to compel arbitration of vaden counterclaims based on the arbitration provision in the notice of amendment.discover had made no previous requests to vaden for arbitration.the district court granted discover motion to compel arbitration.
vaden timely appealed and this court heard argument on that appeal in december.in january,we considered the issue of whether jurisdiction existed.see discover bank vaden,cir vaden i.we held in vaden i that when a party comes to federal court seeking to compel arbitration,the presence of a federal question in the underlying dispute is sufficient to support jurisdiction.id.at.we declined to decide whether such an underlying federal question existed in this case.id.on remand,we directed the district court to determine whether a federal question existed and guided it to examine whether discover bank was the real party in interest with respect to vaden claims and whether these claims were completely preempted by the fdia 
answering these questions,the district court found that discover bank was the real party in interest and that vaden state court usury claims were completely preempted.also,the district court found that there was no issue of material fact regarding the existence of an arbitration agreement between vaden and discover bank,and accordingly granted discover request for arbitration.
vaden again timely appealed the district court ruling,which appeal is before us now.vaden argues that dfs is the real party of interest,and thus the fdia is not implicated and the federal court is without jurisdiction over the dispute.vaden also contends that compelling arbitration was improper for two reasons discover lacks standing because it failed to satisfy the relevant statutory requirements for compelling arbitration,and there was not a valid arbitration agreement between vaden and discover bank.
we turn first to the question of whether the federal courts have jurisdiction over discover bank petition for arbitration under the faa.
under of the faa,a district court may issue an order compelling arbitration if the court would otherwise have jurisdiction under title,in a civil action of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.emphasis added.section does not require a party to actually file suit regarding the underlying controversy the faa requires only that a party be aggrieved by another party failure to arbitrate a controversy,the subject matter of which would fall within the jurisdiction of this court,were an actual suit to arise out of the controversy.reynolds reynolds software,d,see vaden i,at we thus hold that a federal court possesses jurisdiction over a case when the controversy underlying the arbitration agreement presents a federal question.id.at the text of requires us to consider jurisdiction as it arises out of the whole controversy between the parties.tamiami partners,miccosukee tribe,cir suggesting that it is appropriate to look through the arbitration request to assess whether the underlying dispute between the parties is grounded in federal law.thus,a petition to compel arbitration is properly in federal court if the underlying dispute presents a federal question moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d vaden i,at.a court must therefore look through the arbitration claim and examine the underlying action.
the supreme court has explained that even when a complaint alleges only violations of state law,the case may nevertheless center on a federal question,and therefore be removable if federal law completely preempts the state law claims.caterpillar williams,d.this is the complete doctrine.id.caterpillar explains that o nce an area of state law has been completely,any claim purportedly based on that state law is considered,from its inception,a federal claim,and therefore arises under federal law.id.
complete preemption is an exception to the complaint rule.although generally a case may not be removed to federal court solely because of a defense or counterclaim arising under federal law,topeka hous.auth.johnson,cir,complete preemption is an exception to this rule and so federal jurisdiction is proper,even though the preemption is only raised as a defense.see caterpillar,at.see also topeka hous,at noting that complete preemption is an exception to the general rule barring removal based on counterclaims citing charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed 
in misapprehending that complete preemption is a narrow exception to the general rule that federal jurisdiction must appear on the face of the complaint,the dissent fails to appreciate the fundamental distinction between complete and ordinary preemption.its interpretation would deny discover bank a federal forum even if discover were a opposed to bank operating under a federal law the supreme court has expressly held to completely preempt state law.see infra part.the fallacy inherent in the dissent view is patent it would render the concept of complete preemption a nullity.
for jurisdiction to exist in this case,then,two requirements must be satisfied a federal law other than the faa must be invoked and said federal law must completely preempt the state law claims in question.the district court,at our direction,found that there was a federal question in the underlying dispute because discover bank was the real party in interest in the proceedings,thereby implicating the fdia,and that the fdia completely preempted vaden usury claims against discover bank.we now consider its determinations,discussing each in turn.we review questions of jurisdiction de novo,lontz tharp,cir.
first,we look to whether a federal law is invoked by the underlying state court dispute.see caterpillar,at.to resolve this question we must answer another whether discover bank,as opposed to dfs,is the real party in interest with respect to vaden counterclaims on the face of the pleadings,dfs,not discover bank,is the party to the dispute.if discover bank is not the real party in interest with respect to the counterclaims,the fdia does not apply because dfs is not a bank and therefore the implicate no federal law.the parties styling of the pleadings does not control our analysis,however we must decide whether vaden counterclaims are really directed at discover bank rather than dfs.see vaden i,at.the district court found that discover bank was the real party of interest with respect to vaden counterclaims,and we agree.
one of our most fundamental procedural rules is that an action must be brought by the party that has the right to enforce the claim and has a significant interest in the litigation.see.power westinghouse,cir citing.a.the identity of the real party may not always be apparent from the face of pleadings it may be necessary to look beyond the pleadings to the facts of the dispute.see vaden i,at see also phipps fdic,cir w e are required to look beyond the plaintiffs artful attempts to characterize their claims to avoid federal jurisdiction.such is the case here.
the need to look carefully at the facts to determine the real party in interest is particularly compelling in this instance because of the unique and complex relationships among the parties through the various phases of this litigation the instant suit began when dfs,identified as discover financial services,discover,svc affiliate of discover bank,greenwood trust,a de chartered state bank and issuer of the discover card,sued vaden in maryland state court for an unpaid credit card balance.vaden counterclaimed against dfs,alleging damages based upon improper assessment of fees and interest charges t hus,her claims were directed against the entity that extended her credit,charged her interest and had a right to bring the collection lender.amicus,fdic,at.vaden would have us simply accept dfs as the lender,and thus real party in interest,and deny discover bank role as originator of her cardmember account.the facts,however,show that discover bank was the lender here and therefore the real party in interest.
there are several pieces of evidence we find instructive in construing the relationship between vaden and discover bank.the cardmember agreements issued to vaden are of particular significance.these agreements conclusively demonstrate that discover bank was the entity that extended vaden credit and set the interest and fees of which vaden complains see.the agreements allow discover bank to levy periodic finance charges and late fees,as well as to change the rate of finance charge with thirty days notice.id.in addition,the arbitration agreement in question was between discover bank and vaden only,as they were the only two parties to the original cardmember agreement.see.the servicing agreement between discover bank and dfs also supports our finding that discover bank is the real party in interest here.that agreement provides that dfs will service certain discover bank loan products,and dfs must perform all marketing and collection services under instructions from discover bank.one of the service activities dfs performed was mailing monthly bills to cardmembers.nothing on the statements that dfs mailed to vaden identified dfs as the lender.to the contrary,mailing billing statements is consistent with dfs admitted role as a servicing agent.dfs also brings collection actions pursuant to the servicing agreement,as it did here in suing vaden for her unpaid balance on discover bank behalf.see.
in addition,as the fdic points out,the servicing agreement specifies that 
dfs will not be responsible for violations of federal or state law,including usury laws,fee restrictions or privacy laws,to the extent that dfs acts consistently with directions or supervision received from discover bank or its agents discover bank will be solely responsible for establishing the annual percentage yields and rates,insurance premiums,and other charges and fees for its credit cards,deposit accounts and other products and for ensuring that such yields,rates,premiums,charges or fees are in compliance with state and federal laws.
emphasis added.the agreement establishes a clear division of authority between dfs and discover bank,designating discover bank as the party in charge of setting the terms and conditions of lending money through its credit cards.dfs,although it could evaluate consumer credit applications,could only do so under guidelines set forth by discover bank.id.
importantly,the servicing agreement also provides that discover bank will indemnify dfs for any damages caused by discover bank.this includes any potential judgment from vaden state court counterclaims against dfs.discover bank acknowledges that it would be bound by any judgment resulting from the litigation,even though it was not officially a party to it,because dfs was acting on its behalf.appellee br.at.nor would dfs be permitted to keep any funds collected from a cardmember in its own name it must immediately deposit all such funds in discover bank accounts.
a final source of support for the conclusion that discover bank is the real party in interest is found in discover bank financial statement and prospectuses for the sale of interests in credit card receivables through securitizations.discover bank financial statement explains that loans make up the majority of the bank consumer loans and are assets of the bank.the bank prospectuses identify discover bank as the issuer of the discover credit card and owner of the discover card account.these same prospectuses reaffirm discover bank right to set the terms for essential aspects of a cardholder account the rate for periodic finance charges,late fees,credit limits,minimum monthly payments,criteria,policies,and collection practices.service and operating tasks are delegated to dfs.
this evidence notwithstanding,vaden argues that dfs,and not discover bank,is the real party in interest with respect to her counterclaims.she points to several items in the record for support,including the pleadings themselves,morgan stanley annual report on discover,and press releases from dfs.in particular,vaden proffers certain press releases stating that dfs operates the discover card brand as evidence that dfs is the real party in interest.the functions attributed to dfs in these press releases,however,are consistent with its role as a servicing entity and do not establish it as a lender.importantly,vaden herself does not contest the fact that it is discover bank and not dfs that set the interest rate on her account.none of these documents suggest that dfs operated as a lender or had any authority to alter or set vital terms of vaden cardmember account.moreover,these documents are secondary sources of information,rather than primary sources such as the servicing agreement and discover bank prospectus.we are unpersuaded by vaden arguments,as we find the evidence she proffers to be consistent with the conclusion that discover bank is the real party in interest.
on these facts,we hold that discover bank is the real party in interest with respect to vaden state court counterclaims.because discover bank is a,federally insured bank,the fdia is implicated by these claims against the bank 
we turn next to the question of whether of the fdia completely preempts state law usury claims against a,federally insured bank that is the real party in interest of a state court dispute 
in interpreting any statute,we turn first to the text of the statute itself.section a of the fdia provides in part 
in order to prevent discrimination against insured depository institutions with respect to interest rates such state bank s may,notwithstanding any state constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this section,take,receive,reserve,and charge on any loan or discount made,or upon any note,bill of exchange,or other evidence of debt,interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state where the bank is located.
a emphasis added.the statute express preemption provision indicates that at the very least,congress contemplated ordinary express preemption when drafting this statute.
however,to decide the more specific question of whether congress intended complete preemption of usury claims,as distinguished from ordinary express preemption,we look beyond the text,to congress intentions in enacting the statute.the legislative history of the fdia is instructive in this regard.it tells us that congress intended to allow competitive equity among financial institutions,and reaffirm the principle that institutions offering similar products should be subject to similar rules.cong.rec.statement of bumpers.the fdia was enacted in part to provide parity,or competitive equality,between national banks and state chartered depository institutions cong.rec.statement of proxmire.
keeping in mind the purpose underlying the fdia enactment,we turn to the question of whether congress intended the fdia to completely preempt usury claims against banks.although this is an issue of first impression in this court,we are not wholly without guidance as far as federal banking laws are concerned.the supreme court has addressed the issue within the context of the national bank act nba,et,which is to national banks as section of the fdia is to banks in beneficial,the supreme court held that the nba completely preempts usury claims against national banks.at.the court explained that b ecause and provide the exclusive cause of action for usury claims,there is no such thing as a claim of usury against a national bank.id.as a result,even though the plaintiff complaint did not mention federal law,his cause of action arose under federal law and defendant national bank removal to federal court based on complete preemption under the nba was proper.id.at.
one of our sister circuits has compared the nba to the fdia and found that both statutes completely preempt usury claims the third circuit has held that the nba and fdia are interpreted in para materia and therefore the doctrine of complete preemption applies to the fdia as well.in in re community bank of,cir,the court found that section a completely preempts any state law attempting to limit the amount of interest and fees a federally insured,bank can charge.indeed,not only does the fdia contain an express preemption clause notwithstanding any state constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this section but it also incorporates verbatim the language of of the nba.id.at.when congress borrows language from one statute and incorporates it into a second statute,the language of the two acts ordinarily should be interpreted the same way.id.at.therefore,complete preemption was held to apply to state usury claims against,federally insured banks,just as it does to claims against national banks.
the first circuit has also compared the nba and fdia,although not in the context of complete preemption.the dispute in greenwood trust massachusetts,cir,arose when the commonwealth of massachusetts notified greenwood that its policy violated state law.greenwood reacted to the threat of potential litigation from the state by filing for declaratory and injunctive relief in federal court on the grounds that the fdia expressly preempted state law usury claims.in assessing whether the fdia state usury laws,the court explained that congress enacted the fdia to level the playing field between national and state banks regarding the levying of interest rates.greenwood trust,at.the historical record clearly requires a court to read the parallel provisions of the fdia and the bank act in pari materia.id.emphasis omitted 
we find the logic of our sister circuits compelling.we note as well that the fdic further supports our finding of complete preemption the agency has uniformly construed section in pari materia with sections and of the nba.amicus,fdic,at emphasis omitted.u nder section a,state banks were provided interest rate authority comparable to that of national banks.interest charges include not only the numerical percentage rate assigned to a loan but also late payment fees,over the limit fees and other similar charges.id.citing a footnote omitted.in arguing that the fdia completely preempts usury claims,the fdic relies on beneficial national bank,agreeing with the first and third circuits,that in,congress created a federal cause of action that entirely replaced the analogous area of state law.id.at.
we find the analyses of the fdic and our sister circuits persuasive.given the express preemption language of the fdia,the statute legislative history affirming congress intent to provide competitive equality between national and banks,the virtual identity of the preemption language in the nba and that of the fdia,and the supreme court finding of complete preemption under the nba,we are to conclude other than that congress intended complete preemption of usury claims under the fdia.as the final step in our analysis,we turn to a consideration of whether vaden state law counterclaims fall into this completely preempted category.
vaden state court counterclaims challenge certain fees and interest rates charged on her discover card account she argues that these fees and interest rates were in violation of maryland laws regulating finance charges,late fees,and compounding of interest on consumer credit accounts.see,comm.law,vaden complaints regarding the fees and interest charged on her cardmember account fall squarely within the fdic definition of usury charges.see a defining usury charges as the numerical periodic rate,late payment fees,fees,and other charges.we therefore conclude that vaden claims are completely preempted by the fdia we emphasize again that our holding only extends so far as a,federally insured bank is the real party of interest with respect to the preempted claims.
lastly,we turn to the issue of whether an arbitration agreement binds vaden and discover bank so as to make compelling arbitration proper.pursuant to our instructions in vaden i,the district court also examined whether there was a question of material fact about the existence of an arbitration agreement.at.vaden appeals the district court findings that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties and that her claims are subject to arbitration because she failed to opt out of that agreement.discover bank vaden,d,citing snowden checkpoint check cashing,cir,for the proposition that a court must order arbitration once it is satisfied that an agreement for arbitration has been made and has not been honored see.
significantly,under both delaware and maryland law,vaden bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of receiving the arbitration agreement,which was included in a notice of amendment to the cardmember agreement see graham commercial credit,holding that mail which is properly addressed and posted is presumed to be duly received by the addressee marsheck bd.of trustees of the fire police employees ret.of the city of,explaining the presumption of receipt arising from proper mailing.vaden only evidence to support her claim that she did not receive it is her own statement that she did not,and mere denial is insufficient to rebut the presumption of receipt.we find no error in the district court analysis of this issue and so affirm based on the reasoning of the district court 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court finding that discover bank is the real party in interest with respect to vaden counterclaims,and we hold that the fdia completely preempts usury claims against a,federally insured bank to the extent that the bank is the real party in interest with respect to those claims.we also affirm the district court finding that there was no issue of material fact with respect to the existence of an arbitration agreement between vaden and discover and therefore affirm the district court grant of discover motion to compel arbitration.
the district court and the majority inexplicably use the removal doctrine of complete preemption to recharacterize a counterclaim in a state court civil action as federal.from that process,they pluck an independent basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction to support this action to compel arbitration.as i find no independent basis for federal court jurisdiction exists,i respectfully dissent.
in vaden i,the court heard an appeal from a case brought under the faa,which did not have an independent jurisdictional basis on its face the panel found that a federal court may hear a petition to compel arbitration if,but for the arbitration agreement,subject matter jurisdiction over the case would otherwise exist by virtue of a properly invoked federal question in the underlying dispute.discover bank vaden vaden i,cir emphasis added.the court in vaden i remanded the case to the district court with instructions to determine whether such a federal question exists in this case.see id.at.the vaden i panel hypothesized that vaden counterclaims alleging illegal interest rates and late fees might present issues of such substantial federal interest as to be,in effect,federal claims under the fdia.see vaden i,at.the panel suggested to the district court that if it found that discover bank,as opposed to merely discover financial services,is a party of interest in the state law suit,then a federal question may be presented id.at.upon remand,the district court found that discover bank was the real party in interest with respect to the counterclaims and on that basis bootstrapped an additional party into the case to defend the counterclaims.discover bank vaden,d.
my disagreement with the majority opinion centers on its finding of arising under jurisdiction in a counterclaim.federal question jurisdiction can not be predicated on federal issues that may arise later in an action by way of defense or counterclaim.arthur miller,artful pleading a doctrine in search of definition,citing takeda northwestern nat.life ins,cir.
my conclusion that there is no properly invoked federal question in the underlying case relies on basic principles of arising under jurisdiction.federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.see,kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d federal courts possess only that power authorized by the constitution and statute,which is not to be expanded by judicial decree.article iii of the constitution gives federal courts the power to hear cases arising under the constitution,laws,and treaties of the united states.const.art.iii,cl.this grant of power is not.congress did not give the federal courts general federal question jurisdiction until the judiciary act of.act of,ch,stat,current version at.although the language of tracks article iii arising under language,the supreme court has given a limiting construction.miller.at.one of the keystones of this limiting construction is the complaint rule articulated by the supreme court in louisville nashville mottley and constantly reaffirmed by the federal judiciary.id.for the court to have jurisdiction under,it must be clear from the face of a complaint that there is a federal question the federal issue must exist as part of the plaintiff cause of action.louisville nashville mottley.a federal right must be an essential element of the plaintiff claim the controversy must be disclosed upon the face of the complaint,unaided by the answer or by the petition for removal.gully first bank in meridian.this rule also serves the essential administrative function of establishing the existence of a federal question at the onset of litigation.miller.at.the complaint rule applies equally to original and removal jurisdiction and has prevented federal courts from asserting jurisdiction over many cases in which federal issues have actually been raised.id.this rule prevents the disruption,to both the system and the litigants,of shifting a case between state and federal fora in the middle of an action as federal issues arise or fall out.id.
state courts,on the other hand,are courts of general jurisdiction.the supreme court has held that not only do state courts have the ability to hear federal claims,but that in all but the most exceptional circumstances they must hear federal claims.see generally testa katt.establishing that state courts have a general obligation to hear federal claims.this ability and obligation of state courts to hear federal claims and enforce federal law is derived from the supremacy clause of the constitution 
in the case before this court seeking to compel arbitration,federal jurisdiction is purportedly based upon defendant state court alleging illegal late fees and interest rates.there was no diversity jurisdiction and no federal question appeared on the face of the complaint.in affirming the district court,the majority undertook an examination of the state counterclaims using novel understandings of procedural rules as to parties and a completely puzzling view of the doctrine of complete preemption.this process led the majority of this panel to agree with the district court that vaden counterclaims provided federal subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying case,and therefore an independent jurisdictional basis existed to permit the court to decide the petition to compel arbitration under the faa.this was error.there was no properly invoked federal question in the underlying state case.
the court in holmes group,vornado air circulation systems,d,addressed the question of whether a counterclaim can serve as the basis for arising under jurisdiction.the court held that it could not.the court noted that the complaint rule has long governed whether a case arises under federal law for purposes of.holmes group,at.citing phillips petroleum texaco,d,per curiam.the court stated,a appears as part of the defendant answer,not as part of the plaintiff serve as the basis for arising under jurisdiction.holmes group,at.citing in re adams,cir fdic elefant,cir takeda northwestern national life ins,cir wright,miller,cooper,federal practice procedure,ed.the court concluded,f or these reasons,we decline to transform the longstanding rule into the rule urged by respondent.holmes group,at.emphasis in original.
the majority attempts to evade the clear holding in holmes group by misapplying the doctrine of complete preemption to counterclaims.the majority fails to recognize that complete preemption is solely a removal doctrine that is analytically applied to recharacterize allegations made in a plaintiff complaint.the majority sets about its explication of its novel jurisdictional construct in footnotes two and three.op.at.an examination of these footnotes exposes the erroneous legal formulation upon which the majority opinion depends.
in footnote three,the majority acknowledges that complete is a removal doctrine,stating,a lthough complete preemption did originate in the removal context,we conclude that it also applies to the unique procedural posture of this case.op.at.the majority offers as support for this proposition the following quote from caterpillar,williams,d 
on occasion,the court has concluded that a preemptive force of a statute is so extraordinary that it converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.
contrary to the majority apparent understanding,that passage makes plain that the doctrine of complete preemption has but one is,the recharacterization of a plaintiff state complaint so that it may be considered federal for the purposes of the complaint rule.the complaint rule states that,a defendant may not remove a case to federal court unless the plaintiff complaint establishes that the case arises under federal law.franchise tax,at.footnote omitted emphasis added.the complete preemption doctrine thus works to treat a plaintiff state complaint as federal from its inception,thus permitting removal.in the case of complete preemption congress so completely preempt s a particular area that any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character.darcangelo verizon commc ns,cir quoting metro.life ins.taylor,d emphasis added.
the majority holding results in the adoption of a counterclaim rule,rejected by the court in holmes group as it would leave the acceptance or rejection of the state forum to the counterclaimant.it would allow a defendant to remove a case brought in state court under state law,thereby defeating plaintiff choice of forum,simply by raising a federal counterclaim.holmes group,at.or in the case of a dispute requiring arbitration,it would deprive the state court of its concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the faa.see moses cone,at.noting that enforcement of the faa is left in large part to the state courts.
footnote three in the majority opinion concludes to hold otherwise would have the perverse result of returning to state court otherwise completely preempted federal claims because of the unanticipated nature of a defendant counterclaims.op.at.not to quibble,but the counterclaims never left state court,as the case was not removed or removable.no accepted theory of federal jurisdiction would put this claim properly before a federal court.in any event,what the majority characterizes as a perverse result is an accurate description of our legal system and the overlapping jurisdiction of state and federal courts.federal counterclaims are adjudicated in state court every day.see,city county of honolulu sherman,adjudicating counterclaims based on the federal religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa villas west ii of willowridge mcglothin,adjudicating at trial fair housing act counterclaim salon enterprises,langford,d,adjudicating flsa counterclaims.suburban sanitary comm,granting summary judgment as to counterclaims.
i completely disagree with the majority conclusion in footnote three.i believe holmes group is controlling here.in an attempt to support its contention that holmes group does not contradict its conclusion,the majority misinterprets the text of wright miller.the majority in footnote three,selectively quotes wright miller.a key portions is omitted.the omission substantially distorts the textual discussion.in context this section of the treatise states omitted portion in bold 
in contrast,under the doctrine,which has been invoked in a of cases and contexts,a narrow class of claims are so necessarily federal that they always will permit removal to federal court.in these cases,federal law not only preempts a state law to some degree but also substitutes a federal cause of action for the state cause of action,thereby manifesting congress intent to permit removal.thus,if a plaintiff files suit in state court based upon a state cause of action,and the defendant removes the case on the basis of complete preemption,the federal district court will recharacterize the plaintiff state cause of action as a federal claim for relief,making the removal proper on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.in this sense,the doctrine overrides such fundamental cornerstones of federal subject matter jurisdiction as the complaint rule and the principle that the plaintiff is master of the complaint.
charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure at,ed emphasis added.without omissions,the referenced passage makes clear that the doctrine of complete preemption is exclusively focused on claims in a plaintiff complaint and offers no support for the majority jurisdictional theory.
finally,i am constrained to say that i am troubled by the court use of the faa as a make weight for jurisdiction.the faa was designed to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,but not more so.prima paint,d.it did not intend to elevate them over other forms of contract.id.the supreme court has made clear that the plain language of forbids federal courts from adjudicating the merits of the dispute to be arbitrated.yet,this court interprets to require the district courts to address the underlying dispute carefully enough to determine whether it states a federal question.the federal court does this,not so that it can resolve any of the parties rights or remedies under federal law,but simply so it can take subject matter jurisdiction of a faa action that is often nothing more than an ordinary contract action.cmty.state bank strong,cir marcus concurring.
with respect,i believe the approach taken by the majority here,and the panel in vaden i,is mistaken.vaden i puts this court at odds with at least four of our sister circuits.see westmoreland findlay.cir,fitch,cir smith barney,sarver,cir wisconsin nation,cir.the clear weight of authority is that does not make federal question jurisdiction over a petition to compel arbitration dependent on the nature of the underlying dispute to be arbitrated.community state bank,at.actions are regularly filed under the faa,and the approach adopted by this court,finding federal question jurisdiction where the court is asked only to enforce a private contract,considerably,and in my view unjustifiably,expands federal court jurisdiction.community state bank,at.i do not believe we should look beyond the face of the arbitration petition to determine jurisdiction.
the district court erred in determining it had subject matter jurisdiction.there is no properly invoked federal question in the underlying case.therefore there is no independent basis for jurisdiction over the suit seeking enforcement under the faa.i would remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
much of the dissent discussion explicates its dissatisfaction with vaden i.the holding in vaden i is,of course,the law of the case,and beyond the reach of this appeal.
were diversity jurisdiction to exist,this alone would be sufficient to confer federal jurisdiction.here,however,diversity jurisdiction is not present.see.
the dissent argues that complete preemption is purely a removal doctrine and therefore that we improperly invoke it upon the unique procedural posture of this case.although complete preemption did originate in the removal context,we conclude that it also applies to the unique procedural posture of this case.complete preemption creates an exception to the complaint rule on occasion,the court has concluded that the force of a statute is so extraordinary that it converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.caterpillar,at.quoting metropolitan life ins.taylor,d.the doctrine,therefore,does not flow from the procedural act of removal,but from the dominance of federal law over the preempted state law.thus,it is not a logical leap to apply this principle to the instant case.to hold otherwise would have the perverse result of returning to state court otherwise completely preempted federal claims because of the unanticipated nature of a defendant,the question of whether complete preemption is a removal doctrine,see dissenting op.at,is irrelevant.the point is simply whether discover bank arbitration petition presents a federal question.see district court may order arbitration if the court would otherwise have jurisdiction under title,in a civil action of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.we held as much in vaden i,stating the plain text of requires us to ask whether any basis for subject matter jurisdiction would exist for the case in the absence of the arbitration agreement,discover
