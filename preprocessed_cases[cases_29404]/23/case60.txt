this appeal considers whether a letter to a consumer debtor providing a total amount due and stating that the amount may include estimated fees,costs,additional payments,or escrow disbursements that are not yet due is sufficient to state the amount of the debt as required by the fair debt collection practices act.we hold that,in the circumstances here,it is not.as a threshold matter,we also clarify that mortgage foreclosure complaints are not initial communications within the meaning of the fair debt collection practices act.because carlin has stated facts that,if true,give rise to liability under the fair debt collection practices act,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
andrew carlin,individually and on behalf of others similarly situated,alleges that davidson fink llp violated the fair debt collection practices act,et the fdcpa,when it failed to provide the amount of the debt within five days after an initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of a debt,as required by.the complaint alleges that davidson fink made three attempts to collect on a debt and that each time,it failed to provide adequate notice to carlin of the amount of the debt.
carlin urges us to hold that davidson fink first communication,a mortgage foreclosure complaint the foreclosure complaint,was an initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of a debt,and that davidson fink was therefore required to provide the amount of the debt within five days of filing the foreclosure complaint.but we decline to so hold because the plain language of the statute excludes from pleadings in a civil action.instead,we conclude that davidson fink letter,an unambiguous attempt to collect on a debt,triggered the disclosure requirements of,and that carlin has adequately alleged that this second communication by davidson fink did not satisfy those requirements.we therefore vacate the order and judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
