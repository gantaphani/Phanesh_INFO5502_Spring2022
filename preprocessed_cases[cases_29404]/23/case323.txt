plaintiff david ruskin,standing chapter trustee for the eastern district of michigan trustee,appeals the district court decision in favor of daimlerchrysler services north america,daimlerchrysler,in the trustee appeal from a decision of the bankruptcy court.the chapter debtor,matthew adkins,had defaulted on his car payments,and daimlerchrysler,holder of a claim secured by adkins car,moved to repossess the vehicle.the trustee argued that any debt remaining after the repossession and sale of the car at auction should be reclassified as an unsecured claim daimlerchrysler argued,and the bankruptcy court and the district court agreed,that this court decision in chrysler financial nolan in re nolan,cir,foreclosed such a reclassification.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the district court decision.
factual background 
on august,adkins debtor filed a chapter petition and proposed plan.on september,daimlerchrysler filed a proof of claim secured by the debtor plymouth neon neon for at interest,valuing the neon at.the debtor proposed plan valued the neon at,and proposed an interest rate of.daimlerchrysler filed objections to the proposed plan based on the value and interest rate proposed by the debtor.
following a confirmation hearing and resolution of both the trustee and daimlerchrysler objections,the bankruptcy court confirmed a plan the plan on november.the confirmed plan set the value of the neon at daimlerchrysler secured claim was subject to cram down to that amount under a b ii,with the remaining deficiency balance transformed into an unsecured claim for.the plan provided that the secured claim should be paid by monthly payments of and interest at per annum.the plan provided that these payments on the secured claim would be paid by the trustee from payments the debtor made to the trustee.the plan provided that general unsecured creditors receive no less than on all filed claims.
following confirmation,the debtor failed to remit the payments to the trustee as required by the plan daimlerchrysler received no payments on its claims after december.after more than sixty days passed without any payments from the debtor,daimlerchrysler moved for relief from the automatic stay to repossess and sell the neon.as part of that motion,daimlerchrysler requested that any deficiency balance,or the difference between the amount still owed to it on the previously allowed secured claim of and the proceeds from selling the neon at auction,should be paid to it as a secured claim as set forth in the original confirmed plan after filing an amended proof of claim.the trustee objected to the latter request,and a hearing was held the bankruptcy court granted the motion for lifting the automatic stay and held that this court decision in chrysler financial nolan in re nolan,cir,required that any deficiency resulting from the sale of the repossessed automobile be paid as a secured claim in re adkins.
the trustee then appealed to the district court,which initially refused to hear the appeal because the foreclosure had not yet taken place once actual repossession,sale and assertion of a secured claim for the deficiency by daimler chrysler sic took place the appeal was reinstated nunc pro tunc.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under.
on december,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.in re adkins.a timely notice of appeal was filed january.this court has appellate jurisdiction under.
ii.law and analysis 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court statutory interpretation and conclusions of law de novo.it reviews a bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error.in re american homepatient,cir.
b.in re nolan 
the sole legal issue in this case is whether the bankruptcy court and district court correctly extended the principles this court espoused in the case chrysler financial nolan in re nolan,cir,to the present situation in which a secured creditor repossesses a debtor vehicle under relief from the automatic stay.
in the nolan decision,a chapter debtor moved under to surrender her car and reclassify any deficiency resulting from the sale of the surrendered car as an unsecured claim.at.section allows modification of a chapter bankruptcy plan after confirmation of the plan but before completion of payments,on the motion of the debtor,the trustee,or the holder of an unsecured claim,to increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by the plan,to extend or reduce the time for such payments,or to alter the amount of the distribution to a creditor whose claim is provided for by the plan to the extent necessary to take account of any payment of such claim other than under the plan.a prior to nolan,lower federal courts were split on whether section allowed a debtor to modify a confirmed plan by surrendering collateral to a secured creditor the value of which typically would have already been subjected to cram down,and then reclassifying any deficiency resulting from the sale of the collateral as an allowed unsecured claim to be paid back at the generally reduced rate for unsecured creditors set forth in the plan.see at noting split.what the nolan court termed a sizable minority of lower courts followed a rationale set forth in in re jock,that allowed such a surrender and reclassification under section.
in nolan,however,this court held that section did not allow reclassification as an unsecured claim of a deficiency resulting from the sale of a vehicle surrendered,finding five fundamental deficiencies in the reasoning of jock and its progeny.
first,nolan found that section a does not expressly allow a debtor to alter,reduce,or reclassify a previously allowed claim,but rather only affords the debtor a right to request an alteration of the amount or timing of specific payments.at emphasis added.jock and its progeny had interpreted section b reference to section a which allows for surrender of collateral and classification of the deficiency as an unsecured claim,as allowing surrender and reclassification.nolan,however,rejected this interpretation of section b.nolan held that section b does not apply unless the proposed modifications first comply with section a,and that section a did not expressly allow reclassification of secured claims to unsecured claims.at.in so holding,the nolan court noted that while section a allows surrender of collateral,f or section a b ii to provide any protection to the creditor when the debtor chooses to retain her collateral,the secured claim must not be subject to modification throughout the life of the plan.id.at.
indeed,the second principle on which nolan reversed the jock line of cases was the finding that the proposed modification would violate section a b,which mandates that a secured claim is fixed in amount and status and must be paid in full once it has been allowed.at.nolan held that a surrender and subsequent reclassification is an attempt to bifurcate a claim that has already been classified as fully secured,and thus would negate the requirement in section a b ii that a plan is not to be confirmed unless the property to be distributed on account of a claim is not less than the allowed amount of the claim.id.
third,nolan found that the proposed modification would violate section a which provides that a confirmed chapter plan is binding on debtor and creditor,and postulated an unlikely congressional intent to give debtors the option to shift the burden of depreciation to a secured creditor by reclassifying the claim and surrendering the collateral when the debtor no longer has any use for the devalued asset.at.allowing the surrender and reclassification,nolan reasoned,would subject secured creditors to a double reduction of a secured claim in those cases where the creditor already experienced a cram down in valuation at the time of confirmation.id.at.nolan found that allowing debtors to experience such a windfall was unfair and found no evidence for congressional approval of such a result.id.
fourth,because section a only allows the debtor,the trustee,and the holders of unsecured creditors to move for a modification under that section,the jock interpretation of section would create an inequitable situation where the secured creditor could not move to reclassify its claim if the collateral securing the claim appreciates in value,but others can move to shift the burden of a collateral depreciation in value to the creditor.id.
fifth and finally,nolan held that using section to reclassify claims was at odds with the plain language of section.this section does not state that the plan may be modified to increase or reduce the amount of claims.at quoting in re banks,emphasis in nolan.nolan noted that the bankruptcy code uses the terms claim which is specifically defined in the code and payment which is not differently throughout the code,thus making it less likely that congress intended the word claim to be substituted for the word payment in section.id.
based on these five reasons,nolan held that a debtor can not modify a plan under section a by surrendering the collateral to a creditor having the creditor sell the collateral and apply the proceeds toward the claim and having any deficiency classified as an unsecured claim.at citing in re coleman.
application of nolan principles to repossession of collateral 
the trustee contends that the bankruptcy court and district court erred by applying nolan to the present case,because nolan is factually distinguishable.in nolan,the debtor voluntarily sought to modify her plan by surrendering her vehicle and having the deficiency reclassified as an unsecured claim.given that the debtor in nolan reported having frequent mechanical trouble with the vehicle and had put many,many miles on the vehicle,the trustee argues,it was clear in nolan that the debtor was seeking to shift the burden of depreciation which she likely accelerated through her use and lack of maintenance to the secured creditor.here,the trustee contends,it was daimlerchrysler decision to move to lift the automatic stay under d and repossess the secured collateral.the trustee contends that under the present circumstances,nolan should not be applied to allow the treatment of any deficiency resulting from sale of the collateral as a secured claim for purposes of future distributions from the plan.allowing daimlerchrysler to affirmatively repossess the vehicle and retain secured status in the plan,the trustee argues,would allow daimlerchrysler an unfair double recovery and would also be unfair to the other unsecured creditors.the trustee further contends that allowing daimlerchrysler to retain secured status in the plan after it repossesses and sells the collateral makes no sense under the bankruptcy code because a claim is only a secured claim under section of the code if the claim is secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest.a.once daimlerchrysler repossesses and sells the vehicle,the trustee argues,the lien on estate property is extinguished.
daimlerchrysler defends the lower courts application of nolan to the present case,contending that the factual distinctions between this case and nolan are insignificant.it argues that even though daimlerchrysler was the moving party procedurally in this case,in actuality debtor brought daimlerchrysler action upon himself when he defaulted on his payments to the trustee.daimlerchrysler argues that the trustee objection to daimlerchrysler request to treat any deficiency following the repossession as a secured claim was essentially a motion to reclassify the deficiency as an unsecured claim and essentially a motion to modify the plan under section.therefore,daimlerchrysler argues,nolan forbids reclassification of the deficiency in this circumstance.
we believe that whether the trustee technically made a motion under section is not the key to the question of whether reclassification of secured claims is allowed in chapter bankruptcies.nolan holding was not based solely on the language of section.as discussed above,nolan relied heavily on the language of sections and.daimlerchrysler emphasizes that section provides that once a plan is confirmed,its provisions bind the debtor and each creditor.indeed,confirmation of a plan has been described as res judicata of all issues that could or should have been litigated at the confirmation hearing.in re cameron.
because all issues addressed during a plan confirmation are given preclusive effect,the bifurcation of a creditor claim into a secured and an unsecured claim is likewise given preclusive effect.thus if a creditor has an allowed secured claim of x dollars,which must be paid during the life of the plan,that issue has been litigated and can not be altered.
in re coffman,citations omitted.
the nolan decision was also anchored on the provisions of section a b,holding that this provision mandates that a secured claim is fixed in amount and status and must be paid in full once it has been allowed.at.for section a b ii to provide any protection to the creditor when the debtor chooses to retain her collateral,the secured claim must not be subject to modification throughout the life of the plan.id.at emphasis added.in nolan,this court found that the debtor proposed surrender and reclassification did not adequately protect a secured creditor because it allowed the debtor to shift the burden of depreciation she originally accepted when she chose to retain her collateral from herself to the secured creditor.this is especially unfair in those cases where the secured creditor has already borne the burden of depreciation resulting from a cram down of the secured claim over the creditor objection.the code cram down option displaces a secured creditor right to obtain immediate foreclosure upon a debtor default.assocs.commercial rash,d.
when a debtor surrenders the property,a creditor obtains it immediately,and is free to sell it and reinvest the proceeds if a debtor keeps the property and continues to use it,the creditor obtains at once neither the property nor its value and is exposed to double risks the debtor may again default and the property may deteriorate from extended use.
id.at.the adequate protection interest payments made to the secured creditor for retention of the collateral do not always offset these risks.see id.at.
in the present case,allowing a reclassification following a repossession caused by debtor default also would allow the debtor to shift the burden of depreciation back to the secured creditor,and possibly lead to a double reduction of debtor debt.therefore,we believe nolan ban against reclassifications equally applies to cases in which the debtor actions,default have provided cause for the secured creditor to have the automatic stay lifted so the creditor may repossess the collateral.
d.other court decisions that disagree with nolan 
we recognize that courts outside this circuit remain split on the issue following our decision in nolan those courts that have disagreed with nolan have done so for differing reasons.some courts simply disagree with nolan interpretation of section see,bank one,na,leuellen in re leuellen,in re knappen,in re townley.other courts agree that the language of section does not allow modifications that would reclassify a secured claim to an unsecured claim,but they disagreed with having a secured claim exist after the sale of the original collateral,pointing to section a characterization of an allowed claim as a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in such property.see,in re zieder,in re taylor,in re mason.these latter decisions have thus advocated using j to reconsider the secured claim.section j provides,in relevant part,a claim that has been allowed or disallowed may be reconsidered for cause.a reconsidered claim may be allowed or disallowed according to the equities of the case.j.
these cases,along with a number of cases that preceded our decision in nolan,see,in re johnson,hold that the deficiency from a sale of collateral can not be considered a secured claim and must be treated equally with other secured claims.in applying section j,these cases interpret the portion of that statute which provides that a claim that has been allowed or disallowed may be reconsidered for cause as permitting the court to reconsider the classification of a claim as secured or unsecured.if the request for reconsideration was made in good faith and led to an equitable result the court will generally reclassify the deficiency remaining on a secured claim as an unsecured claim see,johnson,at.
however,as one bankruptcy court has noted,the literal language of section j addresses only the allowance or disallowance of claims,not the reclassification of an claim.see coffman,at.therefore,we can not agree with the dissent recommendation that the case be remanded for consideration under section j.furthermore,the dissent view that a counsels a different result is not relevant to our reasoning.the dissent reliance on that section is made necessary only through the use of j,which we have stated is not applicable in this case.
another case cited by the trustee has allowed a reclassification of a secured claim following a sale of repossessed collateral without looking to either section or section j.see in re white.explicitly rejecting either provision and relying on what it termed as common sense,common law,and custom and practice,id.at,the white court found that t he lien that the secured creditor retains by virtue of a b is precisely what a lien is expected to be at common law.id.at.when a d motion to lift the automatic stay is properly made and granted,it is usually explicitly recognized and always implicitly recognized that the grant of the motion relegates the parties to their state law rights.id.at.therefore,the white court found that any deficiency resulting from the sale of repossessed collateral was automatically converted to an unsecured claim,that a creditor claims under the confirmation plan are deemed amended.id.at.
the white court,however,cited no authority for these holdings.we do not find it obvious that the secured creditor who retains a lien under section a b enjoys the same creditor rights he did prior to the debtor bankruptcy filing.see rash,at.in allowing chapter debtors to retain and use collateral over the objection of secured creditors,however,the code has reshaped debtor and creditor rights in marked departure from state law.moreover,the white court logic explicitly allows a secured creditor to retain any appreciated gain remaining from the sale of repossessed collateral,id.at,a result that no other court has recognized.see,nolan,at criticizing jock for creating an inequitable situation where the secured creditor could not seek to reclassify its claim in the event that collateral appreciated,even though the debtor could revalue or reclassify the claim whenever the collateral depreciated.emphasis in original.therefore,we do not find white persuasive.
we recognize the frustration certain commentators have with our allowing a secured claim to remain classified as secured following the sale of the underlying collateral however,as explained above,we find that there exists no provision in the code applicable to this case that would allow a reclassification of the deficiency given the binding effect of the confirmed plan under.therefore,in accordance with our prior decision in nolan,we find that where the debtor actions,default provide cause for lifting the automatic stay under section d,the debtor or trustee generally can not move to reclassify the deficiency resulting from the sale of the underlying repossessed collateral as an unsecured claim 
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the decision of the district court is affirmed.
because i do not believe that nolan is controlling in this instance,i respectfully dissent.in nolan,we held that a chapter debtor can not modify a confirmed plan under a by voluntarily surrendering the property securing the debt to the creditor,requiring the creditor sell that collateral and apply the sale proceeds toward its secured claim,and classifying any deficiency as an unsecured claim.chrysler fin.nolan in re nolan,cir.our decision in nolan was motivated by our belief that debtors should not have wide latitude to subject the creditor to their whims throughout the life of the plan nor the ability to reap a windfall by employing a subterfuge by unfairly shifting the costs of depreciation to the creditor.id.at.our holding in nolan was narrowly tailored to the particular facts and circumstances of that case,and therefore i disagree with the majority decision to extend its holding beyond those boundaries.because in this case the collateral was involuntarily taken from the debtor by the creditor conscious decision to seek relief from stay and to sell the collateral to satisfy its secured claim,i must dissent from the majority decision to extend nolan.see in re goos,stating that a sale may require a different legal analysis than a surrender.
our decision in nolan rejected a sizable minority of lower courts that followed the rationale set forth in in re jock,which allowed a debtor to initiate surrender of collateral and for any deficiency to be deemed an unsecured claim.in nolan we explained five fundamental deficiencies of following the jock line of cases in that situation,each of which stemmed from our concern about the debtor manipulation of the bankruptcy code to surrender the collateral after the collateral has depreciated,thereby unfairly shifting the risk of depreciation to the creditor.three of the deficiencies that necessitated our conclusion in nolan related to our disagreement with jock interpretation of.nolan,at.that provision of the code is not involved here.daimlerchrysler suggestion that a modification is implicitly at issue the trustee objection to its attempt to maintain a secured claim after the sale of the collateral is essentially an attempt to modify the plan without a formal not persuasive.appellee br.at.this case arose not from an attempted modification brought by the debtor or trustee through a motion,but rather from daimlerchrysler motion to lift the stay and its request therein that any deficiency be classified as a secured claim.unlike in nolan,where the creditor would have preferred to continue to receive payments for its secured claim through the plan rather than have the collateral sold,here the creditor was the party moving to initiate the sale.believing that its interests were not being adequately served through the plan,daimlerchrysler moved to lift the stay preventing it from repossessing the collateral,thus enabling it to pursue its remedies outside the plan.
the other two deficiencies cited in nolan were also specific to the surrender attempted in that case.there we were concerned that the debtor seeking a modification in those circumstances may contravene the requirements in a b and a that govern a plan confirmation and its res judicata effect.nolan,at.in this case,the debtor did not seek to surrender the collateral nor to disturb the confirmed plan.instead it was the creditor who decided its interests were better served by obtaining its remedies to repossess the collateral,and therefore the creditor moved to redeem its secured claim outside the plan.
in extending the holding in nolan to allow a creditor who initiated sale of the collateral to recover any deficiency as a secured claim,the majority entirely relieves the creditor of any obligation to protect its own interests against anticipated depreciation in its dealings.on the contrary,i believe that the creditor has the obligation to ensure that as time goes by and,as in this case,payments are not made and it repossesses the collateral,the value of the collateral when liquidated will equal the amount of the remaining claim.in re knappen.placing the risk of depreciation loss completely on the debtor,as the majority does 
denies that the creditor has an obligation to look out for its own interests,and invites unscrupulous creditors to argue value at their whim after the confirmation hearing.in effect,therefore,the creditor needs to assure that the plan provides for a stream of payments such that at any time the value of the collateral,subject to normal wear and tear,when returned to it and liquidated,will equal the remaining amount of the secured claim.
id.at.daimlerchrysler had the opportunity to object to confirmation of t
