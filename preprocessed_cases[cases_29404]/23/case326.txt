background 
procedural history 
on august,plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.plaintiff alleged defendant violated the fdcpa,specifically and.section of title of the united states code states a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.section of title of the united states code states a debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.
on february,defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.defendant motion was based on four grounds the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff claim because of the doctrine res judicata barred plaintiff claim defendant was absolutely immune for its actions and the fdcpa was inapplicable to defendant actions.on august,the district court denied defendant motion on all grounds.
on september,defendant timely appealed the district court order with respect to the issue of witness immunity.on september,defendant filed a motion with the district court to certify that the district court order involved a collateral order that was immediately appealable.on september,the district court denied the motion.
plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss defendant appeal and a motion for sanctions.on february,this court denied plaintiff motions.the court found that the district court denial of absolute immunity to defendant was a collateral order that was immediately appealable in the absence of a final judgment.
plaintiff is a resident of cincinnati,ohio.plaintiff sole source of income is social security insurance benefits,and he receives per month for himself.he also receives per month for each of his minor children.his wife is presently receiving disability payments for an injury she sustained.
in,plaintiff purchased furniture from value city,and plaintiff financed the purchase with a loan from itt financial services.plaintiff defaulted on the loan,and defendant brought suit on behalf of the creditor and obtained a judgment.defendant then initiated proceedings to garnish plaintiff bank account.in order to commence such a proceeding under ohio law,defendant must file an affidavit which states that the affiant has a reasonable basis to believe that the person named in the affidavit as the garnishee may have property,other than personal earnings,of the judgment debtor that is not exempt under the law of this state or the united states.ohio ann.on february,defendant submitted an affidavit that conformed to the ohio statute to the hamilton county municipal court.the court found that the affidavit was valid and froze the funds in plaintiff bank account.
on february,plaintiff requested a hearing to contend that the funds in his bank account were exempt because they derived from plaintiff social security benefits and his wife disability benefits.on february,the court held that the funds were exempt.
plaintiff contended that prior to submission of the affidavit,defendant did not conduct a debtor exam,did not undertake discovery as to whether plaintiff possessed assets,and otherwise had no factual basis for believing that plaintiff bank account contained assets.

a.the doctrine does not preclude this court subject matter.standard of review 
this court reviews questions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.green ameritech,cir.
this court has an independent obligation to determine whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction.olden lafarge,cir.that said,the doctrine does not divest this court of subject matter jurisdiction because the instant case is outside the scope of the doctrine.
legal framework 
in rooker fidelity trust,the plaintiffs filed an action in state court,and the state court ruled against the plaintiffs.the state supreme court affirmed the decision.id.the plaintiff then filed an action in federal district court alleging that the state court decision violated various federal constitutional provisions.id.at.the district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and the supreme court affirmed.id.at.the court found that federal district courts were only empowered with original jurisdiction,and that they did not have appellate jurisdiction to hear a claim that a state court decision was in error.id.at.only the supreme court had such appellate jurisdiction.id.
in district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d,the supreme court reiterated its decision in rooker.there,the plaintiff feldman was an individual who sought to practice law but did not graduate from an accredited law school.id.at.instead,he completed a structured program of the state of virginia where he studied in a practitioner office,audited classes at the university of virginia school of law,and served as a judicial clerk with a federal district court.id.the plaintiff passed the virginia bar examination and was admitted to that state bar.id.the plaintiff then sought admission to the bar of the district of columbia however,the district had a rule that limited bar membership to graduates of schools.the plaintiff filed a petition with the district of columbia court of appeals to waive the graduation requirement,and the state court denied the plaintiff petition.id.at.the plaintiff then filed a complaint in the federal district court challenging the state court decision.id.at.the plaintiff hickey had a similar experience he graduated from an unaccredited law school and petitioned the state court for waiver of the graduation requirement.id.at.the state court denied his petition,and the plaintiff filed suit in federal district court.
the supreme court found that the federal district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal from a state court judicial proceeding.id.at.as a result,the plaintiffs could not challenge the state court refusal to waive the graduation requirement in federal district court.id.at.the plaintiffs could,however,challenge the constitutionality of the graduation requirement itself in federal district court,as the state court promulgated the rule in a setting.id.at.the court also ruled that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim that the state court arbitrarily denied them a waiver of the rule the court reasoned that such a claim was inextricably intertwined with the state court judicial decisions in denying the plaintiffs petitions.id.at.
subsequent to these cases,the federal courts of appeals began to apply the doctrine to preclude federal subject matter jurisdiction in a wide variety of cases where the state court also asserted jurisdiction.because of the inconsistencies between the circuits,the supreme court addressed the scope of the doctrine in exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.
the supreme court in exxon mobil held that the doctrine applied only to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.id.at.exxon mobil dealt specifically with the case where there were parallel state and federal cases on the same issue.the court held that normal preclusion jurisprudence,not,would guide the federal court decision if the state court reached a decision first.id.at.in dicta,the court also addressed the circumstance where the plaintiff initiated a federal claim after a state court decision 
nor does stop a district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.if a federal plaintiff present s some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.
id.alteration in the original quoting gash assocs.vill.of rosemont,cir.
application to this case 
the doctrine does not preclude jurisdiction over plaintiff claim.defendant in the instant case claims this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the ohio state court decision that defendant affidavit was valid.this argument ignores the fact that plaintiff here does not complain of injuries caused by this state court judgment,as the plaintiffs did in rooker and feldman.instead,after the state court judgment,plaintiff filed an independent federal claim that plaintiff was injured by defendant when he filed a false affidavit.this situation was explicitly addressed by the exxon mobil court when it stated that even if the independent claim was inextricably linked to the state court decision,preclusion law was the correct solution to challenge the federal claim,not.see supra.while defendant is technically correct that this guidance was not essential to the holding on the facts of exxon mobil,as that case dealt with parallel state and federal proceedings,the supreme court went beyond the facts of the case to give clear instructions to the circuits on how to address additional factual situations.to follow the reasoning of defendant would be to ignore these unambiguous directives from the supreme court.
the court will not address the preclusive effect of the state court judgment,as this goes beyond the required jurisdictional determination and the issue on appeal.
b.the district court did not err when it denied absolute immunity to defendant 
standard of review 
this court reviews the district court decision denying defendant absolute immunity de novo.brookings clunk,cir citing barnes winchell,cir.
legal framework 
in briscoe lahue,the supreme court held that police officers were absolutely immune from suit for their testimony at trial,d.in reaching its decision,the court recited the history of the rule that private witnesses were absolutely immune from damages liability for their testimony in judicial proceedings.id.at.the rationale behind this absolute immunity was twofold first,witnesses might be reluctant to come forward to testify,id.at.second,those witnesses who came forward might distort their testimony because of fear of subsequent liability,id.the court found that the process is better served if the witness testimony is submitted to the crucible of the judicial process so that the factfinder may consider it,after,together with the other evidence in the case to determine where the truth lies.id.at.quoting imbler pachtman,d.
in malley briggs,the supreme court held that police officers were not absolutely immune from suit for seeking an arrest warrant based on deficient probable cause,d.the court found that the police officer resembled a complaining witness,and a complaining witness was liable at common law for making a complaint with malice and without probable cause.id.the court also rejected the argument that a police officer,when seeking an arrest warrant,makes a discretionary judgment similar to the absolutely protected judgment of a prosecutor seeking an indictment from a grand jury.id.at.referencing imbler,d.in reaching its decision,the court reasoned we intend no disrespect to the officer applying for a warrant by observing that his action,while a vital part of the administration of criminal justice,is further removed from the judicial phase of criminal proceedings than the act of a prosecutor in seeking an indictment.id.at.
the court went on to refine its complaining witness analysis in kalina fletcher,d.there,the state prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the defendant and filed three documents,two of which were unsworn,in support of the arrest warrant.id.at.under state law,an arrest warrant needed to be supported by sworn statements.id.at.in order to satisfy this requirement,she summarized the evidence supporting the charge,including the evidence in the unsworn statements,in a certification for determination of probable cause,and she personally vouched for the truth of the facts in the certification under penalty of perjury.id.at.the defendant challenged the prosecutor actions,as the certification in support of the warrant contained inaccurate factual statements.id.at.
the court began its analysis with the rule that in determining immunity,we examine the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it.id.at.quoting forrester white,d.the court found that as to the prosecutor actions in preparing and filing the two unsworn documents,the prosecutor was acting as an advocate of the state in the judicial process therefore,her actions were protected by absolute immunity.id.at.as to her attestation of the truth of the facts in the certification,the court found that the prosecutor was not protected by absolute immunity testifying about facts is the function of the witness,not of the lawyer.no matter how brief or succinct it may be,the evidentiary component of an application for an arrest warrant is a distinct and essential predicate for a finding of probable cause.id.at.the court found that the prosecutor thus acted as a complaining witness who lacked absolute immunity for the falsehoods in the certification.id.at.
in wyatt cole,d,the supreme court ruled that private defendants were not entitled to any form of immunity in claims.in that case,the plaintiff filed a state court complaint in replevin against his former business partner.id.at.under state law at the time,the plaintiff could obtain a court order for seizure of property possessed by another by posting a bond and swearing to a state court that the plaintiff was entitled to that property and that the adversary wrongfully took and detain ed or wrongfully detain ed the property.id.at.internal quotations and citation omitted.state law did not grant any discretion to the state judge he was forced to issue the order in replevin.id.after a hearing,the state court dismissed the plaintiff complaint in replevin and ordered the plaintiff to return the confiscated property to the defendant.when the plaintiff refused,the defendant sued the plaintiff in federal court,alleging,among other things,that the state replevin statute was unconstitutional and that the plaintiff and his attorney violated by using state law to unconstitutionally deprive him of his property.id.the district court found that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the constitutional protection of due process however,it found that the plaintiff and his attorney had qualified immunity for conduct arising prior to the statute invalidation.id.at.
the supreme court reversed.the court looked first at its garnishment,prejudgment attachment,and replevin cases,and found that private use of state laws could constitute state action under.id.at.citing lugar edmondson oil,d.the court then analogized the claim challenging the replevin action to claims of malicious prosecution and abuse of process.the court reiterated that in such cases,private party defendants did not have immunity 
respondents do not contend that private parties who instituted attachment proceedings and who were subsequently sued for malicious prosecution or abuse of process were entitled to absolute immunity.and with good reason although public prosecutors and judges were accorded absolute immunity at common law,such protection did not extend to complaining witnesses who,like respondents,set the wheels of government in motion by instigating a legal action.
id.at.internal citations omitted.the court found that while private party defendants at common law had a defense of good faith against claims of malicious prosecution and abuse of process,this defense did not equate to immunity in the context.id.at.citing harlow fitzgerald,d.
application to this case 
the district court correctly denied absolute immunity to defendant.the rationales of absolute immunity and the complaining witness analysis support this result.
i.congressional intent 
both plaintiff and defendant agree that congress did not intend to abrogate the absolute immunity of a witness when it enacted the fdcpa.this court agrees that nothing in the fdcpa itself or the legislative history of the act remotely suggests such an abrogation.the question then becomes whether defendant conduct falls under the protection of witness immunity.
ii.the affidavit as testimony 
this court agrees with defendant that testimony presented in the form of an affidavit may be protected under absolute witness immunity.see cruz kauai county,cir it is also true that,in this circuit,a person who functions as a witness in an adversarial proceeding to revoke a defendant bail is to be accorded absolute immunity for her testimony,even if the witness testimony is provided by way of affidavit.citation omitted emphasis removed thomason scan volunteer,cir to the extent wordlaw and scan are sued because wordlaw made arguably false statements in her affidavit in her role as a witness before the state court,the doctrine of absolute witness immunity applies.giffin summerlin,cir the policy considerations underlying witness immunity for testimony in open court apply with equal force to other forms of testimony such as depositions and affidavits.citations omitted.we find that the form of the witness testimony should not affect the status of the immunity attached thereto.
iii.ex parte nonadversarial proceedings 
plaintiff argues that defendant should not receive absolute witness immunity for its affidavit because the affidavit was submitted in an ex parte,nonadversarial proceeding.under ohio law,defendant can initiate a garnishment proceeding by filing the affidavit described,supra,with the state court.ohio ann.the state court then binds the garnished property until a hearing so that the garnishee may not use the property.ohio ann.ohio law does not allow plaintiff to challenge defendant affidavit when it is submitted it only allows a challenge at a hearing after the property has already been bound.ohio ann.plaintiff contends that defendant should not receive absolute immunity for its affidavit because there were no procedural safeguards in insuring the veracity of the affidavit at the time it was submitted,due to the ex parte,nonadversarial nature of the initiation of garnishment proceedings under ohio law.
in support of its contention that the touchstone of witness immunity is the adversarial nature of the proceeding,plaintiff cites several cases of other circuits.in cruz kauai county,the ninth circuit found that a prosecutor affidavit supporting revocation of the defendant bail was not entitled to absolute immunity because the affidavit was submitted at an ex parte proceeding.at.while the court also based its decision on the fact that the prosecutor acted as a complaining witness,it focused its analysis on the fact that the prosecutor functioned as a witness in an ex parte proceeding,at which the defendant did not enjoy the protections of the adversary process.id.in contrast,the ninth circuit found absolute immunity applicable to an affidavit in burns county of king precisely because the proceeding where the affidavit was submitted was adversarial 
although the opportunity for is absent in this case,since the defendant testimony was presented in the form of an affidavit,the plaintiff was nevertheless afforded all the other protections of the adversary process and judicial supervision the plaintiff was entitled to present affidavits and witnesses of his own to refute the statements made by the defendant.under these circumstances,we conclude that the rationale underlying briscoe requires that the defendant be accorded absolute immunity for her statements to the court.
likewise,the fifth circuit found that a report prepared by an expert witness that supported probable cause for an arrest was not entitled to absolute immunity.in keko hingle,the court began its analysis with the notion that the supreme court has subsequently bounded absolute immunity within the precise confines of adversarial judicial proceedings,cir citations omitted.the court found that absolute immunity did not apply to the expert report submitted in an ex parte probable cause hearing we decline to extend absolute witness immunity into an arena where the supreme court had not found factual testimony to justify such heightened protection.id.at.the court expressly based its decision on this fact,and not on the complaining witness theory,as it declined to address that factual question on a motion for summary judgment.id.
in curtis bembenek,the seventh circuit applied a similar analysis to the testimony of a police officer at two separate hearings,cir.the court found that the policy considerations for granting absolute immunity to witnesses testifying at trial apply with equal force to witness testimony in adversarial pretrial settings.id.citation omitted.because the police officer testimony at both hearings was made under oath and subject to,w e see no principled basis for distinguishing between adversarial pretrial proceedings and the trial on the merits in determining whether absolute immunity should be granted to a police officer witness.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.
in sykes james,the second circuit found that the petitioner parole officer was absolutely immune for an affidavit submitted in the petitioner habeas proceeding,cir.the court stressed that 
a habeas corpus proceeding brought under the pertinent new york statute is surrounded by all the judicial process safeguards although is not available,all the other protections of the judicial process were afforded to the petitioner the proceeding was adversarial in nature it was conducted by a judicial officer who rendered the final decision and it was subject to judicial review.moreover,the affidavit oath subjected the parole officer to the penalty of perjury if the affidavit were false the petitioner had the opportunity to present affidavits of his own and testimony could have been taken if the judge considered it necessary.
id.the court then distinguished malley,as that case involved an ex parte hearing.id.citing malley,d.
while plaintiff proposed inquiry of for questions of absolute immunity is viscerally appealing,considering the ease of its application and its partial support in the rationale of briscoe,it is ultimately unviable.we agree with the cited cases insofar as they stand for the proposition that witness testimony at an adversarial proceeding is entitled to absolute immunity,because this proposition is supported by the rationale in briscoe that witness immunity,coupled with the crucible of the judicial process,is the path that would best lead to the ascertainment of truth.see briscoe,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.
we do not agree,however,that the nonadversarial nature of a proceeding automatically precludes applicability of absolute immunity to witness testimony given at such a proceeding.one glaring example not mentioned by either plaintiff or defendant is witness testimony in grand jury proceedings.a grand jury proceeding is the quintessential form of an ex parte,nonadversarial proceeding where many of the procedural safeguards of a trial do not exist.despite this fact,most circuits,including this circuit,have held that absolute witness immunity applies to witness testimony before a grand jury.see grant hollenbach,cir citing macko byron,cir see also lyles sparks,cir frazier bailey,cir anthony baker,cir little city of seattle,cir strength hubert,cir,overruled on other grounds by albright oliver,d san filippo trust,cir kincaid eberle,cir briggs goodwin.most circuits have found that the briscoe rationale of encouraging truthful testimony at trial applies with equal force to testimony before a grand jury additionally,several circuits have explained that at common law,a witness is absolutely immune for grand jury testimony.see,kincaid,at.these cases demonstrate that the delineation proposed by plaintiff is untenable.
the question then becomes what the proper inquiry actually should be.we find that a reviewing court should look at the twin rationales listed in briscoe insuring that a witness is unafraid of providing testimony,and,when the witness testifies,insuring that the witness is not impermissibly pressured to alter her testimony.at.additionally,a reviewing court should look to the common law to determine whether immunity was available in specific instances.
iv.briscoe rationales 
the briscoe court gave two rationales in support of the common law immunity for witness testimony witnesses might be reluctant to come forward to testify without such immunity and once a witness is on the stand,his testimony might be distorted by the fear of subsequent liability.at.neither of these rationales applies to this case.
after obtaining a default judgment on behalf of its client creditor,defendant sought some mechanism to extract funds from plaintiff to satisfy this judgment defendant chose garnishment.as explained,supra,under ohio law,in order to garnish plaintiff property,defendant was required to file an affidavit which stated that it had a reasonable basis to believe that the property was.the focus,then,is on the incentives of defendant in connection with this affidavit.
with respect to the first rationale,this court finds it difficult to believe that defendant would be reluctant to come forward to testify without absolute immunity.defendant is responsible to its client the client in this case enlisted defendant to obtain money from plaintiff.in such circumstances,defendant is unlikely to disobey its client,nor will defendant ordinarily refuse to take future creditor clients,without absolute immunity for its affidavit.the lack of absolute immunity may increase defendant costs of collecting a debt on behalf of a creditor defendant may actually be forced to obey ohio law and conduct some sort of preliminary investigation of a debtor assets to determine whether they are exempt.this increase in costs,however,will not be a disincentive for defendant to pursue actions of garnishment.this cost can simply be passed on to the client moreover,because all attorney debt collectors would have the same incentive to make this preliminary investigation,defendant competitive position would not be harmed by denying absolute immunity for its affidavit.in short,ohio law requires a procedural safeguard that does increase the cost of pursuing a garnishment action however,because garnishment actions will remain profitable for the attorney debt collector and its client,this court has no doubt that the attorney debt collector will continue to bring such actions.defendant financial interest will overcome any reluctance to come forward based on the lack of absolute immunity the same can not be said,for example,for a witness who has no interest in the outcome of a criminal case.
briscoe second rationale is equally inapplicable.the supreme court in briscoe was cognizant of a witness fear of being completely candid without absolute immunity the witness might be inclined to shade his testimony,to magnify uncertainties,and thus to deprive the finder of fact of candid,objective,and undistorted evidence.at.here,the possibility to introduce such variability into defendant testimony was limited.the affidavit made one and only one statement that defendant had a reasonable basis to believe that certain property of plaintiff was.of course,defendant and plaintiff may disagree as to whether defendant had such reasonable basis for example,plaintiff may claim that a preliminary investigation made by defendant was insufficient.this,however,is beside the point of briscoe.the focus is on the testimony itself,not on the factual basis of the testimony.with the affidavit,defendant has no room to shade its testimony,to magnify uncertainties,to distort the evidence defendant can not say that it might have a reasonable basis,or that there is a possibility that it does not have a reasonable basis.defendant can not be equivocal in its affidavit it states that it either has a reasonable basis or it does not.in other words,defendant,even if it has an incentive to play it safe with ambiguous language because of a lack of absolute immunity,it has no ability to do so,as defendant must make the definitive statement that it has a reasonable basis.thus,defendant will not have to fear repercussion from a disgruntled opponent over the meaning and implication of every sworn word,as the battle will not be fought over semantics so much as the substance of the testimony.
the fact that defendant has to be unequivocal in the affidavit without the protection of absolute immunity will not cause defendant to cease submitting these affidavits and to stop seeking garnishment actions,as this would be wholly contrary to defendant financial interests.instead,defendant will have the incentive to conduct some sort of investigation or have some other reasonable basis for its affidavit,as required by ohio law.
v.common law 
most states recognize some cause of action to address a plaintiff claim of improper garnishment 
where an order of attachment or garnishment is improperly obtained or tortiously employed,the defendant in the proceedings may have several modes of obtaining redress for injuries caused thereby.he may proceed on the attachment or garnishment bond,if one has been given,sue for malicious or wrongful attachment or garnishment,or maintain an action for abuse of process or malicious prosecution 
d attachment and garnishment.as with the tort of malicious prosecution,two of the necessary elements of a cause of action for wrongful garnishment are an absence of probable cause for such proceeding,and the presence of legal malice,which may be inferred entirely from a lack of probable cause.burshan union fire ins,so d,quoting adams whitfield,so d.one court has stated that w hether a garnishment is wrongful depends upon whether the steps taken by the parties seeking the writ comply with the statute authorizing such relief.chandler cashway.materials,paso.
in addition,certain states have explicitly ruled that a cause of action for wrongful garnishment may arise from the garnishment of exempt property.owens deutch,grimestad lofgren,rice chase.see generally d attachment and garnishment.one state has ruled that a single instance of garnishment of exempt property does not amount to abuse of process,but multiple instances may be sufficient.layton chase.
the case law cited above demonstrates that states have allowed claims where a plaintiff alleges an improper garnishment,whether the claim is one of malicious prosecution,abuse of process,or wrongful garnishment.this includes a claim that the defendant improperly garnished exempt property.the defendant is not entitled to absolute immunity to counter these claims instead,he has the defenses of probable cause and lack of malice.this common law backdrop generally indicates that defendant would not be absolutely immune from suit for an improper garnishment.
the question then becomes whether defendant,although not immune from suit,should receive absolute immunity for the statements he made in the affidavit.from the supreme court precedent previously discussed,this court draws several rules 
a private witness testifying at trial is absolutely immune for her testimony 
a private witness testifying at a grand jury is absolutely immune for her testimony 
a private witness testifying as a complaining witness has no immunity for her testimony.
this court finds that defendant is a complaining witness in wyatt,the supreme court ruled that although public prosecutors and judges were accorded absolute immunity at common law,such protection did not extend to complaining witnesses who,like respondents,set the wheels of government in motion by instigating a legal action.at.citation omitted.here,defendant instigated the legal action of garnishment and set the wheels of government in motion.in order to do so,defendant swore to the truth of a certain set of facts,it had reasonable belief that the target property of the garnis
