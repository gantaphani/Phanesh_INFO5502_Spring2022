debbie donohue appeals the district court order denying her motions and granting summary judgment to quick collect,quick collect dismissing all of her claims.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
donohue was a customer of a pediatric dental practice called the children choice children choice located in spokane,washington.children choice has an office financial policy outlining customers payment obligations,which donohue signed in.the policy states,in pertinent part,as follows i understand that all services are due to be paid in full within ninety days of date of service a finance charge of per month will be applied to all accounts over days 
in october,children choice assigned to quick collect,a collection service incorporated in oregon,the principal and finance charges donohue owed to children choice.upon receipt of the assignment,quick collect mailed a formal demand letter to donohue seeking in principal,in assigned interest,and in post assigned interest.quick collect did not immediately receive a response from donohue and referred the matter to attorney gregory nielson to commence litigation to collect the amounts due.
in january,quick collect brought an action against donohue and donohue was served with a summons and complaint the complaint.the complaint stated that quick collect sought a judgment against donohue for,among other amounts,the sum of,together with interest thereon of per annum in the amount of.in february,nielson,on behalf of quick collect,sent another demand letter to donohue the nielson demand letter.the nielsen demand letter stated that donohue owed,in addition to costs,for principal,and for interest.
in april,donohue filed a lawsuit in washington state court against quick collect.donohue brought the following two federal claims quick collect violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa by charging a usurious rate of,the complaint and the nielsen demand letter sought annual interest above,the maximum permitted under washington law and quick collect violated the fdcpa prohibition against the use of false,deceptive,or misleading statements in connection with collecting a debt by misrepresenting the amount of interest,the complaint incorrectly stated that was interest on the principal of per annum.donohue also alleged violations of washington state law arising out of the same events.
the action was removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of washington and quick collect moved for summary judgment on all of donohue claims.donohue thereafter for partial summary judgment as to quick collect liability,moved to certify the class,and moved to strike quick collect motion for summary judgment.
faced with these conflicting motions,on december,the district court granted summary judgment to quick collect dismissing donohue claims,and denied donohue motions.the district court concluded as follows as to donohue two fdcpa claims quick collect,through the complaint and the nielsen demand letter,did not charge a usurious interest rate and so did not violate the fdcpa and the complaint accurately set forth the total sum donohue owed and was not false,deceptive,or misleading under the fdcpa.because quick collect did not violate the fdcpa,the district court concluded that donohue could not succeed on her claims either.donohue timely appeals.
we review de novo the district court interpretation of the fdcpa and its rulings on for summary judgment.see clark capital credit collection,cir.seeking somewhat to level the playing field between debtors and debt collectors,the fdcpa prohibits debt collectors from making false or misleading representations and from engaging in various abusive and unfair practices.heintz.jenkins.the fdcpa is a strict liability statute that makes debt collectors liable for violations that are not knowing or intentional.reichert credit,cir.
the two fdcpa provisions at issue in this case are and.section prohibits the use by a debt collector of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.section prohibits t he false representation of the character,amount,or legal status of any debt.section prohibits a debt collector from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.the collection of any amount unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law is a violation of.whether conduct violates or requires an objective analysis that takes into account whether the least sophisticated debtor would likely be misled by a communication.see guerrero rjm acquisitions llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
first,donohue claims that quick collect,through the nielsen demand letter and the complaint,violated the particular and charging more than annual interest in contravention of washington usury law.washington law prohibits charging more than annual interest for the loan or forbearance of any money,goods,or things in action.donohue calculates that the nielsen demand letter sought an interest payment of for a period of days,for an effective annual interest rate of,and that the complaint sought an interest payment of for a period of days,for an effective annual interest rate of.
quick collect contends that these interest amounts in the nielsen demand letter and the complaint are largely comprised of finance charges assessed by children choice,and that the assessment by children choice of the finance charges to donohue overdue account does not implicate the usury statute because there is no loan or forbearance under washington law.quick collect argues that,setting aside those finance charges,the interest it charged did not exceed.donohue replies that,under children choice office financial policy,the grace period during which payment is due before a finance charge is applied is consistent with a forbearance and therefore the finance charges must be considered interest.whether quick collect charged a usurious interest rate,therefore,turns on whether or not the finance charges assessed by children choice pursuant to its office financial policy constitute a forbearance under washington law.
the leading washington state supreme court case on the definition of forbearance under washington law is whitaker spiegel,which concerned a financial arrangement between consumers and a retailer called a revolving charge account.after consumers made an initial purchase,the purchase price of subsequently purchased items,if there was an unpaid balance,would be added to the existing balance as one account.id.the whitaker court defined a forbearance as a contractual obligation of a lender or creditor to refrain,during a given period of time,from requiring the borrower or debtor to pay a loan or debt then due and payable.id.at quoting hafer spaeth.the washington state supreme court applied this definition and concluded that the revolving charge account was a forbearance 
the relationship between the respondents and appellant is clearly that of debtor and creditor.respondents are indebted to appellant upon delivery of the goods and acceptance of them.appellant,by its credit agreement,has agreed to refrain from immediately requiring respondents or any other debtors to pay their debts.in return,respondents have agreed to pay a constant service charge percentage which is applied against a changeable balance.
the reasoning of whitaker makes clear that children choice payment arrangement,unlike a revolving charge account such as was considered in whitaker,does not constitute a forbearance under washington law.children choice did not have a contractual obligation to refrain,during a given period of time,from requiring donohue to pay a loan or debt then due and payable.id.emphasis added.instead,payment was due to be paid in full within ninety days of service.children choice was free to enforce the requirement of payment any time after the ninety days in which payment was finally due.donohue notes that washington law requires that courts look through the form of the transaction and consider its substance.id.but the substance here is late fees assessed to encourage timely choice did not agree
