tim mccollough,a former school custodian,opened a credit card account with chemical bank sometime around.chemical bank merged with the chase manhattan bank chase manhattan in and continued business under the chase manhattan name.mccollough continued to make purchases on the account.
mccollough and his wife fell behind on their credit card bills after he allegedly suffered a brain injury at work and she underwent surgery.when mccollough made his last payment on the chase manhattan account in,an unpaid balance of approximately remained.in,chase manhattan charged off the account on its books.
collect america,collect america through its subsidiary,cacv of colorado,cacv,is a purchaser of bad debt,debts that have been charged off by the primary lender.cacv purchases the debts collect america attempts collection.
in,cacv purchased mccollough delinquent account from chase manhattan.cacv sued mccollough in for in state court to collect the debt.acting pro se,mccollough replied that the statute of limitations is up.two weeks later,cacv dismissed the case.cacv documented service of the complaint and mccollough response in its electronic files.
in,collect america retained jrl,a law firm specializing in debt collection,to pursue collection of mccollough outstanding debt.although jrl is a north dakota law firm,some of its lawyers are admitted to practice in montana.charles denby was the jrl attorney who handled the law firm collection cases for montana.during the period from january through july,jrl filed collection lawsuits in montana.on an average day,jrl filed five lawsuits in the state on one day,jrl filed lawsuits.jrl attorney lisa lauinger testified that approximately of the collection lawsuits resulted in a default judgment.
the contract between jrl and collect america contained the following disclaimer collect america makes no warranty as to the accuracy or validity of data provided.in addition,the contract expressly made jrl responsible to determine its legal and ethical ability to collect these accounts.cacv transmitted information about mccollough account to jrl using debt collection software.cacv also sent the law firm the electronic file.
the law firm screening procedures flagged a statute of limitations problem with mccollough debt.on january,jrl account manager grace lauinger wrote to cacv it appears that the statute of limitations has expired on this file as of august.if you can provide us with an instrument in writing to extend the statute of limitations.the next day,jrl recorded in the electronic file that no demand has gone out on this file this is the collect america batch that we are having problems w ith.
on january,cacv responded to jrl attorney lisa lauinger in an email entitled sol extended that mccollough had made a partial payment on june,and inquired do you need any info from me on this one based on that payment date,the statute of limitations on the claim against mccollough would not have expired until.see.bank of denver story,holding that montana statute of limitation on an account stated commences running from the date of the last payment.
however,the information was incorrect mccollough had not made a partial payment on june.rather,as reflected in the electronic file,the event that took place on june,was the return of court costs to cacv for a collection complaint and summons that cacv had prepared in.lisa lauinger did not respond to cacv offer to provide additional documentation of the event.
on april,jrl filed a collection complaint signed by jrl attorney charles dendy against mccollough in montana state court.the complaint sought judgment for an account balance of,interest of,attorney fees of,and court costs of.
dendy later testified that he reviewed the information in the electronic file before filing suit.at that point,the electronic file indicated the date a june,entry indicating the return of court costs an entry showing that cacv had previously sued mccollough and an entry indicating that mccollough had pled a statute of limitations defense in response.dendy admitted that he made no inquiry into whether a partial payment occurred on june.instead,he explained in this case i relied upon the information that was provided by the client.
on june,mccollough filed a pro se answer to the complaint,asserting a statute of limitations defense 
forgive my spelling i have a head injury and writing dose not come easy 
the stacut of limitacion is up,i have not had any dealings with any credited card in well over years 
i am disabled i get a month 
when workers comp stoped paying i ran out of money,chase would not work with me,they passed it on to collector they lied to me,they insulted me,they used bad language,they called around the clock,so i could not rest,they got me so wound up and confused the healing of my head injury stoped they were hurting me,so i had to stop dealing with them so i could recover,im still recovering.the pain they cossed and new med bills are worth more then the money they want.
this is the thired time they have brought me to court on this account,when will it stop do i have to sue them so i can live quietly in pain 
one month later,mccollough also telephoned dendy and left a message indicating that he would be seeking summary judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations.
dendy noted on july,w e need to get what the client has for docs on hand.the following day,grace lauinger sent an email to collect america asking for documentation.collect america responded b ecause of the age of the account,we ca get any more statements other than what has been sent to you.dendy continued to prosecute the suit.
on august,cacv informed grace lauinger that mccollough had not made a partial payment on june,as previously stated rather,the entry on that date was actually unused costs by another office,not payment.grace lauinger testified that she scanned the email into the electronic file to which dendy had access and that she did not recall whether she directly conveyed the new information to dendy.dendy testified that he did not learn of this information until later.he continued to prosecute the suit.
in october,dendy served on mccollough a list of requests for admission that included the following 
prior to initiation of this suit,defendant tim mccollough has never notified plaintiff or any other party in interest in this action of any disputes regarding said chase manhattan bank credit card.
there are no facts upon which defendant tim mccollough relies as a basis for defense in this action.
every statement or allegation contained in plaintiff complaint is true and correct.
defendant tim mccollough made a payment on said chase manhattan bank credit card on or about june,in the amount of.
the requests for admission did not include an explanation that,under montana rule of civil procedure a,the requests would be deemed admitted if mccollough did not respond within thirty days.
mccollough retained counsel and timely denied all of the requests.continuing to prosecute the collection case,dendy issued a subpoena to chase in november seeking production of the operative records from mccollough account.chase responded a month later that it had no records of the account.
on december,dendy sent to cacv an email marked urgent.the email read 
an attorney has appeared in this action and has served discovery requests 
the attorney is one who is anti purchased debt and who attempts to run up costs in an attempt to secure a large cost award against plaintiff 
please provide me with copies of everything you can get for documentation as soon as possible.we need to request everything available from the original creditor,not just the things that you normally request.application,statements,cardmember agreement,copies of payments,copies of correspondence.please have the requests expedited if possible.
cacv emailed in response 
for this file we are not able to get any more media.the retention rate is seven years from,which was.i have sent you all the docs we have.
cacv also called jrl to explain that the last payment mccollough had made on the account preceded the.
that afternoon,cacv instructed dendy to dismiss the suit asap because of the sol problem.jrl then moved for dismissal with prejudice and the state court dismissed the action.
mccollough sued jrl in federal district court alleging violations of the fdcpa and the mcpa,along with state law claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.
on for summary judgment,the district court found that the following facts were established 
on april,jrl filed a lawsuit against mccollough.
by august,jrl had information from its client demonstrating that the lawsuit was.
jrl prosecuted the lawsuit against mccollough until december.
the district court granted mccollough partial summary judgment on his fdcpa claims.
the case was then tried to a jury over the course of three days.at trial,lay witnesses keri henan and ken lucero testified about their experiences being sued by jrl.michael eakin,a consumer law attorney with montana legal services,testified about the rapid growth of lawsuits in montana and about jrl role in that trend he also testified that a vast majority of jrl lawsuits against debtors result in default judgments because jrl tries its cases without consideration for the pro se status of most of its.james patten,a montana collection lawyer,described the importance of reasonable investigation and testified that it was jrl factory approach of mass producing default judgments,rather than any mistake,that caused jrl to prosecute the debt and pursue unlawful attorney fees against mccollough.
the jury found in favor of mccollough on all remaining claims and awarded him the statutory maximum for violations of the fdcpa for emotional distress and in punitive damages.
jrl filed motions for a new trial and amendment of the judgment to reduce the emotional distress damage award.when the district court denied these motions,jrl timely appealed.
the district court properly granted summary judgment against jrl on the fdcpa claims.the fdcpa prohibits debt collectors from engaging in various abusive and unfair practices.see heintz jenkins.the statute was enacted to eliminate abusive debt collection practices to ensure that debt collectors who abstain from such practices are not competitively disadvantaged and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers.e jerman carlisle,mcnellie,rini,kramer ulrich lpa.the statute defines a debt collector as one who regularly collects debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another,and covers lawyers who regularly collect debts through litigation,heintz,at.
although the fdcpa is a strict liability statute,it excepts from liability those debt collectors who satisfy the narrow bona fide error defense.reichert credit,cir quotation omitted.that defense provides that 
a debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under the fdcpa if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.
c.the bona fide error defense is an affirmative defense,for which the debt collector has the burden of proof.reichert,at citing fox citicorp.credit servs,cir.thus,to qualify for the bona fide error defense,the defendant must prove that it violated the fdcpa unintentionally the violation resulted from a bona fide error and it maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the violation.
the district court correctly concluded that jrl bona fide error defense failed as a matter of law.jrl argues that it maintained adequate preventive procedures by utilizing a system to flag potential statute of limitations problems.however,the procedures that support a valid bona fide error defense must be reasonably adapted to avoid the specific error at issue.reichert,at quoting johnson riddle,cir.jrl error in this case was not its failure to catch cases indeed,jrl initially spotted the limitations period problem and sent a letter to cacv requesting an instrument in writing to extend the limitations period.instead,jrl erred by relying without verification on cacv representation and by overlooking contrary information in its electronic file.jrl thus presented no evidence of procedures designed to avoid the specific errors that led to its filing and maintenance of a collection suit against mccollough.jenkins heintz,cir debt collectors maintained extensive systems and elaborate procedures to avoid collecting unauthorized charges,and insist ed that their client s verify under oath that each of the charges was true and correct.
jrl contends that its reliance on cacv representation about a june,partial payment created a question of fact for the jury on its bona fide error defense.however,the bona fide error defense does not protect a debt collector whose reliance on a creditor representation is unreasonable.reichert,at citing clark capital credit collection,cir.unwarranted reliance on a client is not a procedure to avoid error.indeed,in reichert,we held that t he fact that the creditor provided accurate information in the past can not,in and of itself,establish that reliance in the present case was reasonable and act as a substitute for the maintenance of adequate procedures to avoid future mistakes.at see also turner,cir suggesting that one reasonable preventive measure to avoid mistakes is an agreement with that debts are current turner,d,on remand from the seventh circuit in the above cited case,determining that an understanding agreement that the client would only furnish reliable information would have been necessary to showing reasonable reliance.
the undisputed evidence established that jrl reliance on cacv email was unreasonable as a matter of law.first,collect america contract with jrl expressly disclaimed the accuracy or validity of data provided and instructed that jrl was responsible to determine its legal and ethical ability to collect the account.second,the electronic file confirmed that the event that took place on june,was the return of unused costs rather than a partial payment.third,the electronic file also indicated that mccollough had asserted a statute of limitations defense to a collection action filed against him in over the same debt.finally,mccollough informed jrl that the debt fell outside the limitations period both in his answer to jrl complaint and in a phone call.
for these reasons,the district court properly concluded that jrl reliance on its client was unreasonable as a matter of law.hyman tate,cir reliance was reasonable where debt collector and had understanding that client would not forward accounts in bankruptcy error was made in of cases and debt collector immediately ceased collection efforts upon notice from debtor of the mistake smith transworld,cir the fdcpa does not require an independent investigation of the debt referred for collection where,for example,the debt collector referral form,completed and signed by the,include d specific instructions to claim only amounts legally due and owing.the district court properly granted summary judgment on jrl bona fide error defense.
the district court did not err in granting mccollough motion for summary judgment on his claim that jrl violated the fdcpa by requesting attorney fees in its underlying state collection complaint.
jrl does not dispute the district court determination that the pursuit of unauthorized attorney fees in a collection suit violates both and of the fdcpa.section prohibits the use of unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt,including t he collection of any amount including any interest,fee,charge,or expense unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.see reichert,at violation of arising from a debt collector imposition of an unlawful charge for attorney fees.
section prohibits the use of any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt,including t he false representation of a the character,amount,or legal status of any debt or b any compensation which may be lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt.see clark,at possible violation of arising from misstatement of an account balance foster dbs collection agency,d,holding debt collectors violated by seeking attorney fees not permitted by state law strange wexler,same.
jrl argues that the district court erred in two respects.first,jrl characterizes the district court decision as holding that it violated the fdcpa by requesting attorney fees without having proof of its entitlement to those fees at the time it filed the complaint.in support,jrl cites the sixth circuit opinion in harvey great seneca fin,cir,which held that no fdcpa violation occurs when a creditor files a valid debt collection action in court without having in its possession adequate proof of its claim.however,in contrast to harvey,jrl collection action in this case was invalid because jrl presented no admissible evidence establishing its entitlement to collect the fees at the time of the summary judgment at the time it filed suit.
second,jrl argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because a genuine issue of material fact existed over whether jrl had a contractual to seek attorney fees from mccollough.before the district court,jrl presented a credit card agreement purportedly belonging to mccollough.jrl now admits that the agreement was not mccollough and does not contest the district court exclusion of the evidence.
jrl contends that it presented evidence that attorney fees are permitted under all cardmember agreements,even if it was not able to obtain mccollough specific agreement.jrl argues that its failure to produce a cardmember agreement applicable to mccollough was not fatal,and that the issue should have gone to the jury for its determination as to whether mccollough agreement contained such a provision.
the district court correctly concluded that jrl failed to meet its burden to show a genuine issue for trial because it presented no admissible evidence of a contract authorizing a fee award.the fdcpa prohibits t he collection of any amount unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.emphasis added.jrl produced no evidence of express authorization of its fee request from mccollough the presentation of generic evidence that all credit cards contain attorney fees provisions was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for the jury.the district court correctly granted summary judgment on the claim.
the district court properly held that jrl requests for admission violated the fdcpa as a matter of law.
as a threshold matter,jrl contends that the fdcpa should not be read to cover discovery procedures such as requests for admission although jrl concedes that the fdcpa covers both the filing of complaints,donohue quick collect,cir,and the service of settlement letters during the course of litigation,heintz,at.our precedents do not support such a distinction.rather,the fdcpa applies to the litigating activities of lawyers.heintz,at.the supreme court reasoning in heintz was twofold.first,the court reasoned that lawyers who collect debts through litigation plainly fall within the statutory language defining debt collector s to include those who regularly collec t or attemp t to collect,directly or indirectly,consumer debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.id.quoting alterations in original.second,the court observed that an earlier version of the fdcpa provided an exemption for lawyers,but that congress had since repealed that exemption.see id.at,f,stat,exempting from the definition of the term debt collector any collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of and in the name of a client,stat.repealing the exemption see also a f listing current exceptions to the definition of debt collector,none of which cover attorneys.
we have reached similar conclusions in two cases.first,in the case of fox,we held that the fdcpa applies to attorneys engaged in purely legal activities and thus covers the filing of an application for a writ of garnishment.see at see also id.at there is simply no mention of attorneys in the current definition of debt collector or its exceptions nor is there any distinction drawn between legal and activities.more recently,in donohue,we applied heintz and held that the fdcpa covers the service upon a debtor of a complaint to facilitate efforts.at.we reasoned in donohue that t o limit the litigation activities that may form the basis of fdcpa liability to exclude complaints would require a nonsensical narrowing of the common understanding of the word litigation.id.at rejecting a distinction between lawyers acting in the capacity of debt collectors and those litigating.there is no principled distinction to be drawn between these types of litigation activities and written discovery.
our sister circuits agree.the fourth circuit has held that the fdcpa applies specifically to statements in written discovery documents.see sayyed wolpoff abramson,cir holding that the fdcpa applies to allegedly erroneous statements made by the defendant law firm in interrogatories and a summary judgment motion during the course of a state court collection suit collecting cases.
jrl asserts that failure to exclude discovery procedures from fdcpa coverage would hinder attorneys ability to litigate cases.instead,jrl contends that remedies for improper discovery tactics lie in court rules for civil procedure,and asserts that if its requests for admission complied with the applicable state rules,they ought not subject it to liability under the fdcpa.however,congress enacted the fdcpa expressly because prior laws for redressing abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices were inadequate to protect consumers.a,b.the statute preempts state laws to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of the fdcpa.
moreover,policy reasoning provides no authority to override the clear statutory language of congress.o ur obligation is to apply the statute as congress wrote it.hubbard united states,quotation omitted see jerman.at finding it unremarkable that the fdcpa imposes some constraints on a lawyer advocacy on behalf of a client sayyed,at concluding that,by a simple reading of its text,the fdcpa covers litigation activities,including discovery fox,at the plain language of the statute unambiguously precludes any continued doctrine of special treatment for attorneys under the fdcpa.see also heintz,at allowing for the possibility that the fdcpa may contain some additional,implicit,exception s to account for the potential conflicts that may arise in the application of the fdcpa to litigation activities.in short,the fdcpa does not exclude from its coverage the service of requests for admission.
the district court correctly held that jrl service of false requests for admission violated the fdcpa as a matter of law.the fdcpa prohibits a debt collector from using either unfair or unconscionable means to collect any debt,or any false,deceptive,or misleading means in connection with the collection of any debt,id.the fdcpa measures a debt collector behavior according to an objective least sophisticated debtor standard.clark,at.this standard ensure s that the fdcpa protects all consumers,the gullible as well as the shrewd the ignorant,the unthinking,and the credulous.id.quoting clomon jackson,cir alteration and ellipsis in original.the fdcpa imposes strict liability on creditors,including liability for violations that are not knowing or intentional.reichert,at.
jrl requests for admission asked mccollough to admit facts that were not true that he had never disputed the debt,that he had no defense,that every statement in jrl complaint was true,and that he had actually made a payment on or about june.jrl had information in its possession that demonstrated the untruthfulness of the requested admissions.
the requests for admission did not include an explanation that,under montana rule of civil procedure a,the requests would be deemed admitted if mccollough did not respond within thirty days.because we consider the debt collector conduct from the standpoint of the least sophisticated debtor,we must conclude that the service of requests for admission containing false information upon a pro se defendant without an explanation that the requests would be deemed admitted after thirty days constitutes unfair or unconscionable or false,deceptive,or misleading means to collect a debt.here,jrl effectively requested that mccollough admit jrl entire case against him and concede all defenses.the least sophisticated debtor can not be expected to anticipate that a response within thirty days was required to prevent the court from deeming the requests admitted.the district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.
jrl also challenges the district court denial of its motions for partial summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law on mccollough claims under the mcpa.however,given our resolution of the fdcpa claims,we need not reach this issue.the damages mccollough would receive on his mcpa claims are already available to him through his fdcpa claims.like the fdcpa,the mcpa authorizes actual damages,attorney fees,and costs.compare a,with ann.while the mcpa also permits the court in its discretion to award treble damages and any other equitable relief that it considers proper,id,the district court declined to grant mccollough such relief.
mccollough and amicus curia the state of montana have conceded that if the fdcpa claims are upheld,it is not necessary to reach the mcpa issues.if we were to consider the issues,ours would not be a definitive construction of the statute that prerogative belongs to the montana supreme court.see ticknor choice hotels int l,cir federal courts are bound by the pronouncements of the state highest court on applicable state law and w here the state highest court has not decided an issue,the task of the federal courts is to predict how the state high court would resolve it quotation omitted.
thus,we need not,and do not,reach the mcpa issues.see webb sloan,cir declining to reach state law issues where verdict could be sustained on federal grounds.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to admit evidence.boyd city and county of san francisco,f d,cir.we reverse only if we are convinced firmly that the reviewed decision lies beyond the pale of reasonable justification under the circumstances.id.quoting harman apfel,cir.a party seeking reversal for evidentiary error must show that the error was prejudicial,and that the verdict was more probably than not affected as a result.id.quotation omitted.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the very brief testimony of individual debtors keri henan and ken lucero concerning their experiences of being sued by jrl.jrl argues that the testimony was irrelevant under federal rule of evidence and that it should have been excluded on that basis.alternatively,jrl contends that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and thus that the evidence should have been excluded under rule.
rule defines relevant evidence as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.see united states curtin,cir en banc.if evidence is relevant,it is generally admissible under federal rule of evidence.see id.however,relevant evidence must be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the testimony of jrl conduct in similar cases was relevant to show intent,absence of mistake,malice,willfulness,and reprehensibility.pursuant to the fdcpa,mccollough had to prove that jrl violations were intentional to obtain the maximum amount of fdcpa statutory damages and to counter jrl bona fide error defense.b requiring consideration,among other relevant factors,of the extent to which such noncompliance was intentional id.at c bona fide error defense.mccollough malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims required proof of malice and willfulness.see plouffe.dep t of pub.health human,malicious prosecution hughes lynch,abuse of process.finally,mccollough entitlement to punitive damages depended on a showing of reprehensibility.see state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,requiring consideration of whether the defendant conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident.in addition,jrl defended its conduct on the basis that it simply made a series of mistakes in prosecuting the lawsuit.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.
jrl contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting expert testimony from attorneys michael eakin and james patten regarding jrl collection practices in other cases.however,it failed to preserve this claim for appeal by failing to object at trial.united states archdale,cir holding that filing a motion in limine is insufficient to preserve an issue for appeal absent a further objection at trial.here,jrl filed a motion in limine challenging admission of the evidence,but the district court denied jrl motion to exclude the experts testimony with leave to renew any objections at trial and thus did not issue an ultimate ruling on the evidence.jrl did not reassert the objections at trial.jrl thus failed to preserve its objection under archdale.
jrl also claims error in the district court admission of exhibit,a list of all the lawsuits jrl had filed in the state of montana from january through july.however,defense counsel opened the door to consideration of this evidence when he questioned patten about the number of lawsuits filed during that period.byrd maricopa county sheriff,wl at cir,en banc.a party preemptive use of evidence at trial before its introduction by the opposing party constitutes a waiver of the right to challenge the admissibility of the evidence on appeal.see ohler united states,united states decoud,cir.
jrl also failed to preserve its claim on appeal that the district court erred in allowing the attorney expert testimony and the list of cases to be presented at the liability and general damage portions of the trial,rather than at the punitive damages stage.
the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in formulating the jury instructions.miller,cir.
jrl first argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting exhibit and the testimony of henan,lucero,eakin,and patten without instructing the jury to limit its use of the evidence to the issue of reprehensibility,and to award punitive damages only for jrl conduct toward mccollough.jrl argues that the admission of the evidence without proper limiting instructions violated jrl due process rights.however,jrl failed to preserve this issue on appeal because it did not request an instruction limiting the jury use of the evidence at trial.accordingly,the issue is waived.see id.i f an appellant does not request an instruction at trial,the issue is not preserved on appeal.
jrl likewise argues that it is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the district court instructed the jury that it had previously found jrl requests for admission to be abusive,unfair,or unconscionable,rather than by simply stating its legal conclusion that jrl violated the fdcpa.however,jrl did not raise this objection at trial.indeed,jrl conceded that the instruction correctly summarized the district court prior order and objected only because it disagreed with the court prior order.thus,this challenge is also waived.see id.
the district court did not err in denying jrl motion for judgment as a matter of law on mccollough state law malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims a jury verdict must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence,which is evidence adequa
