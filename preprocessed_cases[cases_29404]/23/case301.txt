laschinski emerson obtained a money judgment in a lawsuit from a tennessee trial court against her former employer nathaniel revis and his company,oak ridge research,orri.revis appealed,but failed to post an appeal bond.emerson subsequently sought and obtained two writs of execution for revis real and personal property in roane county,tennessee to satisfy the judgment.roane county deputy sheriff larry eaton,accompanied by tracy waldo,a paralegal from the law firm representing emerson,appeared at revis house to serve the writs.under eaton direction,private contractors seized revis personal property and changed the locks on his residence.deputy eaton also ordered revis to leave the residence and inquired about any cash that revis was carrying on his person.
revis filed suit pursuant to against the persons and entities involved in executing the writs,alleging that the seizure of his residence and the search of his person pursuant to the writs violated his constitutional rights.the district court granted summary judgment to some of the defendants,dismissed all claims against the rest,and further ordered revis to pay the defendants costs of litigation.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
emerson filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of anderson county,tennessee against revis and orri,alleging sexual harassment,assault and battery,and retaliatory discharge.the law firm of montpelier young,along with solo practitioner april meldrum,represented emerson.a jury awarded emerson in actual damages,including from revis himself and from orri,in addition to in punitive damages.judgment was entered in november of,but an amended judgment was filed in august of that remitted the punitive damage award to,but also added in attorney fees and in discretionary costs.the total amended award amounted to.
revis and orri were held jointly and severally liable for the punitive damages,the attorney fees,and the costs,meaning that revis was personally liable for a maximum of.the amended judgment also specified that interest would accrue on the judgment beginning on july,the date that the jury verdict was announced.furthermore,the amended judgment stated that execution may issue unless revis filed an appeal bond within days from the date of entry.
after filing postjudgment discovery requests in august of that sought financial information from revis,emerson lodged two applications for writs of execution with the anderson county circuit court on october.the applications sought permission to sell both real and personal property owned by revis in roane county,tennessee.because revis had not yet posted an appeal bond,anderson county deputy court clerk joyce graves promptly issued the writs.both writs were addressed to any lawful officer to execute and return.the writs provided,in pertinent part,as follows 
you are hereby commanded to take from the property of nathaniel revis including in sic property listed below the sum of to satisfy the judgment obtained by the plaintiffs you are further commanded to pay such monies,when collected,into the court and you shall make return as to how you have executed this writ within the time allowed by law.
both writs thus overstated revis actual judgment debt by roughly,though this misstatement has little bearing on the issues before us.under the description of property,the first writ listed residence located at revis home address.the second writ described all personal property and asset sic including furnishings,automobiles,cash,located on the premises of revis home address.both writs were delivered to the sheriff department in roane county.
deputy larry eaton received the writs and reviewed them.unsure how to proceed,he took them to the roane county attorney for review.eaton stated in his affidavit that the county attorney advised him that the writs were valid court orders and were to be obeyed as stated on their faces.eaton did not the county attorney apparently offered no whether actual seizure of the residence was appropriate or necessary.revis has moved on appeal to submit deposition testimony on this issue given by eaton in a parallel proceeding,but this testimony does no more than confirm the facts as described and therefore need not be considered.
at on october,deputy eaton served the writs on revis at revis residence.several other sheriff department employees accompanied eaton,as did waldo on behalf of montpelier young.after eaton notified revis of the writs,several employees of a private moving company hired by montpelier young began packing revis personal property and moving it to a storage facility.this included removing allegedly valuable artwork and furnishings.
revis claims that,in addition to removing his personal property,deputy eaton caused the locks to be changed at his residence.according to revis,k k lock and key changed the outside locks on revis home pursuant to a contract arranged for by montpelier young and approved in writing by waldo.at least one set of the new keys was given to eaton.according to revis,eaton escorted him out of the residence at that night and advised revis that he could not return.
finally,revis claims that he was unconstitutionally searched by eaton.waldo allegedly requested,at some point during the execution,that eaton check to determine whether revis was removing cash from the premises.revis stated in his affidavit that eaton demanded that i submit to a search of my person and that revis complied under duress.he added that eaton was armed and made it apparent that force would be used if i resisted.eaton explained in his affidavit that he simply asked revis if he had any cash on him,and that revis responded by showing him his wallet,which contained three dollars.both parties agree that no money was taken from revis during this interaction.
revis posted an appeal bond seven days later.at that point,all of his property,both real and personal,was returned to him.
procedural background 
as noted above,emerson had prevailed against revis in her lawsuit in tennessee state court.revis current lawsuit stems from the actions taken to collect the judgment obtained in that litigation.revis filed this action in federal district court in november of,claiming violations of his civil rights pursuant to and.section provides a federal cause of action for civil damages against an individual acting under color of state law who deprives another of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.jones reynolds,cir quotation marks omitted.a claim,on the other hand,is based upon private conspiracies that are aimed at invidiously discriminatory deprivation of the equal enjoyment of rights secured to all by law.taylor brighton,cir.revis also asserted eight claims under tennessee state law arising from the same events.as defendants,the complaint named emerson,her attorneys in the underlying action,and paralegal waldo.roane county,anderson county,deputy eaton,and deputy clerk graves were named as county defendants.
during the course of the ensuing litigation,all of the defendants other than anderson county and deputy clerk graves moved for either summary judgment or dismissal,and revis responded by moving for partial summary judgment against eaton and roane county and by opposing the other defendants motions.two orders that disposed of the various motions were ultimately issued by the district court.the first granted the defendants motions to dismiss revis federal claims.revis claim against them was dismissed because the complaint failed to show that the defendants actions were fairly attributable to the state,and his claim was dismissed because the asserted equal protection violation was insufficiently alleged.the second order granted deputy eaton and roane county motions for summary judgment on the same federal claims.dismissal of these two county defendants was based on the court determination that no constitutional violation had occurred and,alternatively,that eaton was entitled to qualified immunity.
having disposed of the federal claims against the above defendants,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over revis related claims.the court ultimately dismissed the remaining claims in the case against anderson county and deputy clerk graves after issuing an order for revis to show cause why they should not be dismissed.
thereafter,the defendants moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to,seeking in fees.section gives the district court discretion to award reasonable costs and attorney fees to the prevailing parties in a civil rights action.in the case of prevailing defendants,the court may award fees where the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.lake county sheriff dep t,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.finding revis claims against the defendants to be without foundation and vexatious,the district court granted the defendants motion,but awarded them only of their original request,which it calculated to be.the court determined that of the work for which fees were requested related to defending against revis claims,work that was noncompensable under.
revis filed a timely notice of appeal.his challenges on appeal are limited to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of deputy eaton and roane county on the claim,its dismissal of the claim against the defendants,and its award of attorney fees to the latter group.
ii.analysis 
standard of review and legal framework 
the analysis of each issue raised by revis involves a different standard of review.these standards are set forth below.
summary judgment and qualified immunity 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
evaluation of the claim against deputy eaton also entails an analysis of the doctrine of qualified immunity.that doctrine serves to protect government officials who perform discretionary functions from both suit and liability,provided that their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.the analysis of qualified immunity generally proceeds through a inquiry.first,the court must determine whether the plaintiff in the civil action has demonstrated the violation of a constitutionally protected right.charvat oh.reg l wastewater,cir.second,the court must determine whether the right is so clearly established that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.a third consideration that is occasionally examined by this court to increase the clarity of the analysis is whether the plaintiff offered sufficient evidence to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.estate of carter city of detroit,cir citations omitted.
dismissal under rule b 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a claim pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.sistrunk city of strongsville,cir.a motion to dismiss may be granted only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.id.citation omitted.
award of attorney fees under 
the grant or denial of attorney fees by a district court is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.berger city of mayfield heights,cir.abuse of discretion is defined as a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.id.citation omitted.
b.the claim against deputy eaton 
although the district court granted summary judgment in favor of deputy eaton as to all of revis claims,revis appeals the court judgment only with respect to his claim.according to revis,the court erred in determining that eaton was entitled to qualified immunity regarding eaton eviction of revis from his residence and the alleged search of his person.revis argues that the eviction violated his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights and that the search of his person violated his fourth amendment rights.he concedes that his personal property was constitutionally seized in executing the writs he contests only his eviction and the search of his person.
the state exercise of physical control over a residence that results in eviction can implicate both fourth and fourteenth amendment protections.see,soldal cook county,d holding that the physical seizure of a trailer home by police prior to obtaining a lawful eviction order stated a claim for a fourth amendment violation thomas cohen,cir concluding that the summary eviction of tenants by the police in contravention of established state eviction procedures supported a claim for a fourteenth amendment violation.for ease of analysis,we will consider revis two constitutional claims in reverse order.
revis fourteenth amendment claim 
revis does not challenge the constitutionality of tennessee levy and execution procedures rather,he alleges that eaton did not properly follow them,and in so doing deprived revis of his due process rights.the first step in the analysis requires us to determine whether revis assertion in this regard is correct.see charvat,at.
due process generally requires notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to eviction 
initially,we must consider whether the interest asserted by revis is a protected liberty or property right under the fourteenth amendment.see thomas,at.property interests are not created by the constitution,instead they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.here,as the owner and occupant of his residence,revis clearly had a valid possessory interest under tennessee law.
furthermore,in the specific context of eviction,the fourteenth amendment has particular import.this court has held that d ue process generally requires notice and a hearing prior to eviction.thomas.in thomas,this court determined that the summary eviction of lawful tenants by the police in contravention of state eviction procedures violated the tenants due process rights.id.deputy eaton argues,however,that the judgment against revis in the underlying litigation provided adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in compliance with thomas.
b.the underlying litigation and judgment did not provide constitutionally adequate process for revis eviction 
the district court held that revis eviction pursuant to the writ of execution did not violate his right to due process because the judgment awarded against him in the underlying litigation was an award of execution upon which the state court could issue writs of possession and execution.because deputy eaton had a lawful writ of execution for revis residence,the district court reasoned,eaton was entitled to take immediate possession of it.the court,however,cited no authority to support its determination,and the issue appears to be one of first impression in this circuit.
revis correctly points out that the underlying lawsuit established nothing beyond his financial obligation to emerson.this materially distinguishes the judgment against revis from a judgment for possession upon which a writ of possession may issue.the money judgment against revis is silent concerning who is entitled to possess revis residence,and it provides no notice to revis that he was subject to summary eviction.rather,the judgment simply notified revis that,unless he posted an appeal bond within days,execution may issue to satisfy the judgment.in addressing a similar argument that the underlying merits hearing served as adequate notice for a postjudgment seizure,the third circuit expressed skepticism,noting that the judgment represents only an adjudication of the judgment debtor liability on a monetary debt,not a transfer to the judgment creditor of title to any particular item of the judgment debtor property.finberg sullivan,cir en banc.
of course the underlying litigation also did not adjudicate the right to possess revis artwork and furnishings either,but revis concedes that these items were constitutionally seized pursuant to the writ of execution.eviction,however,has traditionally involved greater procedural safeguards than those related to less severe deprivations.an individual immediate loss of possession of his or her home plainly has greater adverse consequences than the loss of artwork or even a portion of an individual wages.see,united states james daniel good real,d noting that an individual right to maintain control over his home,and to be free from governmental interference,is a private interest of historic and continuing importance,and that the private interests at stake in the seizure of real property weigh heavily in the mathews balance.as the supreme court explained in mathews eldridge,d,the due process analysis generally requires consideration of the private interest that will be affected,the risk of an erroneous deprivation compared with the probable value of additional procedural safeguards,and the government interest at stake.
an owner strong possessory interest in his or her residence is just one of the mathews due process balancing factors weighing against the constitutionality of summary eviction pursuant to a writ of execution.see id.the risk of an erroneous deprivation is also significant.first,although revis has not argued that it applies here,tennessee provides a homestead exemption,which has been interpreted to permit the owners to occupy their designated homesteads pending receipt of the exempted amount from the repossessing party.see.const.art.xi,in re rolfes,citing tennessee caselaw for the proposition that the debtors were entitled to remain in possession of their residence pending their receipt of the homestead exemption.summary eviction pursuant to a writ of execution clearly risks running afoul of that protection.
in addition,seizing a judgment debtor residence and evicting him might serve no valid purpose of the judgment creditor where the debtor possesses no equity interest in the home with which to satisfy the judgment.moreover,in the case of a judgment debtor who leases his residence to tenants,the underlying trial and judgment could not be said to satisfy the tenants due process rights prior to their summary eviction.additional predeprivation process,such as notice and an opportunity to be heard,would permit an owner or tenants to raise these concerns and thereby decrease the risk of an erroneous deprivation.nor would employing state eviction procedures unduly harm the competing interest of efficient postjudgment remedies.davis mansfield metro.hous,cir concluding that requiring hearing procedures for section eight housing residents whose leases were terminated would not impose significant administrative burdens because such hearing procedures were already in place for participants in other types of public housing arrangements.
we recognize that exigency concerns can justify the seizure of personal property without advance notice,but such concerns typically do not arise in connection with real estate.see james daniel good real,at.holding that more procedures are required before seizing real estate,which,by its very nature,can be neither moved nor concealed,than before seizing a yacht which is the sort of property that could be removed to another jurisdiction,destroyed,or concealed,if advance warning of confiscation were given.while we can envision a scenario in which exigency concerns would justify the seizure of real estate without notice,such as where a structure is deemed unsound,the present case involves no such circumstances.see flatford city of monroe,cir recognizing that exigency concerns regarding public safety can justify immediate eviction action under a limited set of circumstances.
thus,while personal property may be levied upon through seizure,a writ of execution for real property is generally levied by formally noting on the writ a legal description of the property and giving notice to the owner and the public that the property is subject to sale.see,hammock qualls,the levy of an execution upon real estate does not transfer the title to the land nor create any interest thereto in the sheriff.crutsinger catron,t he levy of an execution upon land does not divest the seizin of the owner,the defendant no title or interest thereto,is vested in the sheriff by the levy,he is the mere agent under the law to sell.as the trial court judge presiding over revis parallel tennessee proceedings concerning these events observed,the law is you do levy an execution on realty by dispossessing the owner.see also newberry davison chem,cir determining under north carolina law that execution gives no possession or right of possession of real estate a docketed judgment constitutes a lien which may be enforced by sale under execution,but until such sale is made and deed pursuant thereto executed,the right of possession in the owner is not affected.d executions thus,in the case of real property,a writ of execution functions as an instruction to the sheriff to go to the property in question and inform its inhabitants that it will be sold to satisfy a judgment owed until the property is actually sold,the landowner interest in the property does not change.
these authorities support the principle that an execution levied upon real estate does not result in the immediate eviction of the judgment debtor.as a pennsylvania judge explained in analyzing that state execution procedures,
the issuance of a writ of execution against the debtor real estate does not work as an immediate seizure of the property.before the creditor or sheriff sale purchaser can take possession of the debtor real estate,the debtor must voluntarily vacate the premises or eviction proceedings must be brought against the debtor.the debtor,by this time,has already been advised in writing repeatedly that he should contact a lawyer,that he may lose valuable property rights unless he acts promptly.
scott adal.although deputy eaton argues that tennessee recently altered its procedure to depart from this established practice,we disagree for the reasons set forth below.
eaton relies on encyclopedia press,for the proposition that no notice or hearing is required before effecting postjudgment remedies.in,the supreme court considered a claim by a judgment debtor that he was entitled to additional predeprivation procedures prior to the garnishment of his wages.the court held that 
the established rules of our system of jurisprudence do not require that a defendant who has been granted an opportunity to be heard and has had his day in court,should,after a judgment has been rendered against him,have a further notice and hearing before supplemental proceedings are taken to reach his property in satisfaction of the judgment.thus,in the absence of a statutory requirement,it is not essential that he be given notice before the issuance of an execution against his tangible property after the rendition of the judgment he must take notice of what will follow,no further notice being necessary to advance justice.
at.citations and quotation marks omitted,however,concerned only the process due before a deprivation of wages through garnishment,not before deprivation of the special possessory interest that an owner or tenant has in his residence.
in agg flanagan,cir,we followed and upheld an ohio child support postjudgment remedy against a due process challenge.at.the ohio procedure provided for an initial hearing that determined the amount of child support payments owed and concluded in a judgment in the form of a support order.id.if payments were not made,the court could issue postjudgment wage assignments that authorized the garnishment of wages in the amount owed.id.this court held that,under,no predeprivation process was required before garnishment proceeded because the judgment provided adequate notice that nonpayment would result in garnishment.id.at.
but agg dealt with materially different circumstances than those in the present case.first,like,agg addressed only garnishment,not eviction from one home.furthermore,the underlying hearing in agg essentially determined the rights of the parties regarding the property levied,the payor wages.the underlying trial in the present case,by contrast,simply adjudicated a tort claim,not the right to possess revis residence.
in short,no authority cited by deputy eaton has permitted levying an execution upon a residence by evicting the owner without postjudgment notice and the opportunity to be heard.this lack of authority permitting eaton actions,combined with both the longstanding due process requirements of notice and the opportunity to be heard before eviction and the mathews balancing considerations outlined above,lead us to conclude that eaton violated revis fourteenth amendment rights.we reiterate this court holding in thomas,at,that postdeprivation remedies of any sort would be inadequate to redress the unconstitutional eviction here in light of the importance of plaintiffs interest in maintaining possessory rights to their place of residence.flatford,at cir holding that f undamental fairness expects more than mere tort remedies where the government dispossesses its citizens from their homes,but acknowledging that postdeprivation remedies may suffice under exigent circumstances.
eaton is entitled to qualified immunity for the violation 
having determined that deputy eaton did in fact violate one of revis constitutional rights,we next evaluate whether the right is so clearly established that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.charvat,at citation and quotation marks omitted.in answering this question,we consider the right at issue in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.lyons city of xenia,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.revis right to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to eviction following the issuance of a writ of execution for his residence is the particular right at issue here.just as eaton has set forth no judicial authority that clearly justifies the eviction he effected,neither has revis cited any federal authority that squarely defines due process requirements in the context of the postjudgment deprivation of one residence.the lack of settled jurisprudence in this area indicates that the right at issue can not be said to be so clearly established that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.charvat,at.
recent changes in tennessee procedural law also support deputy eaton argument.three months prior to the seizure at issue,tennessee amended its law concerning executions on judgments by consolidating existing rules,statutory law,and caselaw into rule of the tennessee rules of civil procedure.the change lessened any textual distinction between the manner prescribed for levying executions against realty as opposed to personal property.rule,titled execution on personalty,states that a levy is effective when the sheriff with a writ of execution exercises control over the judgment debtor personalty.similarly,rule,titled executions on realty,provides that a levy occurs when the sheriff exercises control over the judgment debtor realty.with regard to realty,however,the new rule requires notice to the judgment debtor and all other persons having an interest of record in the realty prior to any sale.id.
no tennessee court has yet interpreted rule in the context of executions on realty.but historical tennessee caselaw,combined with the commentary to the new rule stating that it was simply meant to consolidate procedures and does not radically change current law,militate in favor of determining that tennessee did not intend to begin permitting judgment creditors to summarily evict judgment debtors from their homes in the course of levying an execution.see,crutsinger,at stating that simply levying an execution does not divest the landowner of seisin.moreover,considering that deputy eaton has not cited any other state procedural law permitting such a practice when levying upon real estate,his interpretation of rule would apparently make tennessee procedure unique in the nation.
the united states supreme court considered an analogous scenario in james daniel good real property,at,where establishing in rem jurisdiction required a governmental seizure,but the actual seizure of real property created due process problems.at.the court held that,while personal property may be physically seized,in the case of real property,the res may be brought within the reach of the court simply by posting notice on the property and leaving a copy of the process with the occupant.id.at.similarly,tennessee rule most likely was intended to do nothing more than direct the sheriff to give notice that the property was subject to sale and return the writ.logic dictates that a rule requiring notice prior to selling the debtor realty necessarily contemplates notice prior to evicting the debtor from the realty.while the existence of exigent circumstances might permit exercising control through actual seizure,we have no need to address that issue in the present context.
the language of the writs themselves further supports eaton qualified immunity argument.both writs given to deputy eaton,which he was required to execute under tennessee law,ordered that he was hereby commanded to take from the property of nathaniel revis including in property listed below the sum of.under description of property,the first writ listed residence located at revis address.this operative language was identical to the wording in the second writ,except that under description of property,the second writ listed all personal property on the premises of revis address.
revis acknowledges that the second writ authorized the actual seizure of the property described,but argues that the first did not.this distinction,however,is far from obvious from the face of the writs.the county attorney further advised eaton that the writs were to be obeyed as stated on their faces,but gave him no specific instructions regarding the residence.these facts distinguish this case from audio odyssey,brenton first nat.bank,cir,panel opinion reinstated en banc,cir,where the eighth circuit denied qualified immunity to state actors involved in unconstitutionally seizing real property when executing a writ of replevin for personal property.the writ in audio odyssey addressed only personal property and no legal advice was sought.id.
here,the advice from the county attorney,combined with the language of the writs themselves,the newly promulgated rule of the tennessee rules of civil procedure,and the absence of clearly established federal caselaw governing the postjudgment deprivation of real property,all support the proposition that deputy eaton actions were not such that a reasonable officer would have understood that what he was doing violated revis rights.see charvat,at see also scott clay county,cir qualified immunity sweeps broadly,affording state officials ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.citation and quotation marks omitted.we therefore conclude that eaton is entitled to qualified immunity with regard to revis fourteenth amendment claim.
having concluded that eaton acted under a reasonable misapprehension of the applicable law,we next address revis allegations that eaton acted in bad faith and as part of a conspiracy to deprive revis of his constitutional rights.we first note that subjective intent is ordinarily not relevant to the qualified immunity analysis.see,blake wright,cir noting that the concept of qualified immunity reflects an objective standard,making the official subjective intent irrelevant.pfannstiel city of marion,cir in a section action claiming that the plaintiff was injured by state action as the result of a conspiracy which includes private persons,the defense is still available to the qualifiedly immune actor,abrogated on other grounds,martin thomas,cir.
furthermore,although revis complaint alleges a conspiracy between eaton and the defendants,he asserts no facts either in his pleadings or affidavit that support the conclusion that eaton formed a plan or objective to deprive revis of his constitutional rights.the record instead reflects that eaton acted according to his reasonable misunderstanding of what the writs of execution required him to do under tennessee law.as noted above,revis has moved to enlarge the record on appeal to include eaton deposition testimony taken in the parallel proceedings.we decline to do so,however,not only because rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure generally bars such a substantive expansion of the record,but because eaton testimony is on balance of no help to revis and actually bolsters our conclusion that no conspiracy occurred.revis claim that eaton knowingly violated revis rights or that he conspired with the defendants to do so,therefore,lacks merit as a matter of law.
revis fourth amendment claims 
a.the seizure of revis residence 
revis asserts,in addition to his due process claim,that his eviction violated the fourth amendment as an unreasonable seizure of his residence.in light of soldal,at,and thomas,at,deputy eaton actions in physically taking possession of revis house by having the locks changed,retaining a key,and evicting revis demonstrably effected a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment.see soldal,at.holding that a seizure under the fourth amendment had occurred when police unceremoniously dispossessed a resident of his trailer home by authorizing its physical removal thomas,at questioning whether verbally ordering the tenants to leave and escorting them out was a seizure of the residence where the officers did not take physical possession of the property gilman,writing for the court on this point separately from the lead opinion.
deputy eaton reliance on dicta in soldal is misplaced.there,the court noted that had the ejection in this case properly awaited the state court judgment it is quite unlikely that the federal court would have bothered with a claim alleging a fourth amendment violation.soldal,at.the state court judgment that the court advised waiting for in that case,however,referred to a judgment for possession pursuant to a eviction proceeding pending at the time the trailer home was seized.id.at.thus,soldal simply begs the question of whether the court writ of execution in this case entitled eaton to evict revis.
in part.above,we answered that question in the negative and determined that,under tennessee law,the writ of execution for revis residence commanded deputy eaton only to give notice that the property was subject to sale.eaton physical seizure of revis residence was therefore in violation of the fourth amendment.for the same reasons addressed in assessing eaton claim of qualified immunity under the fourteenth amendment,however,eaton is entitled to qualified immunity for the reasonable mistake of law that occurred.
eaton alleged search of revis 
revis also raises a separate fourth amendment claim concerning the alleged unlawful search of his person that took place at some point during the course of the levy.rather than describing the attendant facts,revis complaint and his affidavit on the subject contain only conclusory legal assertions.he states that deputy eaton demanded that i submit to a search of my person and that revis complied under duress because eaton was armed and made it apparent that force would be used if i resisted.
while we are mindful that the summary judgment standard requires construing all facts and drawing all inferences in favor of revis,the conclusory assertions in his complaint and affidavit set forth no specific facts concerning the alleged search.deputy eaton explains more fully that he asked revis if he had any money on him at the request of the law firm representative who was present and revis pulled out his billfold,opened it and showed me that he had only in it.revis pleadings and affidavit raise no factual dispute regarding this relatively innocuous account of the events.in fact,revis complaint similarly asserts that revis was obliged to empty his own pockets,revealing three dollars,which he was allowed to keep.
the district court properly concluded that this verbal exchange did not amount to a search,and therefore did not violate revis fourth amendment rights.see united states oliver,cir determining that protection against rude,officious,or intrusive police questioning is not a core concern of the fourth amendment.questioning in itself does not constitute a search or seizure.a lthough a person detained on reasonable suspicion is not free to leave,a person questioned by an officer is free to refuse to answer the question.id.
roane county alleged failure to properly train deputy eaton 
in conjunction with revis constitutional claims against deputy eaton,he also asserted a claim against roane county for failing to properly train eaton.the district court dismissed this claim because it found that no constitutional violation had occurred.although we disagree with the district court rationale on this issue,we agree with the conclusion that it reached.
this court has held that o nly when the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference on behalf of the state entity toward its inhabitants will failure to train lead to that entity liability under.gregory city of louisville,cir.here,revis has made no showing of any deliberate indifference in failing to train deputy eaton that resulted in the highly predictable consequence of a constitutional violation of the sort that occurred.see id.eaton instead acted properly by seeking legal advice as to how to execute the writs.unfortunately,eaton misinterpreted the county attorney advice and misconstrued the proper procedure to be followed.given the lack of clearly established rights in this area of the law,however,a jury could not reasonably find that the county failure to appraise eaton of the proper interpretation of the newly minted rule procedures amounted to deliberate indifference.
d.the defendants 
in addition to claiming that the county defendants violated his constitutional rights,revis named various defendants in his and claims.the group of defendants consists of emerson,the prevailing plaintiff in the underlying tort litigation,as well as four members of her legal team meldrum,montpelier,waldo,and young.revis focuses on their participation in his eviction.after concluding that none of the defendants qualified as state actors in this case,the district court dismissed all claims against them.revis has appealed the dismissal only with respect to his claim.
the fourth and fourteenth amendment rights at issue secure protection only against infringement through state action.see,flagg,brooks,d m ost rights secured by the constitution are protected only against infringement by governments.under some circumstances,however,the conduct of private parties may be deemed to be state action when the conduct allegedly causing the deprivation of a federal right may be fairly attributable to the state.lugar edmondson oil,d.
whether the conduct may in fact be fairly attributed to the state requires a inquiry.first,the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the state is responsible.id.second,the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.id.the court in lugar explained that the two prongs merge when analyzing a state official conduct,whereas they remain distinct when analyzing the conduct of private parties.id.at.
this circuit utilizes three tests to evaluate state action the test,the test,and the or nexus test.lansing city of memphis,cir.the district court concluded that only the nexus test,which focuses on the extent of the relationship between the state and private actors,has possible application to the facts of this case.we agree,but furt
