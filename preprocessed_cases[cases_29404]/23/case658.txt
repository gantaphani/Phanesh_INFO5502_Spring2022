in this writ proceeding,we deny a third party debtor petition in which it challenges the trial court order denying the debtor code of civil procedure section peremptory challenge.
in the trial court,the plaintiff obtained a million judgment against a defendant,a construction lender that failed to meets its commitment with respect to a condominium project in san diego.the plaintiff has unsuccessfully attempted to satisfy the judgment through a myriad of postjudgment collection proceedings.
the third party debtor is controlled by the sole shareholder of the defendant construction lender and owes the defendant substantial amounts.the plaintiff alleges it served the third party with a notice of levy and that,nonetheless,the third party debtor thereafter paid the defendant more than million in management fees.
the third party payment to the defendant in part gave rise to the plaintiff application to the trial court for appointment of a limited receiver.following a contested hearing,the receiver was appointed.however,the defendant did not cooperate with the receiver,who then applied to the trial court for a clarification of his powers and access to books and records of the defendant and the third party debtor among others.the defendant shortly thereafter filed for bankruptcy.
after the defendant filed its bankruptcy petition,the plaintiff filed a motion under section to make the third party debtor liable for the money it transferred to the defendant.
upon being served with the plaintiff section motion,the third party debtor filed a motion to quash service of the notice of levy of execution and a peremptory challenge under section.the trial court denied the challenge,and the third party debtor filed a timely petition for a writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause as well as a stay of all further trial court proceedings.
as we explain,a motion under section,by which a judgment creditor seeks to impose liability for failure to honor a notice of levy,although it implicates substantial interests of third parties and gives rise to a separate adversary factfinding process,is nonetheless an incident to the underlying action and is not itself a separate special proceeding that will support a peremptory challenge under section.see avelar superior court th.the same is true of nfl motion to quash.accordingly,because the trial judge had previously determined the judgment creditor liability as a matter of fact,no parties,even those joined thereafter,had the right to a section challenge.
moreover,even if we considered the motion under section as a special proceeding within the meaning of sections and,it was based in substantial part on the same set of facts that gave rise to the plaintiff earlier motion for appointment of a limited receiver and,as we explain,was therefore a continuation of that postjudgment proceeding.because that proceeding included a disputed factual hearing,no party which thereafter was brought into the proceeding could bring a peremptory challenge under section.
in short,the third party debtor section challenge is barred either by the fact that the trial court resolved the judgment debtor liability or by its determination to appoint a receiver.
factual and procedural background 
brewer et pcf 
this case arises out of the development of a luxury condominium project located at the north end of balboa park in san diego and known as mi arbolito.plaintiffs and real parties in interest,brewer corporation,dynalectric company,brady diego,and division,collectively the brewer plaintiffs,are contractors who provided substantial amounts of material and work on the project.the underlying dispute arose because construction on the project stopped before the brewer plaintiffs were paid in full for their material and work.
the brewer plaintiffs sued both the developer,mi arbolito,llc,and the construction lender,point center financial,pcf.although mi arbolito,llc filed for bankruptcy,the brewer plaintiffs obtained a million judgment against pcf.
pcf is wholly owned by dan harkey,who is also its president.according to a declaration harkey filed in the trial court,pcf has been in business for more than years.harkey stated that national financial lending,llc nfl is a california limited liability company that is managed by pcf and that he is nfl designated agent for service of process.according to harkey,nfl is composed of over members,one of which is pcf.
notice of levy 
on april,the brewer plaintiffs served nfl with notices of levy of execution totaling million.the notices of levy were personally served on a person identified only as jane doe at offices pcf and nfl share.the proof of service states that jane doe refused to identify herself.
some months after the notices of levy were served on nfl,the brewer plaintiffs discovered that,notwithstanding the levies,nfl transferred million it held to pcf.
receivership 
after the brewer plaintiffs discovered nfl transfers to pcf,they moved to have a limited receiver appointed over pcf assets.pcf contested the appointment of a receiver and,after conducting a factual hearing,the trial court determined a receiver was necessary.
the receiver had difficulty obtaining pcf records he believed he needed in order to fulfill his receivership obligations.while the receiver motion to clarify his duties and authority was pending in the trial court,pcf filed a petition for bankruptcy.the brewer plaintiffs then obtained partial relief from the automatic stay in the pcf bankruptcy that permitted them to pursue third party debtors of pcf,including nfl,for levy violations.
section motion and motion to quash 
on june,the brewer plaintiffs personally served nfl agent for service of process,dan harkey,with a notice of its section motion to impose liability on nfl for its violation of the april notices of levy.
on june,nfl responded to the section motion by filing a motion to quash the notices of levy in which it argued that service of the notices on a jane doe at its offices was not valid.
also on june,nfl filed a peremptory challenge to the trial judge presiding over the case under section.the trial judge denied the challenge on the grounds that neither the brewer plaintiffs motion under section nor nfl motion to quash are actions or special proceedings subject to section.
as we indicated at the outset,nfl filed a petition for a writ of mandate,and we issued an order to show cause and stay.
discussion 
ia.section 
by its terms,section applies in any civil or criminal action or special proceeding of any kind or character,subd.a,italics added.under the statute any party to,or an attorney appearing in,an action or proceeding may file a motion to disqualify the judge before whom the action is pending if the motion is supported by an affidavit or statement under oath that simply declares the party or attorney believes the presiding judge in the action or proceeding is biased against the party,the attorney,or the interest of the party or the attorney,subd.a.upon presentation of such a motion and affidavit or statement under oath,the action or proceeding must be assigned to another judge,subd.a.
in a case such as this,where a trial judge has been assigned for all purposes,a new party or attorney representing a new party must make the motion within days of appearing,subd.a.however,only one motion may be made for each side in any one action or special proceeding,subd.a.moreover,neither side in a proceeding may make a motion under section after trial has commenced or the trial judge has resolved a disputed issue of fact relating to the merits,subd.a stephens superior court th,stephens.importantly,these limitations apply even to third parties who are brought into an action or special proceeding after a challenge has been made or a factual issue has been determined.see school dist.of okaloosa county superior court th,after challenge made stephens,at.
the right to exercise a peremptory challenge under code of civil procedure section is a substantial right and an important part of california system of due process that promotes fair and impartial trials and confidence in the judiciary.citation.as a remedial statute,section is to be liberally construed in favor of allowing a peremptory challenge,and a challenge should be denied only if the statute absolutely forbids it.citation.stephens,supra,th at.at the same time,section is designed to prevent abuse by parties that merely seek to delay a trial or obtain a more favorable judicial forum.the home ins.superior court cal th.the general aim of the legislation is to strike a balance between the needs of litigants and the operating efficiency of the courts.citation.to effectuate the legislature intent,our courts have been vigilant to enforce the statutory restrictions on the number and timing of motions permitted.citation.we have not permitted a device intended for spare and protective use to be converted into a weapon of offense and thereby to become an obstruction to efficient judicial administration.citations.id.at,fn.omitted.
section states a if a third person is required by this article to deliver property to the levying officer or to make payments to the levying officer and the third person fails or refuses without good cause to do so,the third person is liable to the judgment creditor for whichever of the following is the lesser amount 
the value of the judgment debtor interest in the property or the amount of the payments required to be made.
the amount required to satisfy the judgment pursuant to which the levy is made.
b the third person liability continues until the earliest of the following times 
the time when the property levied upon is delivered to the levying officer or the payments are made to the levying officer.
the time when the property levied upon is released pursuant to section.
the time when the judgment is satisfied or discharged.
c if the third person liability is established,the court that determines the liability may,in its discretion,require the third person to pay the costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the judgment creditor in establishing the liability.
according to the law revision commission comment,a judgment creditor may enforce the liability imposed by section either pursuant to examination proceedings under article,chapter of title of the code,section et or by way of a separate creditor suit under article,chapter of the code,section et.cal.law revision com.
motion to quash notice of levy 
the cases have recognized that a notice of levy may be challenged by a motion to quash.see lauer rose d.in ruling on such a motion,the trial court is not required to render any statement of decision.ibid.
as we noted at the outset,nfl section challenge is barred either by the fact the brewer plaintiffs section motion and nfl own motion to quash are mere incidents of the underlying action and the trial judge earlier determination of pcf liability bars any further peremptory challenges or,more narrowly,because even if considered special proceedings,the motions to impose liability and quash are nonetheless a continuation of the receivership proceeding.
incidents of an action 
we have not been cited to and are not aware of any cases that have directly considered whether a motion under section or a motion to quash a notice of levy are special proceedings within the meaning of sections and.we conclude that neither a section motion brought in the same action in which the underlying judgment was entered nor a motion to quash service of a notice of levy are special proceedings but rather are only incidents of the underlying action and do not give rise to a separate right to a peremptory challenge under section.our narrow interpretation of special proceedings is not only consistent with the cases that have considered section and its definition of the term,it is also consistent with the balance the legislature has attempted to draw between the important right of litigants to challenge trial judges at the outset of proceedings and the operating efficiency of the trial courts.
under section,judicial remedies are defined as actions and special proceedings.section defines actions as an action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,the redress or prevention of a wrong,or the punishment of a public offense.section,in turn,states every other remedy is a special proceeding.
the phrase special proceeding is used in the code practice in contradistinction to action.that phrase has no reference to provisional remedies in actions at law or in equity.it has reference only to such proceedings as may be commenced independently of a pending action by petition or motion upon notice in order to obtain special relief.in re sutter butte by pass assessment cal,italics added.the phrase therefore appears to apply only to a proceeding which is distinct from,and not a mere part of,any underlying litigation.avelar superior court th,avelar.the phrase can not be defined to include every procedural step or mechanism employed within the context of pending litigation.by describing a special proceeding as any remedy not available in an action,the legislature must have meant to create and recognize two roughly equivalent levels of independent procedures to be directed towards the attainment of different,but similarly final remedies.id.at,italics added.
in avelar,a criminal defendant,who had been charged with battery and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer,moved for discovery of complaints of excessive force made against the officer.the request for complaints was governed by evidence code section,which sets forth notice and good cause requirements for such motions.in response to the defendant motion,the officer employer,a local police department,filed an affidavit under code of civil procedure section that sought to disqualify the trial judge.the trial judge found that the affidavit was effective and disqualified himself.the defendant filed a petition for a writ of mandate in which he argued that discovery proceedings under evidence code section are not special proceedings that give rise to any right under code of civil procedure section.the court granted the writ.i t can be argued that where the legislature prescribes specific procedures by which the disclosure of information may be compelled procedures which are more onerous and complex than those routinely involved in discovery it should be assumed that the legislature has found the information in question deserving of special protection.we recognize that the statutory scheme with respect to police officer personnel records does reflect a legislative desire to deter harassing and unjustified efforts to obtain personally private and confidential information contained in those records.however,with all due respect to law enforcement personnel,we are unwilling to conclude that their interests in privacy are necessarily of greater legal significance than that of other individuals asked to reveal intimate information,or information as to which a legal privilege may be claimed.avelar,supra,th at.
importantly,the court in avelar recognized the significance of the fact that the defendant discovery motion was part of an ongoing criminal action,rather than an independent proceeding to which the right to a peremptory challenge would arise.although the penal code itself identifies a host of procedures as special proceedings of a criminal nature,et,including motions under evidence code section,the court found that this description of various criminal procedures does not necessarily mean they become special proceedings within the meaning of code of civil procedure section when they are used as mere component parts of a primary action.avelar,supra,th at.the court noted,i f no criminal action is pending,an owner motion under penal code sections for the return of property seized under a warrant would be properly classed as a special proceeding.citation.however,if a criminal prosecution is pending,a defendant could not exercise two separate peremptory challenges,one at a motion to suppress under penal code section,and another at the trial itself.ibid.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied on le louis superior court d,in which the court concluded that a preliminary hearing is a part of
