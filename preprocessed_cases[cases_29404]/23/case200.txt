in order to obtain financing for the purchases of a dodge truck and a dodge truck from lustine,in woodbridge,virginia,timothy gibson executed a total of five retail installment sales in connection with the purchase and three in connection with the purchase.after gibson wrecked his truck and returned the truck upon lustine demand when lustine learned that gibson was no longer employed,gibson commenced this action challenging the legality of disclosures made in the retail installment sales contracts.he alleged violations of the truth in lending act tila,et,and related virginia law.
the district court held that disclosures in the first contract and the first contract constituted violations of tila and awarded gibson statutory damages,as well as for statutorily authorized attorneys fees.the court rejected gibson claim that lustine improperly disclosed a charge for the inclusion of gap insurance as part of the amount financed in the second contract.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court findings that two contracts violated tila and reverse its rejection of gibson claim that the gap insurance cost was improperly disclosed as part of the amount financed on the second contract.we also vacate the district court award of attorneys fees to permit the court to reassess its award in light of gibson additional meritorious claim.
timothy gibson,a young welder from texas who did not complete high school and who had little credit history,came to virginia in with his older brother to work for a contractor in dumfries,virginia.after having had to hitch rides with his brother and to take taxicabs for transportation,gibson decided to purchase a truck from lustine lustine on october.after selecting a new dodge dakota truck,a lustine employee who sells aftermarket products asked gibson whether he was interested in purchasing undercoating,paint sealant,fabric protector,floor mats,or other products.according to gibson,he told the sales representative that he did not want any such fact that lustine has not disputed.the sales representative nonetheless saved in her file an after sale invoice,not signed by gibson,showing a charge for undercoating and paint sealant.later that day,gibson signed a buyer order for the truck and a retail installment sales contract to finance it that committed him to pay,after applying his down payment.this sum included a charge for after mrkt,but no such charge was disclosed on the retail installment sales contract.the charge was included in the gross amount financed.
in his buyer order,gibson agreed to permit lustine to follow its practice of selling his retail installment sales contract to a third party.moreover,the buyer order provided 
if purchaser is financing this transaction,it is conditioned upon approval of purchaser proposed retail installment sale contract as submitted to or through the dealer.if that proposed retail installment sale contract is not approved under the terms agreed to with the dealer,purchaser may cancel this invoice 
in a financing addendum to the retail installment sales contract,gibson also agreed that he was accepting delivery of the truck that day pending approval by a financing source and that if lustine did not receive approval from a financing source,lustine could rescind the transaction.lustine remained bound,however,until it gave notice that it was rescinding the contract by its failure to sell the loan.as to gibson,the retail installment sales contract provided that he remained bound after he signed the contract and that he could only cancel it if the seller agree d or for legal cause.gibson took delivery of the truck on october,the same day he entered the dealership and signed the retail installment sales contract.
lustine was unable to find a finance company to purchase gibson retail installment sales contract because of gibson low credit rating.accordingly,lustine had gibson return to the dealership on november,to restructure the deal and execute a new retail installment sales contract that reduced the amount financed to.this was accomplished by deleting the after mrkt charge,deleting a gap insurance charge,and increasing gibson down payment.as restructured,this second retail installment sales contract was sold to triad financial corporation.
in early,gibson crashed his truck into a pole,totaling it.on february,he returned to lustine to purchase a replacement truck.he chose a new dodge dakota truck and again signed a buyer order as well as a retail installment sales contract to finance,after applying his down payment.this amount included a charge for gap insurance and an overcharge in the amount of resulting from lustine miscalculation of the dealer business license tax.the inclusion of the gap charge on the buyer order and on the retail installment sales contract was authorized by an addendum that gibson signed,agreeing to purchase the gap insurance.gibson took delivery of the truck that day.
again,lustine was unable to sell this retail installment sales contract to a finance company.one finance company,however,agreed to purchase the loan if it were restructured to provide for an amount financed no greater than.accordingly,gibson returned to the dealership on february,and signed a second retail installment sales contract that provided for financing the amount of.under this restructured arrangement,gibson increased his down payment and thereby decreased the amount financed.this second contract again included a charge for gap insurance,even though gibson did not again sign an addendum to authorize the charge as he had a week earlier for the first contract.
a couple of days after gibson signed the second retail installment sales february,was advised that gibson still owed triad financial money on the loan for his truck because the insurance payout on the totaled vehicle was less than the amount of the outstanding loan.because gibson did not have gap insurance,lustine proposed to cover gibson deficiency by absorbing part of it and passing on the remainder to gibson as an increase in the price of the truck.gibson returned to the dealership on february to sign a third retail installment sales contract agreeing to this arrangement.
after gibson signed the february retail installment sales contract,lustine learned that gibson had quit his job on february,the day after he signed his credit application for financing the truck.because of gibson unemployment,lustine told gibson that he had to return the vehicle,and gibson did so.
after returning the truck,gibson commenced this action against lustine,alleging multiple violations of tila,a violation of the virginia consumer protection act,and common law fraud.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of lustine in all of gibson claims except two the court ruled in 
gibson favor finding that the charge for after mrkt on the first retail installment sales contract was improperly included in the amount financed inasmuch as it was undisputed that gibson did not order,nor did he receive,aftermarket products and that the first retail installment sales contract included an overcharge of for the dealer business license tax.in making these findings,the district court rejected lustine principal argument that,because neither of the retail installment sales contracts on which violations were found had been purchased by finance companies and no monies were ever loaned on them,the contracts were not consummated as required by federal law.the court relied on our decision in nigh koons buick pontiac gmc,cir,rev in part,d,to reject lustine argument.the parties agreed that nigh dictated an award of,twice the sum of the two finance charges related to gibson successful claims and because gibson was a successful plaintiff under the tila,gibson submitted a claim for attorneys fees in the amount of,pursuant to a.the district court awarded gibson.
from the district court judgment,lustine appeals,challenging the court conclusion that the relevant retail installment sales contracts were consummated and its holding that gibson was improperly charged for aftermarket products on the first contract.gibson filed a challenging the district court rejection of his claim that the second retail installment sales contract improperly included a charge for gap insurance in the amount financed.
lustine overarching contention is that neither of the violations found by the district court are actionable because they arose from retail installment sales contracts that were not consummated.the claim for the improper disclosure of the aftermarket charge arose from the first retail installment sales contract,which was rejected by lenders and replaced by a second one and the claim based on the overcharge related to the first retail installment sales contract,which was superseded by a second contract entered into a week later.because neither of the two contracts was purchased by a finance company and credit was never extended to gibson on either of them,lustine argues that any violation with respect to them can not lead to sanctions imposed by tila,which regulates only consummated credit contracts.see b b.
recognizing that our holding in nigh might be applied to hold that the transactions in this case were indeed consummated,lustine argues that nigh is inapposite because it analyzed neither the federal reserve board official commentary nor state law.appellant br.at.lustine asserts that federal reserve board commentary expressly interprets consummation under regulation z to impose a state law construct.id.at discussing a of the official staff commentary to pt,supp.i official staff commentary,which provides state law governs.when a contractual obligation on the consumer part is created is a matter to be determined under applicable law regulation z does not make this determination.lustine contends that under virginia law,a condition precedent must be fulfilled before the contract shall take effect,smith mcgregor,and reasons that a contract that does not take effect until a condition precedent is fulfilled is one that is not consummated.appellant br.at,there was no consummation,and hence no tila liability.
the truth in lending act was enacted to inform consumers use of credit by increasing their awareness of credit costs.see a.consequently,the act requires meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him.id.to this end,tila requires the disclosure of,among other things,the amount financed and the finance charge.see id.a b.the amount financed is defined to be the amount of credit of which the consumer has actual use,id.a a,and the finance charge is defined as all charges imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.the finance charge does not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction.id.a.
these and the other required disclosures must be made before the credit is extended.b.regulation z,the federal reserve board primary tila regulation,elaborates on this timing requirement,providing that a creditor must make disclosures before consummation of the transaction.b emphasis added.consummation in turn is defined to occur at the time that a consumer becomes contractually obligated on a credit transaction.id.emphases added.this definition of consummation,adopted in,moved away from the definition which provided that a transaction shall be considered consummated at the time a contractual relationship is created between a creditor and a customer irrespective of the time of performance of either party.id.kk january,version emphasis added.as one district court noted soon after the change,u nder the new,revised definition courts should only look at the point in time that the consumer becomes contractually obligated on the credit transaction.iwan jack haggerty olds,wl.may,see also fed.reg,as before,state law determines when the contractual obligation arises,but the revised definition focuses on when the consumer becomes obligated.
in nigh,we construed regulation z,concluding that because the regulation expressly refers solely to the consumer commitment and because of tila express purpose of protecting consumers from receiving inadequate disclosures prior to their entering into credit transactions,consummation encompasses unfunded,financing agreement options to which consumers contractually commit,and under which they can be bound at the lender sole discretion.nigh,at.we reasoned that consummation occurs when a consumer has done all he can to be committed to the terms of a credit transaction,for 
i f consummation,or extension of credit,does not encompass a consumer commitment to a financing agreement that provides unilateral power for the creditor to execute the agreement later,creditors could intentionally provide faulty disclosures to consumers,obtain their commitment,and then afterwards provide accurate disclosures prior to closing the transaction,which if provided earlier might have dissuaded the consumer from accepting the credit,all without incurring tila liability.
id.thus,we concluded that a consumer consummates an unfunded retail installment sales contract when he signs it even if the dealer has not signed it.id.at.
in view of the language of the act,as well as regulation z,we find unpersuasive lustine assertion that nigh is inapposite.the change to regulation z in altered the definition of consummation from when a contractual relationship is created to when the consumer becomes contractually obligated on a credit transaction.it is this distinction on which nigh not when a contract becomes effective under state law,but when the consumer becomes contractually obligated.see nigh,at nigh,having signed the contracts and turned them over to koons buick,was committed to the transaction and obliged to perform upon by koons buick.the amended regulation z focuses only on the consumer and his obligations.accordingly,the question in this case is not whether a contract was created under state law,as urged by lustine,because such an analysis would revert to the old regulation instead,the question is whether gibson was obligated to the terms of credit in the retail installment sales contracts upon which he bases his tila claims.
applying nigh,we conclude that when the purchaser of a motor vehicle signs a retail installment sales contract after which he no longer can alter the terms of credit and after which the dealer retains the exclusive right to decide when the financing arrangement takes effect,the transaction is consummated for tila purposes.see nigh,at see also official staff commentary a consummation does not occur when the consumer becomes contractually committed to a sale transaction,unless the consumer also becomes legally obligated to accept a particular credit arrangement emphasis in original.we specifically held in nigh that,when the consumer had signed a buyer order and a retail installment sales contract,the transaction was consummated.after signing the contract,the consumer could no longer change the financing terms even though the dealer had not yet signed the contract.if these unsigned documents in nigh were sufficient to justify the conclusion that the consumer was contractually obligated for purposes of tila,then,a fortiori,a document signed by both parties that would be a contract but for an unfulfilled condition that a finance company purchase the loan on terms acceptable to dealer likewise contractually obligated the consumer for tila purposes.thus,we need not decide whether,under virginia law,these contracts contained valid conditions precedent so long as lustine,not gibson,had control over satisfaction of them.
the eleventh circuit has applied the nigh construction of consummation to that very circumstance where the condition precedent was controlled by the dealer.see bragg bill heard chevrolet,cir adopting nigh and agreeing that consummation occurred not when title to the automobile passed or when a bilateral contract was formed,but rather when the purchaser signed the retail installment sales contract,thereby becoming obligated on the credit agreement.the contract in bragg stated that neither party hereto shall be bound to the other until terms of the credit have been approved by both parties.id.at.the court rejected the dealer argume
