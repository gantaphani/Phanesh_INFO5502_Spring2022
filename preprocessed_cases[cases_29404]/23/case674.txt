we conclude the browns third and fourth causes of action against mortensen are not impermissibly vague or confusing.we also conclude,however,that the federal fair credit reporting act et preempts the browns claims against mortensen.accordingly,we affirm the trial court order dismissing with prejudice the browns third and fourth causes of action against mortensen.
background 
these facts are based on the allegations in the browns fourth amended complaint.
robert brown and his two minor children received dental services from the reinholds defendants,who are not parties to this appeal the dentists.mortensen had an agreement with the dentists for the collection of an allegedly outstanding debt owed by brown to the dentists for dental services.under their agreement,mortensen would share the proceeds of the collection of the debt with the dentists.
in march,mortensen and brown spoke by telephone.during their conversation,mortensen claimed brown owed money to the dentists.brown asked mortensen to provide some verification of the alleged debt.in response,mortensen sent brown a copy of not only brown dental chart,but the dental charts for his two minor children as well.in may,mortensen and brown again spoke by telephone.mortensen claimed the dental charts verified the debt owed by brown.brown disagreed and complained that the dental charts included confidential medical information about his two minor children and himself.the charts revealed,for example,the children and brown names,social security numbers,dates of birth,residence addresses,telephone numbers,health care providers,health care treatments and treatment dates.
soon after their conversation,and continuing for a period of approximately two years,mortensen used and disclosed the dental charts,including the confidential medical information contained in them,to three consumer credit reporting agencies specifically,experian,equifax and trans union.mortensen made these repeated disclosures for purposes of verifying the claim that brown owed money to the dentists.mortensen made these disclosures despite i the fact that brown had told mortensen that the charts included confidential medical information,and ii the fact that there was no claim that brown two minor children owed money to the dentists.the browns never authorized disclosure of the dental charts and confidential medical information.in fact,the browns repeatedly asked defendants not to make such disclosures,but the disclosures continued.
brown also wrote to the credit reporting agencies,explaining that the information they had received was inaccurate and incomplete.in response,the credit reporting agencies contacted mortensen for verification of the alleged debt.mortensen then provided to the credit reporting agencies brown dental history and payments to the dentists for the past years.brown claimed that detailed history was not only unnecessary to the alleged debt collection,but was also inaccurate.brown then requested that the dentists contact the credit reporting agencies to ask them to delete the information mortensen had provided.the dentists refused to do so and,in fact,made further disclosures to the credit reporting agency equifax.
following these events,the browns sued mortensen and the dentists.the browns amended their complaint four times.the fourth amended complaint alleged violations of cmia and,in the alternative only,violations of the fair debt collection practices act et fdcpa.the browns named mortensen in the third and fourth causes of action for violations of cmia,as well as in the fifth cause of action for violations of fdcpa.after considering defendants demurrers,the trial court dismissed with prejudice the browns third and fourth causes of action.the browns eventually dismissed with prejudice the fifth cause of action,which was the only remaining cause of action against mortensen.
on appeal,the browns challenge the trial court order dismissing the third and fourth causes of action.

standard of review 
we review de novo the trial court order of dismissal after sustaining a demurrer.on appeal from an order dismissing an action after the sustaining of a demurrer,we independently review the pleading to determine whether the facts alleged state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.chang lederman th.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.id.at.we read the complaint as a whole and its parts in context,giving the complaint a reasonable interpretation.stonehouse homes city of sierra madre th.when a demurrer is sustained with leave to amend but the plaintiff elects not to do so,we presume the complaint states as strong a case as the plaintiff can muster.citations.we will affirm if the trial court decision to sustain the demurrer was correct on any theory.citations.id.at.
uncertainty 
although the browns fourth amended complaint may not be a model of clarity,it is not fatally uncertain or confusing.it is clear from the caption of the complaint that the browns assert claims for violations of the cmia and,in the alternative,one claim for violations of the fdcpa.the title of the complaint states fourth amended complaint for damages and injunctive relief for violations of confidentiality of medical information act civil code et.and,in the alternative only violations of fair debt collection practices act et.the third and fourth causes of action allege violations of cmia those causes of action not only allege that the defendants violated cmia,but also allege that mortensen made unauthorized,unexcused disclosures of privileged medical information.see heller norcal mutual ins.cal th,subd.g.
each cause of action also states which party is bringing the claim and against whom it is directed.the third cause of action states it is by the two minor plaintiffs against mortensen individually and doing business as credit bureau services and does through.similarly,the fourth cause of action states it is by brown against mortensen individually and doing business as credit bureau services and does through.see cal.rules of court,rule.
mortensen claims the complaint is unclear as to which defendants made the alleged cmia violations.but,in the third and fourth causes of example,paragraphs,and of the fourth amended browns repeatedly allege that mortensen disclosed confidential medical information.although these causes of action also include general references to defendants,reading the complaint as a whole and its parts in context,we conclude the complaint is not impermissibly vague or confusing.stonehouse homes city of sierra madre,supra,th at.moreover,when a complaint is uncertain in some respects,the parties can clarify ambiguities during discovery.khoury maly of california,th.
preemption under the fair credit reporting act et.
mortensen argues that,even if the fourth amended complaint is not overly confusing or vague,the trial court order of dismissal should nonetheless be affirmed because the complaint fails to state a claim as a matter of law.mortensen asserts the browns cmia claims are preempted by the fair credit reporting act fcra et.we agree.the language of the fcra dictates that,because the browns cmia claims are based on mortensen alleged disclosure of information to consumer reporting agencies,those claims are preempted.although ou
