introduction 
plaintiff mui ung gave a promissory note,secured by a deed of trust on real property,to defendant henry koehler.some years after the note became due,defendant,claiming nonpayment,recorded a notice of default against the property in anticipation of a nonjudicial foreclosure sale.plaintiff filed this action to enjoin the sale,contending that the statutory time limit for exercising the power of sale in the deed of trust had expired.
at common law there was no time limitation on the exercise of the power of sale in a deed of trust.the legislature reversed that rule of law in when it passed the marketable record title act act,et which has been held in prior decisions to impose a time limit on such exercise of either or years from the final maturity date of the underlying debt.notwithstanding this authority,plaintiff argued that defendant right to nonjudicial foreclosure under the deed of trust expired four years,rather than or years,after the note became due.she premised this argument on a provision of the act,section,which had not been considered in the prior decisions.the trial court accepted her argument and granted summary adjudication precluding sale of plaintiff property under the deed of trust.
we conclude that the and time limits for the exercise of a power of sale in a deed of trust imposed by section are not overridden by section.further,we conclude that once the beneficiary of a deed of trust has become entitled to claim the time limit of section,subdivision a,the beneficiary does not lose that entitlement merely by filing a notice of default that specifies the final maturity date of the underlying debt.accordingly,we reverse the decision of the trial court.
ii.background 
plaintiff borrowed money from defendant in december.the loan was evidenced by a promissory note that was secured by a deed of trust to two real properties in oakland.the note matured on december.more than years after the note matured,on april,an agent for defendant recorded a notice of default against one of the two properties for which defendant held a deed of trust.soon after,plaintiff filed this lawsuit to prevent defendant from enforcing the security interest provided by the deed of trust,contending that the statutory time period for enforcement had long since expired.
plaintiff first filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent defendant from conducting a nonjudicial sale of the property.the trial court granted the motion in an extensive written opinion.the opinion first noted that there was no dispute that judicial foreclosure on the deed of trust was precluded by section,which extinguished that remedy upon expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the underlying promissory note.the trial court then turned to the availability of nonjudicial foreclosure.prior to passage of the act,the court noted,the law was clear that exercise of the power of sale in a deed of trust was not subject to any time limit at all.for the first time,the act established such time limits.as the court recognized,california decisions had held that one of the act provisions,section,subdivision a,imposes a time limit for nonjudicial foreclosure of either or years from the final maturity date of the debt.despite acknowledging these authorities,the trial court refused to follow them because they did not consider the effect of section.concluding that section,in concert with section,acts to extinguish the remedy of nonjudicial foreclosure upon expiration of the statute of limitations on the underlying debt,the trial court preliminarily enjoined defendant from conducting a nonjudicial sale of plaintiff property.
in response to subsequent for summary adjudication,the trial court reaffirmed its ruling,granted summary adjudication for plaintiff on her claims against defendant,and made its injunction against foreclosure permanent.because the trial court found that defendant time to foreclose had expired under section,it had no occasion to reach plaintiff alternative argument that defendant was entitled,at most,only to the expired time limit of section,subdivision a 
iii.discussion 
a.the time limits applicable to exercise of a power of sale 
defendant contends that,contrary to the ruling of the trial court,the applicable time limits for nonjudicial foreclosure under a deed of trust are set forth in section,subdivision a,and are unaffected by section.because there are no material factual issues in dispute and the trial court interpretation of the act is an issue of law,we review its ruling de novo.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.
the legal background 
the beneficiary of a deed of trust ordinarily has two means to enforce the security interest provided by the deed.first,code of civil procedure section expressly grants the beneficiary the right to bring an action for judicial foreclosure in the manner of a mortgage upon such property.code civ,see field acres cal d.in addition,if the deed of trust contains an express provision granting a power of deeds of trust invariably beneficiary may pursue nonjudicial foreclosure,often called a trustee sale,under the detailed regulatory provisions of sections through.moeller lien th,d huene cribb,power of sale must be express in the deed of trust.aside from the availability of this second remedy,deeds of trust have the same legal effect as a traditional mortgage.as a result,deeds of trust are often characterized as practically and substantially only mortgages with a power of sale monterey partnership bangham,cal d,quoting bank of italy.bentley cal,bank of italy.
historically,california law did not impose a time limit on nonjudicial foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale in a deed of trust,bank of italy,supra,cal.at,the statute of limitations never runs against the power of sale in a deed of trust.in,the legislature enacted section,which states,a lien is extinguished by the lapse of time within which a n action can be brought upon the principal obligation.although section was recognized as imposing a statute of limitations on judicial foreclosure of mortgages and other security interests,puckhaber henry cal,the statute almost immediately was held not to apply to nonjudicial foreclosure under a deed of trust.grant burr cal.retention of the right to nonjudicial enforcement was justified by the equitable principle that courts will not help the debtor to recover pledged or encumbered property unless he pays his debt.carson redevelopment agency adam d.carson redevelopment.
code of civil procedure section,which expressly authorizes judicial foreclosure of a deed of trust,was enacted in.the supreme court thereafter recognized that section extinguished the right to bring an action under section of the code of civil procedure for judicial foreclosure of a deed of trust upon expiration of the statute of limitations on the underlying debt,but the court reaffirmed the principle that exercise of the right of nonjudicial foreclosure was not subject to any time limit.flack boland cal d,flack.this rule of law continued unchallenged until the passage of the act,carson redevelopment,supra,d at.
there is no dispute that the act overturned the historic rule.chapter of the act,entitled ancient mortgages and deeds of trust,contains a provision stating that u nless the lien of a mortgage,deed of trust,or other instrument that creates a security interest of record in real property has earlier expired pursuant to section,the lien becomes unenforceable,by exercise of a power of sale or otherwise,either years from the final maturity date or the last date fixed for payment of the underlying debt or years from the date of recording of the security instrument,subd.a.subsequent decisions have applied section to impose a time limit on nonjudicial foreclosure under a deed of trust.nicolopulos superior court th,d nicolopulos miller provost th,d miller.miller held that section,subdivision a,permitted a power of sale to be exercised up to years from the recordation of a deed of trust,rejecting the argument that the power of sale should be treated as a lien for purposes section.miller,at,d.nicolopulos followed this interpretation of the act in rejecting an attempt to shorten the time periods in section through invocation of the doctrines of estoppel and laches.nicolopulos,at,d.
although both miller and nicolopulos would appear to be controlling here,plaintiff argues that the analysis in those cases is incomplete because it did not include consideration of a further provision of the act,section.the trial court accepted this argument,concluding that s ince neither miller nor nicolopulos considered and passed upon the application of section in this context,they are not controlling authorities.citation.
the impact of section 
section states expiration of the lien of a mortgage,deed of trust,or other security interest pursuant to this chapter or any other statute renders the lien unenforceable by any means commenced or asserted thereafter and is equivalent for all purposes to a certificate of satisfaction,reconveyance,release,or other discharge of the security interest,and execution and recording of a certificate of satisfaction,reconveyance,release,or other discharge is not necessary to terminate or evidence the termination of the security interest.nothing in this section precludes execution and recording at any time of a certificate of satisfaction,reconveyance,release,or other discharge.plaintiff does not press the argument,rejected in miller,that section limits nonjudicial foreclosure because the power of sale is a lien that expires pursuant to section.rather,she bases her argument on the undisputed fact that,as noted above,the lien created by the right of judicial foreclosure under a deed of trust is extinguished under section upon the expiration of the statute of limitations.applying the language of section,she argues that the expiration of that lien renders a deed of trust unenforceable by any means commenced or asserted thereafter,thereby precluding nonjudicial enforcement as well.
when engaged in statutory construction,our goal is to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.coachella valley mosquito vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,d,coachella valley,quoting hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.fitch select products cal th,d.when doing so we do not construe statutes in isolation rather,we construe every statute with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part,so that all may be harmonized and anomalies avoided.coachella valley,at,d.although courts are ordinarily instructed to give statutory words their usual,everyday meaning,that rule has an important exception w hen a word used in a statute has a legal meaning,it will be given that meaning in construing the statute.arnett dal cielo cal th,d,harris lammers th,d.
applying these principles,we find plaintiff argument untenable for two distinct reasons.first,the language of section,when given the meaning assigned it in a century worth of case law construing section,does not support plaintiff interpretation.second,plaintiff construction of section would effectively impose a time limit on the enforcement of powers of sale,thereby overriding the and time limitations so clearly established by section,subdivision a,and rendering that subdivision largely pointless.
turning first to the language of the statute,the impact of section in these circumstances turns on the meaning of the word lien.the section states that once the lien of a deed of trust has expired pursuant to the act or any other statute,the lien becomes unenforceable by any means.going back at least to flack in,and implicitly to grant burr in,california law has treated the lien created by a deed of trust,as that term is used in section,as including only the security interest enforceable through judicial foreclosure,while excluding the power of sale.an unbroken line of cases,continuing through miller,has affirmed this principle.
courts have squared this doctrine with the seemingly uncompromising language of section carson redevelopment,supra,d at.by citation to the anomalous nature of deeds of trust in this state.bank of italy,supra,cal.at.from the early days,california law treated traditional mortgages as establishing a security interest through imposition of a lien on the encumbered property,without affecting title to the property.in contrast,the execution of a deed of trust was deemed to establish a security interest by passing title to the encumbered property from the obligor to the beneficiary trustee.id.at.thus,the reference in section to a lien could be regarded as addressing the type of security interest created by a traditional mortgage but not that created by the power of sale in a deed of trust.because the legislature amended section in without giving any indication that it disapproved of the courts interpretation,we must assume that the legislature concurred in this distinctive treatment of deeds of trust see,coachella valley,supra,cal th at,d,when the legislature amends a statute without altering parts of the statute that have previously been judicially construed,the legislature is deemed to have been aware of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial construction.
this judicial history has important implications for the proper interpretation of the language of section.section does not state that when the lien of an instrument creating a security instrument expires,the security instrument itself becomes unenforceable rather,it states that when the lien of the instrument expires,the lien becomes unenforceable.in other words,section precludes enforcement of the security interest that has been statutorily extinguished,not necessarily the entire instrument creating the security interest.as discussed above,the reference to a lien in section has invariably been construed not to include the power of sale,which was deemed to create its security interest through passing title rather than imposing a lien.giving effect to this judicial understanding of the term lien in section,section must be construed as making unenforceable only the right of judicial enforcement under code of civil procedure section,the only interest that is extinguished by section.
plaintiff argues that the subsequent language of section,which states that extinction of the lien under section is equivalent for all purposes to a certificate of satisfaction,reconveyance,release,or other discharge of the security interest,effectively extinguishes the power of sale.as she points out,the recording of a deed of reconveyance would unquestionably prevent enforcement of any power of sale in the original deed of trust.like the language discussed above,however,this portion of section is consistent a legislative intent to extinguish only the security interest reached by section,not the entire deed of trust.as noted,it states that extinction under section is equivalent to documents creating a discharge of the security interest,not a discharge of the instrument creating the security interest.it adds nothing to plaintiff argument.
our interpretation is consistent with the remaining language of section,which gives no hint that it was intended to work a dramatic change on the preexisting law governing powers of sale.the operative language relied on by plaintiff,unenforceable by any means commenced or asserted thereafter,is only a portion of the statute.the predominant purpose of section is served by the remaining text,which states that extinguishment of a security interest as a matter of law shall have the same effect as the recordation of a certificate of satisfaction,reconveyance,release,or other discharge of the security interest the recordation of such a document is not necessary to terminate the security interest and the statute does not preclude the recordation of any of those documents.in other words,the bulk of section is concerned with automatically removing the cloud on title otherwise created by a recorded but expired security interest.save the phrase cited by plaintiff,nothing about the statute suggests it was intended to overrule a century of case law 
even if the language of section were ambiguous,plaintiff interpretation fails for the second and independent reason that its practical effect would be to replace the time limit of or years for the enforcement of a power of sale expressly established by section,subdivision a,with a time limit of four years,thereby reducing that section to virtual surplusage.
as noted above,the goal of statutory interpretation is to discern and implement the purpose of the legislature coachella valley,supra,cal th at,d,which requires reading every section of the statute in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.in re marriage of harris cal th,d.thus,t he intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.in re marriage of harris,at,d,quoting people pieters cal d.accordingly,courts must avoid a reading that renders a portion of the statute meaningless hassan mercy american river hospital,supra,cal th at,d,or leads to absurd consequences.bonnell medical board cal th,d.it is a safe assumption that in drafting a statute,the legislature intends neither to include blocks of language with no function nor to create legal absurdities.
plaintiff interpretation would render subdivision a of section virtual surplusage.as both miller and nicolopulos held,the language of section indicates that the statute was intended to end the unrestricted enforceability of a power of sale in deeds of trust by placing a time limit of either or years,as applicable,on the power enforcement.under plaintiff reading,the power of sale would become unenforceable at the same time the right of judicial foreclosure is extinguished by section.because the right of judicial foreclosure is ordinarily extinguished four years after the final maturity date of the underlying is,upon the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to contracts in writing code civ,this interpretation would cause powers of sale to become unenforceable four years after the debt matured.the time limits of and years specified in section would become irrelevant in nearly all cases the legislature is unlikely to have intended to grant holders of a power of sale an enforcement period of either or years in one section,only to snatch it back with the next.
the statutory history 
although our holdings on the language and structure of the act make it unnecessary to consult the statutory history bonnell medical board,supra,cal th at,d,we address that history because plaintiff cites it extensively in support of her interpretation.
the act was derived from a recommended text drafted by the california law revision commission law revision commission in.recommendation relating to marketable title of real property cal.law revision com.commission recommendation.as recommended by the law revision commission,the portion of the act dealing with ancient mortgages and deeds of trust current sections through an additional section,numbered.recommended section unambiguously extinguished the rights to both judicial and nonjudicial foreclosure,expressly including powers of sale,upon the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the underlying obligation.commission recommendation,at.recommended section,in turn,did not include the current language stating that expiration of the lien renders the lien unenforceable by any means instead,it included only the latter portions of the current section addressing certificates of satisfaction and other documents indicating release.commission recommendation,at.
had these provisions survived the legislature unscathed,defendant power of sale would clearly have been extinguished four years after december.they did not.although these provisions of the bill passed the assembly essentially as recommended by the law revision commission,they were amended by the senate.on june,the senate deleted recommended section in its entirety,thereby eliminating the provision stating unambiguously that a power of sale terminated upon expiration of the statute of limitations.slightly over a week later,by a separate amendment,the senate inserted the present phrase containing renders the lien unenforceable by any means into section.there is no contemporary commentary that explains the purpose of these changes.
the authoritative commentary on the act is the comment by the senate committee on judiciary committee,published with the final bill.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.committee comment.the committee comment on section states that s ection prescribes a maximum time for enforcement of a mortgage or deed of trust the section limits the time for exercise of a power of sale under a deed of trust,reversing the rule of case law that such a power of sale never outlaws.committee comment,at.this confirms the impression created by the language of the act that section was intended,in the form passed by the legislature,to impose time limits on the exercise of powers of contrast to the original proposal,in which section played that role.
the committee comment on section makes no mention of an intent to reverse the lack of time limits applicable to powers of sale,as one would expect if plaintiff interpretation accurately reflected legislative intent.rather,the comment states only that running of the enforcement period prescribed in section or any other statute such as section has the effect of complete discharge of the mortgage or deed of trust this reverses the rule that a mortgage or deed of trust barred by the statute of limitations may be equitably enforced.citations.committee comment,supra,at.plaintiff argues that the committee comment assertion that the running of the enforcement periods has the effect of complete discharge of the deed of trust should be taken to indicate the legislature intent to foreclose enforcement of the entire instrument upon the expiration of any time limit.on the other hand,as defendant points out,because the committee comment expressly refers to the running of the enforcement period in section as well as in section,the legislature could have intended that the time limits in both statutes would expire before the deed would be discharged.the language is consistent with either interpretation.
accordingly,the legislative history is at most ambiguous.aside from the reference in the committee comment to a complete discharge of the deed of trust,there is little in the legislative history that supports plaintiff interpretation.further,it is nearly impossible to square her construction of the act with the legislature deletion of a section of the original draft that unambiguously would have accomplished her purpose.because nothing in the legislative history is sufficiently convincing to overcome the relatively clear language of sections and,when interpreted in light of the judicial history of section,the trial court ruling that section overrides the time limits of section,subdivision a,must be reversed.
b.the effect of defendant recordation of a notice of default 
plaintiff contends that even if defendant power of sale did not become unenforceable through operation of section,it was subject to the time limit of section,subdivision a,rather than the time limit of subdivision a.because the period expired more than a year before defendant sought nonjudicial foreclosure,he would be under subdivision a.although the trial court found it unnecessary to reach this argument,it is appropriate for us to decide the question because it has been fully briefed by the parties,appears certain to arise on remand,and is an issue of law that can be decided on undisputed facts.code civ,see cobbs grant cal d.
