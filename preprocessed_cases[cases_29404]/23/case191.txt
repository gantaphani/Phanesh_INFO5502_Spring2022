this case presents an issue of first a party joined as a defendant to a counterclaim the additional may remove the case to federal court solely because the counterclaim satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.codified in scattered sections of title of the united states code.we hold that neither a west nor b west supp permits removal by such a party.
on june,palisades collection palisades,a delaware corporation,initiated a collection action in west virginia state court against charlene shorts,a west virginia resident,to recover in unpaid charges plus interest on shorts cellular phone service contract.
the contract,originally entered into with at t wireless services,provided that shorts would be charged a early termination fee if she defaulted on her payment obligations before the end of the contract.in october,cingular wireless cingular merged with at t wireless services,to become at t mobility attm.before her contract term expired,attm determined that shorts was in default on her account,terminated her service,and charged her the early termination fee.in june,attm assigned its right to collect on shorts default to palisades.
after palisades filed the collection action in state court,shorts filed an answer denying the complaint allegations.shorts also asserted a counterclaim against palisades,alleging unlawful,unfair,deceptive and fraudulent business act s and practices,in violation of the west virginia consumer credit protection act the act,as codified at ann.lexisnexis.at.almost one year later,the state court granted shorts leave to file a first amended counterclaim joining attm as an additional the amended counterclaim alleged that palisades and attm violated the act by systematically contract ing for,charg ing,attempt ing to collect,and collect ing illegal default charges in excess of the amounts allowed by west virginia code a and impos ing unconscionable charges in violation of.at.
shorts filed a motion for class certification,seeking to represent a class of individuals under similar contracts with cingular and attm,but before the state court could rule on that motion,attm removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia.in response,shorts filed a motion to remand,arguing that attm could not remove the case because it was not a defendant pursuant to the general removal statute.the district court granted shorts motion and remanded the case to state court,concluding that attm could not remove the case to federal court because it was not a defendant for purposes of removal under,palisades collections shorts,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,and cafa does not create independent removal authority that would allow attm to circumvent the requirement that only a true defendant may remove a case to federal court,id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
we granted attm permission to appeal,and we possess jurisdiction to review the district court remand order under c.
attm makes two principal arguments.first,in its notice of removal,attm contended that the case is removable under the general removal statute,second,on appeal,attm now argues that,even if does not permit removal by additional,b,added by cafa,constitutes a separate removal power authorizing attm to remove.attm also makes an additional argument that,if neither nor b permits removal by additional,then we should realign the parties to make attm a traditional defendant.
attm first two arguments raise questions concerning removal to federal court and issues of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.payne ex rel.estate of calzada brake,cir questions concerning removal united states abuagla,cir issues of statutory interpretation.in resolving this case,we are mindful that federal courts,unlike most state courts,are courts of limited jurisdiction,created by congress with specified jurisdictional requirements and limitations.strawn v.at t mobility,cir.and,we are likewise cognizant that w e must not give jurisdictional statutes a more expansive interpretation than their text warrants,but it is just as important not to adopt an artificial construction that is narrower than what the text provides.exxon mobil allapattah,d citation omitted.

before turning to the issues raised in this appeal,an overview of the relevant jurisdictional statutes is appropriate to place the following discussion in context.
the general removal statute,provides that any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants,to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.a emphasis added.section of title of the united states code establishes the procedures for removal of a case under.see west.
through cafa,congress expanded federal diversity jurisdiction by amending to give federal district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,and is a class action in which a any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.d west.
in addition to amending,congress also added b,which provides 
a class action may be removed to a district court of the united states in accordance with except that the limitation under section b shall not apply,without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is brought,except that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.
for purposes of b,congress defined a class action as any civil action filed under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure or similar state statute or rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought by or more representative persons as a class action.d b see a explaining that,for purposes of,a class action has the meaning given in d.
section b eliminates at least three of the traditional limitations on removal the rule that,in a diversity case,a defendant can not remove a case from its home forum,b the rule that a defendant can not remove a diversity case once it has been pending in state court for more than a year,b and the rule that all defendants must consent to removal,chicago,rock island pac.ry.martin.concluding that all the defendants must join in the application for removal payne ex rel.estate of calzada,at failure of all defendants to join in the removal petition is an error in the removal process.see,progressive ins.preciado,cir see also,at,reprinted in,section establishes the procedures for removal of interstate class actions over which the federal court is granted original jurisdiction in new section d.the general removal provisions currently contained in chapter of title would continue to apply to class actions,except where they are inconsistent with the provisions of the act.for example,like other removed actions,matters removable under this bill may be removed only to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.
accordingly,with this framework in place,we now turn to attm arguments.
in its notice of removal,attm contended that a,which permits removal of a civil action over which the federal district courts have original jurisdiction by the defendant or the defendants,permits attm,an additional,to remove the case to federal court.we do not agree.
in shamrock oil gas sheets,the supreme court considered the question of whether the suit in which a counterclaim is filed is one removable by the original plaintiff to the federal district court,id.at,under the statutory predecessor to a,which provided that an action may be removed by the defendant or defendants therein to the district court of the united states for the proper district,id.at.although the court acknowledged that,between and,the removal statute allowed either party to remove the suit to federal court,id.at,the court concluded that congress narrow ed the federal jurisdiction on removal by amending the statute in to allow removal only by the defendant or defendants in the suit,id.at.noting that interpretation of removal statutes call ed for strict construction,id.at,the court thus held that the original plaintiff against whom the original defendant had filed a counterclaim could not remove the case to federal court under a predecessor.
for more than fifty years,courts applying shamrock oil have consistently refused to grant removal power under a to who are not the original plaintiffs but who would be able to exercise removal power under attm interpretation.see cross country bank mcgraw,d,noting that district courts within the fourth circuit have adopted the majority rule that a defendant is distinct from the defendant or defendants who are permitted to remove cases pursuant to a,owens,d,the majority view,that defendants are not defendants for purposes of removal under a,is the better rule.hayduk ups,nearly every court that has considered the question whether may remove under a has determined that they may not.croy buckeye int l,the overwhelming weight of authority indicates that a third party defendant is not entitled to removal of an entire case to federal court under a.manternach jones county farm serv,noting that courts are not in disagreement as to the of a claim under a.
as the sixth circuit more recently explained,a lthough shamrock oil is not dispositive of the precise issue before us,it does dictate that the phrase the defendant or the defendants,as used in a,be interpreted narrowly,to refer to defendants in the traditional sense of parties against whom the original plaintiff asserts claims.first bank of pulaski curry,cir noting that the american law institute has recommended that congress make clear what the present law merely implies the right of removal applies only to the action as framed by the pleading that commences the action.counterclaims,and claims can not be the basis for removal under a see also florence abm,d,i n adopting the current language of the removal statute,congress intended to restrict removal jurisdiction solely to the defendant to the main claim.
of course,additional,like defendants,are certainly not defendants against whom the original plaintiff asserts claims.thus,we easily conclude that an additional is not a defendant for purposes of a.see,capitalsource,thi of columbus,d,concluding that additional counterclaim defendants are not defendants within the meaning of the removal statute.and do not have statutory authority to remove this case dartmouth plan,delgado,but just as a has no special rights to remove,neither does a nonplaintiff.a counterdefendant is not a defendant joined in the original action and therefore not a party that can remove a state action to federal court.tindle ledbetter,noting that because the justices,who were joined as defendants on the counterclaim under louisiana procedural equivalent to.h,are additional counterclaim defendants,they can not remove this suit to federal court see also james moore et,moore federal practice b iv ed noting that the better view is that,defendants,and defendants are not defendants within the meaning of a.
congress has shown the ability to clearly extend the reach of removal statutes to include,defendants,or defendants,see a west a party may remove any claim or cause of action related to bankruptcy cases.emphasis added.in crafting a,however,congress made the choice to refer only to the defendant or the defendants,a choice we must respect.thus,attm,as an additional,may not remove the case to federal court under a this conclusion is consistent with the principle that w e are obliged to construe removal jurisdiction strictly because of the significant federalism concerns implicated and that if federal jurisdiction is doubtful,a remand to state court is necessary.stadium auth.ellerbe becket,cir internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted see also shamrock oil,at.due regard for the rightful independence of state governments,which should actuate federal courts,requires that they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute has defined.internal quotation marks omitted.
perhaps anticipating our conclusion that an additional may not remove under a,attm argues that b provides a removal power independent of that conferred in a.attm further argues that,under the broad language of b,any defendant,including a,may exercise that removal power.we need not decide whether b grants such a power because,even assuming that b grants a power of removal,attm,as an additional,may not exercise this power.
attm argues that the broad language of b permits an additional to remove a class action to federal court for two reasons.first,attm contends that because b provides only that a class action may be removed to a district court,it does not limit the parties entitled to remove.second,attm contends that,in overriding several traditional limitations on removal,b twice refers to any defendant,a phrase it believes is broad enough to include.
we find neither argument convincing.first,attm contention that b grants it removal power because it does not expressly limit the parties who may remove simply does not comport with the language of b when the statute is read in its entirety.given that the only reference in the statute as to a party who may remove is to a defendant,and that the statute states that the class action may be removed in accordance with,which specifically provides procedures for a defendant or defendants to remove cases to federal court,see a,we think that congress clearly did not intend to extend the right of removal to parties other than defendant s.and,as discussed in section,defendant in the removal context is understood to mean only the original defendant 
second,the use of the phrase any defendant also does not grant removal power to additional.section b uses any defendant stating that a class action may be removed without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is brought and then stating that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.b emphasis added.the first provision eliminates the defendant restriction on removal found in b,which is the rule that diversity actions shall be removable only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought.b.of course,under the normal rules of statutory construction,the same terms should have the same meaning in different sections of the same statute.larue dewolff,boberg,d internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.thus,given that we have already concluded that defendant in a means only an original defendant,we must likewise conclude that defendant in b means only an original defendant.because we presume that congress legislated consistently with existing law and with the knowledge of the interpretation that courts have given to the existing statute,strawn,at,that the first reference to defendant in b is in relation to b defendant rule only reinforces our conclusion that defendant in b also means only the original defendant.blockbuster,galeno.cir it is true that congress displayed in cafa an aim to broaden certain aspects of federal jurisdiction for class actions.however,we think that,rather than evincing an intent to make as drastic a change to federal jurisdiction as blockbuster proposes,cafa detailed modifications of existing law show that congress appreciated the legal backdrop at the time it enacted this legislation.
the statute use of the word any to modify defendant does not alter our conclusion that additional may not remove under b because the use of the word any can not change the meaning of the word defendant.likewise,b second use of the phrase any defendant,such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants,b emphasis added,eliminates the rule of unanimous consent for removal the use of the word any juxtaposed with the word all was intended to convey the idea of,not to alter the definition of the word defendant.
put simply,there is no indication in the language of b or in the limited legislative history that congress intended to alter the traditional rule that only an original defendant may remove and to somehow transform an additional like attm into a defendant with the power to remove.reading b to also allow removal by,defendants,and defendants is simply more than the language of b can bear.
thus,we conclude that attm,as an additional,does not have a right to remove under either a or b.again,this conclusion is consistent with our duty to construe removal jurisdiction strictly and resolve doubts in favor of remand see.stadium,at.
in an effort to overcome this plain language,attm stresses that i t is inconceivable that congress intended to leave a large category of class actions in state court.appellants br.at.but,d itself leaves many class actions in state courts,see,luther countrywide home loans servicing,cir affirming remand of a class action to state court preston tenet healthsystem mem l med,cir same,and although we are cognizant of the fact that congress clearly wished to expand federal jurisdiction through cafa,we also recognize that it is our duty,as a court of law,to interpret the statute as it was written,not to rewrite it as attm believes congress could have intended to write it.if congress intended to make the sweeping change in removal practice that attm suggests by altering the rule that only a defendant may remove and that defendant in the context of removal means only the original defendant,it should have plainly indicated that intent.
finally,attm argues that,if neither nor b permits removal by an additional,then the parties should be realigned so that attm is deemed a defendant with the right of removal.appellants br.at.because the question of realignment concerns removal,and removal jurisdiction and realignment are not severable for the purpose of determining the proper standard of review,fid.guar.thomas solvent,cir,we also review the district court refusal to realign the parties de novo.should our inquiry involve factual determinations made by the district court,we review those determinations for clear error.prudential real estate affiliates,ppr realty,cir.
in determining whether to realign parties,we apply the principal purpose test first,we determine the primary issue in controversy,and then we align the parties according to their positions with respect to the primary issue.united states fid.guar.v.a s,cir.the determination of the primary and controlling matter in dispute does not include the and counterclaims filed by the defendants.instead,it is to be determined by plaintiff principal purpose for filing its suit.zurn,acton constr,cir emphasis added.
here,palisades principal purpose in filing the suit was to collect shorts debt.on that issue,palisades and shorts were properly aligned.thus,like the district court,we conclude that realignment was inappropriate.
we reiterate that our holding today is narrow under both a and b,a may not remove a class action counterclaim to federal court.congress is presumed to know the current legal landscape against which it legislates,and we are merely applying those established legal rules.if congress wants to overturn such precedent,it should do so expressly.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is hereby 
palisades collections llc,a collection agency,commenced this action in west virginia state court by filing a debt collection case against charlene shorts for a debt incurred by shorts under her cell phone service contract with at t mobility llc.shorts filed a class action counterclaim against palisades collections and joined at t mobility llc and at t mobility corporation collectively at t as defendants.in the class action counterclaim,shorts purported to represent citizens of west virginia,alleging that at t cell phone service contracts violated the west virginia consumer credit and protection act,et and demanding over million in damages.
relying on the class action fairness act of cafa,stat,at t removed the case to federal court.see d,b.
on shorts motion,the district court remanded the case to the west virginia state court from which it was removed.the court found that shorts counterclaim class action met all of the jurisdictional requirements of cafa embodied in d inasmuch as shorts purported to represent a class of west virginia customers well over the cafa minimum of class members the class claimed in the aggregate a minimum of million in damages well over the cafa minimum of million and minimum diversity,as required by d a,existed.most of the class members are west virginia citizens,whereas at t is a citizen of georgia and delaware,and palisades collections is a citizen of new jersey and delaware.see c.the district court also found inapplicable cafa exception,which only applies when most class members have the same citizenship as one of the defendants.see d.although the district court thus found that it had removal jurisdiction under d,it nonetheless held that cafa did not give at t,as a counterclaim defendant,removal authority under b.
at t filed this interlocutory appeal under c,challenging the district court ruling that because at t was a counterclaim defendant,it did not have removal authority under cafa.shorts supports the district court conclusion that cafa did not provide at t with removal authority and also challenges the district court finding of removal jurisdiction under d.
the majority opinion agrees with the district court that a counterclaim defendant is not granted authority under cafa,b,to remove a class action that otherwise meets the jurisdictional requirements of d,and therefore it does not reach shorts jurisdictional argument.
for the reasons stated in this opinion,i conclude that cafa does indeed authorize at t to remove this interstate class action,even though at t was sued as a counterclaim defendant,not as an original defendant.section b,added by cafa,expanded removal authority,conferring on any defendant the right to remove a class action.and removal jurisdiction exists under d and,as found by the district court.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
removal authority 
removal of a case from state court to federal court is generally proper when the federal court has removal jurisdiction and the removing party has removal authority.since the majority rests its judgment entirely upon at t purported lack of removal authority,i begin with that issue.
the majority holds that at t may not remove the class action filed against it because,and only because,at t was sued as an additional defendant in a counterclaim,as distinct from being named an original defendant in an independent action.it concludes that because at t is a counterclaim defendant,it does not fall within the language may be removed by any defendant of b emphasis added.the majority conclusion,i respectfully submit,is demonstrably at odds with this broad language.
section a states the general rule for removal authority,that civil actions,of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants.a emphasis added.this language is the basis for both the rule that all defendants must unanimously consent to removal,see chicago,rock island pac.ry.martin,and the rule that only original defendants can remove,see shamrock oil gas sheets.but b,which was added by cafa,provides a different rule for removal of class actions over which the district court has removal jurisdiction.it states that a class action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants emphasis added.this language expands removal authority in the cafa context.
shorts and the majority agree that b does expand removal authority,but just not far enough to reach the present case.for example,b expands removal authority by allowing removal without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is brought.they acknowledge that this modifies b rule,which denies removal authority whenever at least one defendant resides in the state whose court has the case.
similarly,i submit that b,in authorizing removal by any defendant,also expands removal authority beyond the limits of a so that it includes any defendant joined as an additional defendant to a counterclaim,as well as any counterclaim defendant.as the supreme court has repeatedly noted,r ead naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning,that is,one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.ali fed.bureau of prisons,d quoting united states gonzales,d quoting webster third new international dictionary.a counterclaim defendant is certainly a kind of defendant and falls easily within indiscriminately of whatever kind of defendant.the plain language of b thus gives at t,as a kind of defendant,authority to remove the class action in this case from state court to federal court.
both shorts and the majority argue that we should read the word any narrowly,based upon the exclusive congressional purpose perceived to exist behind the entire clause.but neither shorts nor the majority cite any statutory language or legislative history to support their articulation of cafa exclusive purpose in authorizing any defendant to remove a class action.they maintain simply that in using any defendant in b,congress intended to overrule only the requirement that defendants must unanimously consent to removal.see martin,at.and in making this point,they argue that the any defendant language of b,for some unexplained reason,does not modify the rule announced in shamrock oil,at,that counterclaim defendants who are also plaintiffs can not remove under a.
i agree with shorts and the majority that b any defendant language expands removal authority by abolishing martin unanimous consent rule in the cafa context.but i maintain that the same clause also abolishes the shamrock oil rule for cafa purposes.not only is the language of b clear here,but also both shamrock oil and martin were based on the exact same language in a predecessor it seems implausible at best that the b language abolished the martin rule while leaving untouched the shamrock oil rule,especially when both rules depended on the same language.
in both martin and shamrock oil,the supreme court based its holding on the statutory interpretation of the wording the defendant or defendants in a prior codifications,the codification at the time of shamrock oil,and act of august,stat,ch,the location at the time of martin the martin court found the unanimity rule plain 
it thus appears on the face of the statute that if a suit arises under the constitution or laws of the united states,or if it is a suit between citizens of different states,the defendant,if there be but one,may remove,or the defendants,if there be more than one.
and in view of the language of the statute we think the proper conclusion is that all the defendants must join in the application 
at.emphasis added.and shamrock oil relied upon congress deliberate replacement in of either party with the defendant or defendants in finding that counterclaim defendants who are also plaintiffs can not remove.see at.
even though both the unanimity rule of martin and the original defendant rule of shamrock oil derive from the same language in a,the majority asserts that b any defendant language abolishes one but not the other.we should hesitate before attributing such acrobatic skill to congress.
shorts and the majority contend that defendant should be read consistently throughout and and that because the defendant in a refers to the original defendant,any defendant in b should also refer to the original defendant.see,ante at.but reading defendant consistently does not mean we must read any defendant in b the same as the defendant or the defendants in a.surely one is not construing defendant differently when one finds any defendant has a different meaning from the defendant or the defendants.the article the restricts the noun that follows,while the article any expands its meaning.see reid angelone,cir accord apotex,the has a narrowing effect,while any would have a broadening effect.moreover,the majority seems to recognize the difference in meaning between any defendant and the defendant when it states that any defendant overrules the martin rule,which had depended on the phrase,the defendant.see ante at.
the majority assertion that in both a and b the word defendant means only original defendant is both puzzling and potentially unsettling to existing interpretations of jurisdictional statutes.the majority opinion applies the logic that because the defendant in a refers to the original defendant,as held by shamrock oil,any defendant must likewise mean only original defendant because both terms use the word defendant.i conclude that the majority takes this misstep only in an effort to import the shamrock oil rule into the cafa context.yet,shamrock oil did not state that the word defendant itself means original defendant.rather,it held that the defendant or defendants,when adopted by congress to replace either party in the earlier statute,refers to the original defendant and not a counterclaim defendant who was also the plaintiff.at.
the majority contends additionally that the language following any defendant,which provides that a class action may be removed without the consent of all defendants,was the basis by which b overruled martin.to reach this conclusion,the majority finds that the text without the consent of all defendants somehow reads back and narrows the meaning of any defendant.but such a reading is not grammatically supportable.the without the consent of all defendants language does not restrict any defendant,but rather expands removal authority without the consent of all defendants modifies the verb may be removed and not the noun any defendant,thus eliminating the requirement that at t get the consent of all defendants,a group that undoubtedly would include shorts,who clearly did not want the case removed.
the error in the majority reading of without the consent of all defendants becomes apparent when one takes the full clause of b and substitutes for any the supreme court definition of any,and for the parties,the names of the parties in this case.thus,the full clause of b would provide that the class action may be removed by one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind of defendant which includes the counterclaim defendant at t without the consent of all defendants which includes the defendant shorts.
shorts and the majority argue that in adopting their construction of a and b they are following the canon that courts strictly construe federal jurisdictional statutes and that their construction,in denying at t removal authority,eliminates the possibility of removal by all counterclaim defendants in qualifying class actions.but in purportedly applying the canon,they overlook the fact that the canon can not defeat the plain meaning of the statutory language.we must not give jurisdictional statutes a more expansive interpretation than their text warrants but it is just as important not to adopt an artificial construction that is narrower than what the text provides.exxon mobil allapattah,d citation omitted.moreover,the canon applies with less force in this case because the justifications for the canon are not present in view of congress explicit purposes for enacting cafa.
the supreme court first annunciated the canon of strict interpretation of federal jurisdictional statutes in healy ratta,and reiterated it as an additional basis for its ruling in shamrock oil.in both shamrock oil and healy,the court gave two reasons for applying the canon of strict construction.first,the court observed that successive acts of congress had constricted federal jurisdiction,evincing a clear congressional policy to narrow federal jurisdiction.see shamrock oil,at.healy,at.second,in both shamrock oil and healy,the court stated that federalism principles required strict construction of encroachment on state court jurisdiction.shamrock oil,at.healy,at.
but neither of these rationales applies with any force in this case.first,cafa unquestionably expanded federal jurisdiction and liberalized removal authority,see johnson advance america,cash advance centers of south carolina,cir,thus reversing the restrictive federal jurisdiction policies of congress that both healy and shamrock oil listed as the primary justification for application of the canon.second,cafa addresses the federalism principle,stating that congress intended the extension of federal jurisdiction over large interstate class actions and liberalization of removal to further the proper balance of federalism and restore the intent of the framers of the united states constitution by providing for federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance under diversity jurisdiction.cafa b,stat.johnson.unlike the generalized legislative history referenced in shamrock oil and healy and by the majority,this stated purpose for expanding federal jurisdiction and liberalizing removal in the cafa context is part of the statutory text,and federal courts surely have an obligation to heed it.
the supreme court recently relied upon similar statutory statements of findings and purposes in rejecting an artificial reading of the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa.in merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith dabit,d,the court interpreted the words in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,as contained in slusa.the plaintiff dabit argued for an artificially narrow reading of the words,premised on the canon against finding federal preemption of state law.id.at.that canon,like the canon of strict interpretation of jurisdictional statutes,derived partly from federalism concerns.but,based largely on slusa purposes,as stated in slusa,the court unanimously gave the statute its natural reading,even though that reading had the effect of significantly preempting more state law.id.at.under a similar analysis,this court should give any defendant used in b its natural reading.
i conclude that the plain language of b grants removal authority to at t in this case.section b any defendant language could not have overruled one rule derived from the phrase the defendants in a but not another rule derived from the same statutory language in the same statute.and when one also considers the expansive meaning given to any by the supreme court,the natural reading of the plain language of b unambiguously grants at t removal authority.
ii.removal jurisdiction 
because i conclude that at t has removal authority,i must also determine whether the district court correctly found it had removal jurisdiction.
section d confers original jurisdiction on district courts over any civil action in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,and is a class in which any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.d a.the district court concluded and shorts acknowledges that the class action counterclaim in this case meets the requirements of d insofar as it alleges the jurisdictional amount million and diversity of citizenship minimal diversity.shorts contends,however,that the class action counterclaim in this case is not any civil action over which d grants jurisdiction to district courts.she states,a counterclaim is not a civil action.rather,a civil action arises from the plaintiff original claims,citing federal rule of civil procedure a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.
in state court,palisades collections,as a plaintiff,filed a collection claim against shorts,as a defendant.shorts,as a counterclaim plaintiff,then filed a class action against palisades collections,as a counterclaim defendant,and against at t,as an additional defendant joined under the west virginia analog to federal rule of civil procedure h.see.note to amendment the party pleading the claim is to be regarded as a plaintiff and the additional parties as plaintiffs or defendants as the case may be.thus,while palisades collections is the plaintiff and shorts the defendant in the original collection action,shorts is the class action plaintiff,representing class plaintiffs against palisades collections and at t,as class action defendants.i conclude that shorts claim on behalf of against palisades collections and at t is a class action over which cafa confers jurisdiction.
in using the term any civil action in d,where congress granted jurisdiction to the district courts in cafa,congress used a term of art created by the federal rules of civil procedure to merge all actions and causes of actions,whether claims for damages,injunctive relief,and other relief,and whether at law or in equity.with that merger,a plaintiff now claims,in one action,without stating separate causes of action,claims for damages,injunctive relief and other relief.see.there is one form of civil action.
the effect of this rule was to streamline all pleading by eliminating the numerous earlier requirements such as stating causes of action and transferring claims between law and equity.at the same time rule was adopted,the advisory committee provided an instructional note to the rule reference to actions at law or suits in equity in all statutes should now be treated as referring to the civil action prescribed in these rules.note emphasis added.congress complied with this instruction when referring in d to a class action as a civil action.
that a class action in whatever form is a civil action was indicated early by the supreme court soon after it adopted the rules in.as the court stated,the class suit was an invention of equity to enable it to proceed to a decree in suits where the number of those interested in the subject of the litigation is so great that their joinder as parties in conformity to the usual rules of procedure is impracticable.hansberry lee.thus,the class action,once a form of suit in equity,became with the enactment of rule,a civil action.indeed,the text of rule,regulating class actions generally,confirms this.see.c a whether to certify the action as a class action id.d conducting the action id.d in conducting an action under this rule id.d b i any step in the action id.d b iii otherwise come into the action id.g a ii the types of claims asserted in the action emphases added throughout.as recognized in hansberry lee from the history of class actions,a class action is available in conformity with the usual rules of procedure as practicable,whether by complaint,counterclaim,or claim.indeed,shorts herself must recognize this as she brought her class action as a counterclaim.
shorts,of course,does not maintain that her class action counterclaim is barred simply because she brought it as a counterclaim.she undertook,in filing the class action,to seek certification of the action as a class action.see west virginia rule c a containing the same language as the federal rules counterpart.that rule provides that the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.this applies to shorts class action counterclaim.shorts therefore can not credibly claim that her class action counterclaim is not an action and thus a civil action under rule.
courts have reached a similar conclusion in the context of,which authorizes the removal of a civil action against federal officers and agencies.implementing the authority granted by,which authorizes removal of a civil action commenced in a state court against a federal official or agency,courts hav
