this appeal involves a final order of the united states tax court finding that george green green failed to properly report settlement proceeds as taxable income and improperly deducted certain expenditures and losses as business expenses and losses.the tax court also sustained the commissioner assessment of penalties for these deficiencies.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the income at issue in this case resulted from a whistleblower lawsuit that green brought against the texas department of human services tdhs,the failure of the state of texas to pay the resulting judgment,and ultimately,a monetary settlement between green and texas.the following facts,except where noted,are taken from the tax court findings of fact.
whistleblower lawsuit 
while working as an architect for tdhs,green came to believe that officials with tdhs were engaged in a pattern of fraud and corruption.green discussed the misconduct with his supervisors,and when they failed to act,he advised numerous tdhs employees that he intended to report the misconduct to authorities outside of the department.on december,green was fired for allegedly abusing sick leave,falsifying official documents,and misusing his business phone 
on march,green filed suit against tdhs under the texas whistleblower act.green suit was tried before a jury in august and september of.the jury found that green was fired in retaliation for reporting misconduct at tdhs,and awarded green in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on october,the trial court entered judgment in favor of green in the amount of 
green efforts to collect the judgment 
after the entry of the judgment in october,texas failed to pay green any portion of the judgment awarded in,after discharging his trial attorney,green instituted legal proceedings and attempted to secure a legislative appropriation to obtain satisfaction of the judgment.his efforts were unavailing.
in february of,to assist him in the collection of the judgment,green hired new counsel,john augustine augustine,and a team of consultants to help him by raising public consciousness of his plight and getting the attention of lawmakers.in order to fund the collection attempts,green sold an interest in of his ultimate recovery,if any,to james king king for.in,green formed green capital green capital and ts capital asset,llc ts capital for the purpose of employing consultants and advisers,including legal consultants,publicists,and other professionals,to attempt to collect the judgment from texas.in connection with these businesses,green maintained an office.
during and,green filed abstracts of judgments in several counties against texas,all of which were unsuccessful in securing payment.green and his representatives attempted to influence public opinion with newspaper articles,magazine articles,and television broadcasts about green struggle to obtain satisfaction of his judgment.green also filed a declaratory judgment action in a texas trial court against texas and the attorney general.additionally,green attempted to secure a legislative appropriation to pay the judgment.in,two bills were introduced during the regular session of the texas legislature to appropriate funds to satisfy the judgment,but neither of the bills were enacted.
during this time,green was involved in a lawsuit with allied interests,allied,in which green was being sued for expenses owed to allied for services it rendered in connection with green attempt to collect the judgment.in,a judgment in favor of allied was entered against green and green capital.in,green paid allied,including punitive damages of,in satisfaction of allied judgment.
between and,while engaged in his efforts to collect the judgment,green mental and physical health deteriorated significantly,requiring repeated hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer.
settlement 
after the legislature failed to appropriate funds for payment of the judgment,green approached the legislature budget board lbb.green and augustine worked with lieutenant governor bob bullock bullock,the chairman of the lbb,in order to convince the lbb that an emergency warranted the issuance of a budget execution order authorizing tdhs to expend funds to satisfy the taxpayer judgment.green met with bullock on several occasions to discuss green unsuccessful efforts to collect the judgment and his continued stress and failing health.augustine informed bullock that green was willing to negotiate some sort of settlement and that at that point,the judgment had reached over because of the accruing interest.
although not noted by the tax court,the foreman of the jury in the whistleblower lawsuit,richard fogg fogg,also advocated on green behalf.fogg attended one of bullock meetings with green and discussed green ongoing health problems stemming from the collection of the judgment.during this meeting,bullock told green and fogg that there was enough money in the state treasury to pay you for what you went through.
green and texas entered into a written release and settlement agreement settlement agreement dated november.augustine and harry potter,iii potter,a special assistant attorney general for texas,were responsible for drafting the agreement.in relevant part,the settlement agreement provided 
the state shall make a cash payment of to plaintiff for damages for loss of earning capacity,mental anguish and suffering past and suffering future,in accordance with the findings specified and incorporated into the final judgment in cause.paragraph four

on november,green received a payment for.green received per month from january,through december,under the first annuity,and per month during the same period from the second annuity.additionally,in january,green received the final payments of and under the respective annuities.the total amount paid under paragraphs five and six of the settlement agreement was.
green tax returns 
on his federal tax return,green excluded the payment of that he received under a of the internal revenue code code,which provides an exclusion for damages received on account of personal injury or sickness.on his federal tax returns for,and,green reported the annual payment of per month from the second annuity,made under paragraph six of the settlement agreement,as taxable income.in those three years,green did not report the per month received under the first annuity and paragraph five as taxable.in statements attached to the and returns green asserted that the was not taxable because it represented additional damages other than punitive and interest and is excluded from income under a of the code.green did not report the payments of and as taxable income on his tax return for.instead,he attached a statement to his return claiming that the constituted additional damages received from texas and that the constituted all other damages and asserting that both payments were excludable under a of the code.
for each of the years through,green claimed losses with respect to his interests in green capital ts capital.these claimed losses arose from expenses incurred by green in attempting to collect his judgment and defend himself in the allied litigation.such expenses consisted of,among other things,payments to attorneys and consultants and office expenses.green deducted all of these expenses as trade or business expenses under of the code.as a result of the claimed losses,totaling,green reported no tax due for any years at issue except,for which green reported a tax due of.
in july,green filed amended federal income tax returns for the years,and.on the amended returns,green claimed that of reported income was not includable as income under a.this resulted in green requesting a refund of for.
legal proceedings 
upon auditing green return,the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner issued two notices of deficiency to green,one for through,and one for.the commissioner determined that all of the payments received by taxpayer from texas during the years at issue were includable in green income.the commissioner also disallowed all losses claimed by green with respect to his interests in green capital and ts capital for the years at issue.in addition,the commissioner determined that green was liable for penalties under a of the code for all of the years at issue.
green filed two petitions in the tax court seeking redetermination of the deficiencies.the commissioner conceded that the received by the taxpayer under paragraph four of the settlement agreement,which provided for the payment of compensatory damages to taxpayer,was excludable from his gross income under a of the code.as to the excludability of the payments under paragraphs five and six of the settlement agreement the deductibility of the business expenses and the appropriateness of the penalties,the tax court conducted a trial.
first,the tax court found that green had failed to establish that paragraph five of the settlement agreement was intended to compensate green for personal injuries or sickness arising out of the whistleblower lawsuit.the court found that all compensatory damages awarded in the final judgment of the whistleblower lawsuit were expressly allocated in paragraph of the settlement agreement.accordingly,green was required to include in gross income the in payments he received under paragraph five of the settlement agreement for additional damages during the years in issue.second,the court found that the payments made under paragraph six of the settlement agreement were not excludable from green income under a of the code.third,the court concluded that green losses and expenses resulting from green capital and ts capital,were not deductible under of the code as trade or business expenses,but instead were only deductible under of the code as expenses related to the production or collection of income.the court found that green payment of punitive damages to allied was not deductible under either section.finally,the court held that green was liable for penalties under of the code because he had no reasonable basis for excluding from his income the full amount of payments under the settlement agreement.green timely appealed the decision of the tax court.

iii.analysis 
green argues the following on appeal the tax court erred in finding that the payments under paragraph five of the settlement agreement were not excludable income under a of the code the tax court erred in concluding that the expenses incurred by green in collecting the judgment and the punitive damages paid to allied are not deductible as business expenses under of the code and the tax court erred in concluding that green was liable for penalties.green conceded at oral argument that the tax court was correct in finding that the payments received by green under paragraph six of the settlement agreement were not excludable from green income.we address the remaining issues in turn.
a and payments made under paragraph five of the settlement agreement 
paragraph five of the settlement agreement provided that t he state shall fund annuities for additional damages associated with the final judgment in green whistleblower case.emphasis added at issue is whether the in payments for additional damages under paragraph five are excludable under a code as damages received on account of personal injury or sickness.the tax court finding that green failed to establish that payments under paragraph five were allocable to personal injury or sickness is a finding of fact that we review for clear error.see robinson comm r,cir srivastava comm r,cir we review the allocations made by the tax court only for clear error,overruled on other grounds by comm r banks,d.
green argues that the payments are excludable under a of the code.that section states,in relevant part,that gross income does not include any damages received whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments on account of personal injury or sickness.the supreme court has held that amounts are excludable under a only when the underlying cause of action giving rise to the recovery is based on tort or tortlike rights and the damages were received on account of personal injury or sickness.comm r schleier,d see also chamberlain united states,cir.to constitute damages received on account of personal injury,an amount must be awarded by reason of or because of personal injury,and must compensate a victim for the loss of personal or financial capital.chamberlain,at see also united states,d.there is no dispute that the claims underlying green claims were,or that green suffered personal injury.thus,the issue is whether green satisfied prong two requirement that the payments under paragraph five for additional damages were received on account of green personal injuries or sickness.
when determining the tax treatment of a settlement,we must ask in lieu of what was the settlement awarded srivastava,at citing knuckles commissioner,cir see also reg.c as amended in defining damages received as an amount received through a settlement agreement entered into in lieu of a prosecution of tort.where damages are received under a written settlement agreement,the focus is on the origin and characteristics of the claims settled in determining whether such damages are excludable under a.pipitone united states,cir see also francisco united states,cir it is a tenet of federal law that income received in settlement of a claim should be taxed in the same manner as if it had been received in court.therefore,to succeed green was required to establish that the payments under paragraph five were made in lieu of damages for personal or physical injuries,not for punitive damages or economic loss.see,at.finding that punitive damages are not on account of personal injuries or sickness.
we first look to the language of the agreement itself for indicia of purpose.see greer united states,cir.where the settlement agreement lacks express language of purpose,the court looks beyond the agreement to other evidence that may shed light on the intent of the payor as to the purpose in making the payment.id.quoting knuckles comm r,cir see also gajda comm r,cir noting that under a intent of the employer governs treatment of a severance payment.ultimately,the character of the payment hinges on the payor dominant reason for making the payment.the evidence considered by the court may include the amount paid,the evidence adduced at trial,the underlying judgment,the factual circumstances that led to the agreement,and any other facts that may reveal the payor intent.see,dotson united states,cir pipitone,at.we heed the wisdom that when assessing the tax implications of a settlement agreement,courts should neither engage in speculation nor blind themselves to the settlement realities.bagley comm r,cir.instead,the court should discern the claim the parties,in good faith,intended to settle for.dotson,at.
the language of paragraph five does not resolve whether the payments were made on account of green injuries.paragraph five simply refers to additional damages.this is in contrast to both of the other four payments are clearly intended to compensate green for loss of earning capacity,mental anguish and suffering past and mental anguish and suffering future and the payments under paragraph six are intended to compensate green for all other damages,including punitive,and interest.however,there is no such explanation of what additional damages this paragraph five was intended to compensate for.green contends that the payments were intended to compensate him for the injuries sustained in securing payment of the judgment.the government responds that the paragraph five payments were punitive damages cloaked in other damages language for political reasons.
looking beyond the words of the agreement to the payor purpose,we find that it was not clearly erroneous for the trial court to conclude that the payments made under paragraph five were not made to compensate green for personal or physical injuries for the following reasons.green claims that in refusing to acknowledge that the payments made under paragraph five were intended to compensate green for personal injuries,the trial court ignored the evidence and failed to consider the testimony presented at trial.green argues that even under the highly deferential clearly erroneous standard,he is entitled to relief because the evidence presented at trial conclusively established that the money paid under paragraph five was intended to compensate green for personal injuries received in attempting to collect on the judgment.this argument is not supported by the record.
first,an examination of the settlement agreement in conjunction with the jury verdict in the underlying whistleblower suit supports the tax court findings.where there has been a judgment in a trial court that preceded the settlement of the claims,the most persuasive evidence of the payor intent in settling the case is the previous award of that court.francisco,at see also robinson,at the verdict provides the best indication of the worth of the taxpayer claims.here,the trial court in the whistleblower litigation awarded green in the same amount that texas paid to green under the settlement agreement.further,the amount of compensatory damages awarded by the jury in the whistleblower lawsuit for the loss of earning capacity and past and future mental anguish and suffering,mirrored exactly the amount of compensatory damages paid under paragraph four of the settlement agreement.the logical import,then,is that the remainder of the settlement,including the amounts paid under paragraph five,was intended to compensate green for the remainder of the only of punitive damages and interest.
second,green points to the testimony of both potter and augustine that texas was opposed to paying punitive damages and wanted to minimize the amount of punitive damages paid.thus,he argues,the damages paid under paragraph five could not possibly have been punitive damages,but were meant to compensate green for the injuries he sustained in his attempts to collect.however,viewing the testimony presented at the trial as a whole,it appears that although the paragraph five payments were intended to satisfy the punitive damages portion of the judgment,they were labeled otherwise because of political considerations.potter testified that neither he,nor his office,had undertaken any independent investigation of green injuries and that he lacked personal knowledge of green injuries resulting from his efforts to collect the judgment.potter also testified that paragraph five could have been the same type of damages as paragraph four.this testimony undercuts green assertion that the paragraph five payments were intended to compensate for injuries.further,potter explained that texas opposition to paying punitive damages was pretty much a matter of public policy.thus,given the political climate,along with potter lack of knowledge of green injury,the tax court did not err in finding that the paragraph five payments were intended to satisfy a portion of the punitive damages and interest awarded to green,but were labeled otherwise.
third,green points to bullock knowledge of his injuries in support of his argument that paragraph five was intended to compensate him for these injuries.the testimony of green,fogg,and augustine established that bullock was aware of green hardship and health problems stemming from the collection efforts.very likely,it was these compelling facts which led bullock to help green obtain satisfaction of the judgment in the first place.however,bullock was not responsible for negotiating the settlement or drafting the settlement agreement.green did not produce any evidence that bullock informed potter about green postjudgment injuries,and in fact,potter testified that he was unaware of any postjudgment injuries.bullock knowledge of green health condition does not satisfy green burden of establishing that texas intended the money paid under paragraph five to compensate green for personal injury or sickness.
finally,augustine testified that his intent was to obtain from texas full payment of the punitive damages and interest.fogg testified that in his meeting with bullock,he told bullock that he expected green to get a minimum of what was owed to him by the jury verdict.both of these statements confirm that the overall goal of the settlement negotiations and eventual agreement was to provide green with a monetary settlement equal to the judgment entered against the state.
we agree with the tax court conclusion that the record lacks any evidentiary basis for concluding that a specific portion of the paragraph five annuity was allocable to any personal injury or sickness.admittedly,the language used in paragraph five is less than clear.but it is green who bears the ultimate burden of proving that the amounts paid under paragraph five were meant to compensate him for personal injuries or sickness.he has not met that burden.as such,the payments made under paragraph five of the settlement agreement are not excludable under a.
deductibility of business expenses and punitive damages paid to allied 
green appeals the tax court determination that the expenses and losses he incurred in connection with green capital and ts capital are not deductible under of the code as ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business.the commissioner concedes that green substantiated the underlying expenses,but argues that they were deductible only as ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred for the production or collection of income under of the code.
section of the code permits a deduction for all ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.in contrast,deductions are allowed under for the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for the production or collection of income.a deduction claimed under must meet the same requirements applicable to trade or business expenses under,except that the person claiming the deduction need not be in the trade or business.simon comm r,cir snyder united states,cir same.the purpose of is to provide for deductions in those pecuniarily motivated or profit seeking activities which are neither the conduct of the taxpayer trade or business on the one hand nor the mere satisfactions of his needs as a human and those of his family on the other.petschek united states,cir
