this case is to determine ownership of cattle and whether two contesting banks held a security interest in them.the district granted summary judgment for the buyer of the cattle on the ground that the apparent seller was the owner and passed title to the buyer free of a lien.we hold that a fact issue exists on the ownership of the apparent seller,and we reverse the judgment.
bryan brothers cattle company and cattle company bryan paid glenbrook cattle company glenbrook for the cattle,but two bank and cornerstone that brooks louie dickerson was the owner and had previously granted them liens on the cattle.each bank claims priority to the other.no other parties are before us now,and the decision depends,first,on whether bryan has to pay one of these banks or did bryan buy the cattle free of liens as the district court held,and second,if bryan has to pay again,to which bank.we hold that cornerstone has the superior lien on dickerson cattle and that the ownership of glenbrook presents an issue precluding summary judgment.
background 
on october,dickerson granted a security interest in the cattle he owned to cornerstone in exchange for a loan.cornerstone filed a financing statement with the mississippi secretary of state on october,and named louie dickerson as the debtor.
in,dickerson,ellen hardy,bill weeks and john david weeks discussed forming an enterprise involving cattle,with dickerson apparently as the catalyst for the idea.between that time and february,the parties began formulating the plan.hardy and the weeks brothers contributed cash for example,hardy put in,and it appears that dickerson devised the business plan and began putting the operational and financial side of the business into place.the enterprise was to be called glenbrook cattle company.there is a dispute about the intended role of the parties in the enterprise for example,whether dickerson was to be the sole owner or if each of the parties had an ownership stake.this is at the heart of the present legal dispute,and the relationship among the parties is detailed below.
on february,dickerson established a bank account at bancorpsouth bank in senatobia,mississippi in the name of louie dickerson,dba glenbrook cattle company.the account was listed as existing for a sole proprietorship,and the taxpayer id for the account was dickerson social security number.this is the only bank account that glenbrook held or maintained in any capacity,although dickerson had a number of other bank accounts at bancorpsouth and other banks with those accounts listed under his personal name,as well as under the names of his other businesses.
on november,a certificate of formation for a limited liability company llc was filed in the office of the mississippi secretary of state under the name glenbrook cattle company,with dickerson as the registered agent.it appears that no official action was taken with regard to the llc subsequent to the certificate filing.
at about the same time,in november,dickerson borrowed money from peoples in exchange for a security interest in the cattle he owned or later acquired.peoples filed one financing statement in november and two others in september.the financing statements listed brooks dickerson,dickerson legal name,as the debtor.
starting in early,glenbrook began to operate as a cattle business in tate county,mississippi dickerson handled the financial side of the business including the billing and receivables,apparently with little input from the other principals.glenbrook hired clayton zweirschke as the farm manager,responsible for the running of the program.
bryan has maintained a cattle operation in happy,texas for many years.typically,bryan takes physical possession of cattle in texas following completion of a period.bryan first bought cattle by glenbrook in july.dennis bryan,one of the principals in the company,and zweirschke developed a business relationship,which resulted in bryan regularly buying cattle from glenbrook.at that time,glenbrook bought cattle from sale barns,the cattle and then,at the end of the period,placed the cattle on the market to sell to the highest bidder,which sometimes was bryan.
beginning in,glenbrook changed its cattle operations,which altered the arrangement with bryan.under the new arrangement,bryan placed orders for certain cattle at the beginning of each week.zweirschke forwarded these orders to commission buyers at the sale barns.during the week,these buyers purchased the cattle,forwarding the invoices to glenbrook.each day,the sale barns shipped the cattle to glenbrook,where the cattle received a bryan brand and a ear tag.glenbrook then notified bryan of the various purchases and sent bryan a copy of the invoices and a bill of sale.after bryan wired funds to glenbrook during each week,glenbrook mailed a check to the sale barn.at the end of the period,glenbrook shipped the cattle to bryan in texas,charging per pound of weight gained during the period.
in may,approximately head of cattle,intended for bryan,were in various stages of glenbrook program.on may,zweirschke contacted bryan and told it to immediately arrange shipment of the cattle currently in glenbrook program,because glenbrook was out of money to purchase feed and vaccines.
as bryan and zweirschke were in the process of shipping the cattle,a local justice court issued a restraining order prohibiting the further shipment of the cattle.bryan deposited money with the court,took possession of the majority of the remaining cattle,and removed the case to federal court.the federal district court clerk is now holding on deposit.the court ultimately granted bryan motion for summary judgment,holding that bryan purchased the cattle free and clear of liens.the court determined that the financing statements peoples and cornerstone filed were perhaps effective as to dickerson individually,but that their security agreements were not perfected as to glenbrook,which bought and sold the cattle at issue.the court also denied peoples claim that its security agreement was superior to cornerstone.
ii.discussion 
peoples and cornerstone appeal the district court summary judgment that bryan purchased the cattle from glenbrook free and clear of their security interests.peoples also appeals the court denial of its motion regarding the superiority of its security interest to cornerstone.
we hold that there is a fact issue precluding summary judgment for bryan.we agree with the rejection of peoples claim of security interest superiority.
standard of review 
we review grants of summary judgment de novo,factory mut.ins.summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.if the nonmovant sets forth specific facts in support of allegations essential to his or her claim,a genuine issue of material fact is presented,and summary judgment is inappropriate.coleman houston indep.school dist however,w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party,there is no genuine issue for trial.matsushita indus.zenith radio 
b.did bryan brothers purchase the cattle free and clear 
peoples and cornerstone argue that because liens were properly perfected on dickerson and his property,the property sold by glenbrook,which operated as dickerson sole proprietorship,was sold subject to their security interests.bryan counters that the cattle were not subject to peoples or cornerstone liens on dickerson property because bryan purchased the cattle from glenbrook,which operated as either a partnership or a llc,an entity separate from dickerson individual holdings,and thus dickerson could not encumber glenbrook property.we hold that there is a fact issue as to whether glenbrook operated as a sole proprietorship,partnership,or llc.thus,summary judgment as to this issue is improper.
the security interests attach only if glenbrook was a sole proprietorship of dickerson 
under the food security act fsa,a buyer who in the ordinary course of business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a security interest created by the seller,even though the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows of the existence of such interest.the parties do not dispute that the purchase of cattle here is covered by the fsa.but under the fsa a buyer of farm products takes subject to a security interest created by the seller in particular circumstances,including when in the case of a farm product produced in a state that has established a central filing system the buyer has failed to register with the secretary of state of such state prior to the purchase of farm products and the secured party has filed an effective statement or notice that covers the farm products being sold mississippi has a central filing system but bryan failed to register with the mississippi secretary of state prior to the purchase of the cattle.therefore,the question is whether peoples and cornerstone filed statements that were effective and covered the cattle sold to bryan.
if glenbrook operated as a partnership or llc,peoples and cornerstone statements do not cover the cattle sold to bryan because the banks did not have a valid security interest in glenbrook property.in mississippi,a security interest is enforceable against the debtor and third parties with respect to collateral when,among other things,the debtor has rights in the collateral.
if glenbrook operated as a partnership or llc,dickerson did not have sufficient rights in the cattle to encumber them.mississippi recognizes a partnership as a separate entity that may sue or be sued in the partnership name partnership property includes all property brought into the partnership when formed or subsequently acquired by purchase on account of the partnership consequently,if glenbrook existed as a partnership,the partnership owned the cattle and this partnership property is distinct from dickerson personal property a partner right in specific partnership property is not assignable except in connection with the assignment of rights of all partners,and it is not subject to attachment or execution,except on a claim against the partnership consistent with these principles,in a personal loan agreement dickerson could not,without the consent of any of the other glenbrook principals,encumber property glenbrook owned.dickerson could not encumber property that was not his own 
if glenbrook operated as a llc,the peoples and cornerstone security interests do not attach to the cattle.in mississippi,a member of a llc has no interest in specific limited liability company property.the entity has independent power to,among other things,purchase and own personal property,sell or pledge personal property,and secure its obligations with a pledge of its personal property it follows that an individual owner dickerson of a llc owned by multiple parties,can not encumber specific llc property in a personal loan agreement with a creditor.thus,if glenbrook existed as a llc owned by the four parties,bryan takes the cattle free and clear of the peoples and cornerstone loans.
peoples argues that dickerson could encumber the cattle glenbrook sold,pointing to cases decided under mississippi law where a security interest was held to attach to collateral because the debtor had sufficient rights in collateral.however,these cases do not lead to the conclusion that dickerson could encumber glenbrook property if glenbrook existed as a partnership or llc owned by multiple parties.
peoples points to in re whatley in whatley,this court held under mississippi law that a corporation,owned by a husband and wife,had sufficient rights in collateral farming equipment to grant a security interest in the farming equipment to a lender,even though the husband,not the corporation,technically owned the farming equipment.the court reasoned that,while one generally can not encumber another property,the exception of consent by the property owner allowed the security agreement the husband signed to be valid on behalf of the corporation here,the consent theory does not apply because,if glenbrook was owned by three other parties,dickerson could not,without the consent of these parties,encumber the cattle owned by the entity in which each had an ownership stake.
if glenbrook existed as dickerson sole proprietorship,the security interest attaches to the cattle bryan purchased.bryan does not contest that an individual has sufficient rights in collateral under mississippi law to grant a security interest in collateral his sole proprietorship owns.however,bryan points out correctly that,under the fsa provision at issue here,a buyer of farm products who has failed to register with a state central filing system takes subject to a security interest the seller creates only if the secured party has filed an effective financing statement covering the farm products being sold bryan argues that the financing statements that listed dickerson not glenbrook as the debtor were not effective as to the cattle that bryan bought from glenbrook.
under the fsa,an effective financing statement must contain,inter alia,the name of the person indebted to the secured party the fsa and its implementing regulations do not indicate whether a financing statement that lists an individual name is effective against entities that purchase farm products from the individual sole proprietorship doing business under a trade name.in the absence of further provision in the fsa or case law,we will look to mississippi law that also requires a financing statement to provide the name of the debtor 
peoples and cornerstone properly obeyed the mississippi code by listing the debtor under dickerson individual name,rendering their financing statements effective if glenbrook was dickerson sole proprietorship.a financing statement that provides only the debtor trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.however,the mississippi code states that a financing statement that provides the name of the debtor is not rendered ineffective by the absence of the debtor trade name the official comment to section states that the actual individual or organizational name of the debtor on a financing statement is both necessary and sufficient,whether or not the financing statement provides trade or other names of the debtor the banks financing statements were not rendered ineffective by the absence of dickerson trade name if glenbrook operated as dickerson sole proprietorship.
was glenbrook a sole proprietorship,partnership,or llc 
the district court erred in granting summary judgment to bryan because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to glenbrook business form.peoples presents sufficient evidence that glenbrook existed as a sole proprietorship to overcome bryan summary judgment motion.the record shows that dickerson opened the bancorpsouth bank account to which bryan wired the funds for the cattle transaction at issue in the name of louie dickerson,dba glenbrook cattle company.second,this bank only held as a sole proprietorship.third,the taxpayer identification number for glenbrook account is dickerson social security number.fourth,the bills of sale for the transaction with bryan were signed by louie cattle company.taken together,these facts raise a material issue as to whether dickerson operated glenbrook as a sole proprietorship,precluding summary judgment for bryan.
there is substantial evidence that glenbrook was a partnership,however.for example,a partnership appears to have been the intent of the initial,hardy,and the weeks brothers.while this evidence is sufficient to defeat peoples summary judgment motion,bryan can not establish as a matter of law that glenbrook existed as a partnership.
in mississippi,a partnership exists when two or more people carry on as a business for profit courts consider three factors in determining if a partnership existed the intent of the parties,participation in control of the business and profit sharing.
courts must examine the intent of the parties to form a partnership,an express agreement is not required intent may be implied,or established from the surrounding circumstances the manner in which the parties characterize the relationship is probative.the ultimate question is did the parties int
