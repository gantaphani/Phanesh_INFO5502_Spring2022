background 
underlying transaction and initial proceedings on motion to reject 
the background facts of this matter are detailed extensively in the opinions below,familiarity with which is assumed.see in re the penn traffic,penn traffic i penn traffic ii.for the instant purposes,repetition of the background summary from penn traffic iii will suffice.cor is a commercial real estate developer whose holdings include certain tracts of land near a shopping mall known as towne center,in fayetteville,new york.the penn traffic company penn traffic or,the in the underlying chapter reorganization proceeding,is one of the leading food retailers in the united states.penn traffic owned land with a building,adjacent to the towne center,that could not have been developed into a modern suburban supermarket as part of the towne center without the inclusion of contiguous and connecting real property owned by cor.
prior to the commencement of penn traffic bankruptcy case,cor and penn traffic entered into a project agreement providing for,inter alia,the exchange of certain parcels of land,the site preparation and construction of a modern supermarket,reimbursement by cor to penn traffic of a specified portion of the construction costs,penn traffic conveyance to cor of the parcel of land on which the supermarket is situated,and penn traffic leaseback of the improved supermarket parcel from cor.at the time of penn traffic bankruptcy filing,cor had performed all of its obligations under the project agreement except for the reimbursement of the construction costs amounting to approximately million and the tender of a lease to penn traffic.penn traffic had not conveyed the supermarket parcel to cor.
several months after penn traffic filed its bankruptcy petition,cor wrote a letter to penn traffic in which,the bankruptcy court found,cor tendered reimbursement of the million in construction costs,as well as a signed lease,as called for by the project agreement.penn traffic declined to accept cor tender and,several months thereafter,moved pursuant to of the bankruptcy code the code to reject the project agreement.
the bankruptcy court held that,while the project agreement was executory on the petition date in that both sides had subsisting,unperformed obligations at that time,cor tender of the payment and the lease had rendered the project agreement and thus incapable of rejection.the bankruptcy court,accordingly,denied penn traffic motion to reject the project agreement on the ground that the project agreement was.noting briefly the deferential standard applied to debtors business judgments as to whether to assume or reject executory contracts,the bankruptcy court observed that 
t he debtor decision to reject the project agreement,if found executory,appears to meet the low threshold of the business judgment test,in that the debtor has obtained an appraisal of the fair market value of the penn traffic supermarket parcel at million,contrasted with the million reimbursement of the construction allowance which triggers the debtor contractual duty to convey title to the penn traffic supermarket parcel to cor.
penn traffic i,at.penn traffic appealed the bankruptcy court order to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that the project agreement had been an executory contract as of the petition date but rejected the bankruptcy court holding that executory contract status should be determined as of the rejection motion date and take into account performance.the district court reversed the latter aspect of the decision,holding that performance can not alter the executoriness of a contract,and remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.penn traffic ii,wl,at.
ii.initial appeal and proceedings on remand 
cor appealed judge buchwald decision to this court,arguing that the bankruptcy court had correctly found that the project agreement was no longer executory and thus could not be rejected.in penn traffic iii,we explained that we lacked jurisdiction of the appeal because penn traffic ii remand provision contemplated significant further bankruptcy court proceedings and thus was not a final order within the meaning of d.
following our dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court rejection order.among other things,the bankruptcy court rejection order held that rejection of the project agreement was in the debtor best interests and provided that cor was not,by agreeing to entry of the order,waiving its positions that the project agreement was not an executory contract at all and that,in any event,the project agreement was not executory at the time penn traffic moved to reject it.on the appeal of the bankruptcy court rejection order to the district court,that court,as noted above,entered a stipulated memorandum and order deciding appeal from order of bankruptcy court reinstating and reissuing its penn traffic ii decision and affirming the bankruptcy court rejection order without prejudice to the parties appellate rights.this appeal followed.
we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to d,because the district court april,memorandum and order constitutes a final order.fed.b.we review de novo the legal determinations below the factual determinations of the bankruptcy court in this core proceeding are reviewed for clear error.fed.
discussion 
the principal issue presented on this appeal is whether the party to a contract that is executory at the time a bankruptcy case is commenced can,by tender or performance of its own outstanding obligations under the contract,deprive the debtor party of the ability to exercise its statutory right to reject the contract as disadvantageous to the estate.we hold that it can not.
section of the code when read alongside,see note,supra provides that,with exceptions not pertinent here,a trustee or chapter may,with court approval,assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.a assumption is in effect a decision to continue performance.it requires the debtor to cure most defaults and continues the parties rights to future performance under the contract or lease.see b.rejection is in effect a decision to breach the contract or lease.see g west t he rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor constitutes a breach of such contract or lease immediately before the date of the filing of the petition.in the event of rejection,the party is generally relegated to pursuing an unsecured prepetition claim against the estate.in re child world,r ejection under a simply means that the court will permit the debtor to breach the contract,with the result that the contractual obligations will be reduced to general unsecured claims for prepetition damages pursuant to g.where assets of the estate are insufficient to pay unsecured creditors in full,the party to a rejected executory contract,like other unsecured creditors of the estate,may receive only a fraction of the value of its claim.
the plain language of the code permits a chapter trustee and,by extension through,a to assume or reject the executory contract at any time before the confirmation of a plan.d west.a counterparty desiring an earlier determination of the debtor course of action regarding assumption or rejection of the agreement may petition the court to order the debtor to make its determination within a specified period of time.id.
the code does not define the term executory contract.in eastern air lines,ins.of in re ionosphere clubs,cir,we characterized an executory contract as one on which performance remains due to some extent on both sides,id.at quoting labor relations bd.bildisco bildisco,d internal quotation marks omitted,but we were not called upon to address the question of how much performance must be outstanding for the contract to be treated as executory under.in addressing that question,most courts and scholars look to the standard first articulated by professor vernon countryman in his seminal law review article regarding treatment of contracts under the former bankruptcy,that an executory contract is one under which the obligation of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing performance of the other.vern countryman,executory contracts in bankruptcy part i,see collier on bankruptcy ed.
we do not have to determine the precise contours of the test for executoriness to resolve the issues here on appeal because,as the bankruptcy court found,the parties unperformed obligations under the project agreement satisfied the countryman standard as of the petition filing date 
applying what may be referred to as the substantial performance test,it is clear that the project agreement was an executory contract upon the date of filing of the penn traffic chapter petition,because on that date,may,cor had not paid or tendered reimbursement of the million required of it under section of the project agreement as a precondition of its right to conveyance to it of title to the penn traffic supermarket parcel.
penn traffic i,at.
cor contends,however,that the project agreement should not be treated as an executory contract at all.invoking the familiar principle that a court properly looks beyond the form or title of an agreement to determine the true nature of the transaction,see,liona,pch assocs.in re pch assocs,cir,cor argues that the project agreement should be treated as a financing lease,a prepaid option or a form of secured real estate transaction,and that any such treatment precludes the application of the rules governing executory contracts to penn traffic rights and obligations under the project agreement.the bankruptcy court,which analyzed the project agreement under the executory contract rules,see penn traffic i,at,implicitly rejected cor attempt to take the matter outside those rules.the district court explicitly addressed and rejected cor arguments in this regard.penn traffic ii,wl,at.
the courts below properly rebuffed cor attempt to avoid application of of the code to the parties rights and obligations under the project agreement.cor financing lease argument focuses on our holdings in in re pch assocs.and int l trade admin.rensselaer polytechnic,cir,both of which addressed the applicability to certain contractual relationships of special code provisions dealing with the treatment of unexpired leases in bankruptcy proceedings.see in re pch,at addressing applicability of d,d int l trade,at addressing applicability of d see also d.in each case,the relationship at issue was denominated as a leasehold but was found to be something other than a true lease,and the code provisions at issue on appeal were found to be inapplicable.these decisions were not at all concerned with the construction of the term executory contract,however,and thus provide no support for cor argument that the project agreement is not executory.
cor prepaid option argument is equally unavailing.while some courts have held that options contracts under which the optionee fully paid its price for the option to buy property before the debtor filed for bankruptcy are not executory because no performance is due from the optionor unless the option is exercised,see,unsecured creditors comm.of robert helms constr.dev.southmark in re robert helms constr.dev,cir option contract not executory if optionee did not exercise option prior to petition filing brown snellen in re giesing,option contract not executory,and others treat such contracts as executory,see,in re simon transp,option contracts executory in re lane,same,there is no factual basis for application of the prepaid option analysis in this matter because it is undisputed that cor had an unsatisfied contractual obligation to pay some million as of the petition date.
cor secured real estate purchase transaction argument focuses on the aspects of the project agreement that call for exchanges and transfers of particular parcels of property.cor argues that the outstanding real property transfer aspect of the project agreement constitutes a provision for the return or redemption of property securing the money advanced under the agreement for construction of the supermarket,alluding to decisions in which courts have found that property transactions in which the seller retains possession of,or title to,the property until payment in full has been made may constitute secured transactions under applicable law outside the bankruptcy context.see,in re pearson,applying law of secured transactions where purpose of seller retention of title was to ensure payment beard newsome,whether property remained in possession of seller is a factor in determining whether property transaction was actually a mortgage see collier on bankruptcy a ed.the project agreement,however,involved multiple transfers of property and money conditioned on obligations to be performed at various times by the two parties.cor attempt to analogize this complex arrangement to a simple purchase of property with title retained until payment has been made in full,or a simple loan secured by a pledge of property,is untenable.furthermore,the analogy necessarily fails because the supermarket parcel that the project agreement requires penn traffic to transfer to cor upon repayment of the construction costs includes property that never belonged to cor.see penn traffic i,at the acre parcel containing the s upermarket and adjacent parking lots consists of the land originally owned by penn traffic,augmented by the developer swap parcel and construction of the s upermarket and diminished by the owner swap parcel conveyed to cor.
accordingly,the courts below properly determined that the project agreement was an executory contract within the meaning of of the code as of the date penn traffic commenced its chapter bankruptcy proceeding.
executoriness and the debtor rights with respect to assumption or rejection of an executory contract are normally assessed as of the petition date the date on which a voluntary bankruptcy such as penn traffic is commenced.in re riodizio.some courts have,however,denied debtors attempts to assume or reject contracts that were executory as of the petition date in light of events affecting those contracts.cor relies on general statements in such decisions to the effect that events after the filing of the bankruptcy petition may cause the contract to be regarded as not executory when the motion to assume or reject was made,see,in re child world,in arguing that where,as in this case,the party to the contract has rendered or at least tendered its remaining performance under a contract that was executory at the petition date,the contract is no longer executory.
the cases in which the evaluation principle has been invoked to find that formerly executory contracts had lost their executory status by the time the debtor made
