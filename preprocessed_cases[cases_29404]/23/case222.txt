the opinion issued in this case on august,is withdrawn,and this revised opinion is substituted.our resolution of each issue remains the same.
the plaintiffs,caesar and pamela campbell,brought this suit against the purchase money lender on their residence,countrywide home loans.they alleged countrywide violated the automatic stay in their chapter bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the campbells,finding that countrywide had violated the automatic stay by the wording of the claim it filed.countrywide was granted the right to appeal from this interlocutory order.we agree with the bankruptcy court determination that certain unpaid amounts due under the campbells security agreement to countrywide were claims under the bankruptcy code,but reverse its holding that countrywide actions in the bankruptcy court violated the automatic stay.
factual and procedural background 
the principal issue in this case is whether the following is a claim to be submitted by a lender under the bankruptcy code the amount by which a bankrupt homeowner is delinquent in monthly payments for insurance and property taxes that are not yet due that would be maintained in escrow by the lender until they were due.the relevant loan was obtained on october,by caesar campbell,in the principal amount of,for the purchase of a home in richmond,texas.caesar campbell and his wife pamela also executed a texas home security instrument.countrywide is the servicer of the loan.
under the terms of the note and security instrument collectively loan documents,the campbells monthly mortgage payment contained two distinct elements.the first was a monthly payment for principal and interest in the amount of.in addition,the loan documents provided countrywide the right which it exercised to collect other amounts on a monthly basis to cover expenses such as insurance and taxes,to retain these payments in an escrow account,and to pay these expenses as they became due.
the amount countrywide could collect as a monthly escrow is governed by the real estate settlement procedures act respa.et.respa provides that a loan servicer can estimate the property taxes and insurance that will be due on the property for the ensuing twelve months and adjust the monthly payments under the mortgage by of the total calculations to cover the estimated expenses.respa also allows the lender to include an additional of the monthly escrow payment to provide a cushion to cover any estimate shortfalls.see id.a.
on april,the campbells filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.countrywide was listed as a creditor and filed a proof of claim on april.countrywide proof of claim was for.countrywide had three categories of claims.first,countrywide listed fifteen delinquent monthly principal and interest payments.second,countrywide claim included amounts that countrywide expended to cover escrow expenses in years prior to the petition year with credit for any escrow payments made by the campbells.finally,countrywide included certain other costs and fees it was entitled to recover under the loan documents.countrywide did not include in its claim the unpaid escrow payments that accrued between january and the date of the campbells bankruptcy petition in april.
significant for this appeal,in addition to its listed claims,countrywide included the following language in its proof of that countrywide intended to increase the campbells monthly mortgage payment 
the post petition payment for this loan is.effective the post petition payment will increase to 
the increased amount would have recouped the escrow monthly payments that were unpaid beginning in january and ending on the filing of the bankruptcy petition in april.the campbells filed an objection to this increase in the mortgage payment.the bankruptcy court ultimately approved countrywide arrearage claim but disallowed the increased mortgage payment.the confirmed plan required mortgage payments in the amount of the campbells payments.
according to the campbells complaint,countrywide actions were an impermissible attempt to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case.a.the bankruptcy court agreed with the partial summary judgment and holding that countrywide actions were an attempt to collect a debt.the court also held that this action constituted a willful violation of the automatic stay.countrywide challenges both the finding that it was attempting to collect a debt and the finding that its actions violated the automatic stay.the statute under which the campbells bring their claim allows costs,attorneys fees,and punitive damages in certain circumstances.the bankruptcy court left open the issue of damages.the bankruptcy court granted countrywide petition for permission to appeal under.we subsequently granted countrywide petition to appeal.
ii.discussion 
a the contractual relationship between the campbells and countrywide 
we review a summary judgment entered by a bankruptcy court for genuine issues of material fact and for whether the movant was legally entitled to judgment.in re timber,cir.
to understand the relevant law,we begin with the relationship that the loan documents established between countrywide and the campbells.the promissory note set the principal and interest on the loan.these provisions in the mortgage documents required monthly escrow payments 
payment of principal,interest,escrow items,and late charges.borrower shall pay when due the principal of,and interest on,the debt evidenced by the note and any late charges due under the note.borrower shall also pay funds for escrow items pursuant to section.
funds for escrow items.borrower shall pay to lender on the day periodic payments defined as the regularly scheduled amount due for i principal and interest under the note,plus ii any amounts under section escrow items of this security agreement are due under the note,until the note is paid in full,a sum the funds to provide for payment of amounts due for a taxes c premiums for any and all insurance required by lender these items are called escrow items.borrower shall pay lender the funds for escrow items unless lender waives borrower obligation to pay the funds for any or all escrow items.
lender may,at any time,collect and hold funds in an amount a sufficient to permit lender to apply the funds at the time specified under respa,and b not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under respa.lender shall estimate the amount of funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures of future escrow items or otherwise in accordance with applicable law.
charges liens.borrower shall pay all taxes attributable to the property which can attain priority over this security instrument to the extent that these items are escrow items,borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in section.
upon the campbells failure to make their monthly mortgage payment,the loan documents granted countrywide the right to do and pay for whatever is appropriate to protect lender interest in the property and rights under the security instrument though countrywide disputes that the unpaid escrow amounts were bankruptcy code claims,it concedes that it had the right under the provision to proceed against the campbells for unpaid monthly mortgage payments,including escrow sums.we find that under the loan documents,the campbells had an obligation to pay,and countrywide had a right to collect,mortgage payments.
though countrywide had contractual rights to collect the principal,interest,and escrow amounts,its argument for not having to file these unpaid amounts as a claim arises from additional rights under respa which are expressly incorporated by the loan documents.respa arguably allowed countrywide to recalculate monthly escrow payments if necessary to ensure that there would be a sufficient balance in the campbells escrow account to satisfy the escrow expenses as they became due.according to countrywide,respa allows recalculation any time there are insufficient funds in the escrow account to cover escrow expenses in the ensuring year.though that may be true,the is
