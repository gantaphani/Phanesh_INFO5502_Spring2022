marilynn pilalas,a resident of pembroke,massachusetts,challenges the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing claims she brought against the cadle company cadle company and its corporate sibling cadlerock joint venture ii,cadlerock for unlawful debt collection under massachusetts law collectively,we refer to them both as cadle where the distinction does not matter.the facts of this case are not seriously at issue and may be summarized briefly.
some time before,marilynn pilalas husband,nicholas pilalas,opened a credit card account with bank of new york.the account eventually became delinquent and was ultimately purchased by the cadle company,which assigned it to a closely related entity,cadlerock.cadle began telephoning nicholas pilalas to demand that he pay what was due.despite occasional partial payments,he died on december,leaving an unpaid balance of somewhat more than.
cadle took the position that marilynn pilalas was responsible for the balance,although according to marilynn pilalas cadle refused to explain why she paid installments but only sporadically for several years eventually,in may,cadlerock sued her in massachusetts state court for the principal balance of and accrued interest due through march,of,plus costs and attorney fees.
after discovery began,cadlerock offered to settle based on an extended payment plan under which pilalas would pay in consecutive monthly installments of just over percent of what the company claimed she owed including accrued interest in addition to the reduced payments,cadlerock sought a release that barred all actions against cadlerock and its affiliated companies for any claims remotely attributable or related to the debt.specifically,the release provided that pilalas,as the obligor,
agree s to execute this release in favor of bank of new york delaware,cadlerock joint venture ii,and its affiliates released parties,as beneficiaries.obligor s,heirs and assigns,for itself,its successors and assigns as the appropriate case may be,hereby releases,acquits and forever discharges the released parties,their agents,servants and employees,and all persons and entities in privity with them or any of them,from any and all claims or causes of action of any kind whatsoever,at common law,statutory or otherwise,which obligor s and those on whose behalf obligor s sign s has,have or might have,whether known or unknown,now existing or arising hereafter,directly,indirectly,or remotely attributable or related to the above described note s judgment s,this release being intended and understood to release all present and future claims of any kind which obligor s and those on whose behalf obligor s sign s might have against those hereby released,arising from or growing out of any act or omission occurring prior to the date of this release.
acting without counsel,marilynn pilalas signed the release on august,and a week later she and cadlerock attorney signed a stipulation of dismissal of the pending state court suit.over the next two and a half years,marilynn pilalas continued making regular payments.she missed a few payments,but largely performed as agreed and did not hear from any of the cadle entities.
then,in april,marilynn pilalas lost her job.she failed to make a payment that month,and in july,she stopped sending payments entirely.at that point,she had paid of the installments.again,marilynn pilalas heard nothing from the cadle entities despite her outstanding obligation of under the settlement.indeed,the cadle entities have not contacted marilynn pilalas at all following their august settlement.
sixteen months after sending her last payment,on november,marilynn pilalas filed a putative class action suit in massachusetts superior court,naming cadle,cadlerock,their common principal daniel cadle,and a host of related entities as defendants.she advanced a series of charges under state law and sought restitution,damages of various kinds including treble damages,declaratory and injunctive relief,and costs and attorneys fees.
the defendants removed the case to federal court.marilynn pilalas effort to have the matter remanded to state court failed and the defendants were whittled down to the cadle company and cadlerock,but the details do not matter as neither is an issue on appeal.the two defendants moved for summary judgment which,accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge,the district court eventually granted.marilynn pilalas now appeals to this court.
we review de novo the issues of law on which this case turns.v√©lez thermo king de puerto rico,cir.those issues arise under provisions of massachusetts law that govern both consumer fraud.laws ch,and debt collection,id.ch,as well as a closely related provision establishing civil remedies for consumer fraud,id.ch,specifically including unlawful debt collection,id.ch.also pertinent are statutes of limitation that govern potential claims.id.ch.a central aspect of the debt collection provisions makes unlawful debt collection as defined in the statute except when carried out by certain exempted parties.id.ch.
marilynn pilalas position throughout has been that cadle engaged in unlawful debt collection and that the release itself was obtained by fraud and illegal debt collection.however,the limitations period under state law is three years for fraud claims.laws ch,and four years for chapter claims.marilynn pilalas filed her complaint on november,so the statute reaches back only to november.
it is quite possible and we will assume arguendo in marilynn pilalas favor that cadle engaged in unlawful debt collection by pursuing marilynn pilalas prior to its collection lawsuit and the release that followed.broadly speaking,the statute,described in more detail below,forbids unlicensed debt collection by anyone whose principal business is debt collection and who seeks to collect by use of telephone or mails it arguably applies as well to anyone seeking to collect a debt in default purchased from the original creditor.div.of banks,industry letter concerning the massachusetts debt collection statutes,and its applicability to debt buyers,so called june.
at the time it sought to collect from marilynn pilalas,cadle it appears was neither licensed nor within a statutory exception.it had been sent a letter for unlicensed debt collection in and later denied a license.the cadle.div.of banks,wl,at,aff,table.ultimately,the attorney general secured a consent judgment against it.commonwealth v.the cadle,d.
nevertheless,marilynn pilalas chose to settle the lawsuit,agreeing to pay about half of the claimed debt and giving a release to the defendants from all claims she might have against them,present and future.the release might be unenforceable under state law as to claims arising after the release,at least for regulatory and fraud claims.see feeney dell,bates southgate.however,the release by its terms does extinguish claims by marilynn pilalas,including civil claims for unlawful debt collection,unless it is somehow invalid.
had cadle secured the release through fraudulent misrepresentation,it would be voidable,shaw supermarkets,delgiacco,but the district court found no basis for marilynn pilalas allegations that the release was secured by fraud.similarly,some forms of coercion conceivably might render the release voidable,see cabot avx,but marilynn pilalas does not attempt to make any detailed showing along these lines.
in all events,one seeking to repudiate an agreement allegedly entered into under duress must promptly complain of the circumstances under which the document was signed.in re bos.shipyard,cir.here,marilynn pilalas entered into the release in,performed under it for several years,was not again approached by the company even when she ceased to perform,and waited over four years before bringing the present suit,thereby attacking the release.courts have rejected such claims as untimely even with much shorter delays,id.eighteen month delay deemed untimely.
marilynn pilalas settled cadle suit apparently without advice from counsel,and it is a defect of our legal system that,absent attorneys fee provisions rarely of much help to those who are sued,only the,or the very poor who
