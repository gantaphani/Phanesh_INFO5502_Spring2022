four maryland consumers commenced this action against santander consumer usa,and its agents,alleging that the defendants violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,by engaging in prohibited collection practices when collecting on the plaintiffs automobile loans.the loans were originally made by citifinancial auto,and,after the plaintiffs were unable to make payments,citifinancial auto foreclosed on the loans,leaving the plaintiffs obligated to pay deficiencies.citifinancial auto then sold the defaulted loans to santander as part of an investment bundle of receivables,and santander thereafter attempted to collect on the loans it had purchased.
the district court granted santander motion to dismiss the claims against it under federal rule of civil procedure b on the ground that the complaint did not allege facts showing that santander qualified as a debt collector subject to the fdcpa.the court concluded that the complaint demonstrated that santander was a consumer finance company that was collecting debts on its own behalf as a creditor and that the fdcpa generally does not regulate creditors collecting on debt owed to themselves.
we affirm.while the fdcpa is a somewhat complex and technical regulation of debt collector practices,we conclude that it generally does not regulate creditors when they collect debt on their own account and that,on the facts alleged by the plaintiffs,santander became a creditor when it purchased the loans before engaging in the challenged practices.
ricky henson,ian glover,karen pacouloute,and paulette house,maryland consumers who are the plaintiffs in this action,each signed a retail installment sales contract with citifinancial auto credit,citifinancial auto,or citifinancial auto,ltd collectively,citifinancial auto to finance the purchase of an automobile.when the plaintiffs were unable to make the payments required by the contracts and thereby defaulted,citifinancial auto repossessed and sold their vehicles and subsequently informed each plaintiff that he or she owed a deficiency balance.
on december,citifinancial auto sold billion in loan receivables,including the plaintiffs defaulted loans,to santander,a consumer finance company.the plaintiffs allege that,as part of its business,santander acquires defaulted consumer debt for a few cents on the dollar.
thereafter,santander and its agents,presumably in an effort to collect more than the few cents on the dollar that it paid for defaulted loans,began communicating with the plaintiffs in an attempt to collect on the alleged debts.and during the course of those communications,santander and its agents allegedly misrepresented the amount of the debt and their entitlement to collect it.
the plaintiffs commenced this action in november against santander and its agents,alleging that they violated the fdcpa in pursuing the debts and in the manner they pursued them.in their complaint,they proposed to represent a class of certain debtors who were subjected to debt collection efforts by santander consumer usa,on or after december,the date on which santander purchased the receivables from citifinancial auto.
santander filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against it under federal rule of civil procedure b on the ground that the complaint allegations did not demonstrate that santander qualified as a debt collector,as necessary to trigger liability under the fdcpa,and the district court granted the motion by order dated may.in its supporting opinion,the court noted that the fdcpa applies to debt collectors,as that term is defined in the act,but not to creditors collecting debts in their own names and whose primary business is not debt collection.in reaching its conclusion,the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that,because the plaintiffs loans were in default when santander acquired them from citifinancial auto,santander qualified as a debt collector under the fdcpa,rather than as a creditor.
the plaintiffs filed this appeal,presenting the single issue of whether,as necessary to state an fdcpa claim,their complaint adequately alleged that santander was acting as a debt collector,as that term is defined in,when it engaged in the collection practices challenged in the suit.
in their brief on appeal,the plaintiffs state their position that santander was a debt collector,subject to regulation by the fdcpa,based on the following reasoning 
the terms debt collector and creditor are mutually exclusive under the fdcpa.an entity can be either a debt collector or a creditor in any particular transaction.the determining factor of whether an entity is a debt collector or creditor in any particular transaction when the entity in question is not the originating lender is whether the debt was acquired prior to default or after default.since santander acquired the plaintiffs debts from the original lender well after each plaintiff defaulted on their debt,santander collection activities on these defaulted debts make it a debt collector.
emphasis added.to make their argument,the plaintiffs rely on their interpretations of and,which define creditor and debt collector,respectively.their argument rests on the premise that the fdcpa regulates debt collectors,not creditors,and that the two terms,as used in the act,are mutually exclusive.see bridge ocwen fed.bank,fsb,cir ftc check investors,cir.thus,they reason,because excludes from the definition of creditor any person to the extent that he receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in default solely for the purpose of facilitating collection of such debt for another,such person must of logical necessity be a debt collector.because santander fits,as they argue,the exclusion from the definition of creditor,it must therefore be a debt collector.they claim that this conclusion is fortified by one of the exclusions to the definition of debt collector.see f iii excluding from the definition of debt collector any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due another to the extent such activity concerns a debt which was not in default at the time it was obtained emphasis added.at bottom,they maintain that the default status of debt determines whether a purchaser of debt,such as santander,is a debt collector or a creditor.
the plaintiffs argument,however,contains several interpretational and logical flaws,such that their interpretation of the fdcpa ultimately stands in tension with its plain language.when arguing from the definition of creditor,they overlook the fact that the exclusion applies only to a person who receives defaulted debt solely for the purpose of facilitating collection for another.emphasis added.similarly,in relying on the exclusion in f iii,they fail to address whether santander fits under any definition of debt collector before addressing whether the f iii exclusion applies.
we conclude that the default status of a debt has no bearing on whether a person qualifies as a debt collector under the threshold definition set forth in.that determination is ordinarily based on whether a person collects debt on behalf of others or for its own account,the main exception being when the principal purpose of the person business is to collect debt.
we begin our explanation by noting at a general level that the fdcpa purports to regulate only the conduct of debt collectors,not creditors,generally distinguishing between the two based on whether the person acts in an agency relationship with the person to whom the borrower is indebted.with limited exceptions,a debt collector thus collects debt on behalf of a creditor.a creditor,on the other hand,is a person to whom the debt is owed,and when a creditor collects its debt for its own account,it is not generally acting as a debt collector.
the fdcpa definitions of debt collector and creditor bear out this distinction.
the definition of debt collector,which is contained in,is comprised of two parts.the first part defines the classes of persons that are included within the term debt collector,while the second part defines those classes of persons that are excluded from the definition of debt collector.the first part,defining those who are included,provides in relevant part 
the term debt collector means any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts,or who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.notwithstanding the exclusion provided by clause f of the last sentence of this paragraph,the term includes any creditor who,in the process of collecting his own debts,uses any name other than his own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts.
emphasis added.stated more simply,this provision defines a debt collector as a person whose principal purpose is to collect debts a person who regularly collects debts owed to another or a person who collects its own debts,using a name other than its own as if it were a debt collector.
the second part of defines the classes of persons that are excluded from the definition of debt collector,so that a person who meets one of the definitions of debt collector contained in the first part of will not qualify as such if it falls within one of the exclusions.as relevant here,exclusion f iii provides that t he term debt collector does not include any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity concerns a debt which was not in default at the time it was obtained by such person.f iii.to simplify,this exclusion means that a person collecting nondefaulted debts on behalf of others is not a debt collector.this exclusion was intended by congress to protect those entities that function as loan servicers for debt not in default.see,at,as reprinted in,t he committee does not intend the definition of debt collector to cover the activities of mortgage service companies and others who service outstanding debts for others,so long as the debts were not in default when taken for servicing emphasis added.
thus,the overall structure of makes clear that when assessing whether a person qualifies as a debt collector,we must first determine whether the person satisfies one of the statutory definitions given in the main text of before considering whether that person falls into one of the exclusions contained in subsections a f.if a person does not satisfy one of the definitions in the main text,the exclusions in subsections a f do not come into play.see davidson capital one bank usa,cir w here a person does not fall within subsection f or any one of the six statutory exclusions,he is not deemed a debt collector as a matter of course.instead,he must satisfy the act substantive requirements.
the material distinction between a debt collector and a creditor at least with respect to the second definition of debt collector provided by is therefore whether a person regular collection activity is only for itself a creditor or whether it regularly collects for others a debt collector not,as the plaintiffs urge,whether the debt was in default when the person acquired it.see heintz jenkins,d the act definition of the term debt collector includes a person who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed to another alteration in original quoting see also davidson,at the statutory text is entirely transparent a person must regularly collect or attempt to collect debts for others in order to qualify as a debt collector under the second definition of the term,at the committee intends the term debt collector,subject to the exclusions discussed below,to cover all third persons who regularly collect debts for others emphasis added.but see bridge,at ruth triumph,cir check investors,at.
with this interpretation of,we turn to the complaint in this case to assess what it states about santander.the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs borrowed money from citifinancial auto to purchase automobiles and that,when the plaintiffs went into default on the loans,citifinancial auto repossessed and sold their automobiles,leaving them owing deficiency balances.it also alleges that when the loans were in default but before december,santander was hired as a servicer to collect on the loans,presumably on behalf of citifinancial auto.
but the very next paragraph of the complaint alleges that on december,citifinancial auto sold the plaintiffs loans to santander.only thereafter,when santander began collecting from the plaintiffs on the loans that it had purchased,did santander engage in the conduct that the plaintiffs allege was in violation of the fdcpa.specifically,the complaint alleges that after december,santander improperly contacted the borrowers directly,misrepresented the amounts owed,and misrepresented the fact that santander was entitled to collect on the loans.importantly,however,the complaint does not allege that,when santander engaged in the allegedly illegal collection practices,it was collecting the debts on behalf of citifinancial auto.rather,it alleges that citifinancial auto had sold the loans to santander,presumably for a few cents on the dollar,thus leaving santander to collect on the debts for its own account.and this allegation is consistent with public sec filings,which reveal that santander purchased billion in loan receivables from citifinancial auto on december,following which santander presumably attempted to obtain a return by collecting more than a few cents on the dollar through its collection efforts.
applying these allegations to the definition of debt collector in,it is apparent that santander does not fall within the first or third definitions of debt collector.the complaint does not allege,nor do the plaintiffs argue,that santander principal business was to collect debt,alleging instead that santander was a consumer finance company.the complaint also does not allege,nor do the plaintiffs contend,that santander was using a name other than its own in collecting the debts.thus,to allege that santander was a debt collector,the complaint is left to satisfy the second definition of debt collector that santander regularly collects debts owed to others and was doing so here.
yet,the complaint allegations also do not satisfy this definition because the debts that santander was collecting were owed to it,santander,not to another.this is alleged specifically and unambiguously.the complaint asserts that after santander purchased the plaintiffs debts on december,and became the entity to which the debts were owed,it engaged in collection efforts that violated the fdcpa.thus,those collection efforts were pursued for its own account,as the loans were then owed to it.santander was therefore not a person collecting a debt on behalf of another,so as to qualify as a debt collector under the second definition,but on behalf of itself,making it a creditor.
because the complaint does not satisfy any definition of debt collector,the analysis ends,and the exclusions from the definition of debt collector,on which the plaintiffs rely,have no significance.
nonetheless,the plaintiffs argue that the default status of a debt is determinative of whether a person who purchased the debt is a debt collector,pointing to exclusion f iii,which excludes from the class of persons defined as a debt collector any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due another to the extent such activity concerns a debt which was not in default at the time it was obtained by such person.f iii emphasis added.they argue that because that provision excludes persons collecting debts not in default,the definition of debt collector must,by a negative pregnant,necessarily include persons collecting defaulted debts that they did not originate.this logic,however,turns the statutory provision upside down,failing to recognize that the fdcpa defines debt collector by reference to those who are included in the various classes and then excludes,among others,the subset of persons who obtain nondefaulted debt to collect on it for others.as noted earlier,this exclusion was included by congress to protect mortgage service companies and similar loan servicers who acquire debt not in default and service it for a f
