filed a class action suit against the principal lender of the company that issued the notes.the district court certified the class action.however,there is a currently pending bankruptcy adversary proceeding dealing with most of the same questions at issue in the class action.we reverse the class certification because,in light of the adversary proceeding,the class action is not the superior method for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.
from to,the thaxton group,tgi,sold notes to appellees.the notes,which tgi sold in a series of transactions,id.at,were offered under at least eight separate registration statements that tgi filed with the securities exchange commission,id.at.the allege that tgi sold these notes in order to repay a portion of the debt tgi owed to appellant,finova capital,which was tgi principal lender.see id.at.tgi filed for chapter bankruptcy on october.see in re the thaxton group.filed.
shortly after tgi bankruptcy filing,appellees filed this class action against finova and tgi lawyers and accountants the class action complaint alleges that tgi misrepresented financial data in the notes registration statements in violation of section of the securities act of,and that finova is jointly and severally liable for the misrepresentations under section of the securities act,because finova was an active partner and counselor to tgi,took a leading role in most of tgi major business decisions,and was fully aware of the note sale program designed to transfer the risky portion of the finova debt to the unsuspecting noteholders.the class action complaint also asserts that finova was a participant in a civil conspiracy,under south carolina law,to sell worthless securities to the plaintiffs with the purpose of transferring the money to finova.id.at.
several months after the appellees filed their class action,the committee of tgi unsecured creditors commenced an adversary proceeding against finova in the delaware bankruptcy court where tgi bankruptcy was pending the unsecured creditors sought to have finova secured claims either disallowed or equitably subordinated to the noteholders unsecured claims.the official cmte.of unsecured creditors of the thaxton group,finova capital in re the thaxton group.filed.the adversary complaint alleges that finova violated banking laws and regulations,securities laws and regulations,and fiduciary duties owed to tgi.it includes allegations of the same securities law violations alleged in appellees class is,liability under section for tgi section violations.id.at.while the adversary complaint does not contain any allegation of a south carolina civil conspiracy,the substance of the civil conspiracy claim is alleged repeatedly,as many of the complaint allegations depend upon the existence of a scheme to sell worthless securities to the noteholders in order to allow tgi to repay money owed to finova.see.
the district court acted on the appellees class action complaint by certifying the class action and designating three subclasses,only two of which included plaintiffs pursuing claims against finova.the first subclass comprises tgi noteholders who purchased notes during the period prior to october,and who held these notes as of the date that thaxton discontinued the note program on september,and who are pursuing section claims against finova for tgi section violations.id.at.the second subclass comprises tgi noteholders who held notes purchased from thaxton as of september,when thaxton discontinued its note program and who are pursuing civil conspiracy claims against finova.id.at.in certifying the class action,the district court found that the action satisfied all of the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure.id.at.specifically,it found that a class action is the superior method available for the fair and efficient adjudication of plaintiffs claims.id.at.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,finova filed a petition in this court for permission to appeal the district court class certification.we granted finova petition for permission to appeal,stayed the class action proceedings pending in the district court,and now reverse the district court class certification.
we review the district court certification decision for abuse of discretion.mcclain south carolina nat.bank,cir.though,in order to be affirmed,the district court must exercise its discretion within the framework of rule.lienhart dryvit,cir.in addition to satisfying the numerosity,commonality,typicality,and representativeness requirements of federal rule of civil procedure rule a,actions certified under rule b must satisfy the and superiority requirements.id.the party seeking class certification bears the burden of proof on these elements.id.we address only rule b superiority requirement,which requires that the district court find that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.rule b b deems the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class a pertinent consideration in deciding whether the class action is superior.
the district court concluded that the class action was superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy by comparing the class action to thousands of individual suits,without even mentioning the adversary proceeding in its analysis see one class action,with subclasses,remains unquestionably superior to thousands of separate trials that might lead to disparate results.it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to find the class action superior without analyzing whether it was superior to the adversary only other pending,collective proceeding having to do with the same controversy as the class action.by failing to analyze whether the class action was superior to the adversary proceeding,the district court did not consider the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class,as rule b b advises.
when the class action is compared to the adversary proceeding,it is clear that the former is not superior to the latter.the bankruptcy court must decide the matters raised in the adversary proceeding in order to determine the validity and priority of tgi creditors claims.it would be inefficient and needlessly duplicative to allow the class action to go forward when the adversary proceeding will likely adjudicate this controversy in the normal course of tgi bankruptcy the adversary proceeding presents no danger of unfairness due to disparate results because it,like the class action,will yield a single result for all of the noteholders.also,the adversary proceeding will avoid many of the expenses and complexities associated with having the class action and the adversary proceeding pending simultaneously such as those presented in the case before us today.for these reasons,the class action can not be considered the superior method for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.
appellees contend that the class action is superior to the adversary proceeding because the adversary proceeding seeks relief that is different from the relief in this action.appellee br.at.specifically,appellees point to their claim for punitive damages and the potential availability of pre and interest in the class action.however,this disparity in the relief requested does not overcome the considerations that lead us to conclude that the class action is not the superior method for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the class action plaintiffs have acknowledged that,if successful in the adversary proceeding,they could be made more or less whole.the fact that the relief sought in the two actions differs slightly is not enough to persuade us that the class action is superior.
conclusion 
the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded.
