the facts underlying this appeal date back to,when the small business administration sba loaned million,evidenced by a promissory note,to statler industries,statler,an augusta,maine,based paper manufacturer.to secure the loan,the sba received a first priority mortgage on the statler plant site,a first priority security interest in almost all the company equipment and machinery and a personal guaranty of the loan from leonard sugarman,then statler president and a major shareholder.
sugarman attorney,harris baseman,was able to modify slightly the standard guaranty required by the sba with sba consent the word limited was added to the title of the preprinted sba form and an additional sentence this guaranty is limited to of the outstanding loan balance was added to the bottom of the preprinted form.the guaranty did not require the sba to exhaust its collateral before turning to him sugarman sought unsuccessfully to secure such a limitation but the sba refused to modify its boilerplate.
in,the firm finances were in good shape,and sugarman not only renewed his prior request that the sba agree to liquidate collateral before he was held personally liable,but also asked to have the guaranty limited to.with the sba agreement baseman had the following two sentences typed at the bottom of the guaranty form before it was 
this guaranty is limited to the deficiency existing after sale of corporate assets securing the subject loan.the guaranty is further limited to an amount not to exceed five hundred thousand dollars.
at the sba insistence,the preprinted language was not altered.thus,inconsistent with the new first sentence of the added language,boilerplate language in the form continued to allow the sba to demand payment from sugarman without first exhausting the collateral.
also left undisturbed was boilerplate language granting the sba full power,in its uncontrolled discretion and without notice to sugarman to take any action it deemed fit with respect to the collateral.the form provided the sba could deal in any matter with the collateral,including 
t he substitution,exchange,or release of all or any parts of the collateral,whether or not the collateral,if any,received by lender upon any such substitution,exchange or release shall be of the same or a different character or value than the collateral surrendered by lender.
the new guaranty,executed by both sides,is agreed to have supplanted the original guaranty.
in,statler defaulted in its payments on the sba loan.the sba then demanded payment of the outstanding balance million plus interest and,unable to pay,statler filed for chapter bankruptcy.in,with the bankruptcy court assent,statler sold its assets to tree free fiber,which assumed statler obligations under the sba loan.sugarman consented to the assumption,reaffirmed his guaranty,and agreed that tree free could sell machinery or equipment with an aggregate value up to per year without sba consent.
to carry out its purchase of statler assets,tree free received a million loan from a supplier,thermo fibertek.the loan was given pursuant to a subordination agreement,which granted thermo fibertek the first security interest in certain machinery and equipment that had previously been subject to the first priority claims of the sba.both the sba and sugarman gave their consent to this subordination.
the following year,tree free needed additional financing to upgrade its facilities and sought a loan from keybank,to help tree free to secure the loan,the sba agreed with keybank that the sba would give up its first priority on certain of the mortgaged real estate and its first priority security interest in certain of the machinery and equipment that backed the promissory note.sugarman was apparently not told of the transaction and he did not give consent to the sba release of its priority positions.
at the time,philip proulx,then the sba chief of portfolio management,expressed concern in a letter to tree free executives about the proposal that the sba enter into the release.proulx said that if it subordinated its position and the business were to fail,sugarman would remain liable under the guaranty but without the protection provided by the sba first claim on the released real estate and equipment nevertheless,the sba took the view that it was entitled to release the collateral without sugarman consent and ultimately did so.
in december,tree free defaulted on the loan from keybank and the maine superior court placed tree free into receivership.tree free assets were sold with its reduced security position,the sba received only of the million the sale generated.as a result,the sba was left with a deficiency on its original loan to statler in the amount of,plus additional interest that had accrued.
the sba demanded under the guaranty that sugarman pay the deficiency.sugarman denied liability,contending that the sba had violated its obligations to him by releasing its first priority security interests without his consent.the loan was eventually purchased from the sba by lpp mortgage lpp standing now in the sba shoes,lpp commenced this law suit in federal district court in massachusetts to recover the deficiency remaining on the loan to statler.
in the district court,both parties moved for summary judgment and the district court denied both motions.in doing so,the court found that the sba was required under the guaranty to exhaust whatever collateral it had before turning to sugarman as a guarantor.although as noted above boilerplate language provided otherwise,the district court found the typewritten sentences added in overrode the boilerplate language in this respect.
however,the modified guaranty by its terms only required the sba to exhaust its collateral this guaranty is limited to the deficiency existing after sale of corporate assets securing the subject loan.the district court found it less clear whether the sba was entitled to release collateral in without sugarman consent.it therefore conducted a two day bench trial,hearing extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.proulx,sugarman and baseman all testified.
proulx testified that,consistent with his letter,he believed the typewritten text had no impact on the sba rights to subordinate its collateral.sugarman and baseman both testified that they understood the language inserted in to protect sugarman interest in having the collateral available and that its release without his consent was inconsistent with this understanding.ultimately,the district court found that sugarman consent was required and it dismissed lpp mortgage claim.
the gist of the district court denying summary judgment to lpp and the other deciding against it on the merits after as follows that the guaranty as amended by the additional sentences was ambiguous as to whether the sba could without sugarman consent subordinate its first priority in the collateral so that extrinsic evidence was proper and,based on the testimony and the parties dealings,sugarman the sba could not do persuasive.
lpp has appealed,urging various errors the standard of review in this court varies with the claim of error.broadly,issues of law are reviewed de novo,carr pms fishing,cir,and fact findings at a bench trial for clear error,principal mut.life ins,cir but several judgment calls arguably fall somewhere in between these poles.the case is not hard to analyze but several of the issues are very close calls.
we start with choice of law which,happily,turns out not to matter.in the district court,lpp claimed that massachusetts law governed,while sugarman thought maine law controlled.they agreed,however,that there were no substantive differences between the two states as to the relevant contract rules and the district court applied a hybrid of the two.neither side complains about this approach on appeal,and we mention it only because both sides were probably wrong.
because the guaranty is a contract between a private party and an agency of the united states,it appears likely that federal common law governs as to contractual issues,b,borrowing from state law where appropriate and consistent with federal interests.in some situations,federal common law might give the
