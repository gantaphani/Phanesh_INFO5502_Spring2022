the bankruptcy code automatic stay is designed to ensure the orderly distribution of assets by temporarily protecting the property of the debtor estate from the reach of creditors.a willful violation of the stay occurs when a creditor,with knowledge of the stay,seizes the debtor property without first obtaining relief from the stay from the bankruptcy court.here,we face the question whether the creditor violates the stay if,without permission of the bankruptcy court,he forecloses on an asset to which the debtor has only an arguable claim of right hereafter,arguable property.we answer in the affirmative,reverse the district court,affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court,and remand to that court for further proceedings.
this case arises out of the foreclosure of a parcel of land in eastland county,texas the eastland property.jacqueline chesnut chesnut,who is named in the deed as the sole purchaser of the eastland property,married the debtor,vance chesnut chesnut,in,approximately three years before she purchased the eastland property.the parties dispute whether the property was chesnut separate property or belonged to and chesnut as their community property.chesnut attended the closing without her husband and signed all of the relevant legal documents alone,including the real estate lien note,the deed of trust,the title policy and the warranty deed.although the warranty deed recites that the eastland property was acquired by jacqueline chesnut,as her sole and separate property and estate,chesnut contended that the eastland property was paid for with community funds,and texas law provides for a rebuttable presumption that property purchased during marriage is community property.
the original grantor of the deed,after having difficulty collecting timely payments from chesnut,sold the note to templeton mortgage corporation and its sole shareholder,mark templeton brown.after acquiring the note,brown corresponded with chesnut,telling her that she was delinquent in her obligations.in early,brown informed chesnut that if she did not make her account current,he would foreclose on the eastland property.after chesnut failed to make the necessary payments,brown set a foreclosure sale for february.
however,on january of,chesnut filed an individual chapter petition for bankruptcy relief.a copy of the bankruptcy petition was faxed to brown office that day and reviewed by brown attorney.in his appellate brief,brown acknowledges receipt of notification from chesnut of the filing of his chapter petition in fact,brown filed a copy of the notice as an exhibit in this lawsuit.the petition put brown on notice that chesnut claimed that the eastland property was community property under the protection of the automatic stay.a establishing the automatic stay for property of the estate a including community property in the debtor estate.although brown knew about the petition and chesnut claim that he held a community interest in the eastland property,brown proceeded with the foreclosure sale.the eastland property was sold on february,as planned.
chesnut brought this action against brown and templeton mortgage in august,asserting that brown willfully violated the automatic stay provisions of h.the bankruptcy court,without deciding whether the eastland property was community property,agreed.the bankruptcy court found that brown belief that the property was not part of the estate was not sufficient to obviate compliance with the procedures of d.the court assessed brown a fine and attorney fees.the district court reversed the bankruptcy court,and held that the eastland property was chesnut separate property and that,regardless of when that determination was made,there was no violation of the automatic stay because chesnut had no interest in the eastland property.chesnut appeals to this court.
we review a decision of a district court,which sat as an appellate court in review of the bankruptcy court,by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.in re gerhardt,cir.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and the conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.
the automatic stay is designed to protect creditors as well as debtors.without the stay,creditors might scramble to obtain as much property of the debtor limited estate as possible.the automatic stay prevents such a scramble by providing breathing room for a debtor and the bankruptcy court to institute an organized repayment plan.in re stembridge,cir.it allows for the equitable disbursement of estate property among creditors.see reliant energy,enron can,cir the purposes of the bankruptcy stay under include further ing equity of distribution among the creditors by forestalling a race to the courthouse.quoting gatx aircraft courtney leigh,cir.
the development of this principle has progressed unevenly over the last one hundred and fifty years.its evolving nature is reflected in the supreme court and congress incremental modification of the stay in response to perceived defects in its scope.although the bankruptcy act of did not include an express stay provision,the supreme court recognized the need for injunctive power as far back as.in ex parte christy,the court protected property in custodia legis literally,in the custody of the law loosely,in the care of the court under the rationale that an injunction was necessary to enforce the court jurisdiction over the equitable dispersal of property to creditors.how.t he purposes so essential to the just operation of the bankruptcy system,could scarcely be accomplished except by clothing the courts sitting in bankruptcy with the most ample powers and jurisdiction to accomplish them.ninety years later,the court extended the scope of the stay to protect property not in custodia legis.cont l bank rock island.congress followed in by making the stay.chandler act of,stat.congress later amended the statute to move the initiation date from confirmation of the plan back to the petition date in,congress enacted the current version of the stay.this section contains provisions that establish and enforce the stay,except particular kinds of property from its reach,and provide procedure for parties to seek relief from the stay.a h.
in h,congress gave debtors the right to sue for violation of the stay,specifying that a n individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.h.a willful violation 
does not require a specific intent to violate the automatic stay.rather,the statute provides for damages upon a finding that the defendant knew of the automatic stay and that the defendant actions which violated the stay were intentional.whether the party believes in good faith that it had a right to the property is not relevant to whether the act was willful or whether compensation must be awarded.
in re taylor,cir emphasis omitted quoting in re bloom,cir see also fleet mortgage group,kaneb,cir.thus,there are three elements to a claim under h the defendant must have known of the existence of the stay the defendant acts must have been intentional and these acts must have violated the stay.
the first two elements are undeniably present here.the bankruptcy court found that brown knew of chesnut bankruptcy filing,and that brown intentionally continued with the foreclosure.brown contests none of these findings.this leaves the question whether brown violated the automatic stay when he foreclosed on the eastland property without first seeking relief from the bankruptcy court.
section a bars any act to obtain possession of property of the estate and,by negative implication,allows any act to obtain possession of property that is not property of the estate.thus,seizing a debtor bank account would violate the stay,while foreclosing on the home of some unrelated individual property,to which the debtor neither had nor asserted a claim of interest,would not.neither of these examples disposes of the instant case,however,because the classification of the eastland property
