travis volden appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of innovative financial systems,ifs for claims made under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa and causes of action for fraud and deceit.ifs the district court conclusion that ifs is a debt collector for purposes of the fdcpa.we affirm.
background 
ifs is primarily a check guarantee company that contracts with merchants who accept checks from customers.ifs,in turn,contracts with eft network,eft to process returned checks through the automated clearing house ach a national network of banks and financial institutions used to transfer funds electronically to and from bank customers accounts.under this arrangement,a check written to a merchant is endorsed with a stamp that includes ifs account information at huntington national bank hnb,the bank where ifs maintained an account for purposes of the eft contract,and deposited at the merchant bank.if the check is dishonored by the drawer bank,after the merchant bank has credited the merchant account for the amount of the check,the federal reserve sends it to hnb as directed by the endorsement.hnb then debits ifs account for the amount of the dishonored check,and ifs attempts to collect on the check electronically or by using conventional methods of phoning or writing letters to the check writer.
the national automated clearing house association nacha is an association of financial institutions who use the ach.nacha promulgates rules for use of the ach that participating financial institutions agree to follow.one of those rules provides that before a charge for a collection fee for again presenting a dishonored check can be submitted through the ach,written authorization by the owner of the account to be charged must be obtained.as part of its contract with eft,ifs agreed to comply with the operating rules of nacha each time it initiated an ach entry with eft,to obtain written authorization from account holders in order to collect fees,and that each ach entry submitted to eft represents and warrants that authorization has been obtained for the debiting or crediting of the account.
in june,volden wrote two dishonored checks to mcdonald restaurants and two to an establishment called the crow bar.the checks totaled.mcdonald and the crow bar contracted with ifs for their check guarantee services.after the checks were returned by the merchants banks,ifs electronically submitted them to eft for through the ach to volden credit union.three of the four dishonored checks were presented twice.ifs also separately submitted a collection fee plus sales tax for each check each presentment resulted in a charge from volden credit union because of insufficient funds.
when electronic collection failed,ifs sent volden written notices in july that his checks had been dishonored and that he should send payment immediately.in september,ifs sent a notice,giving volden four options on how to proceed.volden finally paid the entire debt using his credit card and subsequently brought suit against ifs pursuant to the fdcpa and south dakota law.
volden argued in the district court that ifs was a debt collector under the fdcpa,making it subject to that act.volden also argued that because he had not authorized ifs to electronically collect fees from his account,as required by the nacha rules and by the contract itself,that ifs had engaged in a false,deceptive,and misleading practice when it submitted the fee to eft for collection.ifs countered that it was not a debt collector,and even if it were,the conspicuously posted signs at the merchants cash registers and volden signing of the checks constituted volden agreement to be charged the collection fee.the district court held that per duffy landberg,cir duffy i,ifs was a debt collector within the meaning of the fdcpa.it also held that permits collection of a fee if authorized by the debtor or allowed by law.since south dakota codified laws section authorizes check fees where signs are posted by merchants,and the court found that both mcdonald and the crow bar had signs posted,the court concluded that ifs could collect the fees.the court granted summary judgment to ifs.
volden appeals,arguing ifs misrepresented facts to a third party in the process of collecting on a debt,and that its written notices to volden were not adequate,all in violation of the fdcpa.ifs the district court conclusion that it is a debt collector under the fdcpa.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.peters serv.bureau,cir.
is ifs a debt collector under the fdcpa 
we deal first with ifs,for if ifs is not a debt collector for purposes of the fdcpa,the statute does not apply,and volden federal claims fail.the fdcpa imposes civil liability only on debt collectors,as they are defined by the statute.a debt collector is any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts,or who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.id.at.
to argue that it is not a debt collector,ifs attempts to divorce the collection fee it assessed against volden from the underlying amount of each check it collected.after all,ifs asserts,volden sued it over the collection fee,and not over the underlying check debt.viewing the collection fee in isolation,ifs argues that the collection fee is not a debt under the fdcpa because it was not a transaction for personal,family,or household purposes the collection fee was not a debt in default at the time of attempted collection,as required by the statutory definition of debt collector and the collection fee is a obligation for which ifs is a creditor of volden,and not a debt collector.
we are not convinced by ifs inventive premise.the collection fee can not be viewed in a vacuum.it arose as an incident to the underlying debt ifs collected on the dishonored checks,and thus is not an independent basis on which status under the fdcpa may be determined.the fdcpa bars debt collectors from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.the fdcpa indicates that collection fees which arise by way of an underlying debt are viewed as part of that debt for purposes of determining conduct that falls under the statute.the collection of any amount including any interest,fee,charge,or expense incidental to the principal obligation is deemed the collection of a debt.id.at emphasis added.the definitions section defines debt collector using the same any debt language.id.at the term debt collector means any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts.thus,the collection fees in this case can not be viewed apart from the underlying check amounts in an attempt to avoid status under the fdcpa.
viewed in this light,ifs argument that it is not a debt collector fails.first,the debt ifs collected from volden was for a transaction for personal,family,or household purposes.it is undisputed that volden wrote the checks at issue to mcdonald and the crow bar for personal uses.second,the debt ifs collected was also a debt in default at the time of attempted collection.section f iii excludes from the definition of debt collector any person attempting to collect a debt which was not in default at the time it was obtained by such person.the only reason the checks were referred to ifs was because they were dishonored by volden credit union.had the checks been honored,ifs would have never obtained them.this court decision in duffy i forecloses any argument that a dishonored check is not a debt in default.third,the debt was not a obligation making ifs a creditor of volden.
the term creditor means any person who offers or extends credit creating a debt or to whom a debt is owed,but such term does not include any person to the extent that he receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in default solely for the purpose of facilitating collection of such debt for another.
we agree with those courts that have found that check authorization services do not become creditors under the act when they attempt to collect a defaulted debt assigned to them by another party.winterstein crosscheck,d,check authorization service is not a creditor within the meaning of the fdcpa where it receive s an assignment of a debt in default.holmes telecredit serv.holding that check authorization service was not a creditor because it received title to dishonored checks from another party after the checks were already in default.the debt ifs was assigned was in default and,therefore,ifs was not a creditor of volden.
given the fdcpa definition of debt collector,that ifs principal eighty processing dishonored checks,and our decision in duffy i,we hold that ifs is a debt collector under the fdcpa.see duffy,at t attempts to collect payment on a dishonored check can be debt collection practices within the meaning of the fdcpa and be subject to its consumer protections.
b.did ifs use a false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of a debt,in violation of the fdcpa 
having determined that ifs is subject to the fdcpa,we turn to volden various arguments that ifs made a false,deceptive,or misleading representation in connection with the collection of volden debt.we begin with his assertion that ifs made a false representation to eft,making ifs liable to volden under the fdcpa.
was ifs submission of collection fee a false,deceptive,or misleading representation 
section provides that a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.as earlier noted,ifs contract with eft states that ifs agrees to comply with all rules at the time each entry is initiated by ifs with respect to the most recent represented check entry program guidelines and that each entry of a collection fee claim to the ach shall in no way breach any federal,state or local statute or regulation pertaining to electronic funds transfers electronic check representment including the operating rules of nacha.it then states that ifs must obtain written authorization from the account holder in order to collect a fee.the contract also says that ifs represents and warrants with respect to all entries that eft originates for ifs that each debtor has authorized the debiting or crediting of its account,each entry is for an amount agreed by the debtor,and each entry is in all respects properly authorized.emphasis added.
ifs promised eft that its entries would comply with applicable law and the nacha rules,and that ifs would obtain written permission from account holders to collect a fee.when ifs submitted volden checks to eft for processing,it apparently did not have volden written authorization to collect the fees,which is required by nacha rules and is a direct requirement of the contract.thus,by not obtaining volden written permission,ifs apparently breached the contract with eft in two ways.but these breaches,by themselves,are not a false,deceptive,or misleading representation by ifs to eft.ifs did not affirmatively tell eft at the time it submitted volden checks that it had his permission to collect the fee its actions breached the contract,the claim for which,if any,belongs to eft.
ifs contract with eft does,however,state that an implicit representation flows with the submission of each check collection entry fee.ifs represents and warrants emphasis added with each entry submitted that the account holder has authorized the debiting of the account for the amount to be debited,and that each entry is in all respects properly authorized.emphasis added.whether ifs falsely represented that volden had authorized collection of the fee,then,turns on the meaning of properly authorized under the contract.
regulation e,et,regulates electronic fund transfers through the ach under the electronic fund transfer act et.supplement i to section of regulation e entitled coverage states that a consumer authorizes a check collection fee to be debited electronically from his or her account where the consumer has received notice that a fee imposed for returned checks will be debited electronically from the consumer account.the record indicates that both mcdonald and the crow bar had posted signs warning consumers of the check collection fee charged by ifs for returned checks.thus,under regulation e rule,volden,by paying the merchants with a check and having notice of the fee,had authorized ifs to debit his account,and in that sense the collection fee entry was properly authorized.
but the contract expressly states that ifs must obtain written authorization from the account holder in order to collect a fee.emphasis added.the contract states it is governed by nevada law.under nevada law,a contract is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.margrave dermody.while this contract provision does not specifically define properly authorized for purposes of the section,that term is not reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation in this case.the express terms of the contract contemplate written authorization,not implied authorization per regulation e,and thus properly authorized means written authorization by the consumer.there is no dispute that ifs did not have volden written authorization.thus,when ifs submitted the collection fees to eft,by definition under the contract,ifs falsely represented to eft that such submissions were properly authorized.
was ifs false representation in connection with the collection of a debt 
though ifs,by the terms of the contract,made a false representation,that representation was made to eft,not to volden.volden argues that the language of section does not require that a false representation be made to the consumer.he argues that the in connection with language in the section includes false representation made to others while in the process of collecting a debt.volden directs us to only one district court case in support of his argument.notwithstanding this being relatively scant support,even the case provided is distinguishable.see van westrienen americontinental collection,d.
in van westrienen,the district court held that under section,the consumer debtor does not have to be the actual recipient of the false statement in order to press a claim.all that is needed is that a debt collector use a misrepresentation in connection with the collection of any debt.id.citation omitted.in that case,a debt collector maintained misleading information on its website,and in a collection letter referred the plaintiff to the website.there was conflicting testimony about whether the plaintiff actually viewed the site,but the plaintiff argued it did not matter since the information on the site was misleading,and the debt collector referred the plaintiff to the site in its collection letter.the court agreed,stating d efendants are debt collectors who used the misrepresentations in the website in connection with collecting the debt from plaintiffs by inviting them to view the website.id.at.though viewed in a vacuum the district court statement seems to broaden the scope of misleading representations beyond the debtor,the context involves a debt collector directing a debtor to misleading information.
we have found only one other case,again from the same court that issued van westrienen,to assert a similarly broad sentiment.in mathis omnium worldwide,no.civ,wl,plaintiff brought suit against a debt collector who persisted in contacting her about her deceased father debts.the court rejected the debt collector argument that plaintiff could not bring suit under the fdcpa because she was not the consumer who owed the debt.citing section,the court stated that the statutory language does not require the prohibited conduct to be directed only at the consumer to be actionable.id.at.though this statement by itself might support volden argument,the thrust of mathis was to clarify that the statutory language of the fdcpa does not limit causes of actions to those brought by a consumer,so long as the alleged conduct was directed at the plaintiff.id.e
