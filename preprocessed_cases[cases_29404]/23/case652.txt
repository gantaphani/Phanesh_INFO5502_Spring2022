background 
in july,lindsay kan executed a first note for,secured by a deed of trust on real property in stevenson ranch the property.the same day,he executed a second note in the amount of,also secured by a deed of trust on the property.both trust deeds named guild mortgage company as the lender,guild administration as the trustee,and mortgage electronic registration systems,mers as the beneficiary acting as nominee for the lender,its successors,and assigns.
more than two years later based on what is characterized in appellant opening brief as spectacularly unsound and specious advice kan recorded two instruments that purported to modify the deeds of trust to correctly reflect an indebtedness of zero dollars.the instruments stated the deeds of trust were modified to eliminate any further payments,and to reflect a status of paid as agreed.shortly afterward,pcya trust,of which kan is the trustee,recorded two documents labeled full reconveyance,purporting to reconvey both trust deeds to lindsay kan and declare them void at inception.kan then deeded the property to the pcya trust.
in october,in spite of kan maneuverings,mers substituted recontrust company,recontrust as the trustee under the first deed of trust and assigned all beneficial interest under the deed of trust to the bank of new york mellon bony,as trustee for cwalt,alternative loan trust mortgage pass through certificates,series cwalt recontrust recorded a notice of default on december.it served a notice of trustee sale in march.the foreclosure sale,however,has not yet occurred.
the second deed of trust was assigned by mers to bank of america,bofa in july.
in october,kan,as trustee of the pcya trust,filed a quiet title complaint against guild mortgage company and all persons or entities unknown,claiming any legal or equitable right,title,estate,lien or interest in the property.the complaint alleged,among other things,that the loans secured by the property were securitized,resulting in defendants interest in the property being extinguished,relinquished,or discharged.it further claimed that all loan debt had been fully satisfied.in addition,the complaint alleged that the securitization process was deficient because the transfer of the promissory notes to a securitized trust did not comply with the terms of the servicing and pooling agreement governing the securitized trust.
although the complaint alleged that the first trust deed had been assigned to bony,and an attachment to the complaint showed that the second trust deed was assigned to bofa,neither entity was listed as a defendant.as a result,respondents bony and bofa,along with respondent bana las hfi lien heloans bana,moved to intervene in the action.according to the application for leave to intervene,bony is the current beneficiary of the first deed of trust,bana is the current beneficiary of the second deed of trust,and bofa is the current servicer of the loans.the trial court granted leaved to intervene.

ii.proposed amendments 
the complaint contained a number of theories by which kan claimed he was the sole party that had valid title to the property.on appeal,kan abandons the majority of these theories,and argues only that he can state a valid cause of action for quiet title based on allegations that the attempt to transfer the first deed of trust to the investment trust cwalt did not comply with the trust servicing and pooling agreement and was therefore void.
kan proposes that,upon remand,he be allowed to amend his complaint to make the following allegations the investment trust was created under new york law the trust is subject to the requirements imposed by the internal revenue code on real estate investment trusts new york law requires that all trust deeds be transferred to such an investment trust before the trust closes the transfer of the subject trust deed to the investment trust occurred after the trust closed in and the attempted transfer to the investment trust was therefore void.kan asserts these allegations sufficiently plead a right to quiet title in his favor,including a finding that respondents have no right,title,or interest in the property.
iii.analysis 
kan argument is not a novel one.the wave of real estate loan defaults over the past decade has given rise to a number of creative theories developed by individuals hoping to avoid foreclosure.the argument that a defendant lacks standing to foreclose because of an improper securitization process has recently become particularly popular.
this argument was addressed in jenkins jpmorgan chase bank,cal app th,jenkins.the plaintiff alleged that her loan was pooled with other home loans in a securitized investment trust in a manner violating the trust pooling and servicing agreement,thereby resulting in extinguishment of any security interest in her home.the jenkins court found that the plaintiff allegations were insufficient to state a cause of action because california courts have refused to delay the nonjudicial foreclosure process by allowing to pursue preemptive judicial actions to challenge the right,power,and authority of a foreclosing beneficiary or beneficiary agent to initiate and pursue foreclosure.id.at.california nonjudicial foreclosure scheme has an exhaustive nature,which is intended to provide the with a quick,inexpensive and efficient remedy against a defaulting to protect the from wrongful loss of the property and to ensure that a properly conducted sale is final between the parties and conclusive as to a bona fide purchaser.id.at,quoting gomes countrywide home loans,th,gomes.a preemptive action seeks to create the additional requirement that the foreclosing entity must demonstrate in court that it is authorized to initiate a foreclosure before the foreclosure can proceed,a process not contemplated by the nonjudicial foreclosure statutes.jenkins,supra,cal app th at,quoting gomes,supra th at.the jenkins court distinguished a factual situation involving misconduct in a nonjudicial forec
