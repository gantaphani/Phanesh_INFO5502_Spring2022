the fair debt collection practices act,so far as relates to this case,forbids a debt collector which the defendant is to use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation in connection with the collection of any debt.the defendant sent a dunning letter to credit card debtors,including the plaintiffs and the or so other members of the class that the plaintiffs represent,which states with irrelevant boilerplate language omitted 
the above referenced account has been referred to our office for collection of the balance in full.previous attempts have been made by our client to resolve this debt voluntarily.as of this date,those attempts have not been successful.therefore,your original agreement with the above mentioned creditor has been revoked.
encore receivable management,the defendant debt collector has been authorized by our client to provide the necessary effort to collect this debt.we recommend that you take advantage of this opportunity to pay the balance in full to prevent further collection activity.
unless you notify this office within days after receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of this debt or any portion thereof,this office will assume this debt is valid.if you notify this office in writing within days from receiving this notice,this office will obtain verification of the debt or obtain a copy of a judgment and mail you a copy of such judgment or verification.
the plaintiffs allege that the sentence that we have italicized in the first paragraph of the letter is false,and they sought to bolster this allegation with deposition testimony that specific provisions of the contract were still in effect,in which event the agreement itself had not been revoked.certainly the payment requirements of the contract were still in were the basis of the attempt to collect a debt due to the issuer.the plaintiffs argue that this false statement was misleading and confusing,a claim they attempted to support with a consumer survey.the district judge excluded the survey and went on to rule that the challenged sentence is true because it clearly means only that the debtors privileges have been revoked and so he granted summary judgment for the defendant.
the judge was right to exclude the survey.although the plaintiffs hired a competent survey researcher to conduct it,the questions he asked in the survey were drafted not by him but by the plaintiffs lawyer.that has turned out to be a mistake.a consumer survey,to be sufficiently objective to be usable as evidence in a suit under the fair debt collection practices act,depends among other things on whether the questions are leading or suggestive.american home products johnson johnson,see also johnson johnson merck consumer pharmaceuticals smithkline beecham,cir pittsburgh press club united states,cir weight watchers int l,stouffer,bruce keller,a survey of survey evidence,in the litigation manual john koeltl john kiernan eds business and commercial litigation in federal courts,robert haig,ed.that the questions were drafted by the plaintiffs lawyer was apt to make them leading,and did.
the key meaning of your original agreement with the above mentioned creditor has been revoked was rephrased as follows,with a choice of possible answers 
if a debt collector sent you a letter stating that your agreement with the original creditor has been revoked,what do you feel this statement means 
there is no longer a contract between the original creditor and me.
i must pay the debt immediately.
i do not have to pay the debt because the creditor revoked the agreement.
i am unsure as to what this means.
the survey respondents should have been read it was a telephone survey the actual wording of the letter.and the suggested answers omitted the defendant reading,adopted by the the recipient privileges have been revoked.we add parenthetically that a telephone survey is not an ideal method of testing the understanding of a written statement,since inflection can alter meaning and some written statements are easier to understand when read than when heard.
the plaintiffs argue that only a lawyer could draft the survey questions because a survey researcher would not be familiar with the fair debt collection practices act.that is not correct.the questions designed to elicit a consumer understanding of the meaning of the passage that we quoted do not require any knowledge of the act.if they did,the proper response would be for the lawyer to explain the relevant law to the survey researcher.
there is more that is wrong with the survey.there was no control group of survey respondents shown a wording of the dunning letter that the plaintiffs agreed would not be confusing or that simply omitted the challenged sentence.as we explained in johnson revenue management,cir emphasis added,the plaintiff has to show that the additional language of the letters unacceptably increases the level of confusion many unsophisticated consumers would be confused even if the letters they received contained nothing more than a statement of the debt and the statutory notice.phyllis welter,trademark surveys b,to.
the defendant,it is true,makes an unsound objection to the instead of targeting unsophisticated consumers it surveyed a random sample of consumers.the average consumer is more sophisticated than the unsophisticated consumer because the average is the average of a group that contains sophisticated consumers as well.yet the law is primarily intended to protect the unsophisticated consumer,taylor cavalry investment,cir russell equifax,cir,since the sophisticated one can usually fend for himself that is what sophistication means in this context.so a better survey would include questions designed to filter out the sophisticated.but that is of no consequence in this case a defendant can only be helped by a survey that includes responses from the sophisticated.
the plaintiffs lawyer made a damaging admission at oral argument,but we will not hold him to it.he said that without the survey he could not prove that his clients are entitled to a positive amount of statutory damages he was not seeking actual damages.not so.
in a suit under the act other than a class action,the amount of damages is such damages as the court may allow,a a,while in a class action,which this case is,the class itself which the judge certified is additionally entitled to an amount of damages not to exceed the lesser of or per centum of the net worth of the debt collector,a b,plus attorneys fees,a.the act directs the judge,in computing damages,to 
consider,among other relevant factors 
in any individual action under subsection a a of this section,the frequency and persistence of noncompliance by the debt collector,the nature of such noncompliance,and the extent to which such noncompliance was intentional or 
in any class action under subsection a b of this section,the frequency and persistence of noncompliance by the debt collector,the nature of such noncompliance,the resources of the debt collector,the number of persons adversely affected,and the extent to which the debt collector noncompliance was intentional.
b.with the possible exception of the nature of such noncompliance,insofar as it refers to the gravity of the violation,see graziano harrison,cir,or its blatancy,crossley lieberman,cir pipiles credit bureau of lockport,cir though we are unclear what as a practical matter these inquiries would add to a determination of the frequency and persistence of the unlawful factors listed in the statute are independent of what a consumer survey would show.
not wanting their appeal to depend on the admissibility of the survey,the plaintiffs argue that if a statement in a dunning letter is false,the district judge need not find that it would not mislead anyone,and that the statement that the debtor agreement with the issuer of the creditor has been revoked is false.even if we accept the premise,the conclusion would not follow.if the average unsophisticated consumer would not be influenced by a statement rightly or wrongly claimed to be literally false,the case should end right there.hahn triumph partnerships llc,wl cir.mar,wahl midland credit management,cir.as we expla
