the plaintiff,george velasco,brought this action to compel the payment of a promissory note the promissory note or note,issued by former staff members of the national defense security council of the republic of indonesia ndsc in the amount of million,against the ndsc,the government of indonesia,chalid mawardi,indonesia former ambassador to syria,former ndsc official ibnu hartomo,and various other unnamed government officials and agencies,all in their official capacities collectively,the defendants.the district court entered an order granting the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,a,f,d,and.the plaintiff appeals that order.finding no reversible error,we affirm the decision of the district court.
on october,former ndsc deputies for development and planning,ibnu hartomo and soebagyo soedewo,issued a series of indonesian promissory notes collectively valued at billion.the notes bear the crest of the ndsc and are payable in dollars to the central establishment for trade and and or their bearer in new york.hartomo utilized the offices of the syrian government to validate and effect the issuance of the notes at a signing ceremony at a hotel in damascus,syria,attended by the president of the central bank of syria,hartomo signed the notes,and mawardi certified that they were.a representative of the syrian ministry of foreign affairs notarized mawardi signature on the notes.the central establishment for trade and investment then indorsed the notes,rendering them bearer in form.thereafter,hartomo exchanged the notes for notes issued by hassan zubaidi,a financier.zubaidi placed some of the notes in the international market.
hartomo admitted that at the time he issued the notes,he knew he was not authorized to do so.the former ndsc secretary general,achmad wiranatakusumah,declared that two letters of authorization purportedly signed by him and empowering hartomo and soedewo to issue the instruments on behalf of the ndsc were forgeries.similarly,ambassador mawardi had not received an express delegation of authority from the ministry of finance or the department of foreign affairs and,therefore,lacked the authority to confirm or legalize the notes the notes themselves contain numerous facial irregularities and are distinguishable from notes issued by bank indonesia or the indonesian ministry of finance,the only agents under indonesian law with authority to issue promissory notes binding on the government.among other things,the notes lack a statement that they were issued under the authority of those entities,fail to designate a specific payment agent,place of payment,or exact amount and method of repayment,and omit other key terms.
in late,the ndsc became aware of reports that the notes were in circulation.on december,the ministry of finance issued a letter to certain government ministerial departments alerting them of the alleged ndsc promissory notes,advising them that only the ministry of finance and bank indonesia are authorized to obtain foreign loans on behalf of the republic of indonesia,and requesting an investigation into the matter.the ministry of finance and bank indonesia determined that the purported ndsc notes were not issued in accordance with indonesian law and,therefore,were not binding on the republic of indonesia.on january,the ndsc secretary general sent a confidential memorandum to the governor of bank indonesia stating that the ndsc had no authority to issue promissory notes and that it did not and could not authorize any ndsc official,including hartomo and soedewo,to issue any promissory notes.
the secretary general requested bank indonesia to issue notices announcing that the purported ndsc notes were void and invalid.on january,february,and march,bank indonesia issued circulars by telex alerting all banks in jakarta,bank indonesia branch offices,and bank indonesia representative offices worldwide of the unauthorized notes and advising them the issuance of such notes was conducted at the risk and responsibility of the individual issuers.on march,hartomo was discharged from his position at the ndsc.on april,the ndsc issued a press release confirming that it was not authorized to issue promissory notes and that the purported ndsc notes were unauthorized and illegal.subsequently,the international press,including the new york times,the asian wall street journal,and forbes magazine,reported widely on the fake notes and bank indonesia repeated repudiation of them.it is undisputed that these events occurred prior to the time velasco purchased his note.
velasco purchased his note in panama on september,from patrizion bucciarelli,an italian businessman,for million and approximately in antique gold coins.when he presented the note for payment at banaico bank in panama city on november,one day after the note maturity date,the bank informed him that indonesia refused payment.velasco presented the note for payment on subsequent occasions at the offices of the indonesian consulate general,which informed him that the note was unauthorized and not payable.
velasco subsequently sued to enforce payment on the note.his amended complaint states claims for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,unfair and deceptive trade practices,and breach of contract and demands specific performance as well as monetary damages.the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction,improper venue,insufficient service of process,and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court held that the plaintiff failed to prove that any former staff members of the ndsc had either actual or apparent authority to issue the note.accordingly,the court held that the acts of the ndsc with respect to the issuance of the note were not the acts of a foreign state and that the commercial activity exception to the fsia did not apply.the district court determined the defendants to be immune from suit pursuant to the fsia and granted the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction without reaching the defendants alternate bases for dismissal.velasco contends that the district court erred in ruling that the acts of the defendants in conjunction with the issuance of the note did not constitute commercial activity of a foreign state which abrogates sovereign immunity under the fsia.
