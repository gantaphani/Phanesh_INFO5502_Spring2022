fair debt collection practices act 
the panel reversed the district court summary judgment in favor of the defendant in an action under the fair debt collection practices act.
the act requires that within five days of the initial communication with a consumer about the collection of a debt,a debt collector must send the consumer a notice containing specific disclosures.the panel held that this requirement,set forth in a,does not apply only to the initial debt collector that tries to collect,but also applies to subsequent collectors that communicate about the same debt.
friedland,circuit judge 
the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa requires that within five days of the initial communication with a consumer about the collection of a debt,a debt collector must send the consumer a notice containing specified disclosures.a.the question presented here is whether the phrase the initial communication as used in the fdcpa means the first communication from the initial debt collector that tries to collect,or whether it means the first communication a consumer receives from any collector about a debt,including subsequent collectors that communicate about the same debt.
applying tools of statutory interpretation and construing the language in a in light of the context and purpose of the fdcpa,we hold that the phrase the initial communication refers to the first communication sent by any debt collector,including collectors that contact the debtor after another collector already did.in other words,if there are multiple debt collectors that try to collect a debt,each one must send the required notice after its first communication with the alleged debtor about the debt.because the district court held otherwise,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
this case began with a loan that maria hernandez took out to finance an automobile purchase.after hernandez stopped making payments on the loan,thunderbird collection specialists,thunderbird,a debt collector,sent her a letter seeking to collect the debt.hernandez did not respond to the letter.
following thunderbird unsuccessful attempt to collect hernandez debt,thunderbird retained the law firm williams,zinman parham pc wzp as counsel to assist in its collection efforts.in december,wzp sent hernandez a collection letter,which was its initial communication with her.the letter notified hernandez that wzp,a debt collector,represented thunderbird regarding a debt incurred by hernandez with the original creditor while it informed hernandez that she could dispute the debt or request additional information about the original creditor,it did not tell her that she could do so only in writing.
hernandez filed the instant lawsuit against wzp in the united states district court for the district of arizona as a putative class action,alleging that wzp violated the fdcpa by sending a debt collection letter that lacked the disclosures required under a of the fdcpa.that section provides in full 
a notice of debt contents 
within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt,a debt collector shall,unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt,send the consumer a written notice containing 
the amount of the debt 
the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed 
a statement that unless the consumer,within thirty days after receipt of the notice,disputes the validity of the debt,or any portion thereof,the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector 
a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the period that the debt,or any portion thereof,is disputed,the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector and 
a statement that,upon the consumer written request within the thirty day period,the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor,if different from the current creditor.
a we refer herein to the written notice containing these disclosures as a validation notice.
hernandez alleged that wzp failure to notify her that any dispute about the debt had to be in writing to obtain verification of it,or that any request had to be in writing to obtain the name and address of the original creditor,violated a and a,respectively.
the parties filed for summary judgment on hernandez fdcpa claims.in its motion,wzp did not address whether its letter lacked the content required by a.rather,it contended that it was not required to comply with that provision because thunderbird march letter was the initial communication sent to hernandez with respect to the debt at issue and therefore the sole communication triggering a requirements.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of wzp.
hernandez timely appealed,contending that a imposes the requirement to send a validation notice on each and every debt collector that communicates with a consumer about a given debt 
we review de novo the district court interpretation of a,as well as its rulings on for summary judgment based on that interpretation.clark capital credit collection,cir.
the sole dispute on appeal is whether the phrase the initial communication as used in a refers only to the very first communication sent about a debt or instead to the first communication sent by each and every debt collector that seeks to collect it,including those collectors that take over collection efforts from a prior debt collector.although this question has divided the district courts,it is an issue of first impression for this court,and it has not yet been addressed in a published opinion by any of our sister circuits 
in answer to this question,we hold that although the sentence in a in which the phrase the initial communication appears is ambiguous when read in isolation,when the sentence is read in the context of the fdcpa as a whole and in light of the statute remedial purpose,it is clear that the validation notice requirement applies to each debt collector that attempts to collect a debt.

when an examination of the plain language of the statute,its structure,and purpose clearly reveals congressional intent,our judicial inquiry is complete.real,at quoting campbell allied van lines,cir.but if the plain meaning of the statutory text remains unclear after consulting internal indicia of congressional intent,we may then turn to extrinsic indicators,such as legislative history,to help resolve the ambiguity.bf goodrich,at explaining that only if holistic analysis of the statutory text leaves ambiguity or,indeed,if it reveals it may we turn to extrinsic indicia of legislative intent.see also benko quality loan serv,cir.if the statutory text is ambiguous,we employ other tools,such as legislative history,to construe the meaning of ambiguous terms.
the text of a does not alone reveal which party interpretation is correct.in the fdcpa,congress did not define the term the initial communication or the word initial.congress did define communication to mean the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium.this definition of communication is broad enough to sweep into its ambit both the march letter from thunderbird and the december letter from wzp.
wzp argues that,regardless of the lack of formal definition in the fdcpa,the meaning of a phrase the initial communication is clear.wzp contends that by using the definite article the preceding initial communication,congress plainly contemplated that only one initial communication with a debtor about a given debt would trigger the validation notice requirement.according to wzp,under this definition,it was not obligated to send a validation notice because,as the second collector to attempt to collect the debt,it did not send hernandez the very first,the initial communication about the debt.
when the phrase the initial communication is viewed in isolation,wzp is correct that the use of t he definite article the instead of the indefinite a or an preceding initial communication appears to indicate that congress meant for a single communication to trigger the validation notice requirement.onink cardelucci in re cardelucci,cir.see also united states barron,cir.en banc congress s use of the definite article the,when referring to the judgment,carries the message that there is one identifiable document.this is because the definite article the particularizes the subject spoken of,suggesting that congress meant to refer to a single object here,a single initial communication.black law dictionary ed.providing as an example that t he house means only one house.
the meaning of the phrase the initial communication is less clear,however,when the phrase the initial communication is read in conjunction with the phrase a debt collector that follows in the same sentence.gale first franklin loan,cir.refusing to take a blindered view of a statute by construing its language in isolation see also sturgeon frost,statutory language can not be construed in a vacuum.quoting roberts.congress provided that within five days of the initial communication,a debt collector must send a validation notice.a emphases added.in contrast with its particularization of initial communication,congress use of the indefinite article a preceding debt collector gives that term generalizing force,gale,at quoting in re cardelluci,at,and thus suggests that congress may have intended to impose the validation notice requirement on any debt collector subject to fdcpa requirements.see black law dictionary ed.providing that t he article a is often used in the sense of any see also levi strauss abercrombie fitch trading,cir.explaining that by using the indefinite article a in the phrase a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution,congress indicate d that any number of unspecified,junior marks may be likely to dilute the senior mark emphasis added quoting c.
ultimately,nothing in a limits its application to only the first debt collector that communicates about a debt.at the same time,nothing in the section clarifies whether the initial communication refers to the first communication ever sent about the debt or the first communication sent by each and every debt collector seeking to collect it.as wzp argues,congress use of the phrase a debt collector could mean that whichever debt collector sends the very first communication about a debt must comply with.or,as hernandez argues,it could mean that each debt collector must comply with upon sending its first communication about the debt.either interpretation is consistent with the language of a,and the section is therefore ambiguous when viewed apart from its statutory context see ileto,at looking to statutory context to clarify ambiguity because the term in question,viewed in isolation,ha d a spectrum of meanings.
because the text of a is ambiguous when read alone,we must turn to the broader structure of the fdcpa to determine which initial communication triggers the validation notice requirement the first ever sent or the first sent by any debt collector,whether first or subsequent.king,at.a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.id.alteration in original quoting united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest.viewing the text of a in the context of the fdcpa as a whole makes clear that the validation notice requirement applies to each debt collector that tries to collect a given debt.this interpretation is the only one that is consistent with the rest of the statutory text and that avoids creating substantial loopholes around both a validation notice requirement and b debt verification requirement loopholes that otherwise would undermine the very protections the statute provides.see king,at rejecting an interpretation that would create the problem congress designed the statute to avoid.
examining the full text of the fdcpa reveals that congress used the phrase a debt collector throughout the statute to impose obligations and restrictions on all debt collectors throughout the entire debt collection process.for instance,the fdcpa 
regulates the time and place at which a debt collector may communicate with a consumer,a 
bars a debt collector from communicating with about a debt,b 
proscribes harassment and abuse by a debt collector,
bars a debt collector from using false,deceptive,or misleading representation s in connection with the collection of any debt,and 
prevents a debt collector from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt.
none of these provisions contains any language suggesting that congress intended to exempt successive debt collectors from their requirements.and the fdcpa broad definition of debt collector plainly encompasses those persons who take over debt collection efforts from another.see defining debt collector to include,with specified exceptions,any person who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due another emphasis added.
had congress intended to distinguish between the obligations that attach to initial and subsequent debt collectors,it would have said so explicitly.trs.for alaska dep t of interior,cir.instead,congress made clear the broad reach of these obligations by imposing civil liability on any debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of the fdcpa.a emphasis added.
wzp attempts to show that congress intended to cabin a requirements to the initial communication sent by the initial debt collector,but those attempts are unavailing.first,wzp argues that congress use of the definite article in the phrase the period in subsections a and a of demonstrates that the statute contemplated one initial communication and one period for dispute.wzp argument is unpersuasive because the phrase the period must be looked at in relation to subsection a.in subsection a,congress provided that the validation notice must contain a statement that unless the consumer,within thirty days after receipt of the notice,disputes the validity of the debt,the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector.a.the term the period logically refers back to the term thirty days after receipt of the notice in subsection a,while the notice refers back to the validation notice that must be sent by a debt collector following the initial communication.see gale,at looking at the preceding sentence to determine what was meant by t he use of the definite article in a statutory provision see also oxford english dictionary ed.providing that the word the m ark s an object as before mentioned or already known,or contextually particularized we keep a dog.we are all fond of the dog.webster new int l dictionary of the english language unabridged ed.defining the as a function word to indicate that a following noun refers to someone or something previously mentioned or clearly understood from the context of the situation.thus,congress use of the definite article in the term the period serves as an internal reference to other statutory subsections,not as an indicator of the total number of dispute periods that congress intended to provide debtors.congress use of the term the period therefore does not shed light on whether there can be only one notice and one period for dispute.
next,wzp contends that congress distinction between the initial written communication and subsequent communications in the only other fdcpa provision that uses a term similar to the initial communication shows that congress knew how to impose requirements on communications after the first one had that been its intent.section prohibits a debt collector from fail ing to disclose in the initial written communication with the consumer that the debt collector is attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose,and from fail ing to disclose in subsequent communications that the communication is from a debt collector.emphases added.contrary to wzp contention,the fact that congress chose to regulate both initial and subsequent communications in in no way suggests that it intended to limit the term the initial communication to the first communication ever sent about a debt.section can readily be interpreted to regulate the initial and subsequent communications sent by each and every debt collector that communicates about a debt.indeed,the language of supports that interpretation because the fact that it plainly differentiates between initial and subsequent communications suggests congress knew how to distinguish between initial and subsequent debt collectors had that been its intent.see united states,discerning from statutory language that congress knew how to provide for the computation of time periods under the speedy trial act relative to the date of an indictment and that it would have so provided in the statutory section in question had that been its intent.that congress chose not to is consistent with the fdcpa broad imposition of requirements on all debt collectors throughout the lifecycle of a debt.
wzp restrictive interpretation that there is only a single initial communication about a debt also creates a significant structural problem in the act.as several district courts have pointed out,restricting the validation notice requirement to the initial debt collector produces a loophole that would,in practice,undermine consumers efforts to verify their debts and congress mandate that collection efforts halt until verification occurs.see,janetos fulton friedman gullace,llp,wl,at,stair ex rel.smith thomas cook,turner shenandoah legal,wl,at.june.congress s intent in enacting was to provide an alleged debtor with days to question and respond to the initial communication of a collection agency.camacho bridgeport fin,cir.once a consumer disputes the validity of an alleged debt or requests information about the original creditor in writing in response to a debt collector validation notice,the debt collector must cease collection of the debt until verification has been provided.b.but nothing in the statute prevents the debt collector from passing the debt on to a subsequent debt collector in lieu of responding to the verification demand.this is so because b gives a debt collector a choice upon receiving a request for validation the collector may provide the requested validations and continue its debt collection activities,or it may cease all collection activities.guerrero rjm acquisitions llc,cir.per curiam alteration omitted quoting jang miller,cir.if a debt collector determined that collecting on a debt was not worth the effort,the collector would be at liberty to sell the account.id.and if the collector did sell the debt,the debt collector that purchased it,on wzp reading,would be permitted to collect free from strictures,and the consumer would be effectively unable to obtain the information necessary to verify or dispute her debt.such a loophole would render almost a nullity,and we therefore decline to endorse wzp interpretation.see state dep t of soc.servs.dublino,we can not interpret federal statutes to negate their own stated purposes.
wzp argues that this loophole could be closed by other provisions of the fdcpa.that argument is not persuasive.although wzp cites a range of fdcpa provisions,it fails to explain how any of them would allow a consumer to verify and effectively dispute a debt.congress must have believed that those other provisions were not sufficient otherwise,it would not have separately enacted the validation notice and debt verification requirements.indeed,the implication of wzp argument is that is superfluous.we decline to interpret the act in a way that renders one of its central provisions inoperative.see trw,andrews,it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.quoting duncan walker.
wzp also predicts that the loophole would be closed by judicial interpretation.it contends that courts faced with the loophole would likely hold that any subsequent debt collector found to be in privity with a previous collector must itself halt collection efforts until verifying the debt.that argument is flawed in several respects.first,it presumes the existence of a privity relationship between the collectors.even if wzp is correct that a subsequent debt collector must respect any dispute received by a previous one with which it is in privity,this proposition provides no assistance when a privity relationship between the initial and subsequent collectors does not exist.furthermore,wzp points to no interpretation of any provision in the act that would require courts to hold that subsequent collectors must respect disputes received by prior ones.we know of no statutory interpretation principle that would allow us to interpret a statute in a manner that creates a nonsensical loophole just because courts might be able to apply a common law principle to close the loophole in a subset of cases.rather than resorting to speculative stopgaps,we adopt the interpretation that itself maintains the act intrinsic structural integrity 
interpreting the initial communication to refer to the first communication by any debt collector is also more in keeping with the fdcpa declared purpose of protecting consumers from abusive debt collection practices.congress enacted the fdcpa in against a backdrop of abundant evidence of the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors.a.as the act itself states,congress goal was to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.as a broad remedial statute,gonzales arrow fin,llc,cir,the fdcpa must be liberally construed in favor of the consumer in order to effectuate this goal of eliminating abuse.see clark,at accord johnson riddle,cir.because the fdcpa is a remedial statute,it should be construed liberally in favor of the consumer.
contrary to wzp arguments,the remedial purpose of the fdcpa is furthered by givin
