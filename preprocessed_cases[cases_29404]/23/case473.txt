murguia,circuit judge 
this case requires us to interpret two provisions of the federal debt collection procedures act fdcpa,which congress enacted to create a comprehensive statutory framework for the collection of debts owed to the united states government.united states gianelli,cir.quoting,at.
the united states small business administration sba guaranteed a loan between a private bank and appellant michael bensal bensal company,bensal coburn investments llc bci.after bci defaulted on the loan,the private bank sued bci as the borrower and bensal as a personal guarantor.the private bank recovered a default judgment and assigned that judgment to the sba.
several years later,bensal inherited a share in his deceased father trust.bensal did not accept his inheritance instead,he signed a disclaimer,which legally passed his trust share to his two children and prevented creditors from accessing his trust share under california law.after bensal executed his disclaimer,the sba filed a lawsuit seeking to satisfy its default judgment.the district court held that the sba is allowed to recover from bensal trust share under the fdcpa despite contrary california law,and the default judgment was a debt within the meaning of the fdcpa.we affirm.
background 
in,bci sought to establish transworld burgers,a restaurant with an theme and decor.to finance this operation,bci took out two loans from millennium bank millennium.in connection with the second loan,but not the first,bci sought a guaranty from the sba.
the sba is a federal government agency that assists small businesses by,among other things,guaranteeing commercial loans from private banks.by providing its guaranty that a commercial loan will be repaid,the sba eliminates some of the risk private lenders face and encourages private lenders to extend more loans to small businesses.a the sba is empowered to make loans to any qualified small business either directly or in cooperation with banks or other financial institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred guaranteed basis.see also united states kimbell foods,noting that t he sba prefers to guarantee private loans rather than to disburse funds directly.
a.the sba guaranty and bci default 
over the course of several months,the parties signed several documents as part of the sba guaranty of the second loan between bci and millennium.first,millennium submitted an application to the sba for an sba guaranty of of a proposed loan to bci.in a signed document sba authorization,the sba reduced the loan amount to,but otherwise approved the bank application,agreeing to guarantee up to of the loan.next,bci and millennium executed a standard loan contract business loan agreement,in which bci borrowed from millennium.bci signed a form sba note acknowledging its second loan with millennium,and bensal signed a form sba guaranty personally guaranteeing repayment of the second loan if bci defaulted.both the sba note and the sba guaranty appeared on sba letterhead,referenced the same sba information,and defined rights sba held against bensal and bci.
in january,bci defaulted on its payment obligations under both loans some time before the default,millennium had assigned both loans to first bank trust fbt.fbt filed suit in california state court and alleged,among other claims,that bci had breached the sba note and bensal had breached the sba guaranty.the state court entered default judgment against bci and bensal in the following sums in principal and interest owed on the first loan,in principal and interest owed on the second loan,in attorney fees,and in costs.
because neither bci nor bensal satisfied the default judgment,fbt requested that the sba honor its guaranty of the second loan.in,the sba negotiated a monetary adjustment with fbt and ultimately paid to satisfy its obligations as a guarantor on the second loan.in,fbt assigned to the sba its right to collect the entire amount owing on the default judgment over from bci and bensal.
bensal inheritance and disclaimer 
in july,bensal father died,leaving behind the edward bensal trust edb trust,which consisted of cash and securities valued at.the trust document awarded bensal of the edb trust.in october,bensal executed a disclaimer of interest in trust,which means he renounced refused to accept his share of the trust.the legal effect of the disclaimer under california law was that bensal trust share passed to his two children.cal.prob.code.
after bensal executed the disclaimer,the sba filed suit in federal district court against the edb trust,bensal,and bensal two children.the sba sought to void bensal disclaimer under the fdcpa.in its complaint,the sba claimed that bensal had fraudulently transferred his trust share to his children by executing the disclaimer,thereby preventing the sba from collecting the debt bensal owed on the default judgment.
bensal advanced two arguments in response.first,he asserted that his disclaimer was not a fraudulent transfer because the california probate code provides that a disclaimer is not a voidable transfer.cal.prob.code.second,he maintained that the default judgment assigned to the sba was not a debt within the meaning of the fdcpa.
the district court rejected both of bensal arguments,granted summary judgment in favor of the sba,and ordered the defendants to transfer all property representing bensal trust share to the sba in satisfaction of the portion of the default judgment relating to the second loan.at the time of the district court summary judgment order,the amount bensal owed on the portion of the default judgment relating to the second loan was over while the value of bensal trust share totaled.bensal timely appealed.
standard of review 
this case involves only statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.see millard united student aid funds,cir.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.entrepreneur media smith,cir.
discussion 
at the heart of this case lies the fdcpa fraudulent transfer provision,which allows the federal government to void a fraudulent transfer by a debtor owing a debt to the united states.specifically,the fdcpa provides that 
a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a debt to the united states which arises before the transfer is made or the obligation is incurred if 
a the debtor makes the transfer or incurs the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and 
b the debtor is insolvent at that time or the debtor becomes insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.
based on the statutory language,the sba must prove the existence of a debt predating the transfer,a transfer of assets,lack of equivalent value in exchange for the transfer,and the debtor insolvency at the time of transfer.neither party contests that the third and fourth requirements are satisfied.instead,the dispute centers on whether bensal disclaimer qualifies as a transfer of property,and whether the default judgment constitutes a debt.
whether bensal disclaimer is a transfer of property 
bensal contends that california law,which expressly states that a disclaimer is not a voidable transfer,controls over the fdcpa and prevents the sba from reaching the edb trust assets.cal.prob.code.we disagree and hold that the fdcpa displaces california disclaimer law.
preemption 
the supremacy clause of the constitution provides that any state law conflicting with federal law is preempted by the federal law and is without effect.nathan kimmel,dowelanco,cir.citing const.art.vi,cl.where a statute contains an express preemption clause,we focus on the plain wording of the clause,which necessarily contains the best evidence of congress preemptive intent.chamber of commerce of whiting,quoting csx,easterwood,internal quotation marks omitted.
the fdcpa contains an express preemption clause,which preempt s state law to the extent such law is inconsistent with a provision of the statute.d.echoing this preemption clause,federal regulations provide 
no person,corporation,or organization that applies for and receives any benefit or assistance from sba,or that offers any assurance or security upon which sba relies for the granting of such benefit or assistance,is entitled to claim or assert any local or state law to defeat the obligation incurred in obtaining or assuring such federal benefit or assistance.
d emphasis added.when bensal signed the sba guaranty,in which he personally guaranteed the second loan,he agreed to a provision that tracks the language of the regulation as to this guarantee,guarantor may not claim or assert any local or state law against sba to deny any obligation,defeat any claim of sba,or preempt federal law.
the state law at issue here is california probate code,which provides that a disclaimer is not a voidable transfer.this law directly conflicts with the fdcpa,which defines transfer in such a way as to include bensal disclaimer.the fdcpa defines transfer as every mode of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset emphasis added.asset means property of a debtor.id.emphasis added.the term property is defined as 
any present or future interest,whether legal or equitable,in real,personal including choses in action,or mixed property,tangible or intangible,vested or contingent,wherever located and however held including community property and property held in trust 
id.emphasis added.based on the plain language of the fdcpa,bensal disclaimer of the trust property qualifies as a transfer of property because bensal disposed of a present or future interest in his share of property held in trust by executing a disclaimer that channelled the trust share to his children.
under the fdcpa,bensal disclaimer is a transfer of property that can be voided,a,but under the california probate code a disclaimer is not a voidable transfer.cal.prob.code.it seems quite clear that california law is inconsistent with the fdcpa and must give way to the federal statute in light of the express preemption clause.
supreme court precedent 
even aside from the preemption clause,our conclusion that the fdcpa controls over california disclaimer law also finds support in the supreme court decision in drye united states.bensal argues that drye is inapplicable to the facts of this case and urges us instead to apply the holding of in re costas,cir.because both drye and costas addressed state disclaimer laws that are virtually identical to the california law at issue here,these two cases are best discussed in tandem.
in drye,the debtor,who owed a substantial tax debt to the federal government,inherited his mother estate.at.soon after being named sole heir,the debtor disclaimed his interest in the estate,which then passed by operation of arkansas state law to his daughter.id.upon learning of the debtor inheritance,the internal revenue service irs filed a notice of federal tax lien,but the debtor argued that arkansas inheritance law disallowed creditors from reaching disclaimed property.id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument and explained,
the question whether a right constitutes property or rights to property is a matter of federal law.we look initially to state law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in the property the government seeks to reach,then to federal law to determine whether the taxpayer rights qualify as property or rights to property within the compass of the federal legislation.
id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the court then looked to state law and noted that arkansas gave the debtor a choice he could either receive the entire value of his mother estate,or choose to channel that value to his daughter.id.at.based on this choice,the court concluded that the debtor held a control rein over his inheritance and,therefore,possessed property within the meaning of the federal tax lien statute.id.at.ultimately,the drye court concluded that state law did not bar the irs from recovering against the debtor trust share.id.
in costas,we addressed a nearly identical state disclaimer statute in the context of bankruptcy law and arrived at a different result.the debtor in costas received a share in her father trust upon his death in shortly thereafter,she executed a disclaimer under arizona law to relinquish her interest,which passed the trust share to her children.at.a few weeks later,the debtor filed for bankruptcy,and the chapter bankruptcy trustee sought to void the disclaimer under the bankruptcy code fraudulent transfer provision.id.at.the debtor argued that under arizona law,creditors were prohibited from reaching disclaimed property in response,the trustee invoked drye for the proposition that arizona disclaimer law does not control over federal law.id.at.we distinguished drye both factually and legally.id.at.
first,we noted a factual distinction based on the timing of the disclaimer in the two cases.the debtor in drye executed his disclaimer after the government already had a interest in his property therefore,a pplication of the state law would have stripped the government of its interest.id.at.in contrast,the debtor in costas executed her disclaimer before filing for bankruptcy,meaning that the bankruptcy estate did not have any prior interest in the disclaimed property and the state law did not operate to defeat any interests.id.we explained that drye is more analogous to disclaimers,where the debtor executes a disclaimer after filing for bankruptcy because in those situations courts have generally included disclaimed property in the estate,reasoning that the right to disclaim itself belongs to the estate as of the time of filing.id.in short,we concluded that when a debtor executes a disclaimer after a debt has already been accrued,then a state disclaimer law does not control.
next,we noted differences in the purpose and structure of the federal tax lien statute and the bankruptcy code.as to purpose,we explained that the federal tax lien statute is primarily concerned with collection of federal debts,which justifies the extraordinary priority accorded to the federal government and contrasts sharply with the policy of bankruptcy law,which largely respects substantive state law rights.id.at.we also highlighted a structural dissimilarity between the two statutes,explaining that the federal tax lien statute recognizes only a narrow range of property exemptions,none of which mention disclaimers,whereas the bankruptcy code property exemptions are quite broad,allowing a debtor to take advantage of all available state law exemptions.id.at citing.
ultimately,we refuse d to extend drye logic to the bankruptcy context in the costas decision.id.unlike costas,however,this case presents a situation that factually and legally fits within the drye framework.
first,the irs in drye and the sba here both had a preexisting interest in the disclaimed property because the debtor in
