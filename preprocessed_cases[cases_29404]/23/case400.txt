equifax check services,uses a series of form letters to assist it in collecting debts from dishonored checks,equifax mailed such a series of letters to michael durkin and,separately,to loretta reed.believing that certain letters were unacceptably confusing,durkin,and later reed,sued equifax under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et.the district court consolidated the two actions into one.after denying the plaintiffs summary judgment,the district court granted equifax motion to exclude the plaintiffs only expert witness.this evidentiary ruling led equifax to move for summary judgment,arguing that the plaintiffs failed to bring forth the necessary extrinsic evidence to support their case.the district court agreed and granted equifax summary judgment.the plaintiffs appealed.we affirm.
equifax,through its check authorization and warranty service,protects retailers from being stuck with bad checks.under the service,when a customer presents a retailer with a check,the retailer contacts equifax,and equifax determines whether it will stand behind the check and authorize it or whether it will deny acceptance of the check.equifax makes this determination by reviewing its database of check writing information.if equifax authorizes a check that is later dishonored,equifax purchases the check from the retailer at face value,making the retailer whole,and then pursues collection efforts on its own behalf.two retailers who have subscribed to this service are funco,also known as funcoland and sears,roebuck and company.
on march,equifax authorized a check in michael durkin name payable to funco.durkin checking account,however,was closed,and the check was dishonored.funco submitted the dishonored check to equifax,and equifax purchased the check at face value.equifax then began its collection efforts and sent durkin a collection letter on april.this initial letter contained a notice of certain rights afforded to durkin under the fdcpa.specifically,equifax informed accordance with a b and the corresponding language drafted by this court in bartlett heibl,cir that he had thirty days from his receipt of the letter to dispute the validity of the debt and that disputes should be in writing.this period is commonly called the validation period,and the aforementioned notice is routinely referred to as the validation notice.with no response from durkin,equifax sent a second letter on april,and likewise a third letter on may.equifax also made a telephone call to durkin during this period.the second and third collection letters did not discuss or reference the validation period,nor did they reiterate any of the rights and procedures spelled out in the initial letter validation notice.each of the three letters appears in the appendix to this opinion 
within a day or two of receiving the initial letter,durkin forwarded it to his attorney,an experienced fdcpa practitioner.durkin had retained the attorney to handle financial and legal matters arising from the theft of his checkbook in august.the check presented to funco in march was among the checks stolen.durkin signature on the funco check was thus a forgery,and the checking account had been closed at the time the forged check was written.durkin and his attorney were therefore aware of the problem with the checking account when the initial letter arrived in april.nevertheless,the attorney did not lodge a written dispute with equifax until may,after the second letter had arrived and the day that the third letter was sent.equifax,once informed about the forgery,ceased all collection activity and expunged durkin check writing history of any negative references regarding the funco check.three months later,durkin attorney filed a class action,with cocounsel,under the fdcpa against equifax in the northern district of illinois using durkin as the named plaintiff.the complaint alleged fdcpa violations on behalf of individuals who had received the same form letters.
separately,a different set of attorneys brought a virtually identical fdcpa class action in the northern district of illinois against equifax with loretta reed as their lead plaintiff.reed wrote a check to sears.equifax authorized the check.nonetheless,the check was dishonored purportedly because of a bank error.equifax bought the check from sears at face value and then sent reed a collection letter that was similar to the initial letter sent to durkin,including the same validation notice.later,equifax sent a second letter to reed,which contained the same form language used in the second letter to durkin.reed purportedly received the same third letter as well,but she has not produced that letter.reed never disputed the debt with equifax rather,she paid equifax plus a service charge.
the district court consolidated the durkin and reed actions.the district court also granted class certification.the class was composed of illinois residents from whom equifax tried to collect a debt for a dishonored check written to funco or sears during a certain period by using the same or similar form letters received by durkin and reed.the class numbered approximately individuals.
the plaintiffs amended consolidated class action complaint contained three counts,each alleging a different fdcpa violation.count one alleged that equifax followup form letters,the second and third letters,contradicted overshadowed the validation notice in the initial letter,causing confusion in violation of.count two claimed that a particular sentence in the second letter describing equifax procedures for handling debts was misleading in violation of.finally,count three alleged that equifax letters,which contained a number,violated by unfairly obscuring the requirement that certain debt disputes be made in writing.
in arguing for summary judgment,the plaintiffs contended that alleged fdcpa violations were apparent on the face of the collection letters.the district court disagreed but ruled that the case should go to trial since the plaintiffs procured a linguistics expert,english professor allan metcalf,to support their claims of confusion.however,equifax later filed a motion to bar metcalf from testifying at trial,which the district court granted.consequently,the plaintiffs were left with no evidence of confusion beyond the collection letters themselves and their durkin,reed,and one class member own assertions that the letters were confusing.this development led equifax to move for summary judgment arguing that the plaintiffs evidence was insufficient to go to trial.the district court granted the motion,ruling that the plaintiffs could not proceed to trial relying solely on the letters and their own testimony.the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration,but the district court declined to alter its summary judgment ruling.the plaintiffs appealed.
the plaintiffs first maintain that the district court erred in denying them summary judgment.they then alternatively argue for the case to go to trial,attacking the subsequent grant of summary judgment for equifax.we review a district court summary judgment decisions de novo,construing all facts in favor of the party.see turner,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in short,summary judgment is appropriate if,on the record as a whole,a rational trier of fact could not find for the party.turner,at.
to determine if the collection letters at issue violate the fdcpa as alleged by the plaintiffs,we examine the letters from the standpoint of the unsophisticated consumer or debtor.see fields wilber law firm,cir reviewing,and claims under unsophisticated standard.while the unsophisticated debtor is considered uninformed,naive,or trusting,he is nonetheless deemed to possess rudimentary knowledge about the financial world and is capable of making basic logical deductions and inferences.id.internal quotations omitted.further,the standard is an objective one and is not the same as the rejected standard accordingly,we disregard unrealistic,peculiar,bizarre,and idiosyncratic interpretations of collection letters.see pettit retrieval masters creditors bureau,cir gammon gc,cir.to that end,a mere claim of confusion is not enough a plaintiff must show that the challenged language of the letters unacceptably increases the level of confusion.johnson revenue mgmt,cir emphasis omitted.under this standard,a plaintiff anecdotal proclamations of being confused will not suffice a collection letter can not be confusing as a matter of law or fact unless a significant fraction of the population would be similarly misled.pettit,at see also taylor cavalry,cir.
in some situations,when an fdcpa violation is so clearly evident on the face of a collection letter,a court may award summary judgment to the fdcpa plaintiff.avila rubin,cir see also bartlett,at chauncey jdr recovery,cir.on the other hand,mere speculation that a collection letter confuses the unsophisticated debtor is not enough for an fdcpa plaintiff to survive an opposing debt collector summary judgment motion.see pettit,at see also jenkins heintz,cir.thus,when the letter itself does not plainly reveal that it would be confusing to a significant fraction of the population,the plaintiff must come forward with evidence beyond the letter and beyond his own assertions that the letter is confusing in order to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial.see taylor,at chuway action fin,cir pettit,at see also walker recovery,cir johnson,at.we have repeatedly indicated that this need for additional evidence frequently referred to as extrinsic evidence might be met through the use of a carefully designed and conducted consumer survey.see taylor,at chuway,at pettit,at walker,at,johnson,at.also,we have suggested that an appropriate expert witness might suffice.see pettit,at.
in this analysis section,we first will address the plaintiffs arguments in favor of their motion for summary judgment.we then will turn to the plaintiffs arguments against the grant of summary judgment for equifax.
whether the plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment.
in arguing in favor of summary judgment,the plaintiffs contend that the collection letters in question violate the fdcpa as matter of law in that the alleged fdcpa violations are apparent on the face of the letters.with the principles articulated above in mind,we turn to the three alleged fdcpa violations.
the fdcpa requires debt collectors to provide debtors with a written validation notice,informing debtors of their rights under,including the right to dispute the validity of the debt within thirty days of receiving the notice see bartlett,at.after this validation period expires,the debt collector may assume that the debt is valid.see id.at a.this validation period,however,is not a grace period a debt collector is perfectly free to demand payment and pursue collection efforts,including an appropriate lawsuit against the debtor,within the validation period bartlett,at see also johnson,at.thus,during the validation period,the debtor right to dispute coexists with the debt collector right to collect.
this coexistence has created a breeding ground for claims of confusion because,on one hand,the debt collector is telling the debtor that the debtor has the right to dispute,and,on the other hand,the debt collector is telling the debtor to pay.to reduce litigation over such confusion claims,this court,in bartlett,offered debt collectors language for explaining the coexistence of the right to dispute and the right to collect during the validation period.at see also miller mccalla,raymer,padrick,cobb,nichols,clark,cir.
here,equifax took advantage of our bartlett language by including it in the initial collection letter importantly,equifax warned the plaintiffs,consistent with the bartlett language the law does not require us to wait until the end of the period before taking action to collect this debt.appendix.equifax thus placed the plaintiffs on notice that something such as the ensuing letters could be on the way before the validation period expired.unsatisfied,the plaintiffs complain that equifax letters are confusing to unsophisticated debtors because these letters contradict overshadow the validation notice in the initial letter.see chauncey,at.according to the plaintiffs,the letters confuse because equifax sent these letters within the validation period and the letters contained threatening demands for immediate payment without any reminder about or reiteration of the validation notice.this argument in favor of summary judgment comes up short for three reasons.
first,the simple act of demanding payment in a collection letter during the validation period does not automatically create an unacceptable level of confusion so as to entitle the plaintiffs to summary judgment.to be clear,the validation period is not a grace period.see bartlett,at.nonetheless,the plaintiffs view is that virtually all demands for payment during the validation period confuse the unsophisticated debtor as a matter of law.presumably,the plaintiffs would like no collection letters sent during the validation period.that view is unsupported by the fdcpa and runs contrary to our case law.if,as this court held in bartlett,a debt collector can bring a lawsuit during the validation period in an effort to collect a debt,see,then certainly a debt collector can send collection letters as well as place telephone calls demanding payment during the validation period.demanding payment for an uncontested,overdue debt is an entirely valid tool available to debt collectors,see johnson,at b ona fide debts that are overdue are,well,overdue,and payable pronto,and the fact that equifax demanded payment during the validation period does not,in and of itself,justify an award of summary judgment to the plaintiffs.
second,pursuant to a,a debt collector must include a validation notice in its initial communication to the debtor or must send a validation notice within five days of its initial communication unless the debtor has paid the debt by that juncture.see a.equifax complied with the language in its initial letter.once that requirement is satisfied,a does not mandate that further validation notices be sent.nonetheless,the plaintiffs point out that a debt collector may not overshadow or contradict the validation notice with other messages sent within the validation period.chauncey,at.to avoid such overshadowing or contradiction,the plaintiffs argue that equifax should have reiterated or referred to the validation notice in its collection letters.however,there is no need for such a blanket rule.while some letters may certainly go over the line,see,id.at,in general,not every letter demanding payment during the validation period overshadows or contradicts a validation notice thus,not every letter sent during the validation period must automatically reiterate the validation notice,refer back to that notice,or remind debtors about the validation period and the time remaining in that period.therefore,the mere absence of any such reiterations and reminders in the collection letters does not alone generate an unacceptable level of confusion so as to warrant summary judgment for the plaintiffs.rather,the matter turns on whether the specific text contains any impermissible overshadowing or contradiction with respect to the validation notice.see id.
third,the specific text in the letters at issue,contrary to the plaintiffs assertions,does not clearly overshadow or contradict the validation notice from the initial letter so as to entitle the plaintiffs to summary judgment.avila,at see also chauncey,at.for instance,these letters do not indicate that the time for disputing the debt has passed.nor do they misrepresent or cloud the amount of time remaining to dispute the debt.the letters encourage debtors to pay their debts by informing them of the possible negative consequences of failing to pay the letters simply do not contain any overt misinformation,apparent contradiction,or noticeable lack of clarity concerning the validation period or the debtor rights under.the letters,in short,do not intrinsically prove the alleged fdcpa violation.accordingly,summary judgment is unavailable to the plaintiffs on this claim.whether this claim should proceed to trial,however,is a separate matter as discussed below.
the plaintiffs next attack a particular sentence in equifax second collection letter under.under this fdcpa provision,a debt collector is subject to civil liability if it use s any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.the challenged sentence reads as follows should you fail to pay for this dishonored check or contact this office to make arrangements,steps will be taken to determine if your check will be assigned to an investigator or to a collection agency.appendix emphasis added.the plaintiffs assert that,as a matter of law,this sentence is misleading and confusing to the unsophisticated consumer in three respects.however,in construing all inferences in favor of equifax,as we must in this situation,see kort diversified collection,cir,we reject the plaintiffs arguments for summary judgment.
the plaintiffs first maintain that the investigator in question is not a private investigator but rather an investigator.however,although the investigator is internal,the letter does not,contrary to the plaintiffs contention,plainly suggest otherwise.it does not indicate that equifax may refer the matter to an investigator outside of equifax it only indicates that equifax may refer the matter to an investigator,which is entirely true.next,the plaintiffs complain that,since equifax is itself a collection agency,the statement that the matter might be referred to a collection agency deceptively implies that the alleged debt has not yet been referred to a collection agency.nevertheless,the letter does not plainly suggest that equifax is not a collection agency.also,this statement is not misleading because,as equifax indicates,since it purchases dishonored checks from vendors and collects the debts on behalf of itself,it may assign such debts to another collection agency if its own collection efforts prove unsuccessful.finally,the plaintiffs contest the portion of the sentence stating steps will be taken to determine the plaintiffs argue that no steps are taken to determine anything it is all done automatically by computer.however,this statement is simply not deceptive whether debt information,the amount of the debt and the amount of time the debt has gone unpaid is sorted and evaluated by a computer or by a person or by some combination of the two,the assessment still comprises steps being taken.therefore,contrary to the plaintiffs contentions,the alleged violations are not so clear as to permit a grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs.see avila,at.
lastly,the plaintiffs accuse equifax of violating.pursuant to this fdcpa section,a debt collector is subject to civil liability,if it use s unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.the plaintiffs claim that equifax unfairly obscured the requirement for debt disputes brought under because the letters,which included a number,urge debtors to telephone equifax.it is undisputed that,by using our bartlett language,the initial letter,which also contained a number,properly informed debtors of requirement.see at.nonetheless,the plaintiffs maintain that the second letter is unfair and confusing because,in addition to the presence of a number,the letter suggests that the debtor contact this office.appendix.similarly,they contend that the third letter is unfair and confusing because,along with the number,the letter states you may reach our offices at the number below if you wish to discuss this matter further.appendix.to avoid this alleged unfairness and confusion,the plaintiffs argue that equifax should have reiterated the portion of the notice explaining the requirement in the collection letters.
however,neither letter plainly indicates that disputes do not have to be in writing contacting the office to discuss the matter does not necessarily equate to telephoning the office to raise a dispute.further,in the second letter,the verb contact does not exclusively mean call or telephone in this context.one could understand the word contact in this situation to mean communicating with equifax in writing.this understanding is bolstered by the fact that equifax included its mailing address in the second letter as well as in the third letter.while the plaintiffs focus on the number,they neglect to pay the same level of attention to the inclusion of equifax mailing address.in short,the challenged portions of the letters do not obviously nullify or undermine the initial letter explanation of the requirement.therefore,in construing all inferences in favor of equifax,the alleged unfairness and confusion about the requirement in the letters is not so clear as to justify the grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs.see avila,at.whether these claims should proceed to trial is,in this case,a separate matter as discussed below.
whether equifax is entitled to summary judgment.
as stated above,mere speculation that a collection letter confuses the unsophisticated debtor is not enough for an fdcpa plaintiff to survive an opposing debt collector summary judgment motion.see pettit,at see also jenkins,at.therefore,when the text of the letter does not plainly reveal that it would be confusing to a significant fraction of the population,the plaintiff must come forward with extrinsic evidence,such as a consumer survey,to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial.see taylor,at chuway,at pettit,at see also walker,at johnson,at.
in order to satisfy the need for extrinsic evidence in this case,the plaintiffs elected not to conduct a survey but instead secured a linguist to support their confusion claims against equifax.nevertheless,the district court barred their expert from testifying at trial,finding the expert testimony irrelevant and unreliable under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.the plaintiffs,as a result,were left with no evidence of confusion beyond the letters themselves and their durkin,reed,and one class member own affidavits claiming that they found the letters to be confusing.the district court ruled that this evidence was insufficient to create a triable issue and thus granted equifax summary judgment.
the plaintiffs attack this result on three levels.first,they argue that the district court erred in excluding their expert.second,they contend that,even without their expert,they presented sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.third,they challenge the need for extrinsic evidence in certain fdcpa situations,arguing that the extrinsic evidence requirement conflicts with the standard.we will address each argument in that order.
turning to the district court decision to bar the plaintiffs expert,english professor and linguist allan metcalf,our review has two steps.we first review,de novo,whether the district court properly followed the framework set forth in daubert.ammons aramark unif,cir internal quotation omitted.the first step is satisfied here because,in accordance with the daubert framework the district court measured both the reliability and the relevance of metcalf proffered opinion testimony.see ammons,at this framework requires the district court to determine whether the proposed witness would testify to valid scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge and his testimony will assist the trier of fact.internal quotation omitted see also.
having determined that the district court properly applied daubert,we next review the district court decision to bar an expert for an abuse of discretion.see ammons,at.here,the district court excluded metcalf testimony on two grounds irrelevant and unreliable.in arriving at this decision,the district court scrutinized metcalf affidavit describing his proposed testimony.in the affidavit,metcalf concluded that,after reviewing the case law defining the unsophisticated debtor,equifax three collection letters including the bartlett validation notice in the initial letter were difficult to read and were thus confusing to the unsophisticated debtor.
metcalf based his conclusion in part upon certain readability tests.his test resu
