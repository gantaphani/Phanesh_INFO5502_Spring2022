for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
keith weiner and scott paris are attorneys who practice on behalf of keith weiner associates,a law firm.on july,defendants filed a lawsuit against in berea municipal court,cuyahoga county,ohio,seeking to recover,plus interest at the rate of per annum and costs.attached to the complaint berea complaint was a revolving credit agreement upon which the claim was based.pursuant to the credit agreement,college extended credit to,a student at the college,for the payment of fees imposed by the college.significantly,the credit agreement contained the following attorney fees provision

as noted above,congress enacted the fdcpa to eliminate abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices.a.when interpreting the fdcpa,we begin with the language of the statute itself.schroyer frankel,cir.as this court has noted,the fdcpa is extraordinarily broad,crafted in response to what congress perceived to be a widespread problem.frey gangwish,cir.courts use the least sophisticated consumer standard,an objective test,when assessing whether particular conduct violates the fdcpa.harvey great seneca fin,cir.this standard ensures that the fdcpa protects all consumers,the gullible as well as the shrewd.kistner law offices of michael margelefsky,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.nonetheless,the standard also prevents liability for bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations of collection notices by preserving a quotient of reasonableness and presuming a basic level of understanding and willingness to read with care.id.at quotation marks and citations omitted
