the letter was not signed by any individual attorney.the firm name,however,was printed as a signature block.
on july,plaintiff filed suit against defendants both as a law firm and as individuals,alleging that the communication violated the fdcpa.specifically,greco alleged that the letter violated two separate fdcpa provisions first,he asserted that the letter misleadingly represented the level of attorney involvement,thereby violating,in violation of general ban on deceptive practices in connection with debt collection,ban on falsely representing that an individual is an attorney,and ban on deceptive means to collect a debt.second,greco claimed that the letter disclosure it stated that the debtor failure to dispute the debt would result in both the debt collector and the creditor as opposed to the debt collector alone assuming the debt to be debtors as to their rights,in violation of.greco requested statutory damages for each purported violation of fdcpa.he also sought to certify a class of persons receiving similar debt collection letters.
the district court determined,as a matter of law,that the letter was not misleading in its representation of attorney involvement,or in its explication of the debtor rights,and hence that it could not support greco claims for relief under fdcpa.first,the district court determined that the letter did not misstate the level of attorney participation,because the letter prominently stated in normal typeface that a t this time,no attorney with this firm has personally reviewed the particular circumstances of your account,and merely advised the creditor that if you fail to contact this office,our client may consider additional remedies to recover the balance due.thus,the district court reasoned,even the least sophisticated of debtors would understand that,while this was a letter from a law firm,no attorney had specifically examined the recipient account information,and hence no attorney had yet recommended filing a lawsuit against the creditor.second,with respect to the disclosure statement,the court noted that the letter language almost identically tracked the words of the fdcpa itself.the only change was the statement that the creditor,in addition to the debt collector,would assume that the debt was valid if the debt collector was not notified of a dispute within days.the court concluded that this statement would not mislead recipients,because the letter language does not create confusion about the debtor right to contest the debt within thirty days.having reached these conclusions on the basis of the complaint and the attached debt collection letter,the court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review a dismissal under.c using the same de novo standard applicable to dismissals pursuant to.b.see,comm.of baruch black and hispanic alumni ass bernard baruch college,cir.thus,accepting the allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff,a complaint should not be dismissed under rule c unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
congress enacted fdcpa in order to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.to achieve this goal,and to protect the most vulnerable population of debtors from abusive and misleading practices,we have construed fdcpa to require that debt collection letters be viewed from the perspective of the least sophisticated consumer.clomon jackson,cir.we have observed,however,that in crafting a norm that protects the naive and the credulous the courts have carefully preserved the concept of reasonableness,and that some courts have held that even the least sophisticated consumer can be presumed to possess a rudimentary amount of information about the world and a willingness to read a collection notice with some care.id.internal quotation marks omitted citing johnson ncb collection services,and gaetano payco of wisconsin.in this way,our circuit least sophisticated consumer standard is an objective analysis that seeks to protect the naive from abusive practices,id.at,while simultaneously shielding debt collectors from liability for bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations of debt collection letters,id.
false representation of attorney involvement 
greco primary argument is that the defendants violated fdcpa by sending a debt collection letter,signed by the law firm and on law firm stationary,thereby implying that the firm had analyzed the debtor case and had rendered legal advice to the creditor concerning that case.specifically,greco asserts that an attorney can not send a collection letter without being meaningfully involved as an attorney within the collection process.in support of that assertion,greco cites our decision in clomon jackson,cir,where we stated 
t he use of an attorney signature on a collection letter implies that the letter is from the attorney who signed it it implies,in other words,that the attorney directly controlled or supervised the process through which the letter was sent t he use of an attorney signature least in the absence of language to the the attorney signing the letter formed an opinion about how to manage the case of the debtor to whom the letter was sent.in a mass mailing,these implications are frequently false the attorney w
