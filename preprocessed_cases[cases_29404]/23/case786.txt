plaintiff,rosewood care center,of peoria rosewood,filed an action against defendant caterpillar,seeking reimbursement for skilled nursing care services provided to caterpillar employee,betty jo cook,while she was a patient at rosewood.rosewood alleged in its complaint that caterpillar had promised to pay for the care and treatment rosewood provided to cook.in response,caterpillar moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that the alleged promise to pay for cook care was not enforceable because it was not in writing as required by the frauds act statute of frauds ilcs west.the circuit court granted caterpillar motion and rosewood appealed.
the appellate court reversed and remanded.d.relying on williams corbet,and hartley varner,the appellate court held that a promise to pay the debt of another is subject to the statute of frauds only if the debt exists at the time the promise is made.applying a preexisting debt rule,the appellate court concluded that,because caterpillar alleged promise to pay for cook care was made before the debt came into existence,it was not subject to the statute of frauds and the circuit court erred in dismissing rosewood complaint.
we subsequently granted caterpillar petition for leave to appeal and now affirm the judgment of the appellate court,although we do so on different grounds.
background 
the following facts are taken from rosewood complaint and attached exhibits.on october,cook suffered injuries at work and was hospitalized from that date until january.sometime thereafter,cook filed a workers compensation claim against caterpillar.
on january,caterpillar contacted hsm management services hsm,the management agent for rosewood,a skilled nursing facility.caterpillar requested that rosewood admit cook on a managed care basis fixed rate.hsm advised caterpillar that rosewood would not admit cook on those terms.
shortly thereafter,on january,norma just,caterpillar employee in charge of medical care relating to workers compensation claims,contacted hsm.just told hsm that cook had sustained a injury and was receiving medical care at caterpillar expense under the workers compensation laws.just requested that cook be admitted to rosewood for skilled nursing care and therapy,and stated that the cost of cook care would be covered and paid directly by caterpillar to rosewood with a zero deductible and no maximum limit.just further advised hsm that cook had been precertified for four weeks of care.just asked that rosewood send the bills for cook care to caterpillar workers compensation division.
that same day,hsm faxed a letter to just confirming their conversation.in this letter,hsm requested just to acknowledge that she had agreed to a snf admission for cook,four weeks of treatment,and the need for further evaluation in connection with the length of care cook would require.just signed the fax,acknowledging her agreement,and returned it the next day 
on january,sue from just office telephoned hsm and confirmed approval for cook transfer from the hospital to rosewood.on january,sue reconfirmed,via telephone,caterpillar authorization for cook care and treatment in accordance with the january agreement,except that sue now advised hsm that cook was precertified for two weeks of care instead of the original four weeks.
on january,cook was admitted to rosewood.upon her admission,cook signed a document entitled assignment of insurance benefits as required by law.in this document,cook assigned any insurance benefits she might receive to rosewood and acknowledged her liability for any unpaid services.
caterpillar,through its management company,continued to orally authorize care for cook and did so on february,february,march,march,april,april,may,and june.cook remained at rosewood until june.the total of rosewood charges for cook care amounted to.
rosewood billed caterpillar on a monthly basis on february,march,april,may,june,and july.caterpillar never objected to the bills being sent to it for cook care,nor did it ever advise rosewood that treatment was not authorized.however,caterpillar ultimately refused to pay for services rendered to cook.
rosewood filed an amended complaint against both caterpillar and cook.relevant here,count iii of rosewood complaint stated a claim for breach of contract against caterpillar,count iv a claim for promissory estoppel,and count v a claim for quantum meruit.in connection with the promissory estoppel claim,rosewood averred that,prior to cook admission,caterpillar had,in the past,requested,authorized,and approved care and treatment at rosewood for other injured employees and had paid for the services.rosewood averred that it only admitted cook based on caterpillar promise.rosewood further averred that it would not have admitted cook without caterpillar promise to pay.
caterpillar moved to dismiss the breach of contract count count iii and the promissory estoppel count count iv,pursuant to section a of the code of civil procedure ilcs a west.caterpillar argued that these claims were barred because its alleged agreement to take responsibility for the cost of cook care was not in writing,as required by the statute of frauds.caterpillar also filed a motion to strike count v,the quantum meruit claim.
on april,the trial court granted caterpillar motion to dismiss the breach of contract and promissory estoppel counts,finding that the statute of frauds applied and,thus,barred rosewood claims.thereafter,the trial court granted caterpillar motion to strike the quantum meruit count.in a subsequent order,the trial court held,pursuant to supreme court rule a,that there was no just reason to delay appeal of its order dismissing the breach of contract and promissory estoppel counts,as well as its order striking the quantum meruit count.
on appeal,the appellate court reversed and remanded.d.relying on williams corbet,and hartley varner,the appellate court concluded that the statute of frauds is only applicable when the promise to pay the debt of another is made after the obligation of the principal has been incurred.in other words,the debt must preexist the promise.here,it was alleged that caterpillar made its promise to pay rosewood prior to the time cook was admitted and,thus,cook had no preexisting debt.the appellate court acknowledged that several appellate decisions seemed to be at odds with williams and hartley,and that the rule had been abandoned by other jurisdictions and legal authorities.nevertheless,the appellate court concluded that principles of stare decisis required it to follow williams and hartley and found the trial court erred in dismissing rosewood complaint on this basis 
justice lytton specially concurred to discuss the general and widely recognized trend to abandon the preexisting debt requirement.d at,lytton,specially concurring.justice lytton noted that illinois statute of frauds does not contain a requirement,and concluded that the timing of the promise should not limit the statute application.however,justice lytton agreed that the court was bound by stare decisis to apply the rule.we thereafter granted caterpillar petition for leave to appeal a.
preexisting debt rule 
the first issue,raised by caterpillar,is whether the appellate court erred in holding that the preexisting debt rule takes this case out of the statute of frauds.caterpillar contends that the appellate court erred in applying the preexisting debt rule because the rule is not supported by the statutory language nor is it commensurate with the purposes underlying the statute of frauds.we agree.
the statute of frauds provides in relevant part 
no action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt,default or miscarriage of another person unless the promise or agreement upon which such action shall be brought,or some memorandum or note thereof,shall be in writing,and signed by the party to be charged therewith,or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.ilcs west.
this section of the statute is known as the surety provision d statute of frauds,at,and has remained unchanged in all material respects since its enactment in illinois in.
when interpreting this statute,we recall that the fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.people pack.the language of the statute is the best indication of legislative intent,and we give that language its plain and ordinary meaning.pack,at.we may not depart from the plain language of the statute by reading into it exceptions,limitations,or conditions that conflict with the express legislative intent.town country utilities,illinois pollution control board.a court should not attempt to read a statute other than in the manner in which it was written.ultsch illinois municipal retirement fund.
in general,the statute of frauds provides that a promise to pay the debt of another,a suretyship agreement,is unenforceable unless it is in writing.however,there is nothing in the plain language of the statute of frauds to indicate that for a writing requirement to apply,the debt must exist prior to the time the promise to pay is made.the term debt is not limited or qualified in any way.under the principles of construction set forth above,we do not find that the statute application depends on whether the debt exists before the promise is made.to do so would read conditions into the statute that are not there.the plain language of the statute does the not require that a debt exist before a promise is made for the promise to fall within the statute.
nor does the purpose underlying the statute of frauds require or support a preexisting debt rule.the statute of frauds was adopted to give greater security to property to guard against false contracts,set on foot by fraud and supported by perjury.hite wells.in eddy roberts,we further stated 
the plain object of the statute is to require higher and more certain evidence to charge a party,where he does not receive the substantial benefit of the transaction,and where another is primarily liable to pay the debt or discharge the duty and thereby to afford greater security against the setting up of fraudulent demands,where the party sought to be charged is another than the real debtor,and whose debt or duty,on performance of the alleged contract by such third person,would be discharged.eddy,at.
more certain evidence is required when one promises to pay the debt of another because t here is a temptation for a promisee,in a case where the real debtor has proved insolvent or unable to pay,to enlarge the scope of the promise,or to torture mere words of encouragement and confidence into an absolute promise.davis patrick.
the concerns underlying the statute of frauds apply no matter when the debt was before the promise was made or after.a false contract set on foot by fraud can arise at any time.indeed,as justice lytton noted below,if anything,the promisor should be entitled to greater protection where the debt is incurred after the promise is made.promisors of a preexisting debt are aware of the amount of debt and can prepare for the likelihood of liability.promisors who agree to pay a debt that has yet to arise may be exposed to limitless liability.d at,lytton,specially concurring.
moreover,numerous authorities have recognized that there is no rule.in rabaud,pet,the united states supreme court stated 
whether by the true intent of the statute,it was to extend to cases where the collateral promise,so called,was a part of the original agreement,and founded on the same consideration moving at the same time between the parties or,whether it was confined to cases,where there was already a subsisting debt and demand,and the promise was merely founded upon a subsequent and distinct undertaking might,if the point were entirely new,deserve very grave attention.but it has been closed within very narrow limits by the course of the authorities,and seems scarcely open for general examination at least in those states where the english authorities have been fully recognised and adopted in practice,pet.at.at.
see also brown,corbin on contracts,at ed noting there is no rule lord,williston on contracts,at ed it is settled that a special promise within the statute may be made prior to or simultaneously with the creation of the principal obligation,and may be offered as an inducement to the creditor to enter into a contract with the principal debtor.
despite the foregoing,the appellate court nonetheless concluded that a debt must exist before a promise is made for the promise to fall within the statute of frauds.the appellate court,relying on williams and hartley,concluded that these two cases together stand directly for the proposition that the statute of frauds is applicable,in matters of surety,only where the promise to pay the debt of another was made after the obligation of the principal debtor had been incurred.d at.thus,according to the appellate court,williams and hartley hold that,if the debt does not exist at the time of the promise,the promise does not fall within the statute of frauds.a careful reading of the cases,however,shows they do not establish such a rule.
in williams,corbet delivered cattle to caldwell.corbet sought to recover the cost of the cattle from williams,who allegedly had promised to pay for them.a judgment was entered in favor of corbet following a jury trial.on appeal,this court affirmed.the court noted that caldwell parted with the cattle only upon williams promise and undertaking,and that the consideration passed from williams to corbet.further,the court noted that williams was the person to whom the credit was given.from this,the court concluded that williams promise was not a suretyship,and therefore not within the statute of frauds.williams,at.
after concluding that the promise did not fall within the statute of frauds,this court noted 
it is not at all like a case where the contract is executed,and the promise to pay made after the debt was created such a promise in such a case must,to be binding,be in writing.that would be a promise to answer for the debt,default or miscarriage of another,and within the statute.so if the credit be not,at the time of the contract,given to the promisor.emphasis added.williams,at.
the court went on to note that there had been conflicting testimony regarding the nature of williams promise,but that it was within the jury province to resolve the conflict and the jury had done so,finding that williams promise did not create a suretyship.accordingly,the trial court judgment was affirmed.
clearly,williams does not hold that,in every instance where a debt does not exist at the time of the promise,the promise will,as a matter of law,fall outside the statute of frauds.had williams believed the timing of the promise to be the sole determining factor,there would have been no reason for the court to consider anything other than the timing of the promise in determining whether it fell within the statute.the court,however,did not limit its analysis in this way.
similarly,if williams had relied on the rule,there would have been no logical reason for the court to defer to the jury determination as to whether a suretyship had been created.credibility determinations would have been irrelevant if the timing of the promise was the dispositive factor.given the analysis undertaken in williams,it is clear that the court did not rely solely on the timing of the promise in determining whether it fell within the statute of frauds.
the second case relied on by the appellate court below,hartley,also does not employ a rule to determine the applicability of the statute of frauds.in that case,reubottom,who was varner employee,owed or to hartley for goods he had received on credit.later,varner went to hartley store,at which time hartley advised varner that the store would not give reubottom any more goods on credit.varner then told hartley that,if the store would give reubottom goods,varner would see that hartley was paid.hartley subsequently provided reubottom with additional goods totaling.hartley sought to recover the costs of the goods from varner.after a jury trial,the circuit court entered judgment in favor of varner.on appeal,varner urged this court to affirm the trial court judgment,arguing that his promise fell within the statute of frauds.citing only to williams
