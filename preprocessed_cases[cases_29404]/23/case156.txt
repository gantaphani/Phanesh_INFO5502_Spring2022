nathan james udell appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,reversing the order of the united states bankruptcy court,eastern district of pennsylvania,and holding that udell educational debt was not dischargeable.udell united states.because the district court correctly determined that the bankruptcy code,a,applies to udell debt and prohibits the discharge of his debt,we will affirm.
background 
the underlying facts are not in dispute.udell entered the united states air force academy as a cadet by congressional appointment on july.he completed three academic years at the air force academy from july,to august.upon enrollment at the air force academy,udell signed a record of acceptance,obligation,reimbursement,and oath of allegiance,agreeing to complete the educational requirements and to serve on active duty for a period of eight years.he further agreed that if he failed to complete the educational requirements or to serve on active duty for the requisite period of time,he would be required to reimburse the government for the cost of his education.
while enrolled at the air force academy,udell possessed an official government issued credit card.when questioned by investigators about a delinquent balance on that card,udell initially claimed that the card was stolen,but later admitted that he had not been truthful about the card being stolen.he also admitted that he had given the card to his girlfriend to use for whatever she needed,and that she had made various purchases with that card.on april,the military review committee convened and recommended udell for disenrollment due to his misconduct.udell was permitted to submit a letter of resignation in lieu of disenrollment.on july,udell letter of resignation was accepted and udell was also discharged under honorable conditions from the air force.
as a result of his early discharge from the air force,udell was required to reimburse the government for the cost of his education in the amount of.including interest and administrative charges,the amount has increased to a total of.udell does not dispute that he owes this amount.in june,udell filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code,stating that he owed to the united states department of defense.in october,udell instituted an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court,seeking a determination that the debt for his air force academy education was dischargeable.
the bankruptcy court determined that udell debt was dischargeable.in re udell.the court recognized that both the armed forces code,d,and the bankruptcy code,a,deal with the dischargeability of educational obligations or loans.id.at.the court,however,determined that d is a more specific statute targeted only to educational obligations arising in connection with service in the armed forces and that,as a specific statute,d controls whether udell debt to the government is dischargeable.id.the court found legal support for its conclusion in case law holding that a more specific statute governs the dischargeability of specific types of educational loans,in those cases health education assistance loans heal.id.the court also found factual support for its decision in the record of acceptance,obligation,reimbursement,and oath of allegiance,which specifically references and summarizes d.id.without expressly considering the language of d,the court concluded that udell obligation to the government was dischargeable under d.id.at.
the district court reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court,concluding that udell debt was not dischargeable.udell,at.the court noted that udell type of debt was encompassed within both the armed forces code,d,and the bankruptcy code,a.upon considering the plain language of d and a,the court determined that d prohibits the discharge of a debt within a period of five years after a debtor has ended service in the armed forces,but is silent with respect to what happens thereafter.the court concluded that a,in contrast,prohibits the discharge of a debt at all times absent a showing of undue hardship.id.at.according to the court,t he two statutes can easily be reconciled so as to give effect to both because d absolutely prohibits the discharge of the debt in question during the first five years,and a prohibits a discharge thereafter unless an undue hardship exists.id.because five years had passed since udell had been discharged and udell had not argued undue hardship,the court determined that his debt was not dischargeable.id.the court noted that its interpretation of the statutes was neither an unfair nor unreasonable harmonization of the two statutes,and that it was not congress intent to treat the debt of one who leaves the military more leniently than the debt of others.id.
udell timely appealed from the district court decision,and we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under d and.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court bankruptcy decision using the same standard as that exercised by the district court.in re woskob,cir.accordingly,we review factual findings for clear error,and we exercise plenary review over legal determinations.id.
on appeal,we are asked to decide whether the armed forced code authorizes the discharge of an educational obligation arising in connection with service in the armed forces,after five years have elapsed since a debtor active service in the armed forces has ended,without a showing of undue hardship as required under the bankruptcy code.after careful review of the submitted briefs and the oral argument,we hold that the armed forces code does not authorize a discharge absent a showing of undue hardship.the two statutes at issue are d and a.the armed forces code,a and d,provide,in relevant part,that 
a the secretary concerned may require,as a condition to the secretary providing advanced education assistance to any person,that such person enter into a written agreement with the secretary concerned under the terms of which such person shall agree 
to complete the educational requirements specified in the agreement and to serve on active duty for a period specified in the agreement 
that if such person fails to complete the education requirements specified in the agreement,such person will serve on active duty for a period specified in the agreement 
that if such person,voluntarily or because of misconduct,fails to complete the period of active duty specified in the agreement,or fails to fulfill any term or condition prescribed pursuant to clause,such person will reimburse the united states in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total cost of advanced education provided such person as the unserved portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty such person agreed to serve 
to such other terms and conditions as the secretary concerned may prescribe to protect the interest of the united states.
d a discharge in bankruptcy under title shall not release a person from an obligation to reimburse the united states required under the terms of an agreement described in subsection a if the final decree of the discharge in bankruptcy was issued within a period of five years after the last day of a period which such person had agreed to serve on active duty.
emphases added.the bankruptcy code,a,provides,in relevant part,that 
a a discharge under section,a,b,or b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made,insured or guaranteed by a government unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution,or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit,scholarship or stipend,unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents 
on appeal,udell argues that his debt is dischargeable under d.to support his argument,udell points to the record of acceptance,obligation,reimbursement,and oath of allegiance,which he alleges references d when setting forth the conditions and obligations of udell enrollment in the air
