introduction 
the great recession hit southern california inland empire region roughly defined as riverside and san bernardino counties particularly hard.this is one of a number of cases which have,in the aftermath of that recession,finally made their way to this court.the appeal stems from financial difficulties encountered in the construction of a kohl department store in beaumont.the developer of the store was inland lcg beaumont,llc inland a utah firm and the general contractor a texas firm,group construction services.somewhere in the process of construction the money dried up and refused to pay its subcontractors for work they had done.those subcontractors included cass construction cass,tnt grading tnt,palomar grading paving palomar grading and contractors.
these four subcontractors recorded mechanic liens and sued to foreclose those liens.with one exception they obtained judgments of foreclosure.the one exception was tnt,who,by the time of the trial to foreclose its mechanic lien,was a suspended corporation and thus unable to prosecute an action.
the two current owners of the property,kohl and wells fargo,have appealed from the judgments obtained by the three successful subcontractors,cass,and palomar grading.kohl purchased the particular parcel on which its store sits just about a month after construction began,and wells fargo bank is the successor to the construction lender wachovia bank,itself a casualty of the great recession.wachovia became the owner of the other two parcels of the tract when it foreclosed on inland.
given that there are two separate appeals arising out of no less than three separate foreclosure actions,this consolidated appeal presents something of an organizational challenge.we have identified no less than discrete issues now before us,all involving the operation of california mechanic lien laws.we have decided to take these issues in the order of the natural progression of mechanic liens soup to nuts as it were from the initial filing of a preliminary notice to the final amount of interest to be applied to a foreclosure judgment.here is a brief summary of our conclusions.appellants go for 
a the fact cass did not name kohl on its preliminary notice was not fatal to the later foreclosure of its mechanic lien,because kohl was an owner or a reputed owner at the time cass recorded its preliminary notice.
b the fact cass did some work after it recorded its mechanic lien was similarly not fatal to the foreclosure of its lien,because the work it did was all pursuant to its subcontract with.
c cass failure to name either kohl or wells fargo on its mechanic lien was also not fatal,because cass had no actual knowledge either kohl or wells fargo was an owner of land in the tract at the time of the recording of cass mechanic lien.
d listing of an address that was not,strictly speaking,the address of kohl store,was not fatal to its lien on the tract which includes the store,because the address it gave was sufficient for identification of the whole tract.
e cass and filed their suits to foreclose their liens timely even though they later had to add kohl and wells fargo as doe defendants,because at the time of filing their suits neither had actual knowledge kohl or wells fargo was an owner in the tract.
f cass can collect an amount in its foreclosure action in excess of the amount it listed on its lien because the excess amount was pursuant to its contract and incurred prior to the recording of the lien.
g the trial court did not err in including within cass lien foreclosure amount a sum cass owed to tnt,even though by the time of trial tnt was a suspended corporation,because tnt,at the time of the judgment,did not qualify as a claimant under the statute which requires deduction of amounts owed to claimants in figuring lien judgments.
h given the unitary nature of the project,even though it involved three contiguous parcels,the trial court was within its discretion not to allocate cass and lien judgments between the one parcel owned by kohl and the two parcels owned by wells fargo.
i in light of our decision on the allocation question,lien amounts were susceptible of precise calculation,therefore both cass and palomar grading can collect prejudgment interest on their liens.waived its right to prejudgment interest and there is no issue on appeal as regard to that.
but it not a complete shutout.
j the amount of that prejudgment interest is properly figured at percent,the interest used is for obligations imposed by law,not percent,the interest rate for obligations voluntarily undertaken by contract,because neither kohl nor wells fargo entered into any contract with any lien claimant.rather,their obligation results because the law imposes it on them.
the project,as it came into being in the spring of,involved the construction of a kohl department store on parcel of a tract,the technical legal description of which is all subsumed within parcel map.when we refer to the tract or the property we mean the land encompassed by that particular parcel map number.
the tract is easily conceptualized a large rectangle,parcel,sits next to two smaller rectangles,parcels and.in terms of the actual work done by cass and,there was no differentiation between the parcels.for them,it was all one big rectangle.in this appeal,no issues are raised as to the reasonableness of the actual work done by cass and,so we need not describe that work in detail.it is enough to say it entailed various forms of grading,infrastructure,sewer and utility work.
the issues raised in this appeal require chronological treatment.but before we set out that chronology,we need to point out that certain events took place out of the sequence one might naturally expect.inland had been planning the kohl department store project before actually acquiring the tract.it had also lined up wachovia bank as its construction lender,and had engaged as its general contractor all prior to its actually owning the property.in turn,formally subcontracted with cass prior to inland formal acquisition of the tract,and it was more than a month after work got started that inland sold off parcel of the tract to kohl.kohl does always own the land on which its stores sit,but it decided in this case to own parcel.
these chronological anomalies help explain the origin of some of the technical issues raised by kohl,and wells fargo as wachovia successor.the lien claimants here began work prior to the current owners of the tract,kohl and wells fargo,taking title.the lien claimants received their information about ownership interests in the tract from the entity they dealt with,which got its information from inland.that said,here are the events in the case,told in strict,if somewhat prosaic,chronological order 
prior to march the tract was owned by loma linda university.
march,while the tract was still owned by loma linda,inland signed a contract with kohl to develop a kohl store on the tract.the deal involved kohl paying percent to inland for the development,with inland paying the balance itself.
march,cass commenced grading and related work.
march,cass served its preliminary notice about the possibility of a mechanic lien on a wachovia bank,the construction lender,b inland,as owner of the tract,and c on,as the original contractor hired by inland.kohl was not served.however,as of march,inland was still not yet the owner of the tract.that would not happen until 
march,on this date inland received a grant deed from loma linda.concomitantly,a deed of trust in favor of wachovia as construction lender was also recorded that very day.
may,cass formally entered into a subcontract with for grading and infrastructure of the tract.
may,kohl became the owner of parcel via a grant deed from inland.
summer fall construction work proceeded on the kohl store.
january,cass recorded a mechanics lien.the lien gave kohl development first street and commerce way beaumont,california as the description of the land.the lien listed as the amount,and lcg beaumont,llc,sidewinder drive,floor,park city,ut,as the owner.kohl was not listed as an owner.
january to april,cass did additional work on the tract,the nature of which is disputed by the parties.the trial court would impliedly find there was substantial evidence all the work was done pursuant to cass existing contract.more details on that point are given in part.
february,tnt,not having been paid by cass,filed a mechanic lien for on the tract.
february,signed a contract with to do certain offsite work.
march,recorded a preliminary notice,naming as the entity who contracted for the work,inland as owner of the property,and wachovia as construction lender.
april,cass filed an action ric against inland and for various causes of action,including a fifth cause of action for foreclosure of its mechanic lien.cass did not name either wachovia or wells fargo,or kohl,as defendants.the fifth cause of action for foreclosure encompassed does though as either owners or persons having an interest in,the kohl property.the sixth cause of action,involving subdivision improvement bonds an issue not before us in this appeal included as defendants does though.
may,cass filed an amendment to its complaint,naming kohl as doe,a possible owner.
june,completed its last day of work.
june,recorded its own mechanic lien.that set forth second street market place,beaumont,ca as a description of the land,and inland lcg beaumont,llc,sidewinder,floor,park city,ut as the owner.the lien gave as the amount.there is no mention of either wachovia or kohl.
june,cass filed an amendment to its complaint adding wachovia as doe.as noted,doe was not one of the owner or had an interest in does those were does though.doe was only involved in the subdivision improvement bond cause of action.
august tnt filed suit ric against cass,inland and others because it was never paid for its work,alleging was owed.september,filed its complaint against and inland ric.the third cause of action for foreclosure of the mechanic lien listed inland and does through as defendants and owners of the property.neither kohl nor wachovia was named in the original complaint.
september,palomar grading filed its original complaint ric,naming wachovia as a lender having an interest in,the property.
december,wells fargo formally took over failing wachovia bank.
about eight months went by.
august,filed a first amended complaint in which inland and does through were alleged to be defendants in a lien foreclosure action.neither wachovia,nor wells fargo,nor kohl were named defendants.
about nine months went by.
may,cass filed an amendment to its complaint naming wells fargo as doe.
november,inland lost its parcels in foreclosure to wells fargo,who became the owner of parcels and.
november,wells fargo filed an answer to cass complaint ric in what by then had become a consolidated case that included tnt action ric the lead case and palomar grading action ric.by september,the jumbo consolidated case also included action ric and the actions of seven other subcontractors whose work on the project is not otherwise relevant to this appeal.
a little more than eight months went by.
july,filed an amendment to its first amended complaint naming kohl as doe.recall that doe was one of the foreclosure defendants.
february,in the course of the trial court consideration of various motions in limine,kohl counsel informed the court that as of february,tnt was a suspended corporation.
february through march,the case was tried.
march,the trial court entered judgment for palomar grading on its cause of action,for.of that,was calculated to be interest at percent for the three years and days since it recorded its complaint.
may,the trial court entered a judgment for cass and,ordering the property to be sold,with cass to receive and to receive.each amount was based on prejudgment interest calculated at percent.
june,gave notice of entry of the judgment in its favor.
june,wells fargo filed a notice of appeal from the march,judgment for 
july,kohl filed a notice of motion for new trial or alternatively to set aside the judgment.
july,wells fargo filed its notice of appeal from the may,judgment in favor of cass and.
august,the trial court denied kohl motions for new trial or to set aside the judgment.
september,kohl filed its notice of appeal from the judgment and the denials of its motions.
iii.discussion 
california mechanic lien law used to occupy sections through of the civil code now it occupies sections through.the change was effective july.the legislature specifically provided that the old law would govern for mechanic liens recorded before that date.see.so when we cite or discuss a mechanic lien statute in the of the civil code,it is old law.we will dispense with the repetitive adjective former in front of those citations or references.
a.did cass forfeit its mechanic lien as applied to kohl,by failing to mention kohl in its preliminary notice no.
kohl makes an in passim argument in its brief to the effect that because cass knew the project would involve kohl,it was therefore required to name kohl in its preliminary notice.this is easily the weakest of all of kohl arguments.the text of the preliminary notice statute,section,only required the preliminary notice to be served on the owner or reputed owner.kohl fit neither description at the time of the preliminary notice.cass filed its preliminary notice on march.kohl acquired title on may.section did not require inclusion of likely future owners,and the phrase reputed owner hardly encompasses mere possible future owners.
was cass mechanic lien void because cass performed work after recording the lien no.
kohl argues that because cass own records showed some work performed after january,the date of its recording its lien,the lien was premature and void.cass responds that this work was punch list work.the dictionary definition of punch list is a list of small repairs or unfinished work that must be completed to fulfill a contract 
but the issue is a little more complicated than the parties present it.first,the statute governing the first date to record a mechanic lien was section.the key phrase in that statute was after he completes his contract.the lead case interpreting that phrase in section is howard wright const.bbic investors,llc th,which reversed a trial court judgment dismissing a lien foreclosure action.the trial court had based its conclusion on the rationale that the subcontractor lien was premature and therefore void.that was error on the trial court part.but the reason the trial court was wrong was not because work done after recording a lien is irrelevant.rather,the appellate court said the lien was still good because the general contractor had breached the contract on the day before the subcontractor filed its mechanic lien.see id.at because of general contractor anticipatory breach of contract,subcontractor completed its contract within meaning of section on june,so the recording of its claim of lien on june was not premature.
in reversing,the howard wright court set down two statements of law.alas those two statements are in tension with each other.first,the howard wright court articulated a substantial completion rule,saying,a contractor completes the contract upon substantial performance of its obligations.howard wright,supra,th at.but then the court turned around and used the categorical word all in interpreting section simply put,a contract is complete for purposes of commencing the recordation period under section when all work under the contract has been performed,excused,or otherwise discharged.howard wright,supra,th at.
we need not resolve the tension between substantial and all in this case,however.there was evidence from cass president,kyle nelson,that and cass agreed to terminate cass remaining work in january.cass gets the benefit of the doubt on the difference between mid and late,so we may draw the reasonable inference from that testimony that the contract had been breached prior to the recording of the lien on january.given that inference,the case comes squarely within the rule of decision of howard wright the contract was over by january,when cass filed its lien,ergo the lien was not premature and not void.
c.did cass and forfeit their mechanic liens as applied to kohl by failing to name kohl in their actual,recorded liens no.
neither cass nor named kohl as an owner in their liens,despite kohl ownership of parcel within the tract by the time those liens were recorded.accordingly kohl argues the liens are void because of the omission.
the statute setting out the requirements for a mechanic lien was section,which was essentially definitional.all it did was explain what a mechanic lien is.as with the preliminary notice statute,the key phrase was owner or reputed owner,if known.
the phrase if known is obviously a different concept from if know able.thus grinnell fire protection system american sav.loan d squarely held that title searches are not necessary for a valid mechanic lien furthermore,as the general contractor points out,other sections of the mechanic lien law contain language indicating that the legislature did not intend to impose on the lien claimant the burden and expense of conducting a title search on the property against which the lien is filed.thus,section provides that a claim of lien must contain the name of the owner or reputed owner,if known,and section similarly requires service of the preliminary day notice on the owner or reputed owner.it appears by the language used in these sections that the legislature recognized that the lien claimant might not have complete and accurate information on the ownership of the property in question,and this recognition makes it improbable that the legislature expected the materialman to conduct a complete and accurate title search to ascertain who owns the property.grinnell fire,supra,d at,italics added.
the question still remains whether cass or actually knew that kohl was an owner of a parcel within the tract when they filed their mechanic liens,since the statutory phrase if known suggests at least a requirement of listing those owners a lien claimant actually knows to be owners.however,that is a substantial evidence question on which the trial court impliedly found against kohl.and there was indeed substantial evidence to support the trial court finding neither cass nor knew kohl was an owner.as to cass,its president kyle nelson testified he did know kohl was an owner when cass recorded its lien.the trial court believed him.that was enough,major western home ins.th,the testimony of a single credible witness even if a party to the action may constitute substantial evidence.ditto as to.its accounts receivable and office manager,linda goral,similarly testified that did know of any owner of the tract other than inland prior to august.mechanic lien was filed in june.
was not listing the right address for the kohl store fatal to its mechanic lien as to kohl no.
section quoted in footnote above merely required that a mechanic lien provide a description of the property sufficient for identification.here,kohl argues that because specified second street in its lien,when the address of the kohl store on parcel of the tract is second street,that its mechanic lien is fatally defective.
as it turns out,the address is physically a little closer to the address than one might guess.the address is in the upper northwest corner of parcel,and readers will recall that parcel is immediately beside the larger parcel owned by kohl.parcel actually has no building on it,but does have some curb and gutter work by.even so,there is no question that is an address that is not actually on parcel of the tract.
according to kohl,by listing an address that did not include parcel the only property actually owned by kohl mechanic lien necessarily excluded parcel from its ambit.the theory is a variation of the linguistic canon of expressio unius exclusio alterius,and a few old cases relied on by kohl,particularly fernandez burleson cal.and nofziger lumber waters,used that linguistic principle to conclude that the property descriptions in those cases were fatal to the liens involved.see fernandez,supra,cal.at the monuments and lines by which the property is said in the notice to be particularly described can not be expunged from the notice,but must be read as part of it so read it is misleading in a particular where it should be substantially true nofziger,supra,indeed,the accurate and certain description in the notice of lien upon lot in block necessarily precludes the idea that such description could have reference to or afford any means for identifying property in some other block in said tract.
but these old cases do not give an accurate picture of the current state of the law bearing on whether a mechanic lien sufficiently identifies the property.the issue of the accuracy of a property description has been problematic in california mechanic lien case law for more than years,and the results have not always been consistent.see wand san gabriel valley lbr.d,reconciliation of all decisions in this field is perhaps impossible 
many of the early cases involved liens against mining claims.a very early case,penrose calkins cal,illustrates what is probably the low point in absolutely insufficient descriptions.there,because a scrivener apparently forgot the balance of the legal description,the mechanic lien literally only specified a certain lot and parcel in nevada county,and then forgot to describe that lot and parcel.ibid.obviously just saying the liened land is somewhere in a given county is not sufficient.
the two old cases on which kohl relies,namely nofziger and fernandez,however,are not good law because of an intervening statute,section,whose predecessor was first enacted in as section of the code of civil procedure section provided in pertinent part no mistake or errors in the the description of the property against which the lien is recorded,shall invalidate the lien,unless the court finds that such mistake or error in the statement of the demand,credits and offsets,or of the balance due,was made with the intent to defraud,or that an innocent third party,without notice,direct or constructive,has since the claim was recorded become the bona fide owner of the property,and that the notice of claim was so deficient that it did not put the party on further inquiry in any manner.italics added.
because section predecessor statute was enacted in,it obviously had no effect on the fernandez case.nor did it have any bearing on the nofziger case.nofziger came to the court based on facts occurring prior to the statute.in fact,nofziger explicitly said the case was decided on prior law.see nofziger,supra.at we forebear any discussion of the effect which section stats,might have upon the case,for the reason that all proceedings in the action were had prior to the enactment of said section.
the reliance by fernandez and nofziger on pre would be the end of the matter,except for a more recent case well,as recent as world war ii hayward.pride.d hayward lumber.hayward lumber was not decided on pre facts,but it still held a description to be fatally defective despite section predecessor being on the books at the time.in hayward lumber,the lien said section of a certain township,when the correct description was the northwest of section.id.at,italics deleted.the hayward lumber court recognized that two of the three cases it was relying on,nofziger and fernandez,did not have the benefit of the statute at that time,still section of the code of civil procedure.but it noted that there was a case decided long after after the enactment of the statute,bishop hayward lumber investment d bishop,which also held a description to be insufficient.based primarily on the bishop case,the hayward lumber case held the description before it to be fatally defective.hayward lumber,supra,d at.
we decline to follow hayward lumber because we conclude hayward lumber misapplied bishop.bishop is a case analogous to a situation where your neighbors hire a contractor,do pay the contractor,the contractor then files a mechanic lien giving the address of your house,and the court holds quite sensibly that the contractor does get to foreclose on your house because,after all,the contractor listed the wrong property.that obviously a situation where section should apply anyway.section was never intended to allow liens on property not benefitted by the work or materials represented by the lien.in our analogy,though,the contractor still might have a valid lien against your neighbor property,and in point of fact the bishop court said exactly that 
the cases that are good precedent on the issue before us include bothum kreis,american transit mix weber d,and borello eichler homes,d.as in the case before us,the lien claimant in bothumjust plain got the address wrong folsom street in los angeles when the right address was folsom street,los angeles bothum,supra.at.applying the predecessor statute to section,the court excused the error,noting that on the record before the court one could say the erroneous street number actually designated any actual street number or building on folsom street.id.at.
in american transit,the lien claimant made a error,lot in block of richland tract,when the right description was lot in block of richland tract.american transit,supra,d at.the court summarily dismissed the argument the mistake was fatal merely by referring to the statute then in its section incarnation and paraphrasing how it worked.the implication was that if there were no fraud or prejudice to a later buyer,nothing more need be said.see id.at.
in borello,the lien claimant said unit and unit,terra linda,san raphael when he should have said terra linda valley.see borello,supra,d at,italics added.terra linda valley was,in fact,a separate subdivision,as were two others that had the name terra linda in them.id.at.indeed,the general area was known as terra linda.the court reasoned that the lien was good because it gave a general geographical area that embraced one of four subdivisions,and there were other identifying facts,most importantly that the owner never owned any unit or in terra linda valley.see id.at.
there is no hint in this case that had any intent to defraud,or that an innocent party buying from kohl would not be on notice of the lien.kohl argument that listing of an address that did not apply to kohl property necessarily precludes application to kohl property as a matter of law therefore fails.
that still leaves the possibility that kohl might prevail as a matter of fact on the theory the description of the property in the lien was still insufficient to identify the tract.as borello points out,the question of the sufficiency of the identification is a question of fact for the trier of fact.borello,supra,d at.and that is an issue kohl does not attempt to tackle.the record in this case contains roughly pages of photographs together with the testimony of vice president as to the physicality of the address in relation to the kohl building.kohl has not attempted to summarize this evidence,much less explain why it was insufficient to identify the kohl property.any insufficiency argument has therefore been waived.
e.did the statute of limitations for filing a foreclosure action run on either cass or foreclosure actions no.
the basic facts bearing on the question of whether the statute of limitations ran on either cass or mechanic lien are not in dispute section provided for a day statute of limitations to file a foreclosure action,which begins to run from the filing of the lien.both cass and met that day deadline when they filed an action the key phrase from the statute itself to foreclose their liens,but in neither case did they name either kohl or wells fargo in their original complaints.and both kohl and wells fargo were owners of parcels in the tract at the time of the original complaints.only later,by the device of substituting kohl or wells fargo in place of various does in their original complaints,were cass and able to obtain judgments foreclosing their liens that applied to kohl and wells fargo interests in the tract.
the actual language of the day statute of limitations applying to mechanic liens only requires an action be filed within the days.see grinnell fire,supra,d at,recognizing point made by appellant.beginning in,however,in paramount sec.daze,the court of appeal engrafted a common law requirement that the mechanic lien foreclosure action must be brought against all of those whose rights,estates,or interests are claimed to be adverse and subordinate.id.at,quoting continental commercial trust sav.bank pacific coast pipe cir,construing analogous idaho statute.the theory of the paramount court was that parties having an interest in the property had the basic right to contest either the validity or priority of the asserted mechanic lien.see id.at.that theory was amplified by the supreme court in connolly development,superior court cal d,where the court observed that mechanic liens do subject owners to the deprivation of their property,and thus constitute a taking of property by the government.accordingly,said connolly,there must be due process protections before property owners can lose their land to mechanic lien foreclosures.see id.at.the owner whose property has been subjected to a mechanics lien can not be denied the protection of the due process clause.
a decade after connolly,the appellate court in grinnell fire dealt with the question of whether doe pleading might solve the problem of a lien claimant who is actually certain of who is the owner of the property being liened.grinnell fire reasoned that since it was clear the legislature never intended to impose on mechanic lien claimants the expense of title searches,the requirement that all interested parties must be named in the foreclosure complaint could be satisfied by the device of doe pleading pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.see grinnell fire,supra,d at.but as a caveat,grinnell fire recognized that doe pleadings are only allowed when the plaintiff does not have actual knowledge of the identity of the party latter named as an initial doe defendant.see id.at.
by way of illustration of the power of doe pleading as approved in grinnell fire,the court in westfour california first bank th held that the statute of limitations did not run in a case where the lien claimant only knew a bank was in the probable position of being a construction lender,but still did not have actual knowledge of that bank deed of trust against the property at the time it filed its original complaint.see id.at,italics added.
given this history,the statute of limitations issue before us boils down,as both wells fargo and kohl acknowledge,to whether cass or had actual knowledge of either wells fargo or kohl interests in the property at the time they filed their original complaints to foreclose the tract both wells fargo and kohl assert there was actual knowledge on the part of both cass and,though they arrive there by slightly different routes.
we begin with wells fargo,as successor to wachovia.wells fargo,obviously laboring in the shadow of westfour,tries to bridge the crevice between a only being known to probably have had a deed of trust on some property and b being known to actually have had one,by reference to a definitional statute,section.section stated that the definition of a construction lender for purposes of the mechanic lien law was an entity that is a beneficiary of a deed of trust in the property 
the argument,however,fails because doe pleading depends on the actual and subjective knowledge of lien claimant,while section,at most,gives a legal definition of construction lender and hence only constructive knowledge.constructive knowledge is a fiction.it imputed knowledge,not actual knowledge.thus it does not follow from the mere existence of a deed of trust on a given property that a lien claimant actually knows there a construction lender,or who that construction lender is.
the proof that only actual,and not constructive,knowledge will defeat a doe pleading is found in a case relied on by the grinnell fire court,irving carpentier cal.there,the plaintiff sued to quiet title in certain land in alameda county.he named a number of defendants including leland stanford and charles crocker,but failed to name a particular defendant even though he would have learned of the defendant interest if he had merely looked in a book of records.id.at.but such constructive knowledge did not,said our high court,prevent him from using the device of doe pleadings under section.the court drew a clear line between a actual ignorance and b what he might have learned had he conducted a title search moreover,the affidavit of douty does not show that plaintiff was ignorant.it shows that if he had examined a book of records named he would have discovered that a certain deed purported to be there recorded.but this does not show that the plaintiff was ignorant of the fact when he commenced his suit.it merely shows that he failed to examine a certain book,which if he had examined would have afforded him some information.his failure to examine tends to establish the fact of ignorance,italics added.since wells fargo does point to any uncontroverted evidence showing cass actually knew wells fargo or wachovia had a deed of trust on the property when it filed its suit,its statute of limitations argument fails.
kohl argument is a little different it a substantial evidence challenge.kohl points to evidence that cass contacted kohl in relation to obtaining payment from.such evidence means,says kohl,cass necessarily knew and this is where kohl brief uses some conspicuously circumlocutory language of kohl identity and relationship to cass claims.kohl ca quite bring itself to state outright that cass knew kohl was an owner.kohl must fall back on whatever insinuation can be eked out of the fact that people knew kohl had an involvement in the construction of one of its stores.
there is an obvious parallel in kohl argument here to the one we have already rejected in part.above.the theory that cass just had to have known kohl owned some of the land in the tract is not supported by substantial evidence.as shown in part.above,there was substantial evidence that cass did know kohl was an owner.
finally,we must note an argument that is not developed in wells fargo brief in regard to the statute of limitations is the fact cass initially listed wells fargo as doe a doe that has nothing to do with the foreclosure cause of action grounds for reversal of the foreclosure judgment as related to wells fargo the issue is waived.wells fargo never makes the formal argument,by way of proper heading or subheading,in its opening brief see cal.rules of court,rule a b 
is cass limited in its foreclosure action to the amount stated in its lien no.
cass mechanic lien listed as the amount owed.its complaint in foreclosure gave the same figure.nevertheless,the trial court gave cass an award that,exclusive of interest,was for,or about more than the amount listed in the lien.the difference is accounted for in cass january billing was the amount prior to the billing,is the amount after the billing 
did the court err no.three statutes,sections,and,when read together,are incompatible with kohl and wells fargo proposed per se rule that a judgment foreclosing a mechanic lien can never exceed the amount stated in the lien itself.first,section quoted in footnote above merely requires mechanic liens to state a demand.the word demand does not denote exactitude.rather it denotes a claim which is subject to either negotiation or litigation.see root american equity specialty ins.th,the action or fact of demanding or claiming in legal form a legal claim to ask for a thing with legal right or authority to claim as something one is legally or rightfully entitled to.quoting oxford english dict.ed.the use of the word demand suggests that the fit between the amount listed in the lien and the amount given by a foreclosure judgment need not be exact.
second,section provided for a percent forfeiture of a mechanic lien if the lien willfully includes amounts of work,labor and material not actually furnished the provision obviously operated to give lien claimants a major incentive not to assert any items which can not be supported in the of lien foreclosure litigation.but there is a necessary logical implication to section harshness the legislature was clearly giving lien claimants an incentive to err,if at all,on the low side in stating lien claims,with the implication being an opportunity to make up for it in the actual foreclosure judgment.
and,finally,section,the statute that directly addressed any limits on the amounts that might be recovered via a mechanic lien,uses the inexact phrase reasonable value as one of the two express limits on recovery amounts either reasonable value,or the contract price,whichever is less section is thus an instance where the interpretive adage expressio unius est exclusio alterius really does apply if the legislature had wanted to limit recovery to just the figure in the lien,it could easily have said so in section.it did.the limit is the contract price,not the lien amount.
kohl and wells fargo make no argument that the amount of the judgment is based on a figure beyond the contract price or that the amount was somehow unreasonable.kohl and wells fargo argument,rather,is based on the analogy of mechanic liens to mortgages the foreclosure of a mechanic lien resembles the foreclosure of a mortgage,and when it comes to mortgages there is no question the recovery must be limited to the amount secured by the mortgage,ergo the recovery on the foreclosure of a mechanic lien is also limited by the stated amount of the lien.
but kohl and wells fargo read too much into their analogy.while both areas of law involve foreclosure,the origins of the right to foreclose are decidedly different.the foreclosure of a mortgages ultimately is a matter of voluntary contract the foreclosure of a mechanic lien at least in a case involving an innocent owner is a matter of the imposition of an obligation on a landowner independent of contract 
the case on which kohl and wells fargo rely for the mechanic analogy,laubisch roberdo cal d,merely stands for the proposition that the purchaser at a mechanic lien foreclosure sale is just as much the new owner of the property as the purchaser at a mortgage foreclosure sale.in laubisch,there was a judgment ordering a mechanic lien foreclosure in january but there was no actual foreclosure sale until march.world war ii intervened,and,during the war,the owner of the property at the time of the mechanic lien transferred the property to a woman named roberdo,who in turn transferred the property to a woman named wentworth,who in turn transferred it to a woman named cowan,and when the purchaser at the mechanic lien foreclosure sought to quiet title and obtain rent from cowan,cowan argued she had acquired the property by adverse possession.in the process of knocking down cowan adverse possession claim,the supreme court simply made the point that no statute of limitations was running against the purchaser at the mechanic lien foreclosure,just as no statute of limitations would have run against a purchaser at a mortgage foreclosure sale.id.at.such a rationale hardly stands for the proposition that the judgment foreclosing the mechanic lien is per se limited in amount to the amount stated in the lien 
g.did the court err in including amounts owed to tnt in the judgment for cass no.
we now come to one of the trickiest aspects of an appeal what to do about tnt corporate suspension the undisputed facts are that cass subcontracted with tnt grading and the is important to do some of cass grading work.tnt did get paid,and filed a mechanic lien for against the tract,plus timely sued cass and doe owners,seeking foreclosure of its mechanic lien.no one argues that tnt mechanic lien was in any way invalid when recorded.however,as kohl trial counsel explained to the court in reference to a motion in limine tnt corporate status had been suspended by the time of trial,and tnt had filed a dismissal of its action.even so,cass trial counsel told the trial court prior to trial that cass had agreed to pay tnt through a pass through agreement.however,as kohl now points out,no evidence of any agreement or assignment of tnt rights to cass was offered by cass at the trial.and cass,for its part,makes no effort in its briefing to show that it has any obligation to tnt in the wake of tnt corporate suspension.cass thus makes no claim in its briefs on appeal that if the judgment is affirmed it will fork over to tnt the cass itself did pay tnt on the tnt cass subcontract.in light of these facts,kohl now asserts the inclusion of in the foreclosure judgment for cass was error.
the question boils down to whether tnt was a claimant under section.section provided,in its entirety any original contractor or subcontractor shall be entitled to recover,upon a claim of lien recorded by him,only such amount as may be due him according to the terms of his contract after deducting all claims of other claimants for labor,services,equipment,or materials furnished and embraced within his contract.italics added.
the key to section is to ask precisely when the contractor or subcontractor is to recover the amount in light of the specified deductions.the answer is,we think,in the judgment foreclosing the lien,because only a judgment will reflect the various deductions of other claimants that have been aired before the court.the question then becomes,who is a claimant there is a statutory answer found in section claimant means any person entitled under this title to record a claim of lien,to give a stop notice in connection with any work of improvement,or to recover on any payment bond,or any combination of the foregoing.italics added.
while there is no question that tnt was entitled,while it was still a viable corporation,to record a mechanic lien indeed it did so there is also no question that it was not entitled to prosecute any claim,lien or otherwise,by the time of trial and the ensuing judgment.as explained in center for self improvement and community development lennar corporation th,a suspended corporation is dead to the law.it can not sell,transfer or exchange real property in california,and contracts entered into during the time of suspension are voidable by the other party or parties through legal action.moreover,it may not prosecute or defend an action,seek a writ of mandate,appeal from an adverse judgment,or renew a judgment obtained before suspension.ibid.while a suspended corporation can revive itself by paying back taxes plus interest and penalties to the franchise tax board see,statutes of limitations keep running during the period of suspension,so a revived corporation claim will be time barred if the statute of limitations runs during the period of suspension.sade shoe oschin snyder d.
we recognize that,strictly speaking,the inclusion of the in cass judgment of lien foreclosure is a windfall to it,at least if for some reason it does forward the amount onto tnt as it represented to the trial judge it would do.even so,we note that kohl and wells fargo will clearly be entitled to offset the encompassed within cass lien should tnt ever,by some chance,revive itself and try once again to foreclose its lien on the tract.see stone serimian cal,wyman hooker,see also ferelli weaver d,no error where trial court made payment of money owed to contractor contingent on contractor first paying subcontractors liens.
though there is a windfall to cass or not,depending on whether it honors its promise to tnt,there is no corresponding loss to kohl or wells fargo they are no worse off than if tnt had paid its corporate taxes and prosecuted its lien to judgment.indeed,were we to rule in their favor on this point,they might obtain a genuine windfall,free and clear of any obligation to tnt should it ever be revived.in that case,cass might owe tnt the for unpaid work,but cass would have no recourse against wells fargo or kohl for it even though their property would have been improved by that amount.
h.did the trial court abuse its discretion by not allocating the judgment among the three parcels within the tract no.
as mentioned,the tract consists of three parcels.kohl building sits on parcel only.parcels and have infrastructure put there by cass,tnt,and palomar grading,but no buildings proper.both kohl and wells fargo now assert the trial court should have allocated the judgment foreclosing the mechanic liens of all successful lien claimants between the various parcels.at the very least such allocation would spare kohl and wells fargo the further legal expense of allocating between themselves how to apportion the judgments 
the issue distills to this legal question did,somehow,the trial court contravene,or otherwise abuse any discretion committed to it pursuant to,the statute governing allocation in the context of mechanic liens,section 
no.we reproduce the entirety of section in the margin as the combined reply brief of kohl and wells fargo observes,section is a confusingly worded statute.confusing as it is,though,we have threaded our way to this conclusion section only applies in cases where there is more than one work of improvement.
the phrase work of improvement is statutorily defined in section work of improvement includes but is not restricted to the construction,alteration,addition to,or repair,in whole or in part,of any building,wharf,bridge,ditch,flume,aqueduct,well,tunnel,fence,machinery,railroad,or road,the seeding,sodding,or planting of any lot or tract of land for landscaping purposes,the filling,leveling,or grading of any lot or tract of land,the demolition of buildings,and the removal of buildings.except as otherwise provided in this title,work of improvement means the entire structure or scheme of improvement as a whole.italics added.
the trial court explicitly found,as a factual matter,that the work of the lien claimants was pursuant to one scheme of improvement as a whole.said the statement of decision the overwhelming weight of the evidence established that the work of improvement,from its inception to completion was one unified project,including all three parcels,with one owner,inland lcg beaumont,llc,one lender,wachovia,and one general contractor,group.cass was not required to allocate the value of its work between the three parcels included in the project.
conspicuously absent from the otherwise voluminous briefing of both kohl or wells fargo is any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court finding.neither of the appellants briefs provides a clear description of what the evidence showed as to what,precisely,ended up on parcel,as distinct from what ended up on parcels and.as the appellate rule was recently reiterated in estate of bonzi th,footnote a party challenging sufficiency of the evidence must set forth all material evidence,including evidence harmful to the party position.foreman clark fallon cal d.failure to do so results in the claim being deemed waived.see also nwosu uba th.kohl and wells fargo make no argument that precise items of work on parcels or do not also benefit kohl store on parcel.
the case law invoked by kohl and wells fargo on the allocation question is inapposite for that very same reason the failure to show a substantive demarcation between the property benefitted and the property supposedly not benefitted.several cases deal with similar situations.raisch paving mountain view sav.and loan d involved two different tracts both benefitted by a sewer line,with the lien claimant failing to file any lien at all on one of those tracts.the appellate court held the judgment of foreclosure could not include the property outside the lien.see id.at.
forsgren associates,pacific golf community development llc th,justice gaut magnum opus on the subject of mechanic lien law,involved a situation where the work only slightly benefitted the adjacent and separately owned property a tee box and a small green area in comparison to a large housing development.see id.at nature of adjacent property included proposed housing development in excess of homes.obviously the failure to allocate under the circumstances gross disproportionality between a tiny improved portion on one property and substantial improvements to an adjoining property would have been highly inequitable.
pacific coast refrigeration,badger d fits the same pattern.there the property that was intended to be benefitted was a supermarket the lien arose out of the construction of cooling facilities in the supermarket.the existence of the supermarket,of course,was of some collateral benefit to a nearby property,a gas station.but the gross disproportion in benefits meant the lien based on cooling facilities installed in the supermarket could not extend to the gas station property in fact,the gas station property had been exempted from the property secured by the deed of trust that gave rise to the construction loan.id.at.
here,by contrast,kohl and wells fargo conspicuously do not make any argument that the work on parcels and is so separate and distinct from the work on parcel that equity required allocation of the liens as to those respective parcels.the trial court was thus well within its discretion not to allocate the amount of liens between the respective parcels.
i.did the trial court err in awarding the lien claimants prejudgment interest no.
kohl and wells fargo argument that no prejudgment interest at all should have been awarded is necessarily dependent on their prevailing on the allocation issue.in forsgren,for example,where allocation was required,the appellate court concomitantly held the lack of it made it impossible to calculate a liquidated damages claim.the amount was simply not capable of being certainly calculated.see forsgren,supra,th at,citing section.here,however,since the whole project was one ball of wax our phrase or one scheme of improvement as a whole the legislature phrase the trial court used the word unitary.the calculation of prejudgment interest could thus readily be made certain from the recording of the liens.
j.did the trial court err in awarding the lien claimants prejudgment interest at percent,as distinct from percent,as against the non contracting,innocent owners yes.
this is the only part of this opinion certified for publication,so we set forth a brief précis of the relevant facts for the benefit of those readers who will not have access to the balance of the opinion in,a developer named inland,engaged a general contractor called,to develop a kohl department store and surrounding property on a tract in beaumont.the construction lender was wachovia bank.general contractor contracted with,among others,palomar grading and cass to do infrastructural work benefitting the tract.as it turned out,both kohl and wachovia ended up owning parcels in the tract.neither,however,ever entered a contract with the two subcontractors.palomar grading and cass were not paid for substantial portions of their work,and brought successful actions to foreclose their mechanic liens the trial judge awarded them prejudgment interest at percent and now kohl and wells fargo,as wachovia successor,are challenging that decision.we write on a clean slate.no published case has considered the issue 
there is a default rate of interest prescribed by the constitution in article xv,section,for the forbearance of any money,goods,or things in action,or on accounts after demand,shall be percent per annum.italics added.things in action obviously include the right to foreclose on a mechanic lien.the legislature,however,has enacted section,subdivision b,specifying that the default for breach of contract is percent the lien claimants in this case argue for the applicability of section percent,as distinct from the constitutional default rate of percent.
we determine it is the constitutional default rate that should apply to prejudgment interest on a mechanic lien as applied to noncontracting,innocent owners.unlike section,the prejudgment interest statute,section,applies to both contract and tort actions.see marine terminals paceco,d.torts generally do not involve obligations incurred by contract.
the salient fact here is that the owners of the property had no contract with either palomar grading or cass.the liens on the property are the result of the imposition of the mechanic lien laws,not contract.the comments of an appellate panel from the depths of the great depression summarize the essence of the legal relationship the right of a materialman to have declared and enforced his lien against specific property is a right provided to him by the organic law,and shall not be lightly considered.it is true perhaps,that changing conditions have,in some cases,permitted an apparent injustice to result through enforcement of liens against an innocent owner,or one defrauded through the machinations of a dishonest contractor.bay lumber pickering,italics added.
we must not forget that,as explained by our supreme court in connolly development,superior court cal d,the operation of mechanic liens do constitute a taking of an owner interest in its property the owner whose property has been subjected to a mechanic lien has suffered at least as serious a deprivation as did the plaintiffs in two united state supreme court cases,and thus can not be denied the protection of the due process clause.id.at.but the taking is justified,in terms of an owner who is innocent of breaching a contract with an unpaid lien claimant,precisely because the owner property has been benefitted by the work or material of the lien claimant.the purpose of a mechanics lien is to prevent unjust enrichment of a property owner at the expense of laborers or material suppliers.basic modular facilities,ehsanipour th.but that benefit is not necessarily the result of an owner contract with the lien claimant.just as prejudgment interest can be given in tort cases,an owner who did contract with a lien claimant can be legally exposed to prejudgment interest.it follows,then,that the statutory default rate for contract breaches of percent should not be applicable to innocent,noncontracting owners,who are analogous to tort defendants,not contract defendants.
the lien claimants here posit two theories against our conclusion.palomar grading is direct.it simply is fair,says palomar grading,to charge percent against the improver of land by which it appears palomar grading means a general contractor who breaches a contract with a subcontractor and let an owner get away with only percent.but it is fair,when one realizes the owner loss is a matter of operation of law,not voluntary choice.unfortunately,general contractors sometimes stiff their subcontractors after taking money from the owner or the owner banker.in that situation the mechanic lien law in effect forces innocent owners to pay twice.to be sure,their paying twice may be justified by the special solicitude shown toward unpaid contractors and material suppliers by the mechanic lien law that law is,after all,part of the california constitution article xx,section but the justification for the loss of property in the case of innocent owners is certainly not that they agreed to it.thus it is perfectly fair that the defaulting contractor who breached its contract should have to pay a higher rate than an innocent owner who did.
cass makes a different argument.it focuses on its right to recover the amount due according to its contract.for cass,because it is entitled to recover the amount due pursuant to its contract it should receive percent interest,period.but that logic ignores section.the statutory language is the liens provided for in this chapter shall be direct liens,and shall be for the reasonable value of the labor,services,equipment,or materials furnished or for the price agreed upon by the claimant and the person with whom he or she contracted,whichever is less.italics added.thus a lien claimant does not necessarily receive the amount due on its contract.again,we see that insofar as the mechanic lien laws act on an innocent owner,the obligation is limited by statute to the reasonable value of work when it is less than the contract.
cass brief also cites some language from a comment apparently in the edition of the respected marsh treatise on mechanic lien law,to the effect it is safe to say only that the lien claimant right to interest is limited to the legal rate now.there are two answers to the proffered quotation one,the quotation only refers to a limit,not what is actually appropriate,and does at least in the snippet cass gives us address prejudgment interest as such.and two,while the safe to say language might have been found in the edition of marsh,it is not to be found in section of either the hard copy of current edition or the current online version.see marsh,cal.mechanics lien law ed,to.moreover,that particular section of marsh is written as a practice guide from the point of view of an attorney for a lien claimant,and the thrust of the section is not this is the law,but there no harm in trying.
obviously our brief decision in regard to the prejudgment interest issue does not address the question of prejudgment interest in the case of culpable,owners,that is,owners who breach their contracts with contractors or materials suppliers and for that reason have a mechanic lien slapped on their property.we also do not address the possibility to be sure of a sham change in ownership from say,a breaching owner to an ostensibly one done deliberately to try to gain a better interest rate.our decision today only applies to innocent owners who,even though they did not breach their own contracts,nonetheless winded up with property subject to a mechanic lien.
because this section is in the context of this partially published opinion,we state our disposition as to the prejudgment interest issue now the judgment is reversed insofar as it provides for a rate of prejudgment interest at percent and is remanded for a recalculation at the rate of percent.the topic of appellate costs is covered in the unpublished disposition.
iv.disposition 
the judgment is affirmed in all respects except to the degree it provides that liens of palomar grading and cass should include prejudgment interest at the rate of percent.to that degree we reverse the judgment and remand it with instructions to the trial court to recalculate the prejudgment interest at percent.
on balance,the respondents cass and are still the prevailing parties in this appeal of issues raised,they have prevailed,either singly or together,in.they shall recover their costs on appeal from kohl and wells fargo.
it is a different matter for palomar grading.the only issue on which it has appeared in this appeal is the issue of the proper rate of prejudgment interest,and on that issue it lost.however,it would be unfair to allow kohl and wells fargo to recover all their appellate costs from palomar grading because they won on the lone prejudgment interest rate issue.most of this appeal has concerned their unsuccessful challenges to the foreclosure judgments obtained by cass and.
accordingly,insofar as palomar grading is concerned,the parties will bear their own costs on appeal.
all undesignated statutory references in this opinion are to the civil code except any reference to section,section,section or section.those statutory references are to the code of civil procedure.
in pertinent part section,subdivision a read except for a number of situations not relevant to this case,every person who furnishes labor,service,equipment,or material for which a lien or payment bond otherwise can be claimed under this title,or for which a notice to withhold can otherwise be given under this title,shall,as a necessary prerequisite to the validity of any claim of lien,payment bond,and of a notice to withhold,cause to be given to the owner or reputed owner,to the original contractor,or reputed contractor,and to the construction lender,if any,or to the reputed construction lender,if any,a written preliminary notice as prescribed by this section.italics added.

section provided in its entirety each original contractor,in order to enforce a lien,must record his claim of lien after he completes his contract and before the expiration of a days after the completion of the work of improvement as defined in section if no notice of completion or notice of cessation has been recorded,or b days after recordation of a notice of completion or notice of cessation.
a case that might be read for a per se irrelevance rule,lewis hopper d,another case,was,as the howard wright court noted,only a statute of limitations case and did not interpret section at all.see howard wright,supra,th at,fn.
here is the text of section in its entirety a claim of lien means a written statement,signed and verified by the claimant or by the claimant agent,containing all of the following a statement of the claimant demand after deducting all just credits and offsets.the name of the owner or reputed owner,if known.a general statement of the kind of labor,services,equipment,or materials furnished by the claimant.the name of the person by whom the claimant was employed or to whom the claimant furnished the labor,services,equipment,or materials.a description of the site sufficient for identification.b a claim of lien in otherwise proper form,verified and containing the information required by this section shall be accepted by the recorder for recording and shall be deemed duly recorded without acknowledgment.italics added.
strictly speaking,wand did not involve a failure to accurately describe the property rather it involved a mistake in the mechanic lien form as to who,precisely,authorized the work to begin with.the lien claimant mistakenly wrote claimant when it should have inserted the name of walter sargent,the entity who contracted with the claimant for the work on the office building in the case.see wand,supra,d at.wand,however,is perhaps the most thoughtful opinion one is likely to encounter in the small eddy of cases bearing on disputed property descriptions.there,justice kaus then of the court of appeal explored the case law to date,and recognized that the bewildering array of cases in this field might at least be analyzed by how those cases grappled with a particular statute,then section of the code of civil procedure,which said mistakes in certain particulars in mechanic liens would definitely not invalidate them.see id.at noting the profound effect which the statute has had on the manner in which our decisions have interpreted the requirements for a valid mechanic lien.our decision today aspires to follow in justice kaus footsteps by,as in wand,focusing on the effect of the iteration of section,namely section.
see footnote above,introducing one of the several predecessors of section.the statute has undergone a number of transformations over the past years from of the code of civil procedure stats,ch,to section of the same code stats,ch,then to section,also in the same code stats,ch,then to section of the civil code stats,ch,and now to,most recently,section stats,ch.
in bishop,a man named hess contracted with the lumber company for materials to build certain premises on property not owned by the plaintiff,josie bishop.the lumber company mechanic lien listed the property as section three of a certain township south josie bishop owned section,of the same township south.but the complaint for foreclosure was served on her anyway.she took no notice of the suit because it listed the wrong property,and allowed a default judgment to be taken against her.she then had to file a quiet title action that led to the bishop opinion.the trial court agreed with her,quieted title,and the lumber company appealed.the lumber company lost,with the court citing the omission language from penrose and fernandez.bishop,supra,d at.obviously the bishop court was not concerned about whether the description in the mechanic lien was sufficient as to the property that really was improved,and the court said that explicitly.see id.at.
a few other things were wrong too,such as the number of the tract block,a mention of maps when it should have said miscellaneous records,and an omission of the descriptive name ganahl from the brooklyn heights tract where the work was done.see bothum,supra.at.
in connolly,the supreme court pointed out that procedural due process even extended to such minor deprivations as a day suspension from school.connolly,supra,cal d at,citing goss lopez.thus an owner whose property has been subjected to a mechanic lien is entitled to procedural due process protection.the connolly court went on to opine,though,that because an owner still has possession and use of the land,the deprivation effected by a mechanic lien was sufficiently minor that california mechanic lien statutes still accord procedural due process.but the connolly opinion was,of course,issued prior to grinnell fire imprimatur on doe pleading to effectively circumvent the day requirement to name all interested parties.which brings us to the point of this footnote despite the fact both kohl and wells fargo are quick to point out the relatively long periods of time that elapsed between the original foreclosure complaints and their being named as doe defendants more than days according to wells fargo neither owner has made the constitutional argument that an excessively long period between the filing of the complaint and the substitution of a doe might contravene due process.that is an issue for another day.neither kohl nor wells fargo complain,for example,that they were prejudiced in their trial preparation because of the delay or that they suffered any cognizable loss by the continuing existence of the liens on the tract in the time period between the filing of the action and service of the action on them as doe defendants.
section provided in its entirety construction lender means any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust lending funds with which the cost of the work of improvement is,wholly or in part,to be defrayed,or any assignee or successor in interest of either,or any escrow holder or other party holding any funds furnished or to be furnished by the owner or lender or any other person as a fund from which to pay construction costs.
the two statute of limitations arguments that wells fargo does make by way of heading or subheading are the actual knowledge argument we have already considered,and a variation of that argument,which is that lien foreclosure plaintiffs must name all interested parties,not just parties who are junior to the lienholders interest.
apropos the argument we addressed in part.above,neither kohl nor wells fargo make the argument that the january billing was not part of the contract so as to render the january,lien premature.
any person who shall willfully include in his claim of lien labor,services,equipment,or materials not furnished for the property described in such claim shall thereby forfeit his lien.
a the liens provided for in this chapter shall be direct liens,and shall be for the reasonable value of the labor,services,equipment,or materials furnished or for the price agreed upon by the claimant and the person with whom he or she contracted,whichever is less.the lien shall not be limited in amount by the price stated in the contract as defined in section,except as provided in sections and and in subdivision c of this section.b this section does not preclude the claimant from including in the lien any amount due for labor,services,equipment,or materials furnished based on a written modification of the contract or as a result of the rescission,abandonment,or breach of the contract.however,in the event of rescission,abandonment,or breach of the contract,the amount of the lien may not exceed the reasonable value of the labor,services,equipment,and materials furnished by the claimant.c the owner shall notify the prime contractor and construction lenders of any changes in the contract if the change has the effect of increasing the price stated in the contract by percent or more.
this basic principle will cut the other way in part.anon.
because we determine the trial court correctly followed the lien statutes,we need not address cass auxiliary argument that kohl was estopped to claim the lien amount should not include the january billing because kohl construction manager actually told cass to go ahead and file the lien in a phone conversation with a cass employee jerry gaeir.the circumstances behind the estoppel argument were that the construction manager said he never trusted anyway,and told the cass employee to go ahead and file a lien so he could have a reason to stop payment.there is no need to address the argument and it would bind wells fargo anyway.we also do not address cass argument that section also operated to allow the judgment to include the additional.
kohl counsel was seeking an in limine order to prevent a representative from tnt,then suspended,from testifying on cass behalf.the request was denied.
from our point of view,the question of whether cass obtained a formal assignment of tnt rights is,in fact,irrelevant.section operates by taking the contract amount and then deducting amounts owed to claimants embraced within that contract.here cass is predicating its right to recover,like the plaintiff in kimber jones d,on an assignment.it is predicating its right to recover on its contract.had tnt stuck around and remained in the case,tnt could have had of the foreclosure in its own right as cass subcontractor,and cass recovery would have been reduced by that amount.
their briefs raise the specter of the various lien claimants being able to pick and choose as to which of the parcels will be foreclosed on.that is a chimera.looking at the judgment the whole tract will be foreclosed upon.
in every case in which one claim is filed against two or more buildings or other works of improvement owned or reputed to be owned by the same person or on which the claimant has been employed by the same person to do his work or furnish his materials,whether such works of improvement are owned by one or more owners,the person filing such claim must at the same time designate the amount due to him on each of such works of improvement otherwise the lien of such claim is postponed to other liens.if such claimant has been employed to furnish labor or materials under a contract providing for a lump sum to be paid to him for his work or materials on such works of improvement as a whole,and such contract does not segregate the amount due for the work done and materials furnished on such works of improvement separately,then such claimant,for the purposes of this section,may estimate an equitable distribution of the sum due him over all of such works of improvement based upon the proportionate amount of work done or materials furnished upon such respective works of improvement.the lien of such claimant does not extend beyond the amount designated as against other creditors having liens,by judgment,mortgage,or otherwise,upon either such works of improvement or upon the land upon which the same are situated.for all purposes of this section,if there is a single structure on more than one parcel of land owned by one or more different owners,it shall not be the duty of the claimant to segregate the proportion of material or labor entering into the structure on any one of such parcels but upon the trial thereof the court may,where it deems it equitable so to do,distribute the lien equitably as between the several parcels involved.
which is not altogether atypical of language in some of the pre statutes.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,language and legislative history very confused as to pre version of section.
the unpublished balance of this opinion is largely taken up explaining why cass and judgments of lien foreclosure are being affirmed.
we have determined that the decision to award palomar grading and cass prejudgment interest in the first place was a correct one because the precise amounts owed were ascertainable from the initial recording of their liens.forsgren associates pacific golf community development th,prejudgment interest not appropriate where precise amount of liens on respective properties had not been ascertained by trial court.
in their briefing,the parties dispute the precedential value of the published portion of royster construction urban west communities th.answer it has no precedential value on the interest rate point,even by inference.in royster,a mechanic lien claimant was awarded prejudgment interest at percent id.at,and the appellate court squarely ruled that the judgment had to be modified to reduce the prejudgment interest to percent id.at.but why we do know.the panel certified royster for publication,excepting its part involving prejudgment interest.id.at,fn.strictly speaking,then,while we know what the court did,we do not know why the court did it.the california constitution says that decisions of the s
