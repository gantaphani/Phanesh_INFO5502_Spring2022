plaintiff appellant joann riggs filed an action against defendants appellees prober raphael,a law firm,and dean prober,together,prober after prober sought to collect a debt riggs owed to prober client,fireside bank.riggs alleged that prober debt collection letter did not comply with the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,or its state equivalent,the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act rosenthal act,cal.et,namely by impermissibly requiring her to dispute her debt in writing and,as a result,misrepresenting her rights to dispute her debt.the district court granted prober summary judgment and riggs appeals.
we have previously held that a collection letter,called a validation notice or dunning letter,violates a of the fdcpa insofar as it state s that the debtor disputes must be made in writing.camacho bridgeport,cir.unlike the validation notice at issue in camacho,prober notice did not state that riggs must dispute her debt in writing.riggs argues that prober notice nonetheless violates a because it implicitly requires written disputes.assuming without deciding that prober notice can be understood implicitly to require written disputes,we hold that a validation notice violates a of the fdcpa only where it expressly requires a consumer to dispute her debt in writing.
background 
statutory background 
the fdcpa seeks to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors and to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged.e.toward that end,the fdcpa imposes certain requirements on debt collectors and imposes strict liability for violations.cruz int l collection,cir donohue quick collect,cir see also providing for civil damages.
section a of the fdcpa requires a debt collector to send a consumer debtor,within five days of the debt collector initial attempt to collect any debt,a written validation notice containing 
the amount of the debt 
the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed 
a statement that unless the consumer,within thirty days after receipt of the notice,disputes the validity of the debt,or any portion thereof,the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector 
a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the period that the debt,or any portion thereof,is disputed the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector and 
a statement that upon the consumer written request within the period the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor,if different from the current creditor.
section provides that a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.a debt collector violates this rule where,among other things,it use s any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.id.
california has adopted a state version of the fdcpa,called the rosenthal act.see cal.et.the rosenthal act mimics or incorporates by reference the fdcpa requirements,including those described above,and makes available the fdcpa remedies for violations.id.thus,for purposes of this case,whether a validation notice violates the rosenthal act turns on whether it violates the fdcpa.
factual background 
the facts of this case are undisputed.in november,riggs purchased a car under a retail installment contract that was later assigned to fireside bank.riggs borrowed of the purchase price.between september and december,riggs failed to make her monthly payments.during that time,fireside bank repossessed the car and notified riggs that it would sell the car unless she made the required payments,which she did not.fireside sold the car,applied the proceeds to riggs debt,and hired prober to collect the balance 
in a validation notice dated april,prober requested repayment of the remaining debt,plus accrued interest.the notice read,in relevant part

prober filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b and,in the alternative,for partial summary judgment.the district court granted in part the motion to dismiss with leave to amend,and granted partial summary judgment for prober on the two claims described above.the court held that prober validation notice did not impermissibly require riggs to dispute her debt in writing and did not falsely misrepresent her right to dispute the debt.the district court entered final judgment at riggs request,and riggs timely appealed.riggs appeals only the district court summary judgment order,not its order granting in part prober motion to dismiss.
