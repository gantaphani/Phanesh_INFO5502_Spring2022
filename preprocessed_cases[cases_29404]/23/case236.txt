in this bankruptcy case,elixir industries,elixir appeals the district court judgment in favor of city bank trust city bank,which held that elixir judgment lien was voided during the bankruptcy proceeding.we hold that upon confirmation of the reorganization plan,the lien was voided under c,and thus affirm the judgment of the district court.
in may elixir properly filed and recorded a judgment lien in the mortgage records of natchitoches parish,louisiana,in the amount of plus costs and interest on property owned by the bankrupt,ahern enterprises,ahern.the property subject to the lien included ahern manufacturing facility in campti,louisiana.the manufacturing facility property was subject to a prior recorded mortgage held by city bank that exceeded the value of the property.
on july,ahern filed for chapter protection.on november,elixir filed a proof of claim in the amount of as an unsecured priority claim.ahern,as debtor in possession,objected to the proof of claim and argued that elixir only had a general unsecured debt because there was no unencumbered property to which the lien could attach.a hearing was held on april,after which the bankruptcy court entered an order sustaining ahern objection because elixir lien was junior to that of city bank.the bankruptcy court reduced elixir claim to a general unsecured claim in the amount of,the principal amount of elixir judgment.
on september,city bank filed a motion for authority to execute dation en paiement and to cancel indebtedness,which sought to cancel all judgment liens on two parcels of ahern property that were pledged to the bank as collateral.the motion,however,did not include the manufacturing facility property.the bankruptcy court granted the motion on october and issued an order requiring the natchitoches parish clerk to cancel all judgments affecting these two parcels.no order was issued concerning the manufacturing facility property.
ahern chapter plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on may.
on november,ahern voluntarily converted its chapter plan into a request for relief under chapter.in february,city bank and the chapter trustee filed a joint motion requesting court approval to sell the manufacturing facility property to the bank,as senior lien holder,in satisfaction of a portion of ahern debts.the bankruptcy court approved the sale on march and credited against city bank claim,leaving it with an unsecured claim of.the trustee transferred the deed for the property to city bank on march.
city bank sold the manufacturing facility property to a third party on march.no title check was performed to discover that elixir judgment lien,as well as three additional liens,remained on the property.the third party later defaulted,and city bank foreclosed on the property.
in,as it contemplated selling the property again,city bank determined that elixir lien as well as the three others had not been cancelled.on april,city bank filed a complaint for declaratory relief in bankruptcy court,seeking a ruling that the liens had been voided during ahern bankruptcy case.elixir,requesting a declaration that the lien was still valid.after for summary judgment,the bankruptcy court found in favor of city bank.the court concluded that its april order sustaining ahern objection to elixir proof of claim had extinguished the lien.
elixir appealed to the district court,which affirmed,asserting multiple reasons.the court held that the bankruptcy court april order sustaining ahern objection voided elixir lien the bankruptcy court confirmation and the substantial consummation of ahern chapter plan was sufficient to void elixir lien and conversion to chapter did not reinstate elixir lien.
elixir subsequently filed this appeal.
on appeal,elixir argues that the bankruptcy court order sustaining ahern objection to its proof of claim did not void its lien on the manufacturing facility property.although the bankruptcy court reduced elixir claim to a general,claim,elixir contends that the court merely reclassified its claim for the purposes of distribution in the bankruptcy proceedings,which did not affect its judgment lien.city bank counters that,because the court found elixir claim to be an allowed unsecured claim,it was not an allowed secured claim under d and the lien was therefore voided.
elixir also contests the district court holding that its lien was voided by the confirmation of the chapter plan.elixir contends that,because the plan had not reached the consummation date necessary for its provisions to take effect,the plan language did not take effect,leaving its lien on the manufacturing property.city bank argues that c operated to void elixir lien.city bank contends that the plan took effect on substantial consummation as defined by.
in reviewing cases originating in bankruptcy,we perform the same function as the district court the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,and issues of law are reviewed de novo.in re soileau,cir.
we do not address the district court holding that elixir lien was voided by the bankruptcy court april order reducing elixir claim and classifying it as a general unsecured creditor we conclude instead that the provisions of c decide this case.in reaching this decision,we hold first that,under section c,the confirmation of a chapter plan voids liens on property dealt with by the plan unless they are specifically preserved,if the lien holder participates in the reorganization.elixir judgment lien was voided because ahern chapter plan was confirmed without elixir objection because the property subject to elixir lien was dealt with by the plan because elixir participated in the reorganization proceedings and finally because the plan did not preserve elixir lien.
title c provides,with immaterial exceptions,that except as otherwise provided in the plan or in the order confirming the plan,after confirmation of a plan,the property dealt with by the plan is free and clear of all claims and interests of creditors,equity security holders,and of general partners in the debtor.
other circuits who have considered c in the context of facts similar to those presented here have found that the section operates to extinguish liens that are not preserved in a confirmed chapter plan.the first court to state this default rule was the seventh circuit.in re penrod,cir.in penrod,the debtor chapter plan made provision for payment of a creditor claim,which was secured by a lien on the debtor hogs.id.at.neither the plan nor the order confirming it provided whether the lien would be extinguished.id.the seventh circuit acknowledged the old saw that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.id.it reasoned,however,that when lienholders participate in a bankruptcy proceeding,and especially in a reorganization,they know that their liens are likely to be affected,and indeed altered.id.at.the court held that liens are interests covered by section c and that unless the plan of reorganization,or the order confirming the plan says that a lien is preserved,it is extinguished by the confirmation provided,we emphasize,that the holder of the lien participated in the reorganization.id.at.the court found that its interpretation of section c would lower the transaction costs of dealing with a reorganized debtor by allowing prospective creditors or investors to determine from the plan of reorganization itself whether liens of creditors whose interests are defined in the plan survive.id.
the eighth circuit acknowledged penrod rationale when it considered the federal deposit insurance corporation appeal of an order confirming a chapter plan.fdic union entities in re transport,cir.the court noted the rule that a secured creditor who participates in the reorganization may also lose its lien by confirmation of a reorganization plan which does not expressly preserve the lien.id.at.the court found,however,that the fdic lien was not voided by the confirmed chapter plan because the bankruptcy court erroneously disallowed its claim,on account of the fdic untimely filed proof of claim.id.at.had its claim been classified properly as a secured claim,the fdic would have been entitled to vote and receive distribution
