this is a lawsuit brought under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa against a debt collector,great seneca financial corporation seneca,and its law firm,javitch,block rathbone,javitch.wendelyn harvey claimed that seneca and javitch violated both the fdcpa and the ohio consumer sales practices act ocspa by filing a lawsuit to collect a purported debt without the means of proving the existence of the debt,the amount of the debt,or that seneca owned the debt.seneca and javitch raised a number of defenses to harvey suit,including the failure to state a claim,the protection provided by the first amendment,and the doctrine.the district court held that harvey allegations failed to state a claim under the fdcpa.it then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over harvey ocspa claim once her federal claim had been dismissed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in january of,javitch filed a complaint for money to collect a debt that harvey allegedly owed seneca.the complaint alleged that harvey owed seneca a total of on two separate accounts.seneca claimed that a lthough due demand has been made,harvey has failed to liquidate the balance due and owing.attached to the complaint were two exhibits that listed the account number,the balance,and the statement closing date for each account.
based on seneca complaint for money,harvey filed suit in january of,alleging violations of both the fdcpa and the ocspa.harvey factual allegations were sparse.she alleged that after being served with the complaint for money,she filed a responsive pleading and sought discovery from seneca and javitch concerning the ownership of debts in question,the origination of those debts,and the amount of those debts.when seneca and javitch refused to provide responses,harvey filed a motion to compel,at which point seneca and javitch dismissed the complaint.she therefore claimed that seneca and javitch filed a lawsuit to collect a purported debt without the means of proving the existence of the debt,the amount of the debt,or that seneca owned the debt.
harvey contended in her complaint that seneca filing of a collection action knowing that it had no documentation to prove the debt constituted a deceptive,unfair,and unconscionable practice.she specifically cited violations of,which prohibits conduct that has the consequence of harassing,oppressing,and abusing a debtor,and,which forbids using deceptive means to collect a debt.
seneca and javitch responded to harvey complaint by filing a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.they argued that a lack of available documentation at the time the complaint for money was filed is not actionable under the fdcpa,the filing of the complaint for money is protected by the common law doctrine of immunity during judicial proceedings,the first amendment,and the doctrine which protects litigants who seek redress of wrongs through judicial proceedings,and the district court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over harvey ocspa claims.seneca and javitch attached to their motion to dismiss the record of their action,which included the docket sheet,the complaint for money,harvey answer to the complaint,harvey request for the production of documents,seneca motion for an extension of time to respond to the production of documents,harvey motion to compel production,and seneca dismissal of the case.
the district court granted seneca and javitch motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and therefore did not reach the merits of their other defenses.it held that seneca and javitch had not engaged in deceptive behavior,and that the filing of a complaint without the supporting documentation in hand did not constitute harassment under the fdcpa.after dismissing harvey fdcpa claims,the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over harvey remaining claim under the ocspa.
on appeal,harvey asserts that,if permitted,she can prove the following facts,which she argues constitute a claim under the fdcpa 
seneca purchases extremely old,defaulted debt in batches of as many as one million accounts at a time,for which it pays pennies on the dollar.
this type of debt is transferred electronically the seller does not provide paperwork which would be considered satisfactory evidence of the debt if submitted to a court.
when printed out,the electronic evidence of the sale consists of one line per debtor containing the debtor name,account number,and alleged indebtedness,without any information about the original contract,the debtor payments,or the assignment or sale of the account.
seneca never obtained from the original debtor,or from an assignee of the original debtor,any payment history or other documentary proof demonstrating the amount of the debt allegedly owed by harvey.the same is true for documentation of the original agreement including the interest rate and for documentation of the chain of ownership of the alleged debt.this is common practice in the industry because of the time and cost of obtaining such documentation.
routinely files collection actions with no more evidence in hand of the debt in question than the single line described above.
the default rate on such lawsuits is at least ninety percent once a default judgment is entered the debtor chances of overturning it are miniscule.thus,in the vast majority of cases,can proceed to garnishment regardless of whether it could have proved its case in disputed litigation.
on the rare occasion when a debtor obtains an attorney and that attorney requests proof of the debt,the amount of the debt seneca ownership of the debt,as happened here,routinely dismisses its collection action.this decision is based upon a analysis which is built into the price of purchasing these debts.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.morrison marsh mclennan,cir.a dismissal of a complaint may be affirmed if it appears that the can prove no set of facts in support of her claim that would entitle her to relief.while reviewing courts construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and accept all factual allegations as true,a court is not required to accept as true unwarranted legal conclusions factual allegations.id.at citations omitted.
harvey complaint 
before we can consider whether harvey complaint survives the defendants motion to dismiss,we must first determine the extent of her allegations.harvey complaint alleges that seneca and javitch filed a complaint for money without the means of proving that harvey actually owed a debt to seneca in the specified amount.because harvey complaint uses imprecise language,we must decide whether harvey intended to allege that seneca and javitch filed the complaint without having on hand at the time of filing the means to prove the complaint,or seneca and javitch filed the complaint without the means of ever being able to obtain sufficient proof of the action.
although reasonable inferences drawn from the allegations must be accepted,bd.of,cir,we need not accept unwarranted factual inferences.perry am.tobacco,cir.a reading of harvey complaint convinces us that she alleged only that,at the time of filing,seneca and javitch did not have the means of proving their claim.this reading of the complaint comports with the district court understanding,which was not challenged by harvey.in addition,harvey clarified her theory of the case in her appellate brief,which states that seneca chooses not to acquire the documentation needed to prove its claims because of the time and cost of obtaining such documentation,not that it is incapable of doing so.the conclusion that seneca and javitch had no means of ever proving their claim would therefore be both an unreasonable extension and a strained reading of harvey allegation that seneca and javitch filed a lawsuit to collect a purported debt without the means of proving the existence of the debt,the amount of the debt,or that seneca owned the debt.
harvey unpled allegations 
we must next consider whether harvey unpled allegations,which she asserts for the first time in her brief on appeal,are properly before us.on appeal,harvey argues that she can prove that seneca and javitch routinely file unsubstantiated suits in the hope of obtaining default judgments.she also contends that,in the event that a debtor contests seneca and javitch action,they will dismiss the suit based on a calculation,which weighs the cost of obtaining proof of their claim against the expected judgment.
these factual allegations first presented by harvey on appeal are significantly different than those contained in harvey complaint.these new allegations assert the elements of improper motive,pattern and practice,and inadequate investigation of the debt before filing the lawsuit.none of the new factual allegations are even vaguely alluded to in harvey complaint.
although a motion to dismiss should be granted only if the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle her to relief,this court should not assume facts that were not pled.see hms property mgmt.group miller,wl at.lexis,at cir,unpublished citing contractors cal.state council of carpenters,d,for the proposition that it is not proper to assume facts that a plaintiff has not plead sic.see also in re delorean motor,cir a complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.the appropriate method for adding new factual allegations to a complaint is not via an appellate brief,but by filing an amended complaint.see sanders barrett.lexis,at,wl at cir,unpublished for the first time on appeal,sanders alleges new facts in an attempt to state a claim against barrett under sanders could have amended his complaint before the district court dismissed his action against barrett,but failed to do so.citations and quotation marks omitted see also.allowing a party leave to amend his or her complaint when justice so requires.
harvey did not seek to amend her complaint to include the factual scenario she now presents on appeal.because she was represented by counsel,she is not entitled to the less stringent pleading standard that applies to pro se litigants.see montgomery huntington bank,cir holding that a pro se complaint must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers quotation marks omitted.
we will therefore disregard the new set of facts alleged for the first time on appeal that harvey argues she can prove at trial.allowing harvey to present a new theory of her case on appeal that was not alleged below would permit her two bites at the apple,a practice that would be very disruptive of orderly trial procedure.see debardeleben cummings,cir holding that a defendant may not breathe new juridical life into a moribund issue by asserting on appeal an entirely new theory of the case,never presented to the district court.we will therefore consider only those facts alleged in her complaint and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts.see,at.
fdcpa claims 
congress enacted the fdcpa in order to eliminate the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors.a.the statute is very broad,and was intended to remedy what it considered to be a widespread problem.frey gangwish,cir.when interpreting the fdcpa,we begin with the language of the statute itself schroyer frankel,cir.
in her complaint,harvey alleges that seneca and javitch violated two provisions of the fdcpa,which prohibits any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass,oppress,or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt,and,which prohibits the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.in determining whether any particular conduct violates the fdcpa,the courts have used an objective test based on the least sophisticated consumer.see smith transworld,cir holding that the contents of a collection letter were not misleading,even under the least sophisticated consumer standard.the district court concluded that harvey had not alleged a violation of either of the fdcpa provisions on which she relies.we agree for the reasons set forth below.
harassment under 
the fdcpa prohibits conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass,oppress,or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt.this provision of the fdcpa lists nonexclusive examples of the type of conduct prohibited by the act as follows 
the use or threat of use of violence or other criminal means to harm the physical person,reputation,or property of any person.
the use of obscene or profane language or language the natural consequence of which is to abuse the hearer or reader.
the publication of a list of consumers who allegedly refuse to pay debts,except to a consumer reporting agency 
the advertisement for sale of any debt to coerce payment of the debt.
causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy,abuse,or harass any person at the called number.
except as provided in uscs,the placement of telephone calls without meaningful disclosure of the caller identity.
the district court dismissed harvey claim under because the filing of a lawsuit is not the kind of conduct that was intended to be covered by section.although nonexhaustive,the examples of oppressive conduct listed in concern tactics intended to embarrass,upset,or frighten a debtor.they are likely to cause the suffering and anguish which occur when a debt collector attempts to collect money which the debtor,through no fault of his own,does not have.montgomery,at citation omitted.these tactics are not comparable to the single filing of a lawsuit.
harvey argues,however,that the question of whether the filing of a lawsuit without adequate proof can constitute harassment should be submitted to a jury.in support,she cites the unpublished case of broadnax greene credit service,wl at.lexis,at cir,which held that a jury could find abusive or dishonest a false accusation and initiation of a criminal complaint alleging that the target debtor had fraudulently negotiated a bad check.broadnax,however,is not a precedentially binding decision and is readily distinguishable from the present case because the debt collector in broadnax filed a false criminal complaint intended to substantially disrupt the debtor life and imperil his liberty in order to coerce him into paying a debt.in contrast,the allegations at issue in the present case do not concern coercion,scare tactics,or fraud,but involve the simple filing of a lawsuit,which is an authorized method of collecting a debt.
cases from other courts of appeals bolster the conclusion that,although the question of whether conduct harasses,oppresses,or abuses will ordinarily be a question for the jury,congress has indicated its desire for the courts to structure the confines of.jeter credit bureau,cir.courts have therefore dismissed claims filed pursuant to as a matter of law if the facts alleged do not have the natural consequence of harassing or abusing a debtor.id.affirming summary judgment for a debt collector because the notice in question did not create a tone of intimidation that the fdcpa proscribes as a matter of law kerr dubowsky,fed.appx,cir unpublished holding that the district court properly dismissed kerr claim because his complaint alleged that dubowsky may call was unwanted but failed to allege facts that it was intended to harass,oppress,or abuse.
even when viewed from the perspective of an unsophisticated consumer,the filing of a lawsuit without the immediate means of proving the debt does not have the natural consequence of harassing,abusing,or oppressing a debtor.any attempt to collect a defaulted debt will be unwanted by a debtor,but employing the court system in the way alleged by harvey can not be said to be an abusive tactic under the fdcpa.see watkins peterson,d,holding that the serving of writs of garnishment that overstated the debt by including costs
