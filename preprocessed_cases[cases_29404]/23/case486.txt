introduction 
the department of the treasury,acting under the direction of congress,launched the home affordable modification program hamp in to help distressed homeowners with delinquent mortgages,but the program seems to have created more litigation than it has happy homeowners.the issue we must decide is whether a bank was contractually required to offer the plaintiffs a permanent mortgage modification after they complied with the requirements of a trial period plan tpp.the district court held the bank was not,and we reverse.
similar issues have arisen in both state and federal courts.we now follow the seventh circuit leading federal appellate decision,which came down after the district court ruling in this case,to hold that the bank was required to offer the modification.see wigod wells fargo bank,cir.the district court should not have dismissed the plaintiffs complaints when the record before it showed that the bank had accepted and retained the payments demanded by the tpp,but neither offered a permanent modification,nor notified plaintiffs they were not entitled to one,as required by the terms of the tpp.
background 
in response to the unfolding financial crisis of,congress passed the emergency economic stabilization act,stat.this law included the troubled asset relief program tarp,which required the secretary of the treasury,among many other duties and powers,to implement a plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners and encourage the servicers of the underlying mortgages to take advantage of available programs to minimize foreclosures.wigod,at quoting a.pursuant to this instruction,the treasury department in started the hamp program to incentivize banks to refinance mortgages of distressed homeowners so they could stay in their homes.home loan servicers,including defendant appellee wells fargo bank,wells fargo,signed servicer participation agreements with treasury that entitled them to for each permanent modification they made,but required them to follow treasury guidelines and procedures.
the process of applying for and receiving a permanent modification plays out in several steps,as set forth in treasury supplemental directive sd,the controlling treasury guideline during the events leading to this suit.first,borrowers supply information about their finances and their inability to pay their current mortgage to the servicer,and the servicer must evaluate whether the borrowers qualify for a loan modification.sd.the servicer computes modified mortgage payments on the basis of the borrowers information.id.
for borrowers who appear eligible to participate in hamp,the servicer then prepares a tpp.the tpp requires borrowers to submit documentation to confirm the accuracy of their initial financial representations,and to make trial payments of the modified amount to the servicer.the servicer must use the documentation to confirm that the borrower s meet the eligibility criteria for a permanent modification.id.
in the step most critical to this litigation,the servicer then must report to the borrowers the results of the eligibility determinations.id.if a borrower does not qualify for the hamp program,the servicer must not only alert the borrower,but must consider alternatives.the servicer should promptly communicate that ineligibility determination to the borrower in writing and consider the borrower for another foreclosure prevention alternative.id.for borrowers who have made all their payments and whose representations remain accurate,the servicer must offer a permanent home loan modification.id.
wells fargo never offered plaintiffs phillip corvello and karen and jeffrey lucia a modification.they filed separate actions against wells fargo,and their cases were consolidated.their situations differ factually in that corvello dealings with wells fargo were in writing,while the lucias dealt with the bank by phone.they both contend that they reached agreements with wells fargo whereby wells fargo was required to offer them permanent mortgage modifications if they complied with the requirements of their trial plans,including proving their eligibility for the permanent modification and making the trial payments.if they did not qualify for the modification,their agreements required wells fargo to alert them immediately and end the period of trial payments.they allege that they complied with their trial plans and made the required payments,and should have been offered permanent modifications.
the district court dismissed both actions under rule b,so we accept the allegations of the complaints as true.kahle gonzales,cir.according to corvello complaint,he provided wells fargo with his financial information via a financial worksheet in june of.wells fargo then sent him a tpp.the tpp stated in the first line that if corvello representations were accurate and he complied with the terms of the trial plan,he would receive a modification offer.the tpp also,and on the same page,assured him,as it was required to do by the applicable treasury directive,that the bank would tell him one way or another on his eligibility for a modification.it read 
if i am in compliance with this loan trial period and my representations in section continue to be true in all material respects,then the lender will provide me with a loan modification agreement,as set forth in section,that would amend and supplement the mortgage on the property,and the note secured by the mortgage i understand that after i sign and return two copies of this plan to the lender,the lender will send me a signed copy of this plan if i qualify for the offer or will send me written notice that i do not qualify for the offer.
paragraph of the tpp alerted the borrower to the obligations of the parties before there could be a permanent modification.it required,in addition to the borrower making the payments and maintaining the accuracy of the representations,that the servicer provide an executed copy of the tpp and modification agreement to the borrower.it stated as follows 
if prior to the modification effective date,i the lender does not provide me a fully executed copy of this plan and the modification agreement ii i have not made the trial period payments required under section of this plan or iii the lender determines that my representations in section are no longer true and correct,the loan documents will not be modified and this plan will terminate.
paragraph of the tpp stated that no modification would take effect until the borrower received a signed copy of the modification agreement.it read as follows 
i understand that the plan is not a modification of the loan documents and that the loan documents will not be modified unless and until i i meet all of the conditions required for modification,ii i receive a fully executed copy of a modification agreement,and iii the modification effective date has passed 
after corvello signed and returned the tpp,and despite the notification representation on the first page of the tpp,wells fargo,according to the complaint,never told corvello whether he qualified for a modification.corvello alleges he complied with the tpp terms,and made all three payments on time.wells fargo still never offered him a permanent modification,nor did it notify him that he did not qualify.he seeks the permanent modification offer allegedly due him under the tpp agreement,and damages for the payments he made to wells fargo.
the lucias interaction with wells fargo was materially similar to corvello experience.they allege that wells fargo offered them a trial plan,with the promise of a permanent modification if they fully complied.they made all of the required payments and submitted the documents requested by wells fargo.despite performance of their obligations under the tpp,they,like corvello,claim wells fargo neither offered them a permanent modification,nor alerted them that they were ineligible for a modification.instead,wells fargo foreclosed on their home and sold it.their complaint seeks rescission of the foreclosure,an offer of permanent modification,and damages.
the plaintiffs filed their complaints in united states district court for the northern district of cal
