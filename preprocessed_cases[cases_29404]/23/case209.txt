in,a number of car dealerships owned and controlled by john koons,filed bankruptcy petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the consolidated proceedings were subsequently converted to a chapter case with richard hall serving as trustee.id hall commenced an adversary proceeding against chrysler credit to recover alleged preference payments made to chrysler credit by three of the,koons chrysler plymouth,koons,brandnewco,and jkj chrysler plymouth,jkj cp,prior to the filing of those dealerships chapter petitions.id.the bankruptcy court held that the trustee was entitled to recover the payments from jkj cp but not from koons or brandnewco.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment as to the koons and the brandnewco payments.the district court initially decided to remand the dispute pertaining to the jkj cp payments,but ultimately certified that issue for interlocutory appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the judgment of the district court as to the koons and brandnewco payments,and we remand the entire case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the disputed payments in the instant case arose from a floor plan financing arrangement between chrysler credit and the.as the bankruptcy court explained,the chrysler credit floor plan agreement operated in the following way 
as vehicles were shipped to the dealerships,chrysler credit paid the manufacturer for them and added the cost of those vehicles to the dealerships line of credit.the purchased vehicles became additional collateral.interest accrued on each vehicle until chrysler was repaid the principal.repayment was due five days after a vehicle was sold,and a dealership received purchase funds a dealership could continue to add vehicles to its inventory as long as it did not reach the maximum amount of its loan and was not in default.as chrysler received payment for each vehicle the loan amount was reduced,which made room for additional inventory.under this arrangement,the collateral security and the loan balance were constantly moving up and down as vehicles were added to inventory and sold.
in the ninety days preceding the koons and brandnewco bankruptcies,chrysler credit was paid by those dealerships pursuant to the floor plan financing agreement.the trustee sought to avoid those payments under b,which provides as follows 
except as provided in subsection c of this section,the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made 
made while the debtor was insolvent 
a on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition 
that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
b emphasis added.section g provides that the trustee has the burden of proving the avoidability of a transfer under subsection b.the parties agreed that the payments in question satisfied the first four elements of section b,confining their dispute to whether the trustee had established that the payments satisfied the requirements of b.
chrysler credit maintained that the disputed payments did not exceed what it would have received in a chapter proceeding because the funds that formed the basis of those payments were proceeds from the sale of vehicles and,as such,under virginia law adopting the uniform commercial code,chrysler credit acquired a security interest in those proceeds.see ann.repealed a security interest continues in any identifiable proceeds from the sale of collateral under chrysler credit view,if the disputed payments had not been made,it would have retained that security interest and received priority in that amount in any chapter proceeding in other words,according to chrysler credit,its security interest at the time of the preference payments was the same as it would have been in a chapter proceeding and thus the amount of the preference payments did not exceed what it would have received in a chapter proceeding.
the trustee,on the other hand,maintained that chrysler received more from the preference payments than it would have for its undersecured claims in a chapter proceeding.the trustee alleged that the payments to chrysler credit came from bank accounts where the proceeds from vehicle sales had been commingled with other funds and that,as such,under virginia law,chrysler credit could not establish a perfected security interest in the funds unless it could trace the payments it received from koons and brandnewco to the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles.see ann.repealed a security interest continues in any identifiable proceeds emphasis added.under this theory,because chrysler credit could not establish that it did,in fact,have a perfected security interest in the commingled funds,chrysler credit would have received far less in a chapter proceeding than it received from the payments.
the bankruptcy court determined that the proceeds had been commingled,and that chrysler credit would normally bear the burden of tracing to establish a perfected security interest in the commingled proceeds under the ucc and other state law.the bankruptcy court concluded,however,that section g supplanted the state law burden of proof,expressly placing it on the trustee,and that the trustee had failed to satisfy that burden because he could not establish that the funds that formed the basis of the preference payments were not proceeds from the sale of collateral.because the trustee could not disprove the existence of chrysler credit security interest,he could not establish that chrysler credit would have received less in a chapter proceeding.id.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment.tracing is a method for the trustee to carry its burden by tracing the funds,the trustee may show that the transfers did not come from the secured creditor collateral in the commingled account.the bankruptcy court correctly held that the trustee failed to carry this burden.
the parties and the lower courts are correct that section b calls for a comparison between the amount that chrysler credit received in alleged preference payments and the perfected security interest that it would have enjoyed in a chapter proceeding.see hager gibson,cir section b protects only those creditors,secure or unsecured,who can establish that they received no more by the payment than they would have received as claimants in a chapter liquidation.the parties and lower courts are also correct that state law determines the extent of the perfected security interest that chrysler credit would enjoy in a chapter proceeding.see butner united states,d holding that u nless some federal interest requires a different result,property interests in bankruptcy proceedings are created and defined by state law.in re the wallace gale,cir.but both the parties and lower courts are incorrect in asserting that the tracing principles that would have determined chrysler credit perfected security interest at the time of the preference payments are relevant to the trustee claims.section b is not concerned with whether the preference payments can be traced to the proceeds of collateral rather that section calls for a comparison of the amount of the preference payments to the amount the creditor would receive in a hypothetical chapter proceeding.and,more importantly,a secured creditor perfected security interest in commingled proceeds is calculated differently in an insolvency proceeding,such as a case under chapter,than it is before the instigation of insolvency proceedings,such as at the time of the preference payments.thus,the amount chrysler credit would have received in a chapter proceeding can not be determined by reference to any security interest chrysler credit might have enjoyed at the time of the preference payments.
in a chapter proceeding,hypothetical or otherwise,the determination of chrysler credit security interest in proceeds from the sal
