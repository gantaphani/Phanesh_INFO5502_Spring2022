james hayes,the lead in this case,received a payday loan from a lender called western sky financial,llc.delbert services corporation later became the servicing agent for hayes loan.because delbert debt collection practices allegedly violated federal law,hayes initiated a putative class action against delbert.claiming that hayes and his fellow plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate any disputes related to their loans,delbert moved to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa.the district court granted delbert motion.
we both respect and appreciate the support of congress and the supreme court for an arbitration procedure that reduces the costs and delays of civil litigation.our review of the record leads us to conclude,however,that the arbitration agreement in this case is unenforceable.the agreement purportedly fashions a system of alternative dispute resolution while simultaneously rendering that system all but impotent through a categorical rejection of the requirements of state and federal law.the faa does not protect the sort of arbitration agreement that unambiguously forbids an arbitrator from even applying the applicable law.we therefore reverse the district court order compelling arbitration and remand for further proceedings.
this case originates with the lending practices of western sky.western sky was an online lender owned by martin webb.webb was a member of the cheyenne river sioux tribe,and western sky offices were located on the cheyenne river indian reservation in south dakota.from its base on the reservation,western sky issued payday loans to consumers across the country.
hayes loan typifies western sky lending scheme.western sky issued hayes a loan,of which consisted of an origination fee.hayes thus received in cash.western sky charged interest on the at an annual rate of.this rate compelled hayes to make monthly payments of over the life of the loan.all told,hayes was set to pay for his.the other named plaintiffs in this case received loans with terms that were just as bad or worse one of the loans came with an annual interest rate of.
no one appears to seriously dispute that western sky payday loans violated a host of state and federal lending laws.indeed,a quick glance at western sky loan agreement suggests that western sky was keenly aware of the dubious nature of its trade.the agreement provides that it is subject solely to the exclusive laws and jurisdiction of the cheyenne river sioux tribe.emphasis in original.it later states that no other state or federal law or regulation shall apply to this loan agreement.
despite western sky best efforts,the law or at least the threat of the law caught up with it.a stream of private litigation and public enforcement actions seems to have led western sky to stop issuing new loans in.
unfortunately,however,the financial and legal problems wrought by western sky persisted.after issuing a loan,western sky practice was to transfer the loan to an assortment of allied servicing and collection firms.in this case,western sky transferred hayes loan to ws funding,llc,which then named its corporate parent,cashcall,as the servicing agent.sometime later,ws funding transferred hayes loan to an entity called consumer loan trust,which in turn named delbert as the servicing agent.the loans issued to the other named plaintiffs in this case followed a similar path.while western sky was owned by a tribal member,delbert claimed no tribal ownership or affiliation.
delbert operation raised questions of its own.the plaintiffs claim that delbert sent them collection notices without disclosing its identity as a debt collector or the identity of the actual creditor.they also allege that delbert used an automatic dialing system to make several calls a week and sometimes multiple calls a day to their homes.
hayes filed a putative class action in the eastern district of virginia to obtain relief from delbert allegedly unlawful collection practices.specifically,hayes claimed that delbert notices and phone calls violated the fair debt collection practices act,and the telephone consumer protection act.hayes also sought declaratory relief to the effect that the loan agreement forum selection and arbitration provisions were unenforceable.
the loan agreement contains a number of notable provisions.most pertinent to this case,the agreement names a tribal forum and then purports to disavow the authority of all state or federal law.as noted above,the agreement provides 
this loan agreement is subject solely to the exclusive laws and jurisdiction of the cheyenne river sioux tribe,cheyenne river indian reservation.by executing this loan agreement,you,the borrower,hereby acknowledge and consent to be bound to the terms of this loan agreement,consent to the sole subject matter and personal jurisdiction of the cheyenne river sioux tribal court,and that no other state or federal law or regulation shall apply to this loan agreement,its enforcement or interpretation.emphasis in original.
another section confirms the disavowal of state and federal law.that section,titled governing law,states in pertinent part 
neither this agreement nor lender is subject to the laws of any state of the united states of america.by executing this agreement,you hereby expressly agree that this agreement is executed and performed solely within the exterior boundaries of the cheyenne river indian reservation,a sovereign native american tribal nation.you also expressly agree that this agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance only with the provisions of the laws of the cheyenne river sioux tribe,and that no united states state or federal law applies to this agreement.
much of the rest of the loan document concerns the arbitration agreement between western sky,the loan servicer,and the borrowers.the main provision of that agreement states that any dispute the borrower ha s with western sky or anyone else under this loan agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.another provision says that the arbitration will be conducted by the cheyenne river sioux tribal nation by an authorized representative in accordance with its consumer dispute rules and the terms of this agreement.moreover,the arbitration agreement states that it covers any claim based upon marketing or solicitations to obtain the loan and the handling or servicing of the borrower account whether such dispute is based on a tribal,federal or state constitution,statute,ordinance,regulation,or common law,and including any issue concerning the validity,enforceability,or scope of this loan or the arbitration agreement.
other provisions of the arbitration agreement mirror portions of the underlying loan agreement in that they purport to disavow the application of all state and federal law.one provision states that the agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving the indian commerce clause of the constitution of the united states of america,and shall be governed by the law of the cheyenne river sioux tribe.the arbitrator will apply the laws of the cheyenne river sioux tribal nation and the terms of this agreement.another provision of the arbitration agreement confirms that the arbitrator will not apply any law other than the law of the cheyenne river sioux tribe of indians to this agreement.
a final noteworthy provision of the arbitration agreement says that the borrower shall have the right to select the american arbitration association aaa,judicial arbitration and mediation services jams,or another organization to administer the arbitration.this provision was not present in earlier versions of the western sky arbitration agreement.and although there is some dispute on this point,appellant br.at,it seems as if the provision was added by western sky to compensate for the fact that the tribal arbitration mechanism set out in the agreement proved in practice to be illusory.
relying on these various terms,delbert filed a motion to dismiss,claiming that the loan agreement forum selection clause along with the doctrine of tribal exhaustion barred hayes and the other plaintiffs from suing delbert in federal court.delbert argued as well that the loan agreement arbitration provisions required arbitration of the dispute.
the district court ruled that delbert could not enforce the loan agreement forum selection clause,and that the doctrine of tribal exhaustion did not apply to the parties controversy.but the district court agreed with delbert that it could enforce the arbitration agreement.the court acknowledged that the tribal arbitration mechanism established by the arbitration agreement had proved problematic,and that other courts involved in western litigation had accordingly voided the arbitration agreement.the court then noted,however,that the agreements in those cases did not allow the parties to choose arbitrators and dispute rules other than those provided by the tribe.in contrast,the parties in this case had recourse to arbitration organizations,including aaa and jams,and this save d the arbitration agreement from meeting the same fate as the earlier western sky agreement.the district court thus issued an order compelling arbitration.
hayes and the other plaintiffs appeal the order compelling arbitration.delbert conditionally appeals the orders declining to enforce the forum selection clause and denying the applicability of tribal exhaustion.on appeal,and certainly at oral argument,the parties focused heavily on the issue of the dispute arbitrability,and we too now address this central question.
we review de novo a district court order compelling arbitration under the faa.seney rent a center,cir.in undertaking this review,we remain cognizant of the strong federal policy in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements.dean witter reynolds,byrd,d.
the faa confers near plenary authority on an arbitrator to resolve a dispute given to him by an arbitration agreement.for this authority to be validly exercised,however,any agreement purporting to give a dispute over to arbitration must itself be valid.the validity of an arbitration agreement is a question of arbitrability and,in the normal course,it is undeniably an issue for judicial determination.peabody holding united mine workers of,int l union,cir quoting at t,commc ns workers of,d 
the specific statutory basis for our review comes from the faa second section,which says that an agreement to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.importantly,any grounds given for revocation must concern the validity of the arbitration agreement in particular,not simply the validity of the underlying contract as a whole.rent a,at citing prima paint flood conklin,d.hayes and his raise several related challenges to the arbitration agreement.
the first challenge involves a bit of history.the plaintiffs claim that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it sets up a hollow arbitral mechanism.they note that the agreement provides that arbitration shall be conducted by the cheyenne river sioux tribal nation by an authorized representative in accordance with its consumer dispute rules.other courts reviewing a western sky arbitration agreement very similar to the one in this case have determined that,a lthough th is contract language contemplates a process conducted under the watchful eye of a legitimate governing tribal body,a proceeding subject to such oversight simply is not a possibility.jackson payday financial,llc,cir,cert.denied,d.the plaintiffs here take up this line of argument.
specifically,the plaintiffs claim that the tribe has no authorized representatives who conduct arbitrations,and that the tribe does not even possess a method through which it might select and appoint such a person.in fact,one official from the tribe has acknowledged that the tribal governing authority does not authorize arbitration and the tribal court does not involve itself in the hiring of an arbitrator.id.at quoting letters from tribal magistrate mona demery.delbert does not appear to contest these points.indeed,in other litigation involving another western sky arbitration agreement,cashcall,one of western sky allied firms,as noted above acknowledge d that the arbitral forum and associated procedural rules set forth in the plaintiff loan agreement are not available.williams cashcall,d,appeal docketed,cir.
the plaintiffs are quick to point out,moreover,that in at least one western sky dispute that made it to arbitration,the appointed arbitrator was a chasing hawk.but chasing hawk later admitted that western sky owner had asked him to arbitrate the dispute.inetianbor cashcall,d.evidence in that litigation was also put forward suggesting that chasing hawk daughter worked for western sky.id.at.
hayes and his argue that the problems stemming from the lack of a reputable arbitrator or arbitral appointment authority are compounded by the total absence of the consumer dispute rules contemplated by the arbitration agreement.the plaintiffs note that several federal courts have found that the rules alluded to by the agreement do not exist.inetianbor cashcall,cir,cert.denied,d see also heldt payday,llc,d.according to the plaintiffs,these grave infirmities in the arbitral mechanism collectively render the arbitration agreement a sham from stem to stern,jackson,at,and thus unenforceable.
delbert counters by pointing out that the bulk of the plaintiffs arguments and the court decisions accepting those arguments are based on an older version of the western sky arbitration agreement,one that is materially different from the agreement entered into by hayes and the other plaintiffs in this case.and that material difference is the provision allowing the borrower to select either aaa or jams both well respected arbitral organizations to administer the arbitration.according to delbert,this addition to the agreement resolves the problems resulting from the tribe lack of a valid arbitrator appointment process and consumer dispute rules.by working within the aaa or jams systems,a potential claimant would avoid the problems associated with the arbitral mechanism set out in earlier versions of the agreement.as noted above,the district court ultimately agreed with delbert on this point,and ordered arbitration on that basis.
the plaintiffs respond in turn that the simple addition of the aaa or jams provision can not save the agreement.it is,they say,beyond patching up.chief among the plaintiffs arguments is that the aaa or jams provision merely allows aaa or jams to administer the arbitration,not actually conduct it.therefore,according to the plaintiffs reading of the agreement,some unknown authorized representative of the tribe still must conduct the arbitration,and that person may rely on aaa or jams rules only to the extent that those rules and procedures do not contradict either the law of the cheyenne river sioux tribe or the express terms of this agreement to arbitrate.
needless to say,how one might reconcile the lately added aaa or jams provision with the rest of the arbitration agreement presents a conundrum.heldt,d at.it is not immediately clear,for instance,whether an aaa or arbitrator would still need to be an authorized representative of the tribe,or when and how the tribe law or the various convoluted provisions in the agreement would override the aaa or jams default rules.
but institutions like aaa and jams excel at solving these sorts of conundrums,and once the court finds that the parties agreed to assign their dispute to arbitration,it typically is for the arbitral authority to sort out both the major and minor details of how the arbitration will proceed.it is likely for this reason that the faa largely leaves judicial review of questions concerning the basic fairness and function of an arbitral mechanism for the award enforcement stage.see hooters of,phillips,cir.nevertheless,given the present agreement outright rejection of the application of federal law to resolve the plaintiffs federal claims,which we discuss below,we need not consider whether the agreement is invalid on the separate basis that the dispute resolution mechanism it establishes has inconsistencies that are apparently contradictory in substance.
