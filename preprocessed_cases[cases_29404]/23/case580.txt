appellant torrence james pled guilty to one count of wire fraud and aiding and abetting,in violation of and,was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment and three years supervised release,and was ordered to pay in restitution,both jointly and severally with two other.james appeals the district court order of restitution,contending it erred because the amount is unsupported by the evidence and greater than the actual losses to all three victim mortgage holders at issue.for relief,he asks this court to remand his case to the district court to enter a corrected restitution order.in response,the government concedes the district court order of restitution exceeds the actual losses sustained by mortgageit and specialized loan of the three victim mortgage holders.however,it disputes james proposed calculation as to the amount of restitution owed to them and to the other mortgage holder,freedom mortgage.it asks this court to remand with instructions for the district court to modify its restitution order regarding the amount of loss attributable to two of the mortgage holders based on what it asserts are the correct calculations and affirm the district court restitution order as to the amount attributable to the third victim mortgage holder,freedom mortgage.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and remand,in part,and affirm,in part,the district court restitution order.
background 
for the purposes of this appeal,we find it unnecessary to recount in full detail the interstate wire fraud transfer scheme involved in the count charged,other than to provide first a general account of the scheme and then some of the relevant undisputed facts underlying that scheme and the parties arguments concerning calculation of the actual losses attributable to each victim mortgage holder and the proper restitution to be awarded.
in short,in late,james and others arranged for and facilitated tremayne miller purchase of three homes using the name and identification of an individual whose identity had been stolen.after miller obtained loans for the purchase of those homes from three lenders by using materially false and fraudulent information,he received money from those lenders for improvements to the properties which were never made and then failed to pay on the loans,causing the foreclosure of those properties at a financial loss to the mortgage holders.
more specifically,miller purchased three homes in colorado,located at stardance circle,in longmont stardance property emerson street,in denver emerson property and stay sail drive,in windsor stay sail property.the stardance property was purchased on november,with a loan from mortgageit in the amount of.similarly,the emerson property was purchased on november,with a loan from first magnus financial in the amount of.finally,the stay sail property was purchased on december,with a loan from freedom mortgage in the amount of.in each instance,the lenders disbursed funds using interstate wire transfers.because the loans covered one hundred percent of the purchase price,each lender was required to separate the loan amount into first and second mortgages,and,therefore,each property was financed with two separate loans from each of the lenders.after closing on each property,the original mortgage lenders either sold one or both first and second mortgages to another entity,as follows 
as part of the scheme to defraud,miller convinced the property sellers to kick back a portion of the selling price or loan money to him to ostensibly cover needed repairs on the property.these funds were disbursed at closing by the original lenders and,in two instances,the funds were distributed to a shell corporation set up by james called t t contractors.in the third instance,for the emerson property,the money was funneled to another account,under another name.the kickbacks to the defendants on the properties totaled,and none of that money was ever used for improvements,nor were the properties ever occupied.eventually,after no payments were made on the loans,the mortgage holders foreclosed on the properties and sold those properties at foreclosure sales for less than the loan amounts due.
following james arrest and indictment,he pled guilty to one count of wire fraud and aiding and abetting,in violation of and,regarding the bank loan and kick back scheme involved with the purchase of the three homes.pursuant to the plea agreement,james agreed to pay restitution to the victim mortgage holders in amounts to be determined by the time of sentencing,vol,doc.at.at the plea hearing,the parties and the district court confirmed that no restitution amount had yet been determined and no agreement as to the amount of restitution was reached.
following james guilty plea,a probation officer prepared a presentence report calculating his sentence under the applicable united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines.the probation officer calculated james base offense level at seven under a.the probation officer then applied a upward adjustment under b h because the loss attributable to the defendant was more than but less than.to arrive at this figure,the probation officer subtracted the total amount of resale of the properties after foreclosure from the total amount financed through loans to miller,and then deducted all identified interest,fees,penalties,and liquidation expenses,for a total loss amount of.the following chart breaks down information provided in the presentence report 
after applying a increase in the offense level for use of fraudulent identification and a decrease for acceptance of responsibility,the probation officer calculated the total offense level at twenty,which,together with james criminal history category of iii,resulted in a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.however,pursuant to an agreement between the parties,they requested a downward variant sentence based,in part,on the lengthy sentence james received in another case accordingly,the district court ultimately imposed a term of imprisonment.
in recommending the amount of restitution,the probation officer determined the actual losses due to foreclosure sales in the amount of was an inappropriate method for calculating the amount of restitution due under because not all of the lenders had retained the original mortgages and,therefore,did not suffer any actual loss,and some of the subsequent mortgage holders could not be identified.according to the probation officer,the only confirmed,reported losses for the purpose of restitution involved only three of the victim mortgage,specialized loan servicing,and freedom submitted loss statements.the probation officer calculated the losses they sustained as follows 
as shown,the recommended restitution amount,as estimated by the probation officer,was.because no information could be obtained as to losses by the mortgage holders retaining the mortgages on the emerson property,no restitution was awarded regarding that loan and it is not at issue on appeal.
james objected to the presentence report concerning the recommended amount of restitution,generally claiming he did not know if the claimed losses were accurate for the purpose of calculating the amount of loss or restitution.nevertheless,at sentencing,james attorney ultimately agreed with the recommended restitution amount by stating,s o the basic way the probation officer addressed this is i think appropriate,vol.at.at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing,the district court ordered james to pay the amount of restitution recommended by the probation officer in the amount of 
ii.discussion 
on appeal,james claims the district court erred because the amount of restitution is unsupported by the evidence and greater than the three identified mortgage holders actual losses.to the extent he did not object to the amount of restitution at sentencing but instead acquiesced,he acknowledges our review is for plain error,with which the government agrees.the government also submits that certain discrepancies in the awarded restitution occurred which constitute an extraordinary circumstance seriously affecting james substantial rights and the fairness and integrity of portions of the court restitution order,requiring remand for correction.as a result,we begin with a discussion of our standard of review.
generally,w e review the district court application of the mandatory victims restitution act de novo,review its factual findings for clear error and review the amount of restitution awarded for abuse of discretion.united states gallant,cir,cert.denied,d,wl.however,in this case,the parties agree james did not object to the calculation or amount of the restitution awarded at sentencing so that plain error review is appropriate for reviewing the restitution awarded.see united states smith,cir.accordingly,we apply plain error review to james claims.for james to prevail on his plain error argument regarding the amount of restitution,he must show clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights,and that seriously affected the integrity of the judicial proceedings.united states johnson,cir quoting united states hatatley,cir.we have held a district court may not order restitution in an amount that exceeds the actual loss caused by the defendant conduct,which would amount to an illegal sentence constituting plain error.see smith,at.
applying our plain error review,we address james claims broken down by property,as follows 
stardance property 
offset claim regarding first mortgage on stardance property 
james points out that while mortgageit sold the first mortgage on the stardance property to another unidentified entity for,the probation officer failed to reduce its restitution award amount for the second mortgage the one mortgageit retained with the profit it made from the sale of the first mortgage.as a result,he claims the amount of restitution awarded to mortgageit on the second mortgage should be reduced or offset by any profit it made on its sale of the first mortgage.the government disagrees,noting that despite its and the probation officer best efforts,no documentation on the first mortgage transaction was available,and,therefore,the district court properly did not engage in speculation by offsetting profits from the sale of that mortgage.because james raises the same claim with respect to the stay sail property,we will address this issue later in our discussion.
claim regarding second mortgage on stardance property 
james contends,and the government agrees,mortgageit was improperly awarded more in restitution than it should have been awarded on the second mortgage for the stardance property.in arriving at this figure,the parties agree the second mortgage on the property in the amount of was sold to citibank and then subsequently repurchased by mortgageit from citibank for.while mortgageit claimed a loss of the amount of from citibank,james suggests his fraudulent conduct had nothing to do with the fact mortgageit later repurchased the loan from citibank at a higher amount than the initial loan amount.as a result,he claims the amount of restitution should be the original second mortgage loan amount of,which is less than the amount claimed as a loss by mortgageit and applied by the probation officer and the district court.the government agrees the loss to mortgageit was inexplicably determined to be greater than the amount of the second mortgage loan.ape.br.at.as the parties both agree,the amount awarded exceeds the loss caused by the defendant conduct and,therefore,amounts to an illegal sentence.see smith,at.as a result,we conclude plain error occurred warranting remand of this portion of the restitution award to the district court with instructions to reduce the restitution amount to mortgageit by.id.
stay sail property 
claim regarding first mortgage on stay sail property 
james contends,and the government agrees,the probation officer incorrectly calculated the restitution amount awarded to specialized loan servicing,the first mortgage holder on the stay sail property.they disagree,however,on whether the corrected restitution award should be calculated by applying the actual foreclosure sale amount on that property,at,or the assessed value of that property,at.specifically,the government agrees with james that when calculating the loss to specialized loan servicing the probation officer erred in relying on that mortgage holder stated loss calculations,which included an inaccurate foreclosure sale price of,rather than the correct foreclosure sale price of.as james explains,the probation officer subtracted the lender inaccurate foreclosure sale amount of from the original first mortgage loan amount of,for a recommended actual loss to specialized loan servicing of.both james and the government agree that if the correct foreclosure sale amount of had been deducted from the original first mortgage loan amount of,it would have resulted in an actual loss of,rather than the loss of.thus,james claims that,at a minimum,the restitution amount should be reduced from to difference of.the government agrees this is the amount by which the restitution award should be reduced in regard to the stay sail property.
however,james alternatively suggests the loss to specialized loan servicing should not be calculated based on the foreclosure sale price of but should be calculated using the assessed value of the home,which the larimer county assessor office valued at weeks after the foreclosure sale on the property.james makes this claim,even though he acknowledges the probation officer used the foreclosure sale price to determine the other mortgage holders losses,rather than the assessed value.by applying the assessed value,james asserts the amount of restitution should be the difference between the original first mortgage loan amount of and the assessed value of,for an actual loss of only.thus,james is alternatively claiming the restitution award should be reduced from to difference of.in support,he states the assessed value of the stay sail property is a better measure of the value of the property returned to the mortgage holder under b b ii,which requires the court to reduce the restitution award by the amount of the value of any part of the property returned to the victim.james also asserts that under cmt.c i and our decision in united states messner,cir,loss is ordinarily calculated based on fair market value.
the government disagrees,arguing assessor valuations of real estate for tax purposes are typically based on sales prices of similar properties within a specified time period and are therefore somewhat historical in nature and lag behind price changes in a rapidly changing market.as a result,it claims no better measure exists as to what a victim actual loss is after foreclosure than the sale to a ready,willing,and able buyer in an arm length transaction.
as the parties agree,the district court erred in applying an inaccurate foreclosure sale amount in calculating the amount of restitution awarded to specialized loan servicing,thereby warranting plain error sufficient to remand the restitution award to the district court for entry of a corrected restitution amount.the issue now before us is whether the district court should continue to apply the foreclosure sale amount as corrected in calculating the amount of restitution,or,as james claims,it should be directed to apply the fair market value in calculating the restitution amount to be awarded to specialized loan servicing.in addressing this issue,we are guided by our and other case law,as well as the language in and.
under the mvra,when an offense involves a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,restitution may be ordered for any victim directly harmed by the defendant conduct.see a.title,states,in part 
the order of restitution shall require that such defendant 
in the case of an offense resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense 
a return the property to the owner of the property or 
b if return of the property is impossible,impracticable,or inadequate,pay an amount equal to 
i the greater of 
i the value of the property on the date of the damage,loss,or destruction or 
ii the value of the property on the date of sentencing,less 
ii the value as of the date the property is returned of any part of the property that is returned
