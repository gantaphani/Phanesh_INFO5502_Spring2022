the primary issue in this appeal is the proper test for determining whether a party has prudential standing to bring a false advertising claim under a of the lanham act,a.phoenix of broward,phoenix appeals the district court dismissal of its false advertising claim against mcdonald corporation mcdonald for lack of prudential standing.for the reasons that follow,we adopt the test for prudential standing set forth in conte.automotive,quaker,cir,and affirm the district court dismissal.
background 
burger king corporation burger king owns,operates,and franchises fast food restaurants throughout the world.today,there are approximately burger king restaurants worldwide.appellant phoenix is a licensed burger king franchisee that owns and operates a burger king franchise in fort lauderdale,florida.mcdonald,like burger king,owns,operates,and franchises fast food restaurants throughout the world,and there are approximately mcdonald restaurants worldwide.as competitors in the fast food industry,both mcdonald and burger king have employed a variety of marketing and promotional strategies to attract customers,generate sales,and ensure customer loyalty.
from to august,mcdonald offered customers the opportunity to participate in various promotional games such as monopoly games at mcdonald,the deluxe monopoly game,who wants to be a millionaire,and hatch,match and win.each of the promotional games featured,and prizes.the prizes included cash awards and food and beverage items,while the prizes included automobiles and cash awards of up to million dollars.in general,customers could win the million grand prize in one of two obtaining one of the rare million,game pieces or by collecting and matching a combination of certain other game pieces.
mcdonald conducted an extensive advertising and marketing campaign for each of the games it offered.in these advertisements,mcdonald represented that all customers who participated in the games had a fair and equal opportunity to win the offered prizes.the advertisements also represented the specific odds of winning certain prizes,including the prizes.
in approximately april,the federal bureau of investigation fbi began investigating the promotional games.while the games were still underway,the fbi informed mcdonald that there were problems with the random distribution of its game pieces.in spite of this alleged knowledge,mcdonald continued to advertise that customers had a fair and equal opportunity to win the offered prizes,including the prizes.
on august,the united states department of justice doj and the fbi announced that between and august,certain of mcdonald promotional games had been compromised by a criminal ring led by an employee of simon marketing,simon,the company mcdonald engaged to operate the promotional games.from approximately to august,simon director of security,jerome jacobson,diverted at least million in prizes by embezzling winning,game pieces and distributing them to a network of winners who claimed or recruited others to claim the prizes from mcdonald.the doj and fbi announced that eight individuals,including jacobson,had been arrested in connection with the scheme.in announcing the arrests,the attorney general stated that the fraud scheme denied mcdonald customers a fair and equal chance of winning.in a corporate press release issued after the arrests,mcdonald chairman and chief executive officer described the scheme as a highly sophisticated inside game of fraud and deception.
on or about april,jacobson pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and mail fraud.approximately other persons either pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with the conspiracy.
following the disclosure of the scheme,mcdonald created an independent task force to review all of its promotional practices,and it introduced additional security procedures to ensure the integrity of future promotional games.nonetheless,consumers throughout the filed several class actions against mcdonald,alleging consumer fraud,negligence,and unjust enrichment.on april,mcdonald settled these class actions by,inter alia,agreeing to implement a million instant giveaway,providing class members and the general public an opportunity to win fifteen million prizes.
on february,phoenix filed the instant action against mcdonald on behalf of itself and all similarly situated burger king franchisees a proposed class of approximately franchisees,alleging false advertising in violation of a of the lanham act.specifically,phoenix alleged that mcdonald misrepresented that each player in its promotional games had a fair and equal chance of winning prizes and misrepresented the specific odds of winning prizes.according to phoenix,mcdonald promotional games were rigged from approximately,those games lured customers away from burger king and yielded an unnatural spike in profits for mcdonald,the prizes including the million prizes were diverted from mcdonald customers,and the advertising campaigns that touted million dollar prizes were literally false.phoenix also alleged that after learning that the games had been compromised,mcdonald knowingly and deliberately continued to advertise the games as though customers had a fair and equal chance of winning.
mcdonald moved to dismiss phoenix complaint on the grounds that phoenix lacked prudential standing under the lanham act and,in the alternative,that jacobson theft was an intervening cause of phoenix alleged injury.on august,the district court issued a written order granting mcdonald motion and dismissing the action with prejudice.noting that the eleventh circuit had not addressed the appropriate standard for determining whether a plaintiff has prudential standing to bring a false advertising claim under a of the lanham act,the district court surveyed the case law of other circuits and adopted the test set forth by the third circuit in conte,at,finding that test to be more persuasive than the categorical approach adopted by several other circuits.applying the conte test,the district court concluded that phoenix did not have prudential standing to bring a false advertisement claim under the lanham act against mcdonald.phoenix now appeals.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,phoenix argues that the district court erred in dismissing its complaint against mcdonald for lack of prudential standing.we review standing determinations de novo.bochese town of ponce inlet,cir.we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,taking as true the facts as they are alleged in the complaint.owens samkle auto,cir.
in every federal case,the party bringing the suit must establish standing to prosecute the action.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.as the supreme court has explained,standing jurisprudence is comprised of two strands article iii standing,which enforces the constitution requirement,and prudential standing,which embodies judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction.id.at.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
to demonstrate article iii standing,a plaintiff must allege that he has suffered an actual or threatened injury,the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant,and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling.primera iglesia bautista hispana of boca raton,broward county,cir.
mcdonald does not dispute that the allegations in phoenix complaint satisfy these constitutional standing requirements.because the issue of constitutional standing is jurisdictional,however,we address it here.see steel citizens for a better env t,d stating that the question of article iii standing is jurisdictional and should be addressed before issues of prudential and statutory standing conte,at.
in its complaint,phoenix alleges that a s a direct and proximate result of mcdonald false advertising and unfair competition,customers were diverted from phoenix and its affiliated franchisees,who accordingly not only lost profits due,inter alia,to reduced sales,but also incurred costs in connection with common counteractive efforts to retain those customers.although phoenix does not allege that mcdonald or any of its employees participated in the theft that led to the compromising of the games allegedly rendering mcdonald advertisements false,phoenix does allege that after mcdonald learned that the games had been compromised,it knowingly and deliberately advertised that customers had a fair and equal opportunity to win prizes.these allegations satisfy the first two prongs of the constitutional standing alleges that it has suffered an actual injury that is fairly traceable to mcdonald alleged misconduct.see primera iglesia,at.in relief,phoenix requests,among other things,actual damages,in amounts to be demonstrated at trial for the harms directly and proximately caused by mcdonald false advertising and other damages incurred,including advertising costs incurred to respond to the fixed promotional games.if granted,this relief would redress the injuries alleged and thus satisfies the third prong of the standing inquiry.see id.based on the allegations in the complaint,we conclude that phoenix has satisfied the requirements of constitutional standing.
even where constitutional standing exists,however,prudential considerations may preclude standing.wooden bd.of regents of.of,cir.we therefore turn to the issue of prudential standing.
whether prudential standing doctrine applies to the lanham act 
we must first determine whether congress intended to abrogate prudential standing doctrine in passing a of the lanham act.section a provides 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which 
a is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person,or 
b in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
a emphasis added.
the issue of whether prudential standing doctrine applies to a of the lanham act is one of first impression in this circuit.the third and fifth circuits have addressed this question,and both have held that congress did not abrogate prudential limitations on the standing of plaintiffs to bring suit under a.see conte,at procter gamble amway,cir.we agree.
congress is presumed to incorporate background prudential standing limitations unless the statute expressly negates such principles.bennett spear,d.although a use of the term any person might lead to the conclusion that congress intended to negate the background of prudential standing by allowing any person who could achieve article iii standing to bring suit,the supreme court has twice held that congress has not expressly abrogated prudential standing doctrine merely by passing a statute the text of which admits a broad interpretation.conte,at.for example,in associated general contractors of california,california state council of carpenters,the supreme court held that congress did not abrogate prudential standing principles when it enacted the clayton act,despite statutory language allowing a ny person who shall be injured in his business or property to bring suit under that act,d.and as noted by the courts in conte and procter gamble,language contained in of the lanham act makes clear that the focus of the lanham act is on conduct in a commercial context,so that conferring standing to the full extent implied by the plain language of a would give standing to parties that have not had their competitive or commercial interests affected by the defendant conduct.conte,at procter gamble,at.rather,t he purpose of the lanham act evinces a congressional intent to limit standing to a narrow class of potential plaintiffs possessing interests the protection of which furthers that congressionally stated purpose.conte,at.
accordingly,in light of the text of a and the purpose of the lanham act as expressed in,we join the third and the fifth circuits and hold that congress did not intend to abrogate prudential standing limitations when it enacted the lanham act.
b.the appropriate test for prudential standing under a 
phoenix argues that the district court applied the wrong test to determine whether phoenix had prudential standing to bring its false advertising claim against mcdonald.according to phoenix,the district court erred in applying the test articulated by the third circuit in conte,and instead,the court should have applied the categorical approach that,according to phoenix,controls in most of the circuit courts of appeals.
this court has not addressed the appropriate test for determining whether a plaintiff has prudential standing to bring a false advertising claim under a of the lanham act.after surveying the caselaw from other circuits and examining the parties arguments,we join the third and fifth circuits and adopt the test for prudential standing articulated in conte we therefore hold that to determine whether a party has prudential standing to bring a false advertising claim under a of the lanham act,a court should consider and weigh the following factors 
the nature of the plaintiff alleged injury is the injury of a type that congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the lanham act 
the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury.
the proximity or remoteness of the party to the alleged injurious conduct.
the speculativeness of the damages claim.
the risk of duplicative damages or complexity in apportioning damages.
conte,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted procter gamble,at adopting the conte test for determining prudential standing under the lanham act.we believe that this test provides appropriate flexibility in application to address factually disparate scenarios that may arise in the future,while at the same time supplying a principled means for addressing standing under a.conte,at.indeed,two prominent commentaries have endorsed this standard.procter gamble,at citing mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.in the author opinion,some limit on the a standing of persons remote from the directly impacted party should be applied by analogy to antitrust law,such as use of the criteria listed in associated general contractors restatement third of unfair competition in determining whether an asserted injury is sufficiently direct to justify the imposition of liability,the supreme court analysis of similar issues under federal antitrust law may offer a useful analogy.and under this standard,standing under the lanham act does not turn on the label placed on the relationship between the parties.conte,at.
phoenix argues that this court should adopt the categorical approach that is applied in the majority of the circuits,as under that approach,actual or direct competition is the exclusive requirement for determining prudential standing.to that end,phoenix argues that the conte test was formulated in order to extend prudential standing under the lanham act to parties who are not in actual or direct competition.thus,according to phoenix,the conte factors inevitably collapse into the categorical approach when applied to a direct competitor alleging a competitive injury,and therefore,direct competitors invariably satisfy the conte requirements.we address each argument in turn.
of the circuits that have not adopted the conte test,the seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits have come the closest to categorically holding that the plaintiff must be in actual or direct competition with the defendant and assert a competitive injury to establish prudential standing under a.see,jack russell terrier network of ca.am.kennel club,cir holding that to establish standing pursuant to the false advertising prong of a of the lanham act,a plaintiff must show a commercial injury based upon a misrepresentation about a product and that the injury is competitive,or harmful to the plaintiff ability to compete with the defendant citation omitted hutchinson pfeil,cir holding that the plaintiff lacked standing because his hopes of eventually obtaining a product to compete with the defendant were too remote,and his inability to compete with the defendant was not a function of the defendant alleged misconduct johnny blastoff,rams football,cir holding that a party must demonstrate that it has a reasonable interest to be protected against conduct violating the act,by asserting a discernable competitive injury internal quotations omitted stanfield osborne,cir holding that the plaintiff must be a competitor of the defendant and allege a competitive injury heath son,info,cir holding that the plaintiff must assert a discernible competitive injury waits,cir same.
in contrast to the seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits,the first and second circuits have applied a less categorical approach to determine standing,wherein the dispositive issue is not the degree of competition,but whether the plaintiff has a reasonable interest to be protected against the type of harm that the lanham act is intended to prevent.see,ortho pharm.cosprophar,cir camel hair cashmere,associated dry goods,cir.in camel hair,a trade group of cashmere garment producers filed a lanham act suit alleging that a coat manufacturer had misrepresented the cashmere content of one of its products.at.in discussing the issue of standing,the first circuit said the plaintiff must have a reasonable interest in being protected against false advertising i t is not enough for the plaintiff merely to establish a falsehood in the defendant advertising or marketing the plaintiff must also show a link or nexus between itself and the alleged falsehood.id.at emphasis added.concluding that the trade group had standing,the first circuit stated that although none of the group members compete with the defendant their position as manufacturers and vendors of fabric and clothing containing cashmere gives them a strong interest in preserving cashmere reputation as a high quality fibre.id.at emphasis added.
in the second circuit,a plaintiff bringing a false advertising claim under the lanham act must demonstrate both a reasonable interest to be protected against the advertiser false or misleading claims,and a reasonable basis for believing that this interest is likely to be damaged by the false or misleading advertising.itc punchgini,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord societe des hotels meridien lasalle hotel operating,cir havana club holding,galleon,cir pdk labs,friedlander,cir.the reasonable interest prong of this test includes commercial interests,direct pecuniary interests,and even a future potential for a commercial or competitive injury,while the reasonable basis prong requires the plaintiff to show both likely injury and a causal nexus to the false advertising.itc,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.and under the second circuit approach,a plaintiff asserting a false advertising claim under a need not be a competitor.see pdk labs,at ortho,at berni int l gourmet rests.of,cir.instead,where the plaintiff products are not obviously in competition with the defendant products,the plaintiff must make a more substantial showing of injury and causation.pdk labs,at quotation marks omitted.
thus,contrary to phoenix assertions,the majority of the circuits do not hold categorically that actual or direct competition is the exclusive requirement for standing to bring a false advertising claim under the lanham act 
we also disagree with phoenix assertion that the third circuit adopted the conte test to extend prudential standing to parties who are not in direct or actual competition.in determining the appropriate test for prudential standing under a,the conte court first noted that the third circuit previous cases addressing a standing requirements defined the dispositive question of a party prudential standing as whether the party has a reasonable interest to be protected against false advertising.conte,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.although the court had never precisely defined the critical term reasonable interest,it had carried forward this prudential reasonable interest requirement and ha d grappled with defining the term with greater precision.id.at.in adopting the test discussed above,the court expressly declined to adopt standards conferring standing only on direct competitors or their surrogates,as such standards were in tension with language from a previous third circuit opinion which implied that parties not in direct competition may nonetheless have standing to sue if they have a reasonable interest to be protected against false advertising.id.at citing serbin ziebart int l,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the court also cited earlier cases from the first and second circuits that recognized standing for lanham act plaintiffs who were not in direct competition with the defendant.id.at citing ppx,audiofidelity,cir holding that the owner of royalty streams from a music recording had standing to sue a distributor of falsely labeled music recordings camel hair,at holding that a trade association of manufacturers of cashmere fibers and fabrics,but not of finished coats,had standing to sue retailers of coats falsely labeled as containing more cashmere than they had.thus,even before the conte decision,the third circuit had implied,and the first and second circuits had held expressly,that parties who are not in direct or actual competition may nonetheless have prudential standing to bring false advertising claims under the lanham act.
finally,we disagree with phoenix contention that direct competitors alleging a competitive injury invariably satisfy the conte requirements.rather than blindly accept a plaintiff allegation that it is a competitor that has suffered a competitive injury,the conte test is designed to determine whether the injury alleged is the type of injury that the lanham act was designed to to the plaintiff ability to compete in the marketplace and erosion of the plaintiff good will and reputation that has been directly and proximately caused by the defendant false advertising.id.at.moreover,at least one federal court in addition to the district court below has applied the conte test where the plaintiff and defendant were direct competitors and held that the plaintiff lacked prudential standing.see,kis,foto fantasy,d,applying the conte test and holding that the plaintiff,a manufacturer and operator of photo booths,lacked prudential standing to bring a false advertising claim against the defendant,also a manufacturer and operator of photo booths,even though the plaintiff and defendant were direct competitors in the photo booth industry.and even accepting phoenix argument,as stated above,we conclude that the conte test provides appropriate flexibility in application to address factually disparate scenarios that may arise in the future,while at the same time supplying a principled means for addressing standing under a of the lanham act.conte,at.
in summary,we hold that to determine whether a plaintiff has prudential standing to bring a false advertising claim under a of the lanham act,a court must consider and weigh the five factors articulated in the conte opinion.
applying the conte.test for prudential standing 
phoenix argues that it satisfied the requirements of prudential standing under the conte test.after examining and weighing the conte factors,we conclude otherwise.
type of injury alleged 
the first factor directs us to determine whether the alleged injury is of a type congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the lanham act.procter gamble,at.as the conte court noted,the focus of a is on protecting commercial interests that have been harmed by a competitor false advertising,and in secur ing to the business community the advantages of reputation and good will by preventing their diversion from those who have created them to those who have not.conte,at alterations in original citation omitted.
in its complaint,phoenix alleges that mcdonald falsely advertised that customers who purchased its products had a fair and equal chance to win any of the prizes offered,including the prizes during the run of the games,mcdonald experienced an unnatural spike in its sales while burger king experienced a decrease in its sales and burger king franchisees incurred costs in an effort to lure back customers who frequented mcdonald while the fraudulent games were running.in our view,these allegations amount to an assertion by phoenix that its commercial interests were harmed by a competitor false advertising,and this is the type of harm the lanham act was intended to redress see id.
mcdonald argues that its conduct was in no way because it was the victim of a criminal fraud scheme perpetrated by a third party.according to mcdonald,to the extent any of its advertising was false,it was false solely because of the intervening criminal conduct of jacobson and his coconspirators.we find this argument unavailing,however,because phoenix alleges that mcdonald knowingly and deliberately continued to advertise that its customers had a fair and equal chance to win prizes even after learning that the integrity of its promotional games had been compromised.moreover,s ection a provides a strict liability tort cause of action.vector,hartford fire ins,cir it is that no proof of intent or willfulness is required to establish a violation of lanham act a for false advertising.
mcdonald also contends that phoenix alleged injuries are not competitive in nature because the challenged advertisements did not tout the products and services of mcdonald or disparage the products and services of burger king.we can not agree.although the advertisements did not disparage burger king or tout some intrinsic quality of mcdonald goods and services,the advertisements nonetheless asserted that customers who patronized mcdonald restaurants had an opportunity to win prizes,including the prizes that had been stolen.moreover,phoenix alleges that the promotional games were sometimes physically attached to mcdonald products.
mcdonald further contends that because phoenix has neither alleged nor suggested that its reputation was adversely affected by mcdonald advertising,this lack of reputational injury counsels against prudential standing.although mcdonald is correct in asserting that phoenix does not allege that its reputation was harmed by mcdonald conduct,we can not say that the lack of alleged reputational injury,in and of itself,directs us to conclude that phoenix has failed to allege the type of injury that the lanham act was intended to redress.again,the lanham act is not only designed to protect against unfair erosion of a competitor reputation,it is also designed to protect commercial interests that have been harmed by a competitor false advertising,conte,at alteration in original,and,as stated above,phoenix alleges such harm.we therefore conclude that the first factor weighs in favor of prudential standing.
directness of the asserted injury 
the second factor requires us to examine the directness with which the defendant conduct affected the plaintiff.phoenix alleges that by falsely advertising that customers had a fair and equal opportunity to win prizes,mcdonald lured customers to its restaurants and away from burger king restaurants.according to phoenix,as a direct result of these false advertisements,it lost sales and incurred additional promotional expenses in its attempts to lure back the customers it lost to mcdonald during the fraudulent promotion.
on one hand,the causal chain phoenix alleges is similar to that of the typical false advertising claim in which a plaintiff alleges that it lost sales market share as a result of the defendant false or misleading representations about some characteristic of the defendant product or services.for example,in logan burgers ozark country cured hams,the fifth circuit concluded that the second conte factor counseled in favor of standing where the plaintiff alleged that the defendant literally false advertising about its own goods influenced its customers to buy its product instead of the plaintiff product,cir.in so concluding,the logan court stated that the plaintiff ability to license its products may have been directly affected by the defendant false advertising about the defendant products.id.emphasis added.and in procter gamble,the fifth circuit stated that the second factor weighs in favor of standing in cases where one competitor directly injur es another by making false statements about its own goods and thus influenc es customers to buy its product instead of the competitor product.logan,at citing procter gamble,at.
on the other hand,the causal chain phoenix alleges is more attenuated than that alleged in cases like logan.phoenix essentially alleges that mcdonald advertisements falsely represented that customers had a fair and equal chance to win one of the rare prizes if those customers patronized mcdonald restaurants and played its games as a direct result of the misrepresentation regarding the prizes,mcdonald lured customers who would have eaten at burger king as opposed to one of numerous other fast food competitors,causing burger king to lose sales and but for this misrepresentation,these customers would have eaten at burger king,even though the chances of winning one of the rare prizes would have been minute had there been no theft,even though only certain prizes were stolen,and even though these customers still had a fair and equal opportunity to win all of the other prizes.accepting phoenix allegations as true,the causal chain linking mcdonald alleged misrepresentations about one aspect of its promotional games to a decrease in burger king sales is tenuous,to say the least.
taking care not to conflate the prudential standing inquiry with the materiality element phoenix must establish to succeed on the merits of its claim,see johnson johnson vision care,contacts,cir to succeed on a claim of false advertising,the plaintiff must establish that the defendant deception is likely to influence the purchasing decision.internal quotation marks omitted,we conclude that the second factor counsels against prudential standing.
proximity to the allegedly harmful conduct 
the third factor requires us to examine the proximity of the plaintiff to the allegedly harmful conduct.in examining this factor,we must determine whether there is an identifiable class of persons whose would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest by bringing a suit.conte,at.the existence of such a class diminishes the justification for allowing a more remote party to perform the office of a private attorney general.joint stock soc y udv,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court held,and mcdonald asserts on appeal,that the consumers who were denied a fair and equal opportunity to win the prizes as advertised constitute an identifiable class of persons whose would normally motivate them to sue mcdonald regarding its false advertising.but this can be said about any false advertising claim,as the consumers who were diverted from the plaintiff product to the defendant product in reliance on the defendant allegedly false advertisements would always have a natural in suing for fraud.as such,if we accept the district court and mcdonald reasoning,this factor would never counsel in favor of prudential standing.moreover,consumers would not be able to vindicate the public interest via the lanham act,as the several circuits that have dealt with the question are uniform in their categorical denial of lanham act standing to consumers.made in the usa found.phillips foods,cir see also conte,at reiterating precedent holding that consumers lack standing under the lanham act and stating that a contrary conclusion would ignore the purpose of the act barrus sylvania,cir holding that consumers lack standing to bring false advertising claims under the lanham act because they can not allege either a commercial or competitive injury.
furthermore,courts applying the conte test have generally considered whether other commercial entities were the more appropriate parties to vindicate the competitive harm wrought by
