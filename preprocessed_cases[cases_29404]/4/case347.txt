baxter international invented sevoflurane in the.this substance,a gas at room temperature,has good anesthetic properties.but it was too difficult and costly to produce commercially until the early,when baxter devised an efficient process for its manufacture.baxter obtained two process patents,the latter of which expires in december.but the anesthetic gas still could not be sold in the united states unless it first received the fda approval,and baxter was not willing to bear the costs of the required medical testing.so in it granted to maruishi pharmaceutical company,of japan,an exclusive worldwide license to practice the sevoflurane process patents baxter owned or was pursuing.maruishi obtained approval to sell the anesthetic in japan,where it was a great success,as it has become in other nations since.this suggested that it would be worth obtaining the fda approval to sell in the united states.abbott laboratories took a sublicense from maruishi in,obtained the fda approval after spending approximately million on testing,and in began selling sevoflurane in the united states.maruishi remains the sole manufacturer under the baxter patents abbott resells sevoflurane that it purchases from maruishi,which pays baxter a royalty based on its total sales.today sevoflurane is the gas used for anesthesia in the united states,with approximately of sales.desflurane holds of this market,and isoflurane accounts for almost all of the remaining sales.isoflurane is not protected by any patent and sells for less,but it is slower in both onset and recovery and has an irritating taste and smell.desflurane likewise has an annoying smell and aftertaste,though its properties otherwise are comparable to therefore has become the anesthetic of choice and commands a premium price.
sevoflurane success gave rivals an incentive to invent around baxter process patents.ohio medical associates now known as ohmeda set out in to do just this.in ohmeda obtained a patent for a new way of making sevoflurane,distinct from baxter process but equivalently cheap and effective.it planned to introduce a rival sevoflurane anesthetic,which it could do by filing a me too application with the fda.ohmeda could receive approval without costly tests just by showing that the finished product is identical to abbott.
before ohmeda could bring sevoflurane to market,it was acquired in by decided to proceed with ohmeda plans and compete with the sevoflurane made by maruishi and sold in the united states by abbott.baxter concluded that it would make more from selling sevoflurane than it would lose in reduced royalties from maruishi for sevoflurane.abbott,which contends that it has spent more than billion to commercialize sevoflurane including distribution of equipment for administering the drug and marketing to alert anesthesiologists to its benefits did not welcome competition before the expiration of the baxter patents.abbott initiated arbitration under the agreement to which it had become a party in and the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,implemented by.the agreement specifies a tribunal,which consisted of a attorney,a spanish attorney,and a japanese law professor.
abbott contended that baxter sale of sevoflurane before the baxter patents expired would violate the exclusivity term of the license baxter replied,first,that the license does not explicitly forbid baxter itself from competing with maruishi in other words,that exclusivity means only that baxter can not issue any other licenses,and,second,that if the license does forbid baxter from competing,then it violates antitrust law,particularly of the sherman act,and is unenforceable.the arbitrators ruled against baxter on both issues.the tribunal held that the license is exclusive in the strong sense and that any reduction in competition is attributable to baxter decision to purchase the competing ohmeda process while bound by this promise not to compete with its licensee.on cross suits filed by abbott and baxter,the district judge then directed baxter to comply with the award,rejecting its contention that the license,as construed by the tribunal,violates the sherman act or the public policy of the united states.the judge observed that competition from desflurane,isoflurane,and sevoflurane made by any other process for the sevoflurane molecule is unpatented is unaffected.wl,dist.lexis.
baxter argues at length in this court that the license,construed to keep sevoflurane off the market until,is a territorial allocation unlawful per se under of the sherman act.but the initial question is whether baxter is entitled to reargue an issue that was resolved by the arbitral tribunal.we think not a mistake of law is not a ground on which to set aside an award.see george watts son,tiffany,cir.section says that t he court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.legal errors are not among the grounds that the convention gives for refusing to enforce international awards.under domestic law,as well as under the convention,arbitrators have completely free rein to decide the law as well as the facts and are not subject to appellate review.commonwealth coatings continental casualty,d.courts thus do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator.united paperworkers misco,d.
arbitrators regularly handle claims under federal statutes.see,rodriguez de quijas express,d claims under the securities act of express,mcmahon,d claims under the securities exchange act of and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act scherk,d international arbitration of claims under the securities exchange act of.we do not see any reason why things should be otherwise for antitrust,more importantly,does the supreme court,which held in mitsubishi motors soler,d,that international arbitration of antitrust disputes is appropriate.
mitsubishi did not contemplate that,once arbitration was over,the federal courts would throw the result in the waste basket and litigate the antitrust issues anew.that would just be another way of saying that antitrust matters are not arbitrable.yet this is baxter position.it wants us to disregard the panel award and make our own decision.the supreme court approach in mitsubishi was different.it observed at.
the utility of the convention in promoting the process of international commercial arbitration depends upon the willingness of national courts to let go of matters they normally would think of as their own.doubtless,congress may specify categories of claims it wishes to reserve for decision by our own courts without contravening this nation obligations under the convention.but we decline to subvert the spirit of the united states accession to the convention by recognizing exceptions where congress has not expressly directed the courts to do so.
starting from scratch in court,as baxter proposes,would subvert the promises the united states made by acceding to the convention.
according to baxter,there is a difference between arbitrating an antitrust issue the subject of mitsubishi and creating it accuses these arbitrators of doing.if the tribunal had construed the agreement differently,there would have been no antitrust problem.baxter relies on the observation in george watts that arbitrators are not allowed to command the parties to violate rules of positive law.that true enough,but whether the tribunal construction of the agreement has that effect was a question put to,and resolved by,the arbitrators.they answered no,and as between baxter and abbott their answer is conclusive.this is a point anticipated in mitsubishi,which observed id.at.while the efficacy of the arbitral process requires that substantive review at the stage remain minimal,it would not require intrusive inquiry to ascertain that the tribunal took cognizance of the antitrust claims and actually decided them.the arbitral tribunal in this case took cognizance of the antitrust claims and actually decided them.ensuring this is as far as our review legitimately goes.
treating baxter as bound abbott by the tribunal conclusion that the license as construed to provide strong exclusivity is lawful does not condemn the public to tolerate a monopoly.if the arrangement among baxter,maruishi,and abbott really does offend the sherman act,then the united states,the ftc,or any purchaser of sevoflurane is free to sue and obtain relief.none of them would be bound by the award.as far as we can see,however,only baxter is distressed by the baxter,as a producer,is a poor champion of consumers.see atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d cargill,monfort of colorado,d brunswick pueblo,d.
what relief the antitrust division,the ftc,or a consumer would obtain,if there is an antitrust problem,is an interesting question.baxter thinks that the solution should be an order allowing it to sell sevoflurane.it wants to take its acquisition of ohmeda as given and ask what consequences it has for exclusivity under the agreement.yet this is anachronistic.the agreement came first,and its exclusivity rule was a lawful ancillary agreement designed to induce maruishi and its sublicensees to make the investments needed to bring the new drug to market.see generally polk,forest city enterprises,cir rothery storage van atlas van lines,bork.at the time baxter acquired ohmeda it was obliged by contract to refrain from producing sevoflurane until.this is how the tribunal understood the agreement,and a court must accept this interpretation.so if there is an antitrust problem,it lies in the the remedy would be divestiture of the ohmeda process patent.baxter can achieve that outcome on its own.baxter,which can solve unilaterally any antitrust problem,is in no position to insist that the burden of solution fall on abbott by depriving it of the benefit of the exclusive license.why should a decision baxter made in reduce the rights abbott enjoys under a promise baxter made to maruishi in but it is unnecessary to pursue this line of argument.all that matters today is that the arbitrators have concluded that the antitrust laws and baxter related arguments,which we need not address do not diminish abbott contractual that decision is conclusive between these parties.
to understand fully why the majority enforcement of this dubious arbitration award is misguided,a brief synopsis of the background material not fully described by the majority is essential.in and in baxter gave options to maruishi to license patents covering the process of manufacturing sevoflurane.by,when negotiations with abbott concerning the introduction of sevoflurane in the united states were undertaken,baxter product and patents for sevoflurane had expired.arbitration transcript at.hence,the only patents that baxter could license to maruishi and that maruishi could in turn sublicense to abbott were those covering the manufacturing process,which were still in effect.in its negotiations with baxter,maruishi considered attempting to obtain a covenant not to compete not only with respect to the process but also as to sevoflurane itself,but instead turned its attention elsewhere.maruishi concluded that the exclusive license for the process and related intellectual property was sufficient protection.see arb.tr.at.the negotiations with abbott dealt only with the process.arb.tr.at.
in,when sublicensing to abbott was negotiated,two distinct sets of agreements were involved in the negotiations.first,there were the sevoflurane agreements establishing the terms of the licenses,and granting exclusive rights to maruishi and to abbott to manufacture sevoflurane under the patent,to all improvements on the patents and to all technology and confidential proprietary information acquired during the development of the process.next,all the parties entered into a dispute resolution agreement dra,first,to ensure that in the event of a dispute commercialization of sevoflurane would go forward and,second,to provide a mechanism arbitration for resolving disputes arising from the sevoflurane agreements that would arguably impair what the parties referred to as the original commercial relationship ocr.the arbitrators were instructed by the dra to attempt to maintain this original commercial unusual concept.appellant br.at.
by the late,ohmeda had developed and patented a different,process to make sevoflurane suitable to be marketed as a generic drug.subsequently,baxter acquired ohmeda.faced with the threat of generic anticipated,but now apparently to be undertaken by sought arbitration.the arbitration panel conceded that the licensing agreement would not preclude baxter offering generic competition because this licensing agreement covered only the manufacturing process,which bore no relation to the process.but a majority of the panel found that,under the dispute resolution agreement invoking the original commercial relationship,baxter proposed sales of generic sevoflurane could be enjoined because they would reduce abbott revenues below monopoly levels,even though the expectation of generic competition was nothing new.the third member of the arbitral panel the only american dissented since he concluded that the arbitrators were not authorized to act independent of the licensing agreement itself.the majority also found a breach of an illinois state duty of good faith,which the dissenting arbitrator thought specious.
the majority upholds the arbitration award here by declaring that,once the arbitrators have spoken to the antitrust issues and in effect commanded the parties to violate the sherman act,the courts have no business intervening.of course,the doctrine that requires extreme deference by the courts to arbitration awards is based on the theory that the parties to a contract may cede broad,almost unlimited,power to an arbitration panel to interpret their agreement.see first options of chicago,kaplan,d see also ids life ins.royal alliance,cir within exceedingly broad limits,the parties to an arbitration agreement choose their method of dispute resolution and are bound by it however bad their choice appears to be either ex ante or ex post.in fact,the arbitrators function almost as agents of the parties to extend their deal to cover unforeseen circumstances.see associated coal united mine workers of america,d telling courts to treat the arbitrator award as if it represented an agreement between the parties as to the proper meaning of the contract words.eeoc indiana bell,cir the arbitrator acts on their joint behalf,with whatever authority the contract bestows.the resulting award is effectively the parties joint decision.all this rests on the proposition that the parties are free to adjust rights and liabilities among themselves as they see fit and through the instrumentality of arbitration to follow wherever the situation may demand.in this bilateral context a commitment to deference can not be questioned.
but other considerations enter the mix when the issue becomes a matter of the arbitrators,in interpreting a statute,commanding the parties to break the law or to violate clearly established norms of public policy in the case before us,the arbitrators have instructed abbott and baxter by imposing on baxter a broad covenant not to compete with respect to sales of sevoflurane itself to effect a horizontal allocation of markets,a clear violation of the sherman act.under the arbitral decision,abbott is granted a monopoly in the sale of sevoflurane in the united states.
for some considerable time not long in the past,the law of the land was that antitrust disputes were not arbitrable.see am.safety equip.maguire,cir applied digital,continental cas,cir.claims made under the sherman act were not merely private claims,but were claims designed to protect the rights of consumers and the public at large.applied digital,at.since more than merely the rights of the parties were at issue,the agreement of the parties to arbitrate could not supersede the public presumed interest in a judicial resolution of antitrust claims.
the growing fondness for arbitration,however,eventually eliminated the prohibition on submitting antitrust matters to arbitration.mitsubishi motors soler,d,did not purport to directly overturn the doctrine that domestic antitrust claims could not be arbitra
