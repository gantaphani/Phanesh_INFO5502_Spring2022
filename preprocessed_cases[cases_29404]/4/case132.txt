on november,plaintiff victor kiam,ii kiam,and two entities through which he controlled the new england patriots,brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against the national football league the nfl,of its member clubs with the nfl,collectively the nfl defendants,and two entities involved in the ultimately successful campaign to locate an nfl football team in jacksonville,jacksonville,and touchdown jacksonville.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated the sherman antitrust act by preventing kiam from moving the patriots out of new england.the defendants assert that the plaintiffs are barred from maintaining this action because they released all claims against the defendants,including the antitrust claims,in a formal written release.following a jury trial limited to the plaintiffs claim of economic duress,the jury returned a verdict for the defendants.the district court then granted the defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs remaining claims.

background 
the new england patriots is a member club of the national football league.from through,kiam,through two corporations,vkk corporation and vkk patriots,kiam and the corporations collectively vkk was the majority owner of the patriots.during the period relevant to this appeal,the patriots played their home games in foxboro,massachusetts.vkk alleges that when it assumed control of the patriots,the team was experiencing substantial financial difficulties stemming in part from the inadequate facilities at foxboro and the restrictive lease that kept the patriots there.
as a condition precedent to the approval of his purchase of the patriots in september of,kiam signed a contract in which vkk agreed to comply with the nfl constitution and bylaws and to obtain advance approval from the nfl of any transfer of ownership of the patriots.vkk further agreed to continue to operate the patriots franchise within its existing home territory,unless a transfer of the franchise to a different city is approved by the member clubs of the league.in,shortly after vkk assumed ownership of the patriots,paul tagliabue,who had succeeded rozelle as nfl commissioner,issued a statement declaring that the sale of any club would only become effective if approved by the affirmative vote of at least of the members of the league.
the patriots first two seasons were not profitable,and kiam was required personally to guarantee loans and use personal funds to cover the resulting cash flow shortages.in an attempt to resolve the patriots financial situation,kiam unsuccessfully negotiated with boston city officials for a new stadium.in,with no prospects for a new stadium in new england,kiam decided that it was necessary to consider moving the patriots to another region of the country.kiam claims that before buying the team he had received assurances from pete rozelle that if a new stadium could not be secured in new england,such a move would be allowed.
at the time kiam began to seek the patriots relocation,several cities were attempting to obtain nfl franchises.because few new franchises were being created,groups in many of these cities sought to lure existing teams.one such group was touchdown jacksonville,tji,created t o secure the nfl franchise for the city of jacksonville.in the spring of,representatives of vkk and tji held a series of meetings about the possibility of relocating the patriots to jacksonville.
representatives of tji informed the nfl of their meetings with vkk and indicated that they were close to a deal that would bring the patriots to jacksonville.as to the plan,tji told the nfl,according to testimony of the nfl director of planning,that we are going to do what you tell us to do.the nfl told tji,according to a tji consultant involved in the negotiations,that the nfl did not favor the move,and that if tji wanted the support of the nfl,which tji needed to procure a franchise,it should cease negotiations with the patriots.as a result of the nfl comments,the consultant testified,tji ceased pursuing discussions with the patriots.
several months later,in the fall of,a new touchdown jacksonville entity was created touchdown jacksonville,tjl.the president of tji,david seldin,was also the president of the corporate general partner of tjl.seldin testified that in october of,tji transferred some of its assets to tjl to enable tjl to seek an nfl expansion franchise for the city of jacksonville.in november,the nfl awarded an expansion franchise to tjl,which then changed its name to jacksonville jaguars,
in,kiam informed commissioner tagliabue that kiam was financially compelled to move the patriots out of new england.tagliabue responded that he opposed such a move and that the patriots would not be allowed to relocate.according to kiam lawyer at the time,tagliabue opposed the move because he was,in principle,just against the concept of moving,and because he was concerned about losing the television revenues the nfl received because of the strength of the new england territory.
meanwhile,kiam had gone further into debt in order to meet the patriots expenses.he told the nfl that if he did not receive a loan he would be compelled to relocate the team immediately.in response,the nfl increased the patriots debt limit by million but required that vkk agree not to move the team before the end of the season.vkk asserts that even with this increased debt limit it was required to sell the team in order to raise enough cash for kiam to meet his obligations.
prospective purchasers of the patriots knew that any sale of the team required approval by the nfl.vkk claims that the nfl thereby lowered the value of the franchise by limiting the pool of prospective purchasers to those interested in owning the team in new england.the nfl eventually approved the sale of the patriots to one james orthwein,but only after he signed an iron clad commitment not to move the team to his hometown of louis.
in april,just weeks before the sale was scheduled to close,the nfl informed kiam and orthwein that the league had a release policy under which the league would not approve a sale unless kiam,on behalf of vkk,signed a release of all claims against the nfl,including potential antitrust claims orthwein appeared ready to rescind the deal unless kiam signed such a release and proceeded to closing.kiam signed the release demanded of him the release on may.three days later,on may,the transaction closed.
some two and one half years later,on november,vkk filed the complaint in this action,asserting federal antitrust claims against the nfl,member clubs,and tjl.the complaint alleged that the defendants violated the sherman act by engaging in monopolistic and conspiratorial conduct that illegally lowered the value of the patriots and had anticompetitive effects in several markets.vkk attempted to avoid the effect of the terms of the release by asserting that kiam had signed it under economic duress,that it was itself an instrument of the anticompetitive conduct complained of under the sherman act and therefore void or voidable under the part and parcel doctrine,which holds that a release is invalid if it is an integral part of a scheme to violate the antitrust laws,and that the release was not binding because vkk received no consideration in return.vkk also claimed that kiam did not know that the release had been part of a conspiracy among the defendants until the fall of,a year before this suit was begun,when he read a newspaper article outlining the defendants behavior in blocking the relocation of the patriots to jacksonville.
the action was originally assigned to judge john sprizzo,who stayed all merits discovery,allowing discovery to proceed only on the issues concerning the validity of the release,pending resolution of a motion for summary judgment made by the defendants.while the motion was pending,vkk moved to amend the complaint to add tji as a defendant,arguing that it had not realized that the entity it had negotiated with in was tji not tjl.on april,judge sprizzo denied the motion for summary judgment and allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add tji.
the case was then bifurcated.a jury trial was to be held on the enforceability of the release,although it was unclear which of the plaintiffs theories could be argued before the jury in that trial.before the trial started,the case was reassigned to judge milton pollack.judge pollack limited the trial to the issue of economic duress.the jury returned a verdict for the defendants.
the defendants then moved again for summary judgment on the remaining claims.on june,the district court granted the motion,holding that the release was supported by valid consideration,that it was not unenforceable as part and parcel of a sherman act violation,that the claims against party added to the complaint after the statute of limitations had not relate back to those against tjl under the requirements set forth in.c and were therefore,that the release applied to tjl,and that there were no questions of fact on the merits of the antitrust claims against the jacksonville defendants.see vkk national football league,d vkk.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the validity of the release 
the defendants claim that vkk was barred from bringing suit against them by the release.vkk challenges the validity of the release on three bases that it was signed under economic duress that it was part and parcel of the defendants antitrust violation and that vkk received no consideration in exchange for it.
economic duress 
at the heart of this appeal is the plaintiffs assertion that the release was invalid because it was obtained by means of the nfl exertion of economic duress on kiam.the jury found in favor of the nfl defendants on this issue,the only one presented to it in the first part of what was to have been the bifurcated trial.
applicable law.f ederal law governs all questions relating to the validity of and defenses to purported releases of federal statutory causes of action.locafrance intermodal.leasing,cir see also dice akron,canton youngstown.olin consolidated aluminum,cir.but it does not necessarily follow from the fact that federal law governs that we must fashion a uniform federal rule of decision.see mardan music,cir.to the contrary,f requently,state rules of decision will furnish an appropriate and convenient measure of the governing federal law.id.at.
the first guide the courts are required to employ in determining whether to incorporate state law or instead to create a uniform federal standard is the congressional intent underlying the federal statute involved.see mardan,at olin consolidated aluminum.we can not find any congressional directive instructing us to formulate a uniform federal standard for determining whether a release of antitrust claims is invalid on the basis of economic duress.see the legislative history of the federal antitrust laws and related statutes,vol.earl kintner,chelsea house publishers.in the absence of congressional guidance on the issue of what law to apply,we look to the test enunciated by the supreme court in united states kimbell foods,d.we assess whether the issue requires a nationally uniform body of law application of state law would frustrate specific objectives of the federal programs and application of a federal rule would disrupt commercial relationships predicated on state law.id.
as to the first factor,while there is a federal interest in vindicating rights arising out of federal enactments,the validity of a release of antitrust claims does not involve the duties of the federal government,the distribution of powers in our federal system,or matters necessarily subject to federal control even in the absence of statutory authority.texas,radcliff materials,d.with regard to the second factor,the application of state law to the validity of a release will not frustrate the objectives of the antitrust laws.although a release from a private antitrust action forecloses that action,it does not immunize the released party from liability under federal antitrust laws for its enforcement of those laws remains possible.finally,under the third factor,a national standard for releases might interfere with the reasonable expectations of the parties to a contract.parties expect state law to govern contracts.it is not unusual for releases,like other contracts,to state specifically that state law governs,as did the release.thus,application of the kimbell foods test leads us to look to new york state law,the governing law specified in the release,to provide the content of the federal law regulating the validity of the release.
economic duress under new york law.the doctrine of economic duress arises from the theory that the courts will not enforce an agreement in which one party has unjustly taken advantage of the economic necessities of another and thereby threatened to do an unlawful injury.scientific holding plessey,cir emphasis omitted quoting nixon leitman,misc d.under new york law,a contract or release,the execution of which is induced by duress,is voidable.dirose pk mgmt,cir,cert.denied,d see also scientific holding,at.however,the person claiming duress must act promptly to repudiate the contract or release or he will be deemed to have waived his right to do so.dirose,at see also scientific holding,at international halliwell mines,continental copper and steel,cir.if the releasing party does not promptly repudiate the contract or release he will be deemed to have ratified it.a party may ratify a contract or release entered into under duress by intentionally accepting benefits under the contract,by remaining silent or acquiescing in the contract for a period of time after he has the opportunity to avoid it,or by acting upon it,performing under it,or affirmatively acknowledging it.in re boston shipyard,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
principles of economic duress applied to the release.the defendants tell us that we can avoid deciding the many challenges that vkk raises to the conduct of the trial,which was confined to the economic duress issue,because vkk forfeited the right to assert economic duress.as noted,under the applicable law,vkk was required to repudiate the release promptly in order to assert such duress.dirose,at.the burden on a party seeking to avoid contractual obligations on the grounds of economic duress increases proportionately with the delay in initiating suit or otherwise repudiating the contract in question,since it is well established under new york law that a party asserting duress must do so promptly.international halliwell mines,at.delays as short as six months have been held to constitute forfeiture of the claim.see dirose,at collecting cases in which delays ranging from six months to two years constituted forfeiture.here,vkk waited thirty months before challenging the release.as a matter of law,the defendants argue,vkk forfeited any right it may have had to assert duress.we agree.
our cases and the new york cases dealing with duress are typically not about duress caused by conspiracy but about a corporate or commercial deal gone sour.see,dirose international halliwell mines scientific holding joseph egan,city of new york,leader dinkler mgmnt,dep t,aff,powell oman constr,dep t feyh brandtjen kluge,dep t,aff,port chester constr.hastings terraces,dep t.not infrequently,when two commercial parties enter into an agreement,one of them has a decided economic advantage over the other.the weaker party often must enter into the bargain because of his economic circumstances,a disparity in bargaining power to his disadvantage,or some combination of the two.
because an element of economic duress is thus present when many contracts are formed or releases given,the ability of a party to disown his obligations under a contract or release on that basis is reserved for extreme and extraordinary cases.otherwise,the stronger party to a contract or release would routinely be at risk of having its rights under the contract or release challenged long after the instrument became effective.the requirement that the party claiming duress disclaim the contract or release about which he is complaining promptly or be held to have forfeited his right to do so protects the stability and reliability of such agreements by denying the weaker party the heads i win,tails you lose option of waiting to see how the arrangement works out and then deciding whether to seek to undo it.under this rule,shortly after the execution of a contract or release,the rights and duties under it become free of the doubt engendered by possible assertions of duress.and,importantly for the case at bar,the requirement of prompt disavowal after execution is fair to the disadvantaged party,who will ordinarily know at the time he executes the instrument that he is being economically coerced.he will therefore be able to disclaim the instrument immediately if he was forced into it by economic duress and wishes to avoid its effect.
we are not altogether in disagreement with vkk assertion that despite these general principles,the time after which vkk was required to act promptly in order effectively to disclaim the release began to run not at the time of its execution,but when kiam learned of the conspiracy about which he and the two vkk companies complain.not until then could they lay his economic duress at the door of the defendants and seek to renounce the release in order to pursue their antitrust claims against the defendants.as in the case of fraud,where the time for the defrauded party to bring an action begins to run when the fraudulent acts are or reasonably should have been discovered,see corcoran new york power,cir dodds cigna,cir,g,the time for vkk to disclaim the release began when the conspiracy of which vkk complains was or reasonably should have been uncovered that,vkk says,occurred in the autumn of.kiam knew that vkk inability to relocate the patriots was at the heart of his financial difficulties.but not until kiam learned about the conduct of the nfl and the jacksonville group in blocking the team relocation,appellants br.at,did kiam know it was the conspiracy of which vkk now complains that resulted in vkk having to sell the club and deliver the release.
while we do not reject vkk theory,neither do we find it applicable to the facts of this case.
first,this suit was not begun until november,roughly a year after the date kiam says he learned about the exchange.vkk asserts that it filed this action as soon as it could mobilize the necessary legal resources.appellants br.at.even accepting this assertion,one year seems to be simply too long a period after kiam asserted discovery of the conspiracy that caused the duress to have waited to disclaim the release.
second,even if one year were not too long a period after discovery to disclaim,the undisputed facts make plain that kiam had sufficient knowledge of the conspiracy as a whole at the time he executed the release to permit vkk to renounce the release promptly after kiam signed it.among other things,at that time,kiam knew from a letter sent to him by the nfl that he had agreed to continue to operate the patriots franchise within its existing home territory,unless a transfer of the franchise to a different city is approved by the member clubs of the league.he knew that the agglomeration of entities previously held to have unlawfully conspired among themselves,see north am.soccer league football league,cir,cert.denied,d see also los angeles mem l coliseum comm national football league,cir stopped him from relocating the patriots.he knew or should have known that the fact that they had stopped him from relocating had caused him to sell the team at a depressed price.he knew that nfl officials would not permit the owners to approve orthwein purchase without his written agreement not to attempt to relocate the team.kiam knew that the nfl had refused to compromise on obtaining a release from him of all antitrust claims relating to relocation before his sale of the team could close.he knew that the terms of the release provided an additional incentive,if more incentive were necessary,for the nfl to continue to deny relocation of the patriots in orthwein hands.he knew that nfl officials required orthwein to sign a commitment not to sue the nfl if he were prevented from the nfl trumpeted as an ironclad commitment that he would not move.appellants br.at.emphasis omitted.according to sam jankovich,chief executive officer of the patriots,kiam even knew that a tji official had explained to jankovich that the nfl had told tji to cease all discussion with the patriots about relocating the patriots to jacksonville and that if tji continued to pursue negotiations with the patriots,the patriots would not be permitted to relocate and tji chances of securing an nfl expansion team would be hurt.and according to jankovich,kiam also knew that this tji official had told jankovich that as a result of the nfl communication,tji was withdrawing its offer and would not participate in any further discussions with the patriots.
we find it particularly telling that when,in,vkk finally pled the conspiracy in a section of its complaint entitled the defendants conspiracy to prevent all relocations by nfl teams out of their home territories,it did not so much as mention the interactions between tji and the nfl,knowledge of which it now contends was necessary for kiam to discover the conspiracy,disclaim the release,and cause this lawsuit to be initiated.
since kiam knew both the extent of the economic duress under which he signed the release and the essential components of the conspiracy that he says gave rise to that duress at the time he executed the release,vkk was required to challenge its validity promptly after that execution,or not at all.we hold that as a matter of law,thirty months was not prompt.we therefore affirm that part of the district court judgment that was based on the jury verdict in this regard,albeit on grounds different from those upon which the district court relied and without considering that verdict or its propriety.
part and parcel doctrine 
vkk mounts a second challenge to the validity of the release under the part and parcel doctrine.rarely discussed and more rarely applied,part and parcel roots are traced to justice cardozo statement in radio of am.raytheon,that a release to an antitrust claim may be invalid when it is so much a part of an illegal transaction as to be void in its inception.the doctrine holds that a release is invalid if the release itself was an integral part of a scheme to violate the antitrust laws.redel general,cir see also ingram ray mcdermott,cir dobbins kawasaki motors.the release must be an object of the combination or conspiracy or an integral part of the scheme in restraint of trade.dobbins.at.i f the release is merely an outgrowth,rather than a cause of the violation,it is not part and parcel of the antitrust conspiracy.northern oil,standard oil,metzner.
no united states court of appeals has ever applied the part and parcel theory to invalidate a release.indeed,at least one circuit has expressed grave doubt as to the very existence of the doctrine.see taxin food fair stores,cir w e are not able to imagine any meaningful way in which the obtaining of a release could be,in appellants own words,part of and in furtherance of the continuing conspiracy among the defendants about which plaintiffs complain.we see no reason,however,to decide for this circuit whether the doctrine is viable.if it is,it does not apply in this case.
the conspiracy of which vkk complains is the nfl defendants scheme to prevent franchise relocation.but insofar as vkk is concerned,the conspiracy was complete when it agreed to sell the patriots to orthwein because vkk could not move the team.the release therefore was not part and parcel of the alleged conspiracy insofar as vkk was a victim of it.it only stopped vkk from bringing suit to recover treble damages for its alleged victimization.
vkk proffers two theories as to why the release was nonetheless an integral part of the nfl defendants conspiracy first,i f kiam could sue and establish that the nfl efforts to keep him in new england violated the antitrust laws,then the nfl defendants could not keep any subsequent owner hostage in new england.appellants br.at.second,the terms of the r elease document itself exposed the member clubs to liability if they allowed orthwein to move.id.
we think that those asserted consequences of kiam signing of the release are insufficient to render the release an integral part of the alleged conspiracy.as to the first,there was nothing to prevent vkk from bringing an action under the antitrust laws against the defendants in,while it was actually being prevented by the nfl from relocating and before kiam signed the release.there is similarly nothing to prevent another member club denied the ability to relocate to begin litigation to challenge the nfl behavior.while the release might have been useful to the alleged conspirators in fending off such a challenge from vkk,the alleged conspiracy could plainly have proceeded without it.it was therefore not an integral part of a scheme to violate the antitrust laws.
vkk argument also proves too much.it is not uncommon,we assume,for a release to prevent the releasor from bringing suit against the releasee for engaging in a conspiracy that is later alleged to have continued after the release execution.such a release would seem always to protect the ongoing conspiracy because it always prevents the releasor from beginning litigation that would establish the scheme illegality.we do not think that the part and parcel doctrine can be read so broadly as thus to render void all releases relating to conspiracies alleged to continue.
the second basis for vkk argument fares worse than the first.vkk asserts 
at an april,meeting,before allowing the owners to vote on orthwein purchase of the patriots,nfl officials required orthwein to sign a commitment not to sue the nfl if he were prevented from the nfl trumpeted as an ironclad commitment that he would not move.
appellants br.at.emphasis omitted in light of this ironclad commitment,allegedly obtained as part of the nfl illegal conspiracy to prevent franchise relocation,the fact that the release also exposed the member clubs to liability if they allowed orthwein to move,id.at though arguably of some benefit to the nfl,hardly made the release an integral part of the scheme.orthwein could not move the team in any event.
we conclude,therefore,that whatever the status of the part and parcel doctrine,the release was not invalid under it because it was not an integral part of the nfl defendants alleged conspiracy 
absence of consideration 
vkk asserts,finally,that the release fails for want of consideration.citing maynard durham ry,d,vkk contends that federal law applies,and that under federal law,consideration is required to render a release enforceable.vkk alleges that all it received in return for the release was permission to sell the patriots,a right the nfl owners had already granted by approving the sale.in reply,the defendants argue that under new york law,which governs because the release contains a new york choice of law clause,a written release is valid even in the absence of consideration and that even if federal law applies,there was adequate consideration for the release because vkk was allowed to sell the patriots and received substantial consideration for doing so.the defendants do not dispute that consideration is required under federal law.
we agree with the district court that we need not resolve the question of which law is applicable.if new york law applies,the release is valid under oblig.law,which provides that a written instrument which purports to be a total or partial release of all claims shall not be invalid because of the absence of consideration or of a seal.and under federal law,as the district court observed,the plaintiffs received valuable consideration because,i n exchange for executing the release,vkk received the nfl consent to transfer ownership of the patriots.vkk,d at see also brock entre computer,cir consent to franchise transfer was adequate consideration for release.vkk argument that the sale had already been approved by the nfl and that the release is not binding because of the lack of consideration given in return therefore fails.
ii.whether tji was a properly added party 
while we thus agree that the action against the nfl defendants was properly dismissed,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to tji and tjl.
relation back of the complaint.
the district court decided that vkk amended complaint,which added tji as a defendant,did not relate back to the filing of the initial complaint and that the claims against tji were thus.vkk football league.we review for abuse of discretion a district court determination that an amended complaint does not relate back to the original complaint.see leonelli pennwalt,cir wilson fairchild republic,cir.
if a complaint is amended to include an additional defendant after the statute of limitations has run,the amended complaint is not time barred if it relates back to a timely filed complaint.see.c.the goal of principles is to prevent parties against whom claims are made from taking unjust advantage of otherwise inconsequential pleading errors to sustain a limitations defense.advanced magnetics,bayfront partners,cir quoting.advisory committee note internal quotation marks omitted.rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure describes the requirements necessary for an amended complaint to relate back to an original complaint 
an amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when 
the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading,or 
the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the foregoing provision is satisfied and,within days of filing the complaint,the party to be brought in by amendment a has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits,and b knew or should have known that,but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party,the action would have been brought against the party.
there are thus three requirements that must be met before an amended complaint that names a new party can be deemed to relate back to the original timely complaint.first,both complaints must arise out of the same conduct,transaction,or occurrence.second,the additional defendant must have been omitted from the original complaint by mistake.third,the additional defendant must not be prejudiced by the delay.see soto brooklyn corr.facility,cir.vkk amended complaint meets all three requirements.
first,both the original and the amended complaints arise out of the same conduct the alleged agreement between tji and the nfl defendants pursuant to which tji discontinued negotiations with vkk for relocation of the patriots to jacksonville.
second,tji was omitted from the original complaint because of a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party.c b.the district court concluded that tji was strat
