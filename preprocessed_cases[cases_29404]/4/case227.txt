in this case,we must decide whether defendants are criminally liable for a scheme that raised the prices the department of defense dod pays to transport its personnel belongings overseas.defendants have admitted to orchestrating this scheme and have agreed to accept liability under the sherman act,and the federal statute,if we determine that their behavior is not immune from such liability under the shipping act,app.we hold that the shipping act immunity provisions afford defendants no relief from liability for the antitrust violation and conspiracy to defraud they have admitted.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for resentencing.
when personnel of the dod are posted to foreign countries,the international through government bill of lading program itgbl covers their moving expenses.the dod contracts with private companies to provide this service.under the military traffic management command mtmc,bids are solicited for through rates from freight forwarding companies.a through rate is a payment encompassing all the costs involved in a move of dod personnel household effects.bidding for through rates occurs biannually and involves a two step process.
in the first step,or initial filing,the freight forwarders file a bid for a through rate associated with a particular route,or channel.the low bid that emerges is referred to as the prime through rate.mtmc publishes this bid and the next four lowest bids.the company that bids the prime is entitled to a set percentage of dod freight business for the associated channel.
in the second step,other freight forwarders resubmit bids in light of the published prime.the remaining companies may match,or,the prime for each channel,or they may bid a higher rate.when the channel at issue operates in a competitive market,a forwarder must typically the prime to receive any dod business.forwarders that the prime are also entitled to a set portion of dod business for the cycle and channel for which they have bid.
because through rates are unitary,they encompass many costs,all of which the forwarders become responsible for when the dod accepts their bids.some of these costs relate to moving services undertaken by other firms along the channel.costs of this sort cover five general categories of service the carriage of goods between inland cities and ports,services performed at ports,ocean transportation between and foreign ports,foreign port services,and carriage of goods between foreign ports and foreign inland points.freight forwarders must naturally consider these costs in setting their bids.
defendant gosselin world wide moving gosselin,a belgian corporation,and defendant the pasha group pasha,a corporation,operate in the channels between the united states and germany.both companies provide a package covering local german moving agent services,european port services,and ocean transport services in this market.defendants thus deal with goods shipments between german points of origin the households of dod personnel abroad and ports of destination.gosselin and pasha offer a landed rate,which is a fee that covers all the moving costs involved in the portion of the channels they service.
defendants also act as the exclusive agents of the international shippers association isa,a conference of freight forwarders organized to negotiate collectively with shippers operating in the through transportation market.many of the freight forwarders who place bids in the mtmc are also isa members.in their capacity as isa agents,gosselin and pasha negotiate service contracts with the trans atlantic american flag line operators taaflo,a group of ocean carriers.taaflo service contract with the isa entitles all isa members to ocean transportation with taaflo at a predetermined rate.
in late,initial filings for the summer bidding cycle of occurred.a freight forwarder filed prime through rates with the mtmc for of the channels between germany and the did not use the landed rate offered by either defendant.instead,by negotiating separately with each service provider at every step of the transportation chain,was able to undercut its competitors by three dollars per hundredweight in twelve of the channels.in december,dod published prime bid along with the next four lowest.the remaining forwarders then had until january,to file their second round bids.
gosselin was evidently alarmed that had been able to for the twelve channels without using gosselin landed rate.later in december,gosselin managing director sent an email to another landed rate provider,inviting the provider to collude with gosselin to prevent the rates for the twelve routes at issue from converging to the prime.such convergence was likely,as we have noted,because of the competitiveness of the through transportation market.the gosselin managing director observed that by not taking bid into consideration we would increase the rate level with an average of.the director opined that t his is the only thing that in my mind can happen.in a reply email sent the same day,an executive at the competitor concurred,noting that if we do not react and give the industry a clear message which rate to base the bids on,then everyone will use the low rate and later expect us to reduce our rates so those carriers can work under their rates.
shortly after this exchange,gosselin managing director forwarded the emails to the president of pasha.the gosselin executive identified the twelve channels,which had quite some money on the table,and inquired what rate levels would you be able to support if those channels would go to second level the director stressed that it is important we move rather quickly now.pasha later indicated its willingness to cooperate.
defendants faced a difficult task in preventing the imminent bids from converging to the prime.had already demonstrated that defendants landed rates could be undercut by contracting separately for each transportation segment along the twelve channels.defendants therefore had to take preemptive action to prevent the remaining forwarders from following lead.in early january,the managing director of gosselin agreed in writing to pay twelve of the largest german moving agents a specified fee.the german agents,for their part,agreed not to handle business from freight forwarders in those channels unless the forwarders submitted bids at the second lowest level the second low or above.gosselin thereafter arranged a telefax to freight forwarders who were finalizing their bids advising them of the german agents undertaking.
not content with securing their share of the dod business designated for the bids,defendants set about eliminating prime rate in the twelve channels at issue.first,they persuaded to cancel its bid with the mtmc if the remaining freight forwarders would file bids at or above the level.defendants then secured such an agreement from the remaining forwarders.the forwarders overwhelmingly honored this agreement,and those who strayed below the level were persuaded to withdraw their competitive bids.
as a result of defendants scheme,a good deal of household goods shipments during the summer cycle in the twelve channels occurred at or above the rate.the net financial effect of the conspiracy was to cause the dod to pay substantially more than if original prime rate had prevailed.
the department of justice doj charged defendants by information with two counts.the first count alleged a conspiracy to restrain trade in violation of the sherman act.the second count alleged a conspiracy to defraud the united states under.
defendants agreed to conditional pleas.they stipulated to a statement of facts on the basis of which they would move the district court to dismiss both counts.gosselin and pasha agreed in their pleas to make only one argument in support of their motion to dismiss that the conduct set forth in the statement of facts is immune from prosecution under the shipping act.if the district court found such immunity with respect to both counts,and this finding was affirmed on appeal,defendants would not enter a guilty plea.if the district court denied the motion as to either or both counts,however,the defendant would plead guilty on the remaining counts subject to withdrawal if a higher court overturned the district court finding.the plea agreements also indicated that the parties would recommend to the district court specified sentences in the form of financial penalties depending on which count or counts survived the motion to dismiss.
pursuant to the plea agreement,defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of immunity under the shipping act,app.the district court granted the motion with respect to the antitrust count,but denied it with respect to the conspiracy to defraud count.following the arrangement set out in the plea agreements,gosselin and pasha pled guilty to the conspiracy to defraud count.again pursuant to the pleas,the district court imposed on each defendant a criminal fine of million.after the final sentencing order,the doj appealed the dismissal on immunity grounds of the antitrust count and defendants their convictions on the conspiracy to defraud count.we now address these appeals,beginning with the issue of immunity under the shipping act.
defendants collusion with each other and with other firms operating in the twelve transportation channels clearly violated the sherman act injunction on combinations in restraint of trade.it has been held too often to require elaboration that price fixing is contrary to the policy of competition underlying the sherman act united states mckesson robbins.defendants scheme,which prevented second round bids from converging to the prime and even erased first round prime bid,amounted to naked bid rigging.and bid rigging agreement is agreement of the simplest kind.united states portsmouth paving corp,cir quoting united states bensinger,cir see also united states brinkley son const,cir.criminal antitrust liability is therefore appropriate unless defendants enjoy immunity under another federal law.
the supreme court has consistently construed the reach of exemptions from antitrust laws narrowly,even when congress confers these exemptions in terms.see,union labor life ins.pireno,d.this narrow construction of antitrust immunity is appropriate because the robust marketplace competition that antitrust laws protect is a fundamental national economic policy.carnation pac.westbound conference,d see also otter tail power united states,d.this canon of construction has been employed by the supreme court to defeat antitrust exemptions claimed under provisions of the act,see group life health ins.royal drug,d,the and mcguire acts,see mckesson,at,and the agricultural marketing agreement act,see united states borden.
defendants here claim exemption from antitrust law under a federal maritime statute,the shipping act of.app.the act modified an earlier law enacted in.see.the earlier enactment grew out of the difficulties faced by the shipping industry in the early part of the last century.see generally puerto rico ports auth.fmc,cir plaquemines port,harbor and terminal dist.fmc.to set shippers on an equal footing with foreign competitors,who operated outside of antitrust strictures,congress granted them limited antitrust immunity.see.
this immunity,however,came with regulatory strings attached.see id.the regulatory requirements of the act were designed to prevent the maritime transportation industry from monopolistically abusing its newly conferred grant of immunity.see puerto rico ports,at.regulation under the act thus preserved some prohibitions.see a e pacific const.saipan stevedore,cir plaquemines,at.nonetheless,regulated firms did enjoy the real benefit of operating outside the full strictures of federal antitrust laws.mindful of this benefit,the supreme court concluded that the traditional canon of narrow construction,applicable to antitrust exemptions generally,applied with full force to the coverage provisions of the act.see fmc seatrain lines,d carnation,at.
the act was supplemented by the shipping act of,app.although the act contained several new grants of antitrust immunity,see id.a,nowhere in the act did congress indicate an intention to override the principle of narrow construction for antitrust exemptions that the supreme court had long applied to the act.moreover,this interpretive maxim has informed the construction of every other grant of antitrust immunity in federal legislation.we therefore see no reason to depart from ordinary practice in construing the act.
with the foregoing interpretive framework in mind,we turn to defendants particular contentions.the district court found antitrust immunity for gosselin and pasha in three distinct statutory provisions of the shipping act.we address immunity under each statutory provision separately 
defendants first claim immunity under app.a,which exempts from antitrust liability any agreement or activity concerning the foreign inland segment of through transportation that is part of transportation provided in a united states import or export trade.
defendants argue that this provision covers all aspects of their scheme to rig bids.the first step in this scheme,defendants emphasize,was the agreement with twelve large german local agents to handle no business from forwarders who filed bids below the second low level.this agreement,defendants claim,is covered by a because the german agents provide only services between german ports and destinations in the foreign inland segment.gosselin and pasha had market leverage only in this segment in the other segment they service,ocean transportation,they were constrained by their status as isa agents and the strict terms of the taaflo service contract.thus the success of the remainder of their scheme depended entirely on the continued viability of the arrangement defendants had reached with the local german firms.for this reason,defendants conclude,the scheme in its entirety should be covered by the immunity provision of a.
we do not believe that the statutory exemption extends as far as gosselin and pasha would have it.to begin with,the statutory language does not support defendants position.for an agreement or activity to concern the foreign inland segment,a emphasis added,as the statute requires,the parties undertaking the agreement or participating in the activity must have in mind some consequence for the foreign inland segment that they intend their behavior to have.accord hileman pittsburgh lake erie,cir c oncerning is essentially a connecting term,the scope and meaning of which is defined in part by the terms it modifies.commerford thompson,observing that the broadest sense of the term concerning is pertaining to or relative to.because defendants collusive effort was aimed at the entire through transportation market,rather than just the foreign inland segment,we do not think that they can claim exemption from antitrust liability under a.indeed,defendants fixed bids for through transportation rates,rates,not just rates for the foreign inland segment of the routes.a.
it is true that defendants original agreement with the german local agents may have had the relationship to a foreign inland segment that the statute requires.id.indeed,united states tucor int l,d,aff,cir,the case upon which gosselin and pasha chiefly rely,awarded immunity under the shipping act.in tucor,several philippine firms,operating in a through transportation market packed,picked up,and trucked household shipments of military personnel from subic naval base and clark air force base to a philippine seaport.at.the firms were indicted under the sherman act for conspiring amongst each other to suppress competition by fixing prices.tucor,d at.defendants pled guilty,but the district court later dismissed the indictments on the basis of immunity under a.the ninth circuit affirmed,finding that a reference to a foreign inland segment,unambiguously exempts the activities of defendants,tucor,at,occurring as they did between points entirely within a foreign country.id.at.
there is an argument to be made that the agreement defendants made with the local german firms fits under the immunity announced in tucor.and if defendants scheme had ended there,we would have to decide whether the agreement did so qualify and whether tucor should be adopted in this circuit.but the scheme did not stop there.rather,gosselin and pasha took additional steps to perfect their plan.and we are not persuaded that these additional steps concerned the foreign inland segment,in the manner the statute requires.a.
gosselin and pasha contacts with,for instance,related not to foreign inland services,but to defendants desire that withdraw the prime through rate bid it had filed with mtmc.similarly,the agreement defendants secured from other freight forwarders to file bids at or above the second low level had little to do with the german inland segment of the through services these forwarders offered.rather,the agreement was a precommitment mechanism to ensure that none of the freight forwarders defected from the anticompetitive cartel that defendants were assembling.when some of these forwarders later broke ranks,defendants instituted measures to reign them in.but these measures were designed only to secure withdrawal of the competitive through rate bids the forwarders had filed in the second round,not to have consequences for the foreign inland segment.
in short,none of the additional steps gosselin and pasha took beyond their agreement with the german local agents had intended effects for any aspect of the german inland part of the through transportation market.it is unclear,therefore,how these steps concerned this foreign inland segment,as they must for immunity to attach under a.
moreover,a broad immunity of the sort that gosselin and pasha seek would threaten to excise antitrust liability from the through transportation market completely.if a exempted from all stages of a conspiracy that involves in some manner a foreign inland segment,then any firm operating in any segment of any through transportation channel need only execute an agreement with a local moving agent to shield itself from the antitrust laws entirely.it does not take much to imagine how sophisticated transportation firms,intent on reaping larger gains,might abuse the immunity of such a rule.the incentives for opportunistic associations with companies operating in foreign inland segments would simply be too great.and without the constraint of anticipated antitrust liability,the prices charged by companies in the through transportation market would escalate.further,the agreements and activity for which defendants seek immunity here were not regulated by the fmc.lack of regulatory oversight might only exacerbate the upward pressure on prices for through transportation engendered by the absence of antitrust liability.
the upshot of defendants interpretation of a would therefore be a through transportation market beset with collusive and artificially inflated bids,detrimental to consumers and competitors alike.the government,as a repeat purchaser,would stand to lose much,and the extra money it would have to pay would come from the fisc and thus taxpayers.
it is unlikely that congress intended such dismaying effects,but if there is any doubt over whether a affords defendants relief,it is settled by the maxim that exceptions to the antitrust laws should be construed narrowly.see seatrain,at.the supreme court has relied on this principle to render agreements subject to the antitrust laws rather than the lesser anticompetitive protections of fmc regulation.see id.here defendants seek exemption from legal enforcement by the doj for agreements that have not been regulated by the fmc.we hold for reasons earlier expressed that a does not immunize defendants scheme to raise through rate bids in the twelve channels at issue.
defendants next claim immunity under a.that section exempts from antitrust laws 
any activity or agreement within the scope of this chapter undertaken or entered into with a reasonable basis to conclude that a it is pursuant to an agreement on file with the fmc and in effect when the activity took place,or b it is exempt ed by the fmc under from any filing or publication requirement of this chapter.
defendants do not claim that their activity or agreement s were undertaken pursuant to an agreement on file with the fmc.rather,they point to a tariff filing exemption that the fmc granted to operating common carriers,like defendants,for the t ransportation of used military household goods and personal effects by ocean transportation intermediaries.c.gosselin and pasha argue that they reasonably believed their collusive activit ies and agreement s to be exempt from the filing requirements of the shipping act under this regulation,and thus beyond the antitrust laws under a b.
the touchstone of a b is reasonableness.yet the terms of the exemption on which defendants rely,and other features of the regulatory framework in which defendants operate,demonstrate that their reliance was,if anything,unreasonable.
to begin with,the exemption facially covers only tariffs,see a,not the kind of agreements and activities involved in defendants bid rigging scheme.yet a distinction between tariffs on the one hand and operating agreements on the other pervades the shipping act.compare a cataloguing the agreements by or among ocean common carriers to which the chapter applies,including agreements to discuss,fix,or regulate transportation rates,with describing tariffs that each common carrier and conference shall keep open to public inspection.this statutory distinction makes implausible defendants claim that they understood the reference to tariffs in the exemption to cover the collusive agreements they secured during the course of their scheme 
the terms of,the shipping act provision mentioned in a b which governs the fmc exemption procedures,further erodes gosselin and pasha claim of immunity under a b.section conditions exemption from the disclosure requirements of the act on a finding by the fmc that the exemption will not result in substantial reduction in competition or be detrimental to commerce.the fmc was thus required to make such a finding before passing the tariff filing dispensation on which defendants claim to have relied.
section is quite clear in laying out the criteria for the granting of filing exemptions no substantial reduction in competition nor a detriment to commerce may result from the exemption.the agreements that defendants secured during their bid rigging scheme,however,accomplished just those ends indeed,it was precisely by a reduction in competition that gosselin and pasha succeeded in inflating bids above the prime level,and this result was clearly detrimental to commerce.the incongruence between the conditions that sets forth and the effects of defendants scheme erodes defendants claim that they reasonably understood the tariff filing exemption to permit such activity.
pasha and gosselin complain that the ex ante judgment of the fmc under should not apply ex post to our interpretation of the reasonableness standard under a b.but the statutory phrase with a reasonable basis to conclude,a,clearly contemplates an inquiry into the propriety of a party belief in light of the circumstances.and one of those circumstances is surely the terms of the statute governing the exemption.as sophisticated businesses operating in a regulatory regime,defendants are properly charged with knowledge of the statute that applies to their behavior.accord hal roach studios,richard feiner,cir citing kansas power light burlington northern,indicating that specialized knowledge including of statutory law may properly be presumed of parties according to their experience.thus aware of the criteria set forth in,gosselin and pasha can hardly claim a reasonable basis to conclude that their behavior was covered by the tariff filing exemption.a.an exemption conditioned upon no substantial reduction in competition simply should not be read to sanction,in any manner,behavior intended to accomplish just such a reduction.
moreover,defendants position flies once again in the face of the maxim that exceptions to antitrust liability should be narrowly construed.gosselin and pasha claim that the scope of the tariff filing exemption somehow applies to the stark anticompetitive agreements here is simply not persuasive.section a b may well extend to behavior taken pursuant to an fmc
