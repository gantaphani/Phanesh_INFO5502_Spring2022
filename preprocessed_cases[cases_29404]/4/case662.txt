plaintiff brian reid was employed by defendant google,google from june until april when reid was terminated.reid was at the time.following his termination,reid filed a lawsuit against google for unfair business practices under california unfair competition law ucl bus,et,based on google alleged discriminatory hiring practices.reid also asserts causes of action for disparate treatment under california fair employment and housing act feha,et,wrongful termination,failure to prevent discrimination,and emotional distress.
on google motion,the trial court struck reid ucl claims based on the provisions of proposition.in addition,the court granted google motion for summary judgment as to the remaining claims.
on appeal,reid asserts the trial court erred in striking his allegations of unlawful hiring and promotion claims from his complaint,and in granting google motion for summary judgment as to the remaining causes of action in his complaint.
statement of the facts and case 
reid,age at the time,was hired by google in june as director of operations and director of engineering.reid is a phd.in computer science and a former associate professor in electrical engineering at stanford university.
the other high level employees with whom reid dealt while at google were ceo chief executive officer eric schmidt,age,vice president of engineering wayne rosing,age,urs hoelzle,age,and founders sergey brin,age,and larry page,age.rosing made the decision to hire reid,and reid reported to rosing,and hoelzle at times throughout his employment at google.
in reid only written performance review while employed at google,rosing described reid as having an extraordinarily broad range of knowledge concerning operations,engineering in general and an aptitude and orientation towards operational and it issues,he project s confidence when dealing with fast changing situations,has an excellent attitude about what ops and support mean,is very intelligent,creative,a problem solver,and that the vast majority of ops run great.reid was given a performance rating indicating he consistently met expectations.from february to february,reid received bonuses including stock options.
reid performance review also contained the following statement by rosing adapting to the google culture is the primary task for the first year here right or wrong,google is simply different younger contributors,inexperienced first line managers,and the super fast pace are just a few examples of the environment.when reid was later terminated,he was told by rosing that he was not a cultural fit.
while reid was employed at google,he was subject to derogatory comments by employees.for example,hoelzle told reid his opinions and ideas were obsolete,and too old to matter.hoelzle told reid he was slow,fuzzy,sluggish,lethargic,did not display a sense of urgency,and lack ed energy.hoelzle made age related comments to reid every few weeks 
reid was also subject to derogatory comments from colleagues within the organization,who referred to reid as an old man,an old guy,an old.they told him his knowledge was ancient,and joked that the cd jewel case office placard should be an lp instead of a cd.
on october,rosing removed reid from the director of operations position and removed his responsibilities and reports as director of engineering.rosing decision to move reid into the position and remove the director of operations was instigated by hoelzle.although reid was permitted to retain his title as director of engineering,reid was moved into a new role at google to develop and implement a new program aimed at retaining engineers by enabling them to obtain a master degree in engineering by attending courses taught by carnegie melon university professors at google.ceo schmidt assured reid that the graduate degree program was important and that the work on it would require another five years.reid was not given a budget or a staff to support the graduate program.
when reid was moved into the graduate program,hoelzle,years younger than reid,took over his responsibilities as director of operations,and douglas merrill,years younger than reid,assumed reid other duties.
in january,brin,page,rosing and hoelzle made a collective decision to pay reid a zero bonus for his work done in.meanwhile,schmidt sent an to rosing asking for a proposal from him on getting reid out in rosing response to schmidt,rosing expressed concern about the group decision regarding reid bonus,stating he was having second thoughts about the full zero out of the bonus versus treating it consistent with all similarly situated performers.rosing instead determined that reid should receive a bonus of,in addition to some other suggested terms of a severance agreement,to avoid a judge concluding we acted harshly 
on february,rosing met with reid and told him he was not a cultural fit,and there was no longer a place for him in the engineering department.reid asked rosing who made the decision to terminate him,and specifically asked if larry page made the decision and rosing nodded in a manner indicating a yes.rosing encouraged reid to apply for positions with other departments.google maintains that rosing told reid that the graduate program was being eliminated,and that was the reason for his termination.however,reid disputes this,and maintains that he was not told any reason for his termination other than lack of cultural fit,and he believed the graduate program would continue.
among various employees of google show that there was no intention of hiring reid in another department after he was removed from engineering.shona brown,vice president of business operations wrote you should make sure i am appropriately prepped.my line at the moment is that there is no role for him in the hr organization.she later wrote we should probably get me clear on this before tomorrow.hr director sullivan sent an email to rosing and brown stating,seems reid first interest is to continue his work on the college programs he been working on.he explore that option first with both of you.sullivan continued i propose brown meets with reid this and lets him know there no role for him in her org i talked with chief financial officer cfo george reyes live,he will not have an option for brian this is the company decision.sullivan also wrote we all agree on the job elimination angle 
ten days after he was terminated from engineering,reid met with cfo george reyes,who told him there was no position in his department.reid then met with brown,who also stated there were no positions for him in her department,and told him there were no openings for reid because he was not a cultural fit at google.
reid turned in his access card on february,and no longer returned to google.pursuant to a severance package,reid was paid salary and health benefits,and his stock options continued to vest until april.
reid filed suit against google on july.the original complaint alleged causes of action.reid subsequently filed an amended complaint alleging two additional causes of action.the causes of action were ucl violations related to google discrimination based on age age discrimination under feha disability discrimination under feha wrongful termination in violation of public policy failure to prevent discrimination negligent infliction of emotional distress intentional infliction of emotional distress fraud in the inducement violation of california labor code section violation of the california labor code section breach of an implied contract for long term employment and payment of a guaranteed bonus amount and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.reid sought injunctive relief,disgorgement of profits,restitution of lost stock options,and attorney fees and costs.
google demurred to reid sixth,eighth,eleventh and twelfth causes of action,and filed a motion to strike certain allegations related to reid ucl and breach of implied contract claims.the trial court sustained the demurrer to reid eighth cause of action for fraud in the inducement.the court granted google motion to strike the allegations regarding implied contract for long term employment,and the allegations regarding google discriminatory hiring and promotion practices.the court also struck reid prayer for relief to recover lost stock options as restitution under the ucl.
google then filed a motion for summary judgment as to the remaining claims,and the trial court granted the motion.judgment was entered,and reid filed a timely notice of appeal.
with regard to the summary judgment,reid appeals the order granting judgment as to the ucl claims in the first cause of action disparate treatment and impact claims in the second cause of action wrongful termination in violation of public policy in the fourth cause of action failure to prevent discrimination in the fifth cause of action negligent infliction of emotional distress in the sixth cause of action and intentional infliction of emotional distress in the seventh cause of action.
discussion 
reid appeals the order striking the unlawful and unfair hiring and promotion practices allegations from his ucl claim in the fist cause of action,and this ucl prayer for restitution of lost stock options the trial court order denying discovery of google applicant data and the order granting summary judgment as to the first,second,fourth,fifth,sixth,and seventh causes of action.
motion to strike reid ucl claims related to hiring and promotion 
on appeal,reid asserts the trial court erred by applying the provisions of proposition retroactively,and striking the ucl claims related to unfair hiring and promotion from his complaint.
proposition was passed by the voters of california in,and changed the ucl provisions to prohibit attorneys from filing lawsuits for unfair competition where they have no client who has been injured in fact by the alleged practice.
reid lawsuit in this case was filed before proposition was passed.google filed a motion to strike the ucl provisions of reid complaint using proposition as support,and asserting the reid was not harmed by google hiring practices,because he was never hired and did not seek a promotion by google.the trial court granted the motion,and struck the unfair hiring and promotion claims under the ucl from reid complaint.
at the time this case was filed in our court,the california supreme court was considering the issue of whether proposition could be applied to cases currently pending.on july,the supreme court answered that question in the affirmative.see californians for disability rights mervyn,llc,cal th,d.
we review the trial court grant of google motion to strike under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.tostevin douglas d.here,reid suffered no injury by google hiring and promotion practices.by reid own admission,he was hired by google the only time he ever applied for employment.the basis of his claim,that reid spoke with some vice presidents at google about securing another position at google when he was terminated does not qualify as a rejected application for employment.see,ibarbia regents of university of california d.in addition,reid never applied for a promotion at google.we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting google motion to strike the unfair hiring and promotion claims under the ucl in reid complaint.
because reid did not suffer any injury as a result of google hiring or promotion practices,he lacks standing to assert these claims under the ucl.as such,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting google motion to strike the ucl claims related to hiring and promotion 
motion to strike prayer for restitution under the ucl 
reid asserts the trial court erred in striking his prayer for restitution under the ucl,and specifically asserts he should have the right to seek the unvested stock options that he had at the time of his termination from google.
as to the causes of action under the unfair competition law,while restitution is available under the ucl without individualized proof of the impact,the law does not contemplate recovery for individuals who were not in some way deprived of money or property by means of defendant unfair competition.see korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,korea supply kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,kraus.specifically,a defendant may be compelled to return money obtained through an unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the property was taken,that is,to persons who had an ownership interest in the property kraus,supra,cal th at,d.
reid seeks return of unvested stock options from the time he was terminated.however,unvested stock options are not owned by the option holder.in in re marriage of walker d,the court noted that when an employee like reid is terminated prior to vesting,his stock options are subject to forfeiture,because the options are only earned after they have vested.
here,reid stock options were not earned at the time of his termination,because they had not yet vested.reid at most had an expectancy interest in the options,however,such interest does not constitute ownership for the purpose of restitution.see,korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.
we are not persuaded by reid reliance on in re marriage of hug d.hug for the premise that in some circumstances unvested stock options are owned by the optionee.hug is inapplicable here,because its holding was specifically limited to marital dissolution actions in which a spouse had unvested stock options at the time of dissolution.the hug court held that because some of the time needed to vest the options passed during the marriage,and the husband was still employed with the company and had an expectation of vesting at the time of dissolution,fairness required that the wife share in the interest of the options.id.at.
because an ownership interest is required in order to seek restitution under the ucl,and reid had no ownership interest in his unvested stock options,the trial court was correct in striking the claim for restitution under the ucl.
age discrimination claims 
the feha prohibits an employer from discriminating on the basis of age.in california,courts employ the test that was established in mcdonnell douglas green,d mcdonnell douglas to resolve discrimination claims,including age discrimination.guz bechtel national cal th,d.first,the employee must establish a prima facie case of discrimination.id.at,d.the employee must at least show actions taken by the employer from which one can infer,if such actions remain unexplained,that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a prohibited discriminatory criterion.id.at,d.thus the employee must establish he was a member of a protected class,he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held,he suffered an adverse employment action,such as termination,demotion,or denial of an available job,and some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.ibid.once the employee satisfies this burden,there is a presumption of discrimination,and the burden then shifts to the employer to show that its action was motivated by legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons.id.at,d.a reason is legitimate if it is facially unrelated to a prohibited bias,and which if true,would preclude a finding of discrimination.id.at,d.if the employer meets this burden,the employee then must show that the employer reasons are pretexts for discrimination,or produce other evidence of intentional discrimination.id.at,d.
although the three part test for pretext stated above appears to be the law in discrimination cases,as we said in reeves safeway stores,th,d reeves,the frequent misconstruction of the mcdonnell douglas decision has led too many courts to replace basic principles of procedure,evidence,and logic with elaborate and essentially arbitrary obstacles to relief.id.at,fn,d.foremost among these is the notion,which pervades innumerable decisions,that on summary judgment in a case of this kind,the ultimate issue is pretext,quoting hugley art institute of chicago d,fn.
in the employment context,a finding of discriminatory motive may be reached without ever finding that the cited reason was pretextual,because the ultimate issue is what really happened,not whether one of the parties is lying about it.if an employer offers an innocent reason for his actions and there is no evidence to the contrary,then he is entitled to summary judgment.but if there is evidence to the contrary,the question of pretext is at best incidental the issue is whether his conduct was in fact motivated entirely by the stated reason or whether discriminatory animus was a cause of that conduct.
summary judgment in age discrimination cases 
when an employer brings a motion for summary judgment in an age discrimination case,and the employer presents admissible evidence either that one or more of plaintiff prima facie elements is lacking,or that the adverse employment action was based on legitimate,nondiscriminatory factors,the employer will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff produces admissible evidence which raises a triable issue of fact material to the defendant showing.caldwell paramount unified school dist.th,d.once the employer meets its burden in the summary judgment motion,the employee must demonstrate a triable issue by producing substantial evidence that the employer stated reasons were untrue or pretextual,or that the employer acted with a discriminatory animus,such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the employer engaged in intentional discrimination or other unlawful action.cucuzza city of santa clara th,d cucuzza.
appellate review of a ruling on a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion is de novo.brassinga city of mountain view th,d.
in this case,the trial court granted defendant summary judgment motion as to all remaining causes of action,finding that google evidence while not sufficient to prove that plaintiff can not establish a prima facie case of age discrimination,it is sufficient to prove that google had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating plaintiff employment in february.the court went on to find reid evidence was not sufficient to raise a permissible inference that in fact,google considered plaintiff age as a motivating factor in terminating his employment.the court noted that because reid had failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to pretext,his other attendant claims should be dismissed.
reid challenges the trial court dismissal of his first,second,fourth,sixth and seventh causes of action 
we note that there is undisputed evidence to support both a prima facie case of age discrimination,as well as a legitimate basis for reid termination.specifically,reid was a member of a protected class,in that he was years old at the time of his termination he was performing competently in the position he held,both in the operations and engineering departments,and as head of the newly created graduate program he suffered an adverse employment action of termination and other circumstance suggests age discrimination as a motive in google action.google establishes a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the termination as elimination of the graduate program,and therefore,job elimination.
in his appeal,reid attempts to raise a triable issue of material fact as to pretext in his termination.t he issue of pretext does not address the correctness or desirability of reasons offered for employment decisions.rather,it addresses the issue of whether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers.citation.mccoy wgn continental broadcasting cir.the employee rebuttal obligation is not satisfied where the employee simply show s the employer decision was wrong,mistaken,or unwise.horn cushman wakefield western,th,d horn.t he employee must demonstrate such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence,citation,and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted nondiscriminatory reasons.morgan regents of the university of california th,d.
here,reid asserts a combination of evidence serves to create a triable issue of material fact that google stated reason of job elimination for his termination was pretextual,such that a rational finder of fact could find the reason unworthy of credence.reid offers statistical evidence of discrimination at google,discriminatory comments made by coworkers as well as decision makers,reid demotion to a position before his termination,and google changed rationales for reid termination.
statistical evidence of discrimination 
reid presented statistical evidence of google practices through the declaration of professor norman matloff,a statistician with years experience in the field.matloff evaluated data for employees in google operations and engineering departments,focusing on dates of birth,quarterly and yearly numerical performance ratings,bonus amounts,job position,educational degrees and salary.matloff did not analyze termination practices within this group because,according to reid,there was only a small number of employees who were involuntarily terminated to date,because google was such a new company at the time.
as part of his analysis,matloff performed a series of multiple regression analyses to determine whether there was any relationship between the age of google employees,the performance ratings they were assigned,and the bonus amounts they received matloff looked for disparity in performance ratings,as well as bonus amount that could be traced to age,as opposed to any other variable.
matloff analyzed employees in the operations and engineering department,and reported that he observed a statistically significant negative correlation between age and performance rating.specifically,for every year increase in age,there was a corresponding decrease in performance rating.the sample size for this finding was.
in addition to limiting the analysis to employees,matloff also analyzed the effect of age on performance ratings for all employees of the operations and engineering department.for this group,matloff found a highly statistically significant negative correlation between age and performance rating.
with regard to an employee bonus amount,matloff performed a regression analysis of employees,finding a statistically significant negative correlation between age and bonus.matloff found a percent decrease in bonus amount related to every year increase in age.the sample size for this analysis was 
google challenges the statistical evidence offered by reid on numerous grounds,including matloff methodology,and sample sizes analyzed.in its order,the trial court issued a ruling pursuant to biljac first interstate bank d.biljac,declining to rule on the specific evidentiary objections,instead opting to rely only on competent and admissible evidence.ibid.
with regard to the trial court duty when presented with objections to evidence in the summary judgment context,the weight of current authority is contrary to the holding in biljac,and seems to agree that the trial court is obligated to rule expressly on all objections,and the court failure to do so may effect a waiver of objections,so that they are not preserved for appellate review.this view appears to have grown out of the statutory command that the trial court consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,except that to which objections have been made and sustained by the court code civ,subd.c,italics added.
however,we believe the biljac decision was substantially correct,and was surely more nearly correct than its critics have been.indeed,based on biljac,in the absence of express rulings by the trial court,as in the present case,we presume either that the trial court ruled correctly on evidentiary objections,or that the court overruled all objections it did not expressly sustain.
contrary to the assumption indulged by a number of courts,the language of code civil procedure section,subdivision c does not mandate express rulings.rather,it reinforces the requirement of express objections by directing the court to consider all evidence,objectionable or not,unless it finds that a meritorious objection has in fact been made.but nowhere is the court commanded to issue an explicit ruling.moreover,even if the statute could be read to impose such a requirement,it does not mandate that in the absence of express rulings the underlying objections are forfeited on appeal.the fact is that when a party properly brings an objection to the trial court,when he files it in proper has done everything he can or should be required to do to bring about a ruling.the fact that a trial court does not expressly rule on such objection should not be interpreted as a waiver of the party objection.
the analysis of waiver of evidentiary objections becomes clearer when viewed in the context of appellate review of evidentiary objections asserted during trial.when an objection is made during the examination of a witness,the examination of the witness can not proceed until the trial court acts on the objection.the most common action is for the trial court to say sustained or overruled,which of course constitutes a clear ruling and preserves the issue for appeal.but if the court fails to make that express statement,we would still consider the issue preserved on appeal.this follows directly from evidence code section,which provides that an objection is preserved for appeal if it is sufficient in form there is no requirement that the objection be expressly ruled upon.
moreover,the lack of an express ruling on an objection in the trial context does not necessitate our finding that no ruling was actually made.for example,if the court permitted the witness to answer,we would find the court impliedly overruled the objection.we would infer the the court sustained the the court instructed the witness not to answer,told the questioner to proceed to his next question,or struck any answer the witness had already given.we would not deem the lack of an express ruling on an objection as a forfeiture of the objection on appeal.
the trial practice circumstance most nearly analogous to the court procedure in a summary judgment motion is that in which the court permits a party to adduce evidence over his opponent objection,while reserving a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence.in such a case,if the court neglects to expressly rule on the objection,it is presumed to have overruled it and admitted the challenged matter into evidence.clopton clopton cal,witkin,cal.evidence ed.presentation at trial,see people flores d.people jacobs d.
in our view,this is the simplest and soundest approach in the present context.if a party lodges otherwise proper objections to evidence,and the court does not rule on those objections at the hearing,the court should be viewed as having reserved a ruling on the objections.its later failure to issue an express ruling effects an implied overruling of all objections,which are therefore preserved for appeal.the entire record is thus presumptively before the appellate court,and the burden is on the objecting party to show that evidence presumptively considered by the trial court should instead be disregarded in determining the propriety of the order on the merits.
we are not persuaded by the notion that we must have evidentiary rulings so that we know what evidence was actually taken into account by the trial court.it does not matter what evidence was taken into account.what matters is what evidence should have been taken into account,and whether the order under or denying summary be sustained in light of that evidence,coupled with the governing substantive law.
in addition,we do not believe that express rulings are necessary to enable the reviewing court to adequately respect the deferential standard of review governing discretionary rulings.while it is true that a trial court enjoys varying amounts of discretion in making some types of evidentiary rulings,many such rulings are not discretionary in the slightest.no court has discretion to admit hearsay evidence,or expert opinion by an unqualified witness,or testimony manifestly lacking any foundation in personal knowledge,over proper objection.even where an objection is of a type usually invoking the trial court discretionary powers,the deferential standards of review should have limited scope as applied in the present context.because summary judgment is decided entirely on the papers,and presents only a question of law,it affords very few occasions,if any,for truly discretionary rulings on questions of evidence.nor is the trial court often,if ever,in a better position than a reviewing court to weigh the discretionary factors.in our view,all reasonable doubts about the admissibility of evidence,like doubts on other aspects of the motion,must be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.
express trial court rulings on a summary judgment motion would not necessarily make the appellate process any surer,fairer,or more efficient.insofar as an evidentiary issue is potentially dispositive of a party right to summary judgment,that issue is virtually certain to be reexamined on appeal under an independent judgment standard.this means that we will analyze the issue in exactly the same way,and reach exactly the same result,no matter what the trial court did.
here,google filed proper objections to the statistical evidence offered by reid that the trial court did not expressly rule upon.we infer from the lack of an express ruling on the objections that the trial court impliedly overruled them,and considered the evidence when ruling on the summary judgment.and,we may consider the issue of the admissibility of the statistical evidence on appeal because we do not find the lack of a ruling creates waiver.
statistical evidence is clearly admissible in the present case.an employee such as reid may produce statistical evidence regarding an employer practices to show that the challenged action is consistent with a pattern of discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,supra,at.statistical evidence is relevant if it demonstrates a disparity in treatment and can eliminate any nondiscriminatory explanations for the disparity,such as legitimate selection criteria or chance.barnes,cir.
here,based on our inference from the lack of an express ruling,we find the trial court was correct in considering the statistical evidence when deciding the motion for summary judgment.despite considering the statistical evidence,however,the court clearly erred when it determined that there was no triable issue of material fact arising from that evidence.importantly,google does not offer conflicting expert testimony to dispute reid statistical findings rather,google counsel offers arguments about why the findings are not sound.such argument goes to the weight of the statistical evidence,a task reserved for a jury,not a court on summary judgment.
in a similar case,the court reversed a grant of summary judgment because the statistical evidence presented a triable issue of material fact.in maitland of cir,the parties disputed whether there was inequity in salaries among men and women employed by the university.on summary judgment,the defendant argued the plaintiff had not included enough variables in its statistical regression analysis to sufficiently demonstrate salary disparity.on appeal,the court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant,holding that the probative value of the statistical evidence and whether sufficient variables were used in the regression analysis was a jury question.the court stated i f a regression analysis omits variables,it is for the finder of fact to consider the variables that have been left out of an analysis,and the reasons given for the omissions,and then to determine the weight to accord the study results ibid.
similarly,while google makes numerous arguments about why reid statistical evidence does not demonstrate age discrimination,it does not offer contrary evidence to dispute the statistics.in other words,although google argues the sample sizes were too small in this case,for example,it does not offer a contrary expert opinion of why the small size would affect the results.moreover,matloff attested to the fact that his findings were both highly statistically significant with regard to performance evaluations as related to age,as well as statistically significant with regard to bonus amounts related to age.as such,google argument that the sample sizes are too small does not re
