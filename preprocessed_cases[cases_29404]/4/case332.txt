after specialty construction brands,hereinafter tec,a manufacturer of tile installation products,stopped supplying wholesale materials to miles distributors,miles,miles filed suit against tec,alleging restraint of trade in violation of the sherman act,and a state law claim for interference with prospective business advantage.on february,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of tec on all claims,and miles appealed.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court ruling.
background 
tec manufactures industrial and residential building products,including a line of tile installation products,grout and mortar miles sells numerous brands of tile and,until,carried tec tile installation products.michael miles incorporated the company in,and his son doug is the company current president.although miles was originally centered in northern indiana,its business expanded in,putting it in competition with a number of other tec distributors,including virginia tile,louisville tile,sobol sales,millers wholesale,and american equipment.during the relevant time period,two of miles competitors expanded their businesses as well.both millers wholesale and virginia tile began selling tec products in south bend,indiana,where miles is headquartered.
historically,miles paid more for tec products than some of its competitors,due to a regional pricing system.in march,however,a significant change occurred when tec implemented a new national pricing program that gave all of its distributors an equal opportunity to receive lower prices if they purchased tec product in bulk.as a result,miles began paying the same price for tec materials as virginia tile and louisville tile.although miles began paying less for tec materials,it did not raise its price margins,its markup for resale,which varied based on the volume purchased as a result of tec new pricing,miles prices decreased and were lower than those offered by other tec distributors.
as tec distributors expanded and prices changed,tec began to receive complaints from other distributors about miles pricing.as early as april,louisville tile president,randy parker,complained to tec that miles margins were lower than those charged by louisville tile.in september,a louisville tile representative complained to tec that miles margin on a particular tec product was while louisville price margin was.at some point,parker remarked to doug miles,hey doug,let keep our margins up on tec down here.
during a march trade show,tec nationwide sales manager,christopher bailey,informed doug miles that tec was dissatisfied with miles pricing.although bailey characterized the discussion as one about market tactics rather than price,he conceded that the gist of the meeting was do you have a new price list or what are you doing out there with our product or you causing me headaches.according to miles sales and marketing manager,john zolman,bailey was more blunt during the trade show conversation,warning zolman and doug miles that miles pricing structure would cause problems in indianapolis,that miles prices were too low,and that louisville tile was already complaining about miles pricing.later,at a september meeting,bailey again expressed concerns about miles pricing and asked doug miles to consider raising prices in the field.doug miles and zolman said they would look into the possibility of changing their prices,but ultimately declined to do so.
on april,bailey sent virginia tile general sales manager,jack mulder,an email message in which he wrote,in part it has come to my attention that there may be some lingering concerns or pricing issues with tec,and that my ultimate fear is that we are unaware of these issues and do get a chance to address alleviate them before a radical decision gets made by virginia tile.bailey further stated,we do not want to see a line get brought into virginia tile,and we will do all in our power to make this unnecessary.mulder responded by email the next day expressing concerns that miles price list could force virginia tile to lower its prices.mulder continued,let decide to make a committed effort to responding by ensuring and protecting ours and your market share currently held together.
on july,randy parker emailed jack mulder writing,miles continues to poach work from us in area.it is very important to all that our two companies take the high road and work together.
after receiving more complaints from tec other distributors,bailey considered terminating tec relationship with miles.at a january trade show,bailey approached parker and said,randy,very hypothetically,if we were to terminate our relationship with miles,and i not saying we going to,i saying if we were to do,what would you do in order to make up that massive loss of sales volume parker indicated he would think about it.
in february,tec management discussed terminating miles at its quarterly meeting and decided to begin studying the issue so that tec could revisit it at the next quarterly meeting.bailey instructed two tec strategic area managers,marc mularoni and charlie renner,to research the effects of termination on their respective territories.mularoni approached louisville tile and american equipment to ask whether and how they would make up the lost sales volume if tec terminated miles.louisville tile responded that it would the tec product line to compete against other brands,and it would work with mularoni to sell to existing tec accounts miles customers,as well as new accounts.american equipment also told tec that it would help recapture the market.
meanwhile,renner sought similar feedback from tec distributors in his territory.by april,renner had been in discussions with virginia tile and millers wholesale about the aftermath of terminating miles.a few days later,virginia tile agreed to aggressively pursue the south bend market and to develop a game plan for fort wayne.in an april email exchange,mularoni told renner that louisville indy will be taking tec to fort wayne and will do a blitz with tec when our decision is implemented.
during the course of its discussions with tec,louisville tile also agreed that it would begin selling tec products in its chattanooga store,where it had previously sold only a competing brand similarly,virginia tile agreed to increase its stock of tec products in its cleveland store.renner testified that this increase in tec stock was something we hoped to gain from the decision to terminate miles.
after consulting with the competing distributors,renner and mularoni decided to terminate miles.according to their proposed plan,key distributors would get a heads up so they could be up and rolling before miles learned of its termination.tec would notify miles on a friday at,and,while miles was being notified,miles competitors would send emails and faxes to miles customers.tec also used a promotional giveaway to provide miles customers with an additional incentive to continue buying tec products.
mularoni communicated the final decision to louisville tile and american equipment,and renner informed virginia tile.just before tec informed miles of its decision,virginia tile sent the following memorandum to its sales team 
this morning friday june tec is notifying miles distributing of south bend they will no longer be a tec distributor.this is a culmination of two things many discussions that virginia tile company and miller wholesale has had with tec mgmt and tec consideration for the manner of marketing that miles distributing uses and the compatibility to their long range goals 
we need to relate our knowledge of this event in a very consistent manner.if a customer inquires to the reasoning behind this,our response is to be this is a result of a tec decision whether on the record or off the record,do not imply that it was a result of any discussions we have had or any dissatisfaction we expressed over the manner in which they marketed the line.
tec is counting on virginia tile company to pick up this additional business as it goes back on the street with some extra effort.we are counting on you to find this business and bring it to virginia tile company.if you have any questions please call me immediately.
on june,tec terminated miles.a letter,dated june,and addressed to doug miles,stated in pertinent part 
we have decided to consolidate our distribution channels in the midwest,and have made the difficult decision to cease our direct sales to your company.after august,we can no longer accept purchase orders for shipment to your facilities.this notice allows for a two month transition period.
shortly before the letter arrived,bailey called michael miles to inform him of the termination,telling him that tec was consolidating its distribution in the midwest and that tec had to end its relationship with miles.michael miles was shocked by the news.despite bailey proffered reason for terminating miles,tec closed no other distributors in the midwest in.in fact,mularoni march quarterly report suggested that tec look to expand distribution in markets where there are multiple existing tec customers.
in a may,document entitled miles termination plan,tec laid out talking points concerning reasons for the termination under a heading that said,miles not on premium strategy.the talking points included currently stocking three competing manufacturers in all markets and weak promotional strategy.the document did not mention pricing or consolidation of distribution channels.
until tec terminated miles,it did not complain about the manner in which miles supported the product or express concerns that miles was the brand recognition and generated by other tec distributors further,miles emphasizes that it was not the only tec distributor that stocked competing brands louisville tile,american equipment,and virginia tile all stocked competing brands at some of their stores.miles also notes that its tec product sales vastly exceeded sales of its other two tile installation brands.
suspicious of the circumstances surrounding its termination,miles filed suit against tec on august,alleging antitrust violations.on may,miles amended its complaint,adding a state law claim.on october,tec moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted on february.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
section one of the sherman act forbids contracts,combinations,and conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade.see in re high fructose corn syrup antitrust,cir.although courts generally analyze claims alleging restraint of trade under a rule of reason,certain kinds of agreements will so often prove harmful to competition and so rarely prove justified that plaintiffs need not prove that the agreements are,in fact,anticompetitive.see state oil khan,d nw.wholesale stationers,pac.stationery printing,d.such agreements are unlawful per se.nynex discon,d.relying on the sherman act as well as a derivative state law claim,miles argues that its termination as a tec distributor was anticompetitive per se and that genuine issues of fact precluded the entry of summary judgment.
summary judgment standard 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of tec de novo.gordon united airlines,cir.in considering miles appeal,we draw our own conclusions of law and fact from the record,making all reasonable inferences in favor of miles,and will uphold summary judgment in tec favor only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and tec is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.also.c.
classification of alleged conspiracy 
when an agreement between competitors at the same level of distribution restrains trade,it has traditionally been denominated horizontal.seebus.elecs.sharp elecs,d.trade restraining agreements between firms at different levels of distribution,a wholesale supplier and a retail distributor,are deemed vertical restraints.id.in this case,the district court did not classify the alleged conspiracy as either horizontal or vertical,reasoning that such a classification was immaterial to the outcome.specifically,the court stated 
a review of the cases suggests that whether one classifies the agreement as horizontal or vertical is not of consequence in this case because plaintiff must still prove an agreement to fix the price or price levels after termination.therefore,the appropriate analysis is not whether this agreement is vertical or horizontal,but rather whether the plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence of an agreement to fix price or price levels to withstand a motion for summary judgment.
miles,specialty constr.brands,d.in fact,the classification of the alleged conspiracy is of consequence,because it determines what evidence miles must produce in order to survive summary judgment.to prove a vertical conspiracy that is per se illegal,miles must show an agreement to fix prices.see bus,at.however,certain horizontal conspiracies,like horizontal group boycotts are illegal regardless of price fixing.see nynex,at.if,as miles has suggested,its competitor tile stores conspired together to force tec to terminate miles,then the conspiracy constitutes an antitrust violation see,klor,stores,d noting that horizontal group boycotts have long been forbidden.we therefore consider whether miles has shown that a genuine issue of material fact remains under either a horizontal or vertical conspiracy analysis.
horizontal conspiracy 
a plaintiff may prove a horizontal conspiracy by either direct or circumstantial evidence.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d toys r us,ftc,cir.when a plaintiff attempts to defeat summary judgment by highlighting circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy,some of the evidence must tend to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently rather than in concert.monsanto serv,d toys r us,at.miles argues that it submitted sufficient evidence of concerted action among competing tec distributors so that a reasonable jury could find a horizontal conspiracy.first,it notes that all of the competing tec distributors complained to tec about miles prices.this evidence,however,is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.the supreme court has noted that such complaints are natural and unavoidable reactions by distributors to the activities of their rivals.see monsanto,at.miles must therefore point to evidence other than the complaints that reasonably suggests tec and the other distributors had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.id.at.internal quotation and citations omitted.
miles next identifies threats made by various tec distributors,noting that virginia tile threatened to carry a competing brand of installation products and that louisville tile threatened,among other things,to stop promoting the tec brand.miller wholesale also threatened to bring in another line of installation products.as the supreme court noted in matsushita,although all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmovant on motions for summary judgment,antitrust law limits the range of inferences that can be drawn from ambiguous evidence in a case.at.thus,conduct that is as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not,standing alone,support an inference of antitrust conspiracy.id.at.in this case,the distributors threats are as consistent with permissible competition as with a conspiracy.indeed,distributors can legitimately decide to carry or promote other brands if they are dissatisfied with reduced profits caused by.therefore,the fact that several of miles competitors told tec that they were considering carrying or promoting other tile installation brands does not support the inference that miles competitors conspired together to boycott tec.
naturally,miles attempts to identify additional evidence of concerted action among tec distributors.he relies heavily on the email message between mulder and parker in which parker refers to miles poaching and emphasizes that our two companies take the high road and work together.he also refers to virginia tile memo stating that miles termination resulted from many discussions virginia tile and miller wholesale had with tec management.finally,miles points to the sales blitz by competing distributors to capture business in miles territory.none of this evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact about the existenc
