plaintiffs cibahia tabacos especias ltda.a brazilian cigarette manufacturer,tritent international an importer of cibahia cigarettes,and dwi,llc a kentucky wholesaler of those cigarettes collectively,tritent,filed suit against the commonwealth of kentucky,arguing that two kentucky statutes have effectively prohibited tritent from doing business in the state.the statutes were enacted to effectuate and enforce the provisions of the master settlement agreement msa,a voluntary agreement that has been entered into by states the settling states and most tobacco companies.tritent alleges that because it is not a party to the msa,it has been adversely affected by anticompetitive behavior that has occurred as a result of the kentucky legislation.
in its lawsuit against the state,tritent alleged that the kentucky statutes are preempted by the sherman act,both because the state statutes mandate or authorize unlawful anticompetitive behavior and because they constitute a hybrid restraint on trade.the district court granted kentucky motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.tritent timely appealed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual.the msa 
in the early to,more than states commenced litigation against the tobacco industry,seeking monetary,equitable,and injunctive relief under various and antitrust laws.the general theory of these lawsuits was that the cigarettes produced by the tobacco industry contributed to health problems among the population,which in turn resulted in significant costs to the states public health systems.in response to the various state lawsuits,the tobacco industry mounted a vigorous defense,denying the states allegations of wrongdoing.with no end to the litigation in sight,the states and the tobacco industry began collaborating on a settlement agreement.
in,the attorneys general of states,as well as of the district of columbia,puerto rico,and the virgin islands,entered into the msa with the four largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the united states.these four morris,rj reynolds,brown williamson,and referred to in the msa as the original participating manufacturers opms.at the time the msa became effective,the opms collectively controlled approximately of the domestic market for cigarettes.
the purposes of the msa,from the viewpoint of the settling states,were to prevent youth smoking,to promote public health,and to secure monetary payments from the tobacco manufacturers.in exchange for the opms cooperation in achieving these purposes,the settling states agreed to drop any pending claims against the tobacco industry and to refrain from filing additional claims.the opms,as discussed in detail below,agreed in turn to implement various health measures and to make payments to the settling states in perpetuity.in the msa,the opms agreed to pay a minimum of billion over the first years of the agreement.
since,approximately additional tobacco companies have joined the msa.these companies,referred to as the subsequent participating manufacturers spms,are bound by the msa restrictions and must make payments to the settling states as set forth in the msa.collectively,the opms and the spms are referred to as the participating manufacturers pms.any tobacco company choosing not to participate in the msa is referred to as a nonparticipating manufacturer npm.
the amount of money that the pms are required to annually contribute to the states varies according to several factors.all payments are based primarily on the number of cigarettes sold.for the opms,the payments are determined in accordance with their relative market share as of.the payment amount of a particular opm is also dictated by the volume adjustment,which compares the number of cigarettes sold in each payment year to the number of cigarettes sold in.if the number of cigarettes sold by an opm in a given year is less than the number it sold in,the volume adjustment allows that opm to reduce its payment to the settling states.in other words,a reduction in the amount of cigarettes sold by the opms results in the settling states receiving less money.
the annual payments of the spms are determined by their relative market share as compared to other spms.for the spms that joined the msa within days of its execution,the annual payments are determined by the number of cigarettes an spm sells beyond the grandfathered as the higher of either the individual spm market share in the year the msa was executed or of the spm market share in.if an spm sales volume or market share declines below the grandfathered amount,then it is not required to make any payments to the settling states.spms that failed to join the msa within days of its execution do not receive the benefit of any grandfathered amount.
the payments from the pms are deposited into an escrow account until disbursement to the settling states.each state receives a payment equal to its allocable share,a percentage of the funds held in escrow that has been agreed upon by the settling states and memorialized in the msa.this allocable share as measured by a percentage of the total funds in escrow does not vary according to how many cigarettes are sold in a particular state in a given year.
during the drafting of the msa,the opms and the settling states contemplated that many of the smaller tobacco companies would choose not to join the msa.this failure to join posed a potential problem for both the opms and the settling states.the opms worried that the npms,both because they would not be bound by the advertising and other restrictions in the msa and because they would not be required to make payments to the settling states,would be able to charge lower prices for their cigarettes and thus increase their market share.
although the settling states motivation was different from that of the opms,these states also were concerned about the effect of the tobacco companies that refused to join the msa.the settling states worried that the npms would be able to regulate their sales so as to stay afloat financially while at the same time being effectively.as a result of these twin concerns,the opms and the settling states sought to have the msa provide these other tobacco companies with incentives to join the agreement.
one such incentive,called the npm adjustment,provides that the payments by the pms to the settling states may be adjusted according to the npm adjustment percentage.according to this provision,if a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants determines that the pms have lost market share as a result of compliance with the msa,the pms required payments to the settling states will be reduced to account for the loss.the npm adjustment therefore gives the settling states an incentive to protect the market dominance of the pms,because otherwise the settling states themselves will receive less funds.
in addition to the npm adjustment,the msa contains other provisions to protect the pms.primary among these provisions is a requirement that the settling states adopt complementary legislation to effectuate the msa,with a failure to do so resulting in substantial reductions in the yearly payments.this complementary legislation,enacted by kentucky and the other settling states,is the subject of the present case.
kentucky escrow statute 
as discussed above,kentucky and the other settling states wanted npms to participate in the msa public health provisions or to be otherwise accountable for the harms caused by their products.section of the kentucky code,commonly referred to as the escrow statute,was part of the complementary legislation designed to address this concern.the escrow statute requires a ny tobacco product manufacturer selling cigarettes to consumers within kentucky,whether directly or through a distributor,retailer,or similar intermediary or intermediaries,to do one of the following join the msa as an spm,or deposit into escrow an amount determined by the statute,currently cents per cigarette sold in kentucky or approximately cents per pack.while the funds are held in escrow,the npm receives any interest earned on the funds it deposits.
as originally enacted,the escrow statute provided for the release of the funds under any of the following three circumstances 
a to pay a judgment or settlement on any released claim brought against such tobacco product manufacturer by kentucky or any releasing party located or residing in kentucky 
b to the extent that an npm establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a particular year was greater than the state allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been required to make in that year under the msa had it been a participating manufacturer,the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such npm.
c to the extent not released from escrow under paragraphs a and b of this subsection,funds shall be released from escrow and revert back to such npm years after the date on which they were placed into escrow.
subsection of the escrow statute,as originally drafted,is referred to as the allocable share release asr provision.this provision allowed an npm to receive a refund of all payments in excess of the amount that it would have had to pay to kentucky had the npm been a pm.
the asr provision was intended to equalize the payments made under kentucky escrow statute and the hypothetical payment that the npm would have been required to make had it been a pm.for tobacco companies that sold cigarettes on a nationwide scale,the asr provision served its desired purpose the escrow obligations and the hypothetical msa obligations were substantially the same.not all companies,however,followed this nationwide business model.some companies followed a regional business model,selling their products only in kentucky and a few other states.as a result,those companies were able to obtain refunds of most of the money they placed in escrow.a brief hypothetical scenario will help to illuminate the disparity between the two business models.
assume that an npm operating on a nationwide scale would have been required to pay total to the settling states if it had joined the msa.because kentucky allocable share is approximately,kentucky would have received no more than from the npm in the hypothetical event that the npm became an spm.the npm,pursuant to the asr provision,would have been entitled to a release of any escrowed funds in excess of the that the monetary obligation to kentucky of an npm was similar to that of an spm.under this business model,of course,the npm would have had similar escrow obligations in the other settling states.
assume now that the npm operated only in kentucky.regardless of the number of cigarettes sold in kentucky,the npm would pay the intended to be equivalent to that paid by an spm selling the same number of cigarettes nationwide.the difference,though,is that the npm would still be entitled to a release of all escrowed funds above the that it would have had to pay kentucky under the though all of its sales were targeted in kentucky meaning that it had no escrow obligations in the other settling states.as a result of this disparity,npms operating on a regional level were able to reclaim most of the funds they placed in escrow.this in turn allowed the npms to artificially lower their prices,which,according to kentucky,made the npms cigarettes more attractive to youth.kentucky also believed that this practice resulted in disproportionate harm because,although the npms significantly contributed to cigarette sales in kentucky,they did not contribute in a proportional manner to the funds held in escrow.
as a result of the business practices of various npms,kentucky repealed the asr provision in.the amended version of the statute now reads as follows 
b to the extent that an npm establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow on account of units sold in the state in a particular year was greater than the msa settlement payments,as determined pursuant to section ix i of that agreement,including after final determination of all adjustments,that such manufacturer would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a participating manufacturer,the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such npm 
rather than being based on kentucky allocable share the that kentucky is entitled to under the msa,the escrow obligation under the amended version also known as the asr repealer corresponds to the total msa payment the npm would have been required to pay had it been an spm.as a result of the asr repealer,every manufacturer whose cigarettes are sold in kentucky,regardless of where else the cigarettes are sold,is required to assume the same monetary obligation per cigarette that it would have incurred under the msa,whether or not it actually joined the agreement.
kentucky contraband statute 
the other key piece of complementary legislation is of the kentucky code,commonly referred to as the contraband statute.this statute requires the kentucky department of revenue to maintain a list of all tobacco companies currently in compliance with either the msa or the escrow statute.the list,known as the directory,must be available for public inspection and must contain the names of the complying tobacco manufacturers as well as all of the manufacturers brand families.id.pursuant to of the kentucky code,no distributor may affix a kentucky tax stamp,which is required for lawful cigarette sales,to any cigarette package if the manufacturer of that brand of cigarette is not listed in the directory.tobacco companies that do not abide by either the msa or the escrow statute are therefore effectively prohibited from selling their cigarettes in kentucky.
the alleged effect of the msa and complementary legislation 
shortly before the msa was executed,the opms controlled approximately of the cigarette market in the united states.by,however,this percentage had decreased to.one reason for this change,according to tritent,is that the opms have increased the price per pack of cigarettes in response to the payments required by the msa.because many cigarette smokers make their purchasing decisions based on cost,the higher cost of the opms cigarettes have resulted in a decrease in the opms market share.the opms are now selling less cigarettes,which in turn lessens their payment obligations under the msa because the payments are subject to the volume adjustment.because the msa provides a disincentive for raising market share in the form of higher payments to the settling states,the npms argue that the pms are not willing to engage in price competition.
the npms,however,who are not obligated to make msa payments or to follow the msa advertising restrictions,should hypothetically be able to increase their market share.such an increase actually occurred prior to the enactment of the asr repealer.a report by the national association of attorneys general confirmed that the npms market share greatly increased in the four years subsequent to the execution of the msa.but the npm volume adjustment reduces the pms payment obligations in the face of such competition by the npms.this means that any price competition mounted against the pms by the npms is undermined because the npms payments are based on the escrow statute rather than on the msa,so that the npms do not enjoy a similar reduction.therefore,any increase in the price per pack of cigarettes manufactured by the pms is generally realized as additional profit rather than resulting in increased payments to the settling states.
the escrow statute,according to the npms,further reduces the potential for price competition because it requires all tobacco companies selling cigarettes in or not they have joined the make similar payments to kentucky.finally,the contraband statute effectively prohibits npms from doing business in kentucky if they do not abide by their obligations under either the msa or the escrow statute.tritent argues that these two kentucky statutes collectively result in an anticompetitive scheme.

standard of review 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.harvey great seneca financial,cir.a dismissal of a complaint may be affirmed if it appears that the can prove no set of facts in support of its claim that would entitle it to relief.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.although reviewing courts must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accepting all factual allegations as true,a court is not required to accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.morgan church fried chicken,cir.
preemption under of the sherman act 
section of the sherman act provides in relevant part every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is hereby declared to be illegal.tritent argues that the district court erred in refusing to hold that the sherman act preempts kentucky complementary legislation.as support for this proposition,tritent claims that the escrow and contraband statutes result in output restrictions that are classified by the sherman act as per se illegal and cartel agreements because they are designed to and,if enforced,do result in supracompetitive prices.the district court assumed,for purposes of the motion to dismiss,that the activity about which tritent illegal output cartel did in fact exist.see great seneca,at requiring a court,when considering a motion to dismiss under rule b,to construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and to take all factual allegations as true.tritent contention regarding the legal effect of the complementary legislation,however,was not presumed by the district court.see id.allowing the court to arrive at its own legal conclusions when reviewing a motion to dismiss.the legal effect of the complementary legislation guides our analysis of the sherman act preemption argument.
as in the typical preemption case,determining whether the sherman act preempts the kentucky complementary legislation involves the inquiry of whether there exists an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and state regulatory schemes.rice norman williams,d.the existence of such a conflict must be more than hypothetical or potential.id.a state statute is not preempted by the federal antitrust laws simply because the state scheme might have an anticompetitive effect.
whether a state statute that restrains competition is preempted by the sherman act requires a analysis.first,tritent must demonstrate that the complementary legislation mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases,or places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute.id.at.see also liquor duffy,d our decisions reflect the principle that the federal antitrust laws state laws authorizing or compelling private parties to engage in anticompetitive behavior.
if we conclude that tritent has satisfied the first step of the preemption analysis,we must then consider whether the state statute is saved from preemption by the immunity doctrine as set forth in parker brown.holding that the state as sovereign,imposed the restraint as an act of government which the sherman act did not undertake to prohibit.the rationale behind parker immunity is that congress,in enacting the sherman act,evidenced no intent to restrain state behavior.id.at.in california retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,d,the supreme court discussed parker immunity in detail and established a test for determining whether it saves a state statute from preemption by the sherman act first,the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy second,the policy must be actively supervised by the state itself.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.
we begin by addressing the first part of the sherman act preemption kentucky complementary legislation meets the rice standard of mandating or authorizing anticompetitive behavior in all cases.tritent argues that the escrow statute and contraband statute collectively authorize anticompetitive behavior.according to tritent,the complementary legislation enacted by kentucky to effectuate the provisions of the msa punishes npms and rewards practice that constitutes an illegal per se output cartel.
tritent asserts that the two statutes operate as follows 
when the opms and the settling states entered into the msa,the price of cigarettes soon increased.this allowed the npms to become financially competitive with the opms and later,the spms.without the hindrance of the msa payment obligations and marketing restrictions,the npms should have been able,at least in theory,to capture a larger market share.
the escrow statute,as originally drafted with the asr provision,allowed the npms to offer competitive prices so long as they targeted their sales on a regional basis.once the escrow statute was amended by the asr repealer,however,the npms were no longer able to offer competitive prices.the asr repealer effectively eliminated price competition among cigarette manufacturers.under the current scheme as it operates in kentucky,because all cigarette manufacturers are required to make similar payments regardless of their participation in the msa,the price per pack of cigarettes is essentially equal.moreover,because the npms operate on a lower profit margin than do the larger pms,the escrow are based on to a penalty.
the contraband statute provides the enforcement mechanism for kentucky statutory scheme.while the escrow statute requires npms like tritent to make the yearly payments,the contraband statute prohibits the npms who have not met their monetary obligations under the escrow statute from selling their cigarettes in kentucky because the npms can not obtain the necessary tax stamps.the complementary legislation,then,requires the npms to either raise their prices to cover their payment has the effect of prohibiting the npms from undercutting the pms to abandon the kentucky market.this anticompetitive end result is allegedly mandated by the complementary legislation itself.
the accuracy of tritent characterization regarding the operation of the kentucky statutes is the first issue that we must address on appeal.as discussed above,the supreme court in rice made clear that in order to be preempted by the sherman act,the state statute in question must mandate illegal conduct in all cases.at.this court had occasion to consider the rice requirement in mcneilus truck and manufacturing ohio,cir.in mcneilus,the ohio statute in question required dealers of remanufactured vehicles to either perform their own repairs or to enter into a binding contract with a dealer of new vehicles located within miles of the selling dealer so that customers could obtain service on their vehicles without voiding the manufacturer warranty.id.at.if the dealer of remanufactured vehicles failed to comply with the statute,the statute gave the state the authority to revoke the dealer license.id.
mcneilus,a dealer of remanufactured vehicles,alleged that the ohio law authorized anticompetitive behavior and was thus preempted by the sherman act.id.at.because it could not perform repairs,mcneilus attempted to secure a binding contract with several different dealers of new vehicles.id.at.all of the dealers within miles of mcneilus location refused.id.according to mcneilus,these dealers participated in a group boycott because mcneilus imported its vehicles from out of state,a practice that angered the other ohio dealers.id.because the group boycott was facilitated by the statute,mcneilus alleged that the statute was preempted by the sherman act.id.
this court rejected mcneilus claim.after recognizing that a group boycott was illegal per se under the sherman act,the mcneilus court acknowledged that the ohio law facilitate d the alleged illegal behavior.id.at.such facilitation,however,was not enough to support a holding of preemption.even though the law had anticompetitive effects,the mcneilus court held that preemption was not called for because the statute neither authorizes nor requires that dealers engage in behavior proscribed by the federal antitrust laws.id.in other words,even
