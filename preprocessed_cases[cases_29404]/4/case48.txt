like most states,massachusetts regulates the relationship between motor vehicle manufacturers and motor vehicle dealers in considerable detail.see.laws ch,relying on these rules,a dealer doing business as john santilli center for automobiles santilli brought suit against a manufacturer,general motors corporation gm,alleging that the manufacturer had engaged in a number of unfair practices.gm denied the material allegations of the complaint.without resolving whether the manufacturer had violated the statute,the district court entered summary judgment in its favor on the ground that santilli had not shown any actionable harm flowing from the challenged conduct.discerning no error in the district court thoughtful disposition,we affirm.
i.the statutory scheme 
we begin by limning the purpose,text,and structure of the statute.chapter,familiarly known as the dealers bill of rights,has two central purposes.one is to curb the potentially oppressive power of automobile manufacturers and distributors in relation to their affiliated dealers.beard motors,toyota motor.the other is to regulate competition in the retail automobile industry for the benefit of the public at large.am.honda motor bernardi.
to effectuate these dual objectives,the statute places off limits certain u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.laws ch.these methods,acts,and practices are delineated in section.that section generally proscribes conduct that is arbitrary,in bad faith,or unconscionable.id.it then describes,and specifically prohibits,discrete acts and practices.id.
the statutory scheme maps two remedial avenues.one involves public enforcement the attorney general may enforce the law.id.the other involves private enforcement the statute creates private rights of action for injunctive relief and damages.id.
this case turns on the meaning and operation of section.in pertinent part,that section authorizes a ny franchisee or motor vehicle dealer who suffers any loss of money or property as a result of a violation of the statute by a manufacturer to bring a civil action for equitable relief or damages.a dealer who has not suffered a loss of money or property as a result of an unfair act or practice may still bring an action for equitable not for it can be shown that the unfair act or practice may have the effect of causing such a loss of money or property in the future.id.
ii.the facts 
consistent with the summary judgment standard,we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to santilli.see houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir.
for many years,santilli has operated an independent automobile dealership in brockton,massachusetts.it is,inter alia,licensed to sell the cadillac line of vehicles cadillac is a gm brand and all licensed cadillac dealers are,therefore,gm franchisees.during the same time frame,norwood cadillac has operated a cadillac dealership in norwood,massachusetts.by,the two dealerships had been in competition for several years.for purposes of this appeal,we do not norwood cadillac is within santilli relevant market area rma,as that term is defined in.laws ch,k 
in the late,gm inaugurated the project msp,a program designed to increase gm presence in certain geographic markets.under the aegis of the msp,gm aspired to create joint ventures with successful independent dealers so that the latter could own multiple dealerships thus achieving economies of scale and,not coincidentally,improving sales of gm vehicles in the targeted markets.
in november of,the msp came to the greater boston area when a subsidiary of gm partnered with joseph laham,the owner of norwood cadillac,to form mass bay automotive,llc massbay.the original plan contemplated that massbay,under laham hegemony,would own and operate both norwood cadillac and north shore truck a dealership that gm previously had acquired.gm contributed approximately in working capital and the assets of the north shore dealership to massbay in exchange for a ownership interest.laham contributed the fixed assets and leasehold improvements of norwood cadillac,valued in excess of,in exchange for a ownership interest.he then sold the norwood dealership,including its goodwill and inventories of used cars and parts,to massbay for approximately.
massbay proved to be a flop,and laham sold his ownership interest to gm in january of.at that point,gm was,in effect,the sole owner of norwood cadillac.it then began seeking a purchaser for the dealership,hoping to find a buyer who would operate norwood as part of another msp arrangement.when this gambit failed,gm began pursuing a more traditional sale.to this end,it solicited bids for the dealership in.santilli was among the bidders,but gm accepted a better offer from a third party.the sale closed,and gm de facto ownership of norwood cadillac ceased,on october.
iii.the lawsuit 
invoking diversity jurisdiction,a,santilli sued gm in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.its complaint contained four statements of claim.we describe them briefly.
count emanates from a provision of the dealers bill of rights that renders it unlawful for an automobile manufacturer 
to own and operate a motor vehicle dealership within the relevant market area of a motor vehicle dealer of the same line make provided,however,that a manufacturer shall not be deemed to be in violation of this paragraph when operating a dealership either temporarily for a reasonable period in any case not to exceed one year or in a bona fide relationship with an independent person 
laws ch,k.santilli alleges that gm violated this prohibition from and after november of one year after massbay had assumed ownership of norwood cadillac.in its view,laham relatively small equity interest in massbay,combined with the restrictive provisions of the massbay operating agreement,precluded massbay from coming within the statutory safe harbor for bona fide relationship s between manufacturers and independent persons.see id.as a fallback,santilli alleges that gm violated the statutory prohibition from and after january of one year after it had assumed full ownership of massbay and,by extension,of norwood cadillac.
santilli premised count on the catchall provision of the dealers bill of rights.that provision proscribes actions that are arbitrary,in bad faith,or unconscionable.id.in support of this claim,santilli alleged that gm ownership and operation of norwood cadillac after the statutory grace period and its favorable treatment of norwood cadillac during the ensuing period constituted arbitrary and unconscionable conduct.
count alleges that gm acted arbitrarily in its allocation of new vehicles,thus unfairly benefitting norwood cadillac.inasmuch as santilli quickly abandoned this claim,we eschew any further comment on it.
count alleges that gm violated a statutory provision that generally prohibits u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.id.a.this count essentially replicates the substantive claims set out in the previous three counts.
at the close of discovery,santilli moved for partial summary judgment on the three counts then remaining,namely,counts,and.gm for summary judgment.it advanced two grounds i that santilli had failed to introduce competent evidence that norwood cadillac is in santilli rma,see supra note and ii that even if gm had violated the statute,santilli nonetheless had failed to adduce any evidence that the violation s had caused it a loss of money or property as required by section as a precondition of a suit for damages.
santilli proof concentrated heavily on gm overlong ownership and operation of norwood cadillac.in an effort to satisfy the injury requirement with respect to that violation,santilli proffered expert evidence estimating the additional sales that it would have garnered but for the continued presence of the norwood dealership during the wrongful interval.santilli argued that the statute forbade gm from owning and operating norwood cadillac during that interval and,therefore,that gm should have closed the doors once the statutory grace period had expired.based on this premise,santilli claimed that it was
