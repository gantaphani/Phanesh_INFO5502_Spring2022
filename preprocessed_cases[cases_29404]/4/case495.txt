this appeal requires us to assess the constitutionality of two subsections of the food and drug administration modernization act of fdama.subsections a and c of fdama prohibit drug providers from promoting or advertising particular compounded drugs.in return,the providers are exempted from the standard drug approval requirements imposed by the food and drug administration.plaintiffs seek to enjoin the enforcement of these subsections,contending that they violate the first amendment guarantee of free speech.the district court agreed with plaintiffs and granted their motion for summary judgment in a published opinion.see western states medical ctr.shalala,d.the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
plaintiffs are a group of licensed pharmacies.they have prepared written promotional materials that they distribute by mail and at medical conferences to inform patients and physicians of the uses and effectiveness of specific compounded drugs.compounding is a process in which a pharmacist mixes ingredients to create a medication for an individual patient.compounding is typically used to prepare medications that are not commercially available,such as a medication for a patient who is allergic to an ingredient in a product.pharmacists can provide compounded drugs to individual patients only upon receipt of a valid prescription.see a.
the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,regulates drug manufacturing,marketing,and distribution.it invests the food and drug administration fda with enforcement powers to make sure that the regulations are followed.in,congress amended the fdca to exempt compounding from certain requirements of the fdca,but only if the compounding pharmacies followed several conditions,including refraining from promoting particular compounded drugs.the new legislation sets out several restrictions on compounding including prohibitions on advertisements,like those of the plaintiffs,that promote particular compounded drugs.see a and c pharmacists may,however,inform the public that they offer general compounding services.see c.
plaintiffs challenged fdama advertising and solicitation restrictions in district court.they contended that the restrictions violate the free speech clause of the first amendment.in a opinion,the district court granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment,holding that the restrictions do not meet the test for acceptable government regulation of commercial speech set forth in central hudson gas electric public service commission,d.the district court also held that the unconstitutional provisions were severable from the rest of fdama.this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see gutowsky county of placer,cir.the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact for trial,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.federal deposit ins.meyers,cir.
in central hudson,the supreme court set out a test for determining the constitutionality of a government restriction on commercial speech.the court must determine whether the regulated speech is misleading or concerns unlawful activity the government has asserted a substantial interest in restricting the speech the government has demonstrated that the regulation directly advances the asserted interest and the restriction is not more extensive than necessary to achieve the asserted governmental interest.see central hudson,at.although the government has asserted substantial interests,they have failed to demonstrate that the speech restrictions directly advance those interests or that they are narrowly tailored to those interests.
the first amendment does not protect commercial speech that is inherently misleading or concerns unlawful activity.see id.at.on appeal,the government does not contend that the prohibited speech is unlawful or misleading,and there is no indication in the record that plaintiffs advertisements are untruthful.therefore,the restricted speech must be evaluated according to the other three central hudson factors.
under the second part of the central hudson test,the speech restriction must serve a substantial government interest.in the district court,the government argued that the challenged restrictions served three substantial interests protecting the public health and safety preserving the integrity of the drug approval process and balancing the need to preserve drug compounding for individual patients with particularized needs while preventing widespread distribution of compounded drugs.the district court determined that the first two interests were substantial and satisfied the second prong of the central hudson test.because the government has a significant interest in protecting the health,safety,and welfare of its citizens,we agree that the first two interests are substantial.rubin coors brewing,d.
the third asserted interest was insufficiently clear to the district court.western states,d at.the court reasoned that for an interest in balancing competing goals to be substantial,the goals themselves must be substantial.see id.at.the court agreed that the goal of ensuring the continued availability of compounded drugs to individual patients was a substantial concern,but was not convinced that the government had a substantial interest in preventing widespread compounding.it held that if the government could not offer an adequate rationale for its goal of preventing widespread distribution of compounded drugs,then the government did not have a substantial interest in balancing this concern with the need for continued access to such drugs.see id.at.
the government effort to balance competing goals can be a substantial interest worthy of government protection.see united states edge broadcasting,d holding that the congressional policy of balancing the interests of lottery and nonlottery states is the substantial government interest that satisfies central hudson.but the government must supply a compelling argument or convincing evidence that it has a substantial interest in achieving both goals.the government can not carry its burden by mere speculation or conjecture.edenfield fane,d florida bar went for it,d crediting the state interest as substantial on the basis of a study containing statistical and anecdotal evidence.
we agree with the district court that the government has not met its burden.there is insufficient evidence in the record to conclude that the government has a substantial interest in preventing widespread compounding.the government asserts that increased distribution of compounded drugs is dangerous because of the health risks associated with large numbers of patients taking such drugs.the government neither explains nor supports this contention.in fact,most of the evidence runs to the contrary.compounding is not only legal under state law,but most states require their pharmacists to know how to compound.see,at.the government has failed to show that its interest in striking a balance between ensuring compounding availability and limiting widespread compounding is substantial.the only substantial interests asserted by the government are protecting the public health and preserving the integrity of the drug approval process.
under the third central hudson factor,the speech regulation must directly advance the government interest.in essence,the government argues that the speech restrictions are necessary to prevent an increase in the demand for compounded drugs that would be injurious to the public health.but the government argument falls short of what is required to show that the speech restrictions will protect the public.the government has not offered evidence or arguments to explain sufficiently why such restrictions will reduce the type of consumption of compounded drugs that is harmful,and even admits that it has a substantial interest in ensuring the availability of compounded drugs.
the government bears the burden of showing that its regulation will advance its interest to a material degree.see liquormart,rhode isl
