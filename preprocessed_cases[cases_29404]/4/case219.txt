this case is on its second trip to this court.tfws,a large liquor retailer in maryland,is suing the state comptroller to obtain a declaration that certain maryland regulations governing the wholesale pricing of liquor and wine violate the sherman act.when the case was before us the first time,we affirmed the district court determination that the regulations violate the sherman act,but we remanded for further consideration of the comptroller amendment defense.on remand the district court granted summary judgment to the comptroller,ultimately concluding that maryland interest in promoting temperance,which is protected by the amendment,outweighs the federal interest in promoting competition under the sherman act.however,one of the questions that was to be decided on the regulations are effective in promoting disputed factual issues that can not be resolved on summary judgment.we therefore vacate the award of summary judgment to the comptroller and remand once again for further proceedings.
the maryland liquor regulations under challenge by tfws are explained in some detail in our first opinion,see tfws,schaefer,cir,so we offer only a brief summary here.the first regulation,the pricing system,prescribes how and when liquor wholesalers may change their prices.see,c lexis.by the fifth of each month,wholesalers must post a schedule of prices with the comptroller.tit,b.these prices are locked in for the following month.id.b a.the comptroller makes each wholesaler monthly posting available to all other wholesalers.id.d.the second regulation is known as the volume discount ban or the antidiscrimination rule.it requires a wholesaler to offer every retailer the same price for a given product.see.ann.code,a lexis.tit,b c.wholesalers can not cut prices to large retailers because discounts of any nature are prohibited.see.tit,b c.
in our first opinion we affirmed the district court determination that the regulation is a hybrid restraint that is illegal per se under of the sherman act,that the volume discount ban is a per se violation of,and that maryland can not claim state action immunity from the sherman act because the regulatory scheme is not actively supervised by the state.see tfws,at see also id.at luttig,concurring.we held,however,that the district court dismissal of tfws complaint on amendment grounds was premature.in the first round the district court concluded on its own motion that despite their effect,the regulations should be upheld under the liquor control powers reserved to the states under the amendment.tfws,schaefer,civ.no,slip op.at.we held that it was too early for the district court to reach that conclusion because neither side had a chance to make its case on the amendment issue.tfws,at.as a result,we vacated the order of dismissal and remanded the case with the following instructions 
on remand maryland should be given the opportunity to assert and substantiate its amendment defense,and tfws should be permitted to respond.the analysis the district court should undertake in analyzing maryland interest and then balancing it against the federal interest is straightforward.first,the court should examine the expressed state interest and the closeness of that interest to those protected by the amendment.we acknowledge that little analysis is needed on this point.temperance is the avowed goal of the maryland regulatory scheme,and the amendment definitely allows a state to promote temperance.second,the court should examine whether,and to what extent,the regulatory scheme serves its stated purpose in promoting temperance.simply put,is the scheme effective again,the answer to this question may ultimately rest upon findings and conclusions having a large factual component.finally,the court should balance the state interest in temperance to the extent that interest is actually furthered by the regulatory scheme against the federal interest in promoting competition under the sherman act.

on remand the parties conducted discovery,which included the exchange of reports from expert witnesses,who were also deposed.in due course the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment for the comptroller,finding that the maryland regulations achieved their stated purpose of promoting temperance and concluding that maryland interest in promoting temperance outweighed the federal interest in preserving free competition.tfws appeals.we conduct a de novo review of the grant of summary judgment.bond blum,cir.
tfws appeal boils down to the argument that the district court relied on disputed evidence to grant summary judgment to the comptroller on his amendment defense.we will look at key issues considered on remand to see whether they could be decided on summary judgment.
the district court first job in deciding whether the comptroller had established his amendment defense was to examine the expressed state interest in establishing the regulatory scheme and the closeness of that interest to those protected by the amendment.tfws,at emphasis added.the maryland legislature authorized the regulations for the express purpose of fostering and promoting temperance and eliminat ing the undue stimulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages.a,a lexis.see also id.at a.the district court therefore concluded that maryland established its liquor pricing system and its volume discount ban with the avowed goal of promoting temperance,which is a proper objective under the amendment.tfws,d at.this conclusion can not be disputed,so we agree.
our second question for the district court on remand was whether,and to what extent,the regulatory scheme serves its stated purpose in promoting temperance.tfws,at.this inquiry,we said,should focus on a basic question,i s the scheme effective id.whether the regulatory scheme actually serves its stated purpose is essentially a question of fact.in the summary judgment proceedings on remand,each side presented its case on this question largely through experts,who offered two types of evidence,theoretical and empirical.the theoretical evidence applies general principles of economics to maryland regulatory scheme.each side theoretical evidence predicts the consumption results that it claims should follow from maryland scheme.the empirical evidence includes actual data about alcohol prices and consumption in maryland and other states or localities.
the comptroller evidence showed the various ways that the regulations could,according to economic principles,promote temperance.the comptroller first expert was frank chaloupka,a professor of economics at the university of illinois.chaloupka offered the opinion,based on his review of published studies,that in general alcohol consumption falls as prices rise.this,he said,is in line with one of the fundamental laws of of the downward sloping demand curve,which states that as the price of a product rises,the quantity demanded of that product falls.the comptroller second expert was david levy,a professor of economics at the university of baltimore.levy suggested ways in which the maryland scheme could,as a theoretical matter,reduce price competition and lead to higher liquor prices.levy talked first about the volume discount ban.the discount ban prevents a wholesaler from offering its customers liquor retailers price discounts.if wholesale price discounts were legal,the lower prices would likely be passed on to consumers with a resulting increase in demand.further,because wholesalers can not provide discounts as a reward to retailers who increase sales of a given product,the retailers have less incentive to offer price promotions or sales on that product.levy also explained why the regulation should have an anticompetitive effect.this regulation,he said,reduces price competition because a wholesaler prices are locked in and may not be reduced for thirty days after they are posted with the comptroller.furthermore,even when prices are reduced in a new filing,the cuts will be less effective because of the regulation.the price posting requirement means that a price cutter action is immediately known to his competitors.according to levy,when there is no price posting and a seller reduces prices,he should gain sales until his competitors gradually learn of his reductions and match them.under maryland price posting scheme,this period of advantage is limited to a single month,making price cuts less worthwhile and thus less likely.
levy also presented some empirical evidence suggesting that alcohol prices in maryland are generally higher than in other states.his figures were drawn from data gathered by the american chamber of commerce research association accra.every quarter accra samples prices of consumer goods,including beer,wine,and spirits,in cities around the country.levy calculated the average price of these beverages for each state for the years through.after adjusting the averages for differences in the various locales,he concluded that maryland average wine price exceeded the average in other states by more than a dollar.maryland prices for spirits,according to levy,were about five percent lower than the average in other states.he attributed this result to higher taxes or sometimes to state monopolies in the other jurisdictions.levy report singles out delaware,a maryland neighbor with higher taxes on liquor,for comparison.he concluded that delaware prices for spirits are about fifteen percent lower than maryland after adjustment for differences in the.he noted that wine and beer prices are also lower in delaware,but declined to put a figure on the difference.
tfws offered a single expert,thomas overstreet,who is an economist.overstreet advanced both theoretical evidence and empirical data.on the theoretical side,he offered several reasons why the maryland regulations might fail to reduce liquor consumption despite increased prices.first,consumers might respond to higher prices by buying less expensive brands or types of alcoholic beverages.spending the same amount of money,they could consume just as much as they did before the price increase.on the other hand,they might allocate more money to alcohol purchases.second,increased prices will expand wholesalers profit margins,leaving them extra money to invest in marketing,which might increase consumption or at least counteract the effect of higher prices.third,by reducing competition between large and small liquor retailers,the regulations may increase the number of small retailers across the state,and this could increase consumption.
although overstreet,like the comptroller experts,did not gather any data of his own,he used available data to run a series of empirical comparisons.first,he compared maryland per capita consumption of wine,spirits,and beer with that of the other states.he found that while maryland was in the top half of all states in the consumption of wine and spirits between and,its consumption of beer has been falling relative to other states.maryland beer prices are not regulated by the challenged scheme.overstreet suggested that if the one beverage not subject to the regulations is also the one beverage with declining consumption,the regulations may not be effective in reducing consumption.second,overstreet compared the changes in maryland per capita consumption of the three categories of alcoholic beverages with the trends for the united states as a whole.he found a very tight correlation between maryland and the country for wine and spirits consumption.with respect to these two beverages,maryland consumption patterns and trends were very similar to the country as a whole.in the period evaluated by overstreet,maryland beer consumption was considerably below the national average.indeed,beer consumption in maryland fell faster and further than the national average.according to overstreet,this suggests that the absence of regulations do es not prevent other factors such as culture or demographics from tempering consumption.finally,overstreet examined alcohol consumption patterns in california and nebraska,two states where regulations had been struck down by courts.california regulations were invalidated by california retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,d,and nebraska by finocchiaro liquor control commission.specifically,overstreet looked at whether consumption rates changed after the regulations were invalidated.in california consumption did not change very much for the seven years immediately after the regulations ended,but then it tailed off sharply.in nebraska consumption did not change significantly in the period after invalidation.
in addition to overstreet expert evidence,tfws offered the deposition testimony of david trone,the president of tfws.trone or members of his family own companies that run liquor stores in the region.trone,based on what he said was information,testified that liquor and wine prices are lower in maryland than in delaware,new jersey,pennsylvania,and virginia.
tfws also attacked the weight of levy evidence.levy figures,tfws argued,are based on inappropriate data and do not support his conclusions.the accra quarterly price samples upon which he depends consist of the price of a single brand and size of wine,a single brand and size of liquor,and of two brands of beer,each taken from a single liquor store in each of two to four maryland cities,depending on the year.the sampled stores were not randomly selected within the cities,nor is there any showing that alcohol prices in these cities are representative of prices across the state.the comptroller responded by noting that accra data are widely used and are the most accurate available for tracking alcohol prices.
in addition to questioning the quality of the underlying data used by levy,tfws argued that his calculations do not lead to meaningful results.because the cities sampled by accra are of widely varying populations,taking a straight average of their prices does not properly reflect the price paid by the average marylander levy should have weighted the prices to reflect population differences,tfws claimed.tfws further questioned whether the adjustment was properly applied or even appropriate.and perhaps most important,tfws suggested a flaw in the logic that leads from levy averages to the conclusion that maryland scheme is actually effective.levy compares maryland prices to the rest of the country and to delaware and finds maryland to be generally higher.maryland regulatory scheme is just one way in which maryland is different from other states.any number of other example,culture,economics,or explain why maryland prices are generally higher than the average in the rest of the country.levy analysis does not come to grips with the effect of other variables on consumption in maryland and elsewhere.
in deciding whether maryland scheme is effective,the district court discussed only the theoretical evidence offered by the three experts.in the end,the court credited maryland experts.tfws,schaefer,d.the court rejected the theories advanced by tfws expert,overstreet,saying that his deposition testimony and report lack ed the persuasiveness of the evidence offered by the comptroller,in the form of the expert testimony of chaloupka and levy.id.the district court rebutted each of overstreet attacks on the comptroller basic argument that higher alcohol prices lead to lower demand.first,the district court rejected overstreet contention that because the regulations have the effect of protecting small retailers,the scheme increases the number of retail liquor outlets.the court said that the state could control the number of retailers through its licensing system.id.second,the court rejected overstreet contention that higher prices might trigger switches to cheaper brands by repeating the comptroller theory that a drinker faced with higher prices might prefer to stick to his brand but drink less.id.at.finally,the court dealt with overstreet point that maryland scheme allows for wide profit margins for wholesalers,who can devote some of that money to marketing efforts and thereby maintain or increase consumption levels.while this is a possibility,the court said,it is a remote,speculative,and tolerable one,in light of the direct effect the scheme has on keeping prices high.id.at.the court did not address either side empirical evid
