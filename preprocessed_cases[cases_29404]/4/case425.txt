hexcel was aware of,and likely even participated in the alleged carbon fiber scheme,throughout the.hexcel involvement in this scheme led to its being subpoened in january,along with other carbon fiber producers bp amoco,toray,and toho,by a federal grand jury that was investigating a possible conspiracy.hexcel confirmed its knowledge of widespread anticompetitive practices in its annual form k disclosures in march.based upon the overwhelming evidence of hexcel knowledge in the record,we hold that hexcel claims are,and we affirm.
factual background and prior proceedings 
hexcel manufactures prepreg,a product made from carbon fiber.prepreg is sold to customers who convert it into various composites for use in a wide variety of end products,including commercial aerospace and military applications.following an acquisition in,hexcel also became a producer of carbon fiber.both before and after hexcel acquisition,hexcel was the largest purchaser of carbon fiber in the united states.
on january,hexcel received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the united states department of justice doj.no later than the date of the receipt of that subpoena,hexcel learned that the doj was investigating an alleged antitrust conspiracy in the carbon fiber and prepreg industries,and that the targets of the investigation included hexcel,bp amoco,toray,and toho.hexcel retained skadden,arps,slate,meagher flom llp skadden to represent it in the government investigation.on march,hexcel filed a form k with the united states securities and exchange commission,in which it publicly disclosed that it was the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into the pricing of all manufacturers of carbon fiber and carbon fiber prepreg.
on july,direct purchasers of carbon fiber class action plaintiffs filed the first of several federal class action lawsuits in the central district of california against hexcel,bp amoco,toray,toho,and others,alleging and unlawful market allocation under the sherman act,over the next ten months,seven more direct purchasers of carbon fiber filed suit in federal court alleging the same conspiracy.
on january,hexcel,bp amoco,and the other defendants amended a joint defense agreement jda originally executed on april.the amended jda included a tolling provision of potential claims against each other for the duration of the jda,terminable upon days written notice.on august,bp amoco terminated the tolling provision as to any claims against it,effective september.
on november,hexcel filed suit against bp amoco alleging violations of,and by conspiring to fix the price of carbon fiber that bp amoco sold to during the.bp amoco moved to dismiss,contending that hexcel lawsuit was.in support of its motion,bp amoco pointed to hexcel form k public disclosure on march,that it was the target of a grand jury investigation into the carbon fiber market as the latest possible date its claims against bp amoco accrued.it also claimed that hexcel knew of the government investigation into the carbon fiber market before hexcel made its disclosure,because it received the grand jury subpoena from the doj on january.
hexcel responded by claiming that it did not become aware of its potential claims until after its own diligent inquiry produced enough evidence to support the filing of a lawsuit under rule good faith basis requirement,in february.the parties stipulated that any claims that had accrued before hexcel public disclosure were unless hexcel could prove that fraudulent concealment prevented it from discovering its claims before that date.the district court denied bp amoco motion to dismiss,despite its doubts that hexcel would be able to prove the timeliness of its claims,on the ground that statute of limitations challenges are generally poorly suited for resolution on the pleadings.
the parties engaged in limited discovery regarding the statute of limitations issue.bp amoco filed a motion for summary judgment on august.therein,bp amoco presented evidence that hexcel had actual or constructive knowledge of its claims prior to april,the date which bp amoco contended was the earliest possible date hexcel claims could have accrued.bp amoco argued that if hexcel had acquired actual or constructive notice of its claims between april,and the present,then the claims would not be.however,bp amoco claimed,if hexcel had actual or constructive notice of the relevant facts showing antitrust violations before april,then the statute of limitations had lapsed,and the claims were.
hexcel countered that its claims were not because the receipt of the doj subpoena came as a complete surprise,and that it had no reason to suspect in the carbon fiber industry.the district court rejected this argument on the ground that bp amoco presented enough evidence to persuade the court to the contrary.hexcel employees undisputedly knew or had reason to suspect that might be occurring in the carbon fiber market before hexcel received the doj subpoena on january.after having received the subpoena and having been alerted to the government investigation into the carbon fiber market,the district court reasoned,hexcel immediately began investigating its own conduct and its possible claims against other carbon fiber manufacturers.by march,hexcel attorneys had interviewed several of hexcel employees,who confirmed the extent of hexcel knowledge or suspicions of.
on october,the district court entered summary judgment for bp amoco on the ground that hexcel had actual or constructive notice of its claims on or before april,and,therefore,that the statute of limitations for the filing of hexcel alleged antitrust claims had run.hexcel timely appealed.
