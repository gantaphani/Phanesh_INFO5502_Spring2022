after dismissing the federal antitrust claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over jebaco pendent state law claims.the appellees move,on appeal,to amend harrah answer for the purpose of alleging diversity jurisdiction and reinstating the state law claims in federal court.this motion is dismissed.
background 
the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to jebaco,the nonmovant,are as follows.jebaco does not own or operate any casinos.players lake charles,did and in may,it leased two berths in lake charles,louisiana,from the beeber corporation to conduct riverboat gambling.under a separate march agreement,jebaco was entitled to receive a portion of the rent,which was a fee.the parties had a dispute that was resolved in a settlement agreement,under which jebaco,again,had a right to receive a fee.in,harrah purchased players and assumed this payment obligation.jebaco rights under the settlement agreement are its only asset described in the record.
hurricane rita struck lake charles in september,damaging at least one of harrah riverboats and the docking area.harrah then ceased operating at this location,halted its fee payments to jebaco,and solicited bids for the two riverboats,the gaming licenses associated with the riverboats,and the real property associated with the berths.jebaco placed a bid,but harrah sold to pinnacle instead for million,a sum jebaco asserts is much greater than the property reasonable value.the purchase agreement between harrah and pinnacle initially contained a clause that required pinnacle to pay harrah million if pinnacle attempted to transfer the operations,assets,or licenses acquired in the sale to the new orleans or shreveport markets.this provision was removed before completion of the sale,however.
according to jebaco,harrah and pinnacle hold six of the fifteen riverboat gambling licenses in louisiana and the only gambling license in the state.jebaco contends that,together,they earn approximately percent of all gaming revenue generated in louisiana,including percent of the gambling revenue in the new orleans metropolitan statistical area msa,percent of the revenue in the lake charles msa,and percent in the city msa.
gambling is heavily regulated in louisiana.see.ann,et titled the louisiana gaming control law.the louisiana gaming control law explicit purpose is to protect the general welfare of the state people by keeping the state free from criminal and corrupt elements.a.consequently,the law strictly regulates persons,locations,practices,associations,and activities related to the operation of licensed and qualified gaming establishments,by requiring permitting,licensing,and reporting,providing for enforcement,criminalizing certain gambling related activities and violations of gambling regulations,and establishing other rules,qualifications,and procedures.
the law also creates the louisiana gaming control board lgcb,which has all regulatory,enforcement,and supervisory authority under the law,including determining whether permit and license applicants are suitable.the law limits to fifteen the number of licenses available for operating a riverboat casino in the state,with no more than six licenses to be used on any designated waterway at a time.these licenses must be used at a specific berth,and are.
harrah and pinnacle agreed they would cooperate to secure the lgcb approval to transfer the licenses.pinnacle also applied to use one of the licenses at another location in lake charles,a berth in which jebaco does not have an interest.further,at a july,public hearing,pinnacle told the lgcb that it was exploring using the second license at another location,which would deprive jebaco of all revenue.on august,the lgcb approved both applications,but the second license remains in place.
in the wake of this transaction,but before the lgcb ruled on the petitions,jebaco sued pinnacle and harrah in federal court seeking monetary and injunctive relief.jebaco complaint alleged that harrah and pinnacle violated the sherman act,by dividing the louisiana casino market and by monopolizing,attempting to monopolize,and conspiring to monopolize that market.jebaco asserts this alleged anticompetitive conduct deprived it of both the revenue from a casino operating at jebaco berths and the ability to purchase harrah assets.
pinnacle and harrah moved for a judgment on the pleadings,fed.civ.c both motions argued that jebaco failed to allege antitrust standing and that jebaco claims were barred by the state action doctrine and petitioning immunity.the district court dismissed the antitrust claims,ruling on the latter two arguments without addressing antitrust standing.jebaco appeals.
jebaco complaint also alleged seven louisiana law causes of action against harrah over which the district court originally exercised supplemental jurisdiction.see.after it dismissed the federal claims,the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the pendent state law claims.harrah moves,on appeal,to amend its answer to allege diversity jurisdiction over the state law claims.

iii.discussion 
jebaco alleges that harrah and pinnacle have divided the louisiana casino in violation of federal antitrust laws and caused jebaco to lose fees and the ability to purchase harrah assets and participate in the market the district court dismissed these antitrust claims after finding them barred by the state action doctrine and petitioning immunity we express no opinion on these exceptions to the scope of antitrust liability.instead,we affirm on the alternate ground,fully briefed below and on appeal,that jebaco has failed to allege sufficient facts that,if true,would establish a plausible claim of antitrust standing.see iqbal.at.
this court has previously described the basic tenets of standing to sue for an antitrust violation,pursuant to section of the clayton act,as follows 
standing to pursue an antitrust suit exists only if a plaintiff shows,an injury to the plaintiff proximately caused by the defendants conduct antitrust injury and proper plaintiff status,which assures that other parties are not better situated to bring suit 
antitrust injury must be established for the plaintiff to have standing under section or section of the sherman act.this requirement is inferred from section of the clayton act,which affords a remedy to any person injured in his business or property by reason of an antitrust violation.a.
doctor hospital of jefferson,southeast med.alliance,cir citations omitted in brunswick pueblo,d,the supreme court described antitrust injury as 
injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants acts unlawful.the injury should reflect the effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.it should,in short,be the type of loss that the claimed violations would be likely to cause.
