opinion of the court 
this appeal by manufacturers of linerboard requires us to decide if the district court erred in granting two motions for class certification by groups of plaintiffs who brought antitrust law suits alleging that the linerboard manufacturers engaged in a continuing combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce in violation of section of the sherman act.appellants contend that plaintiffs failed to establish that the putative class met the requirements of rule b,federal rules of civil procedure,which compel the court to 
find that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy 
appellants are represented through briefs and oral argument by two groups of manufacturers,the international paper appellants and the georgia pacific appellants.
after individual law suits were filed in the northern district of illinois and the eastern district of pennsylvania the cases were transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to the eastern district of pennsylvania for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings.
the district court established two classes 
all persons in the united states who purchased corrugated containers directly from any defendant at any time during the period october,through november,but excluding defendants,their respective parents,subsidiaries and affiliates and federal,state and local governmental entities and political subdivisions.
all individuals and entities who purchased corrugated sheets in the united states directly from any of the defendants during the class period from october,through november,excluding the defendants,their,and their respective parents,subsidiaries and affiliates,as well as any government entities.
in re linerboard antitrust,emphasis added.these classes are presented before us as the box appellees and the sheet appellees.
the district court concluded that the putative classes met the requirements of rule a and noted that 
there is an overlap between the predominance requirement of rule b and the prerequisite of rule a that common questions exist.the courts have repeatedly focused on the liability issues,in contrast to damage questions,and,if they found issues were common to the class,have held that rule b was satisfied.newberg on class actions.
the court then decided that the putative classes had met the requirements of rule b.the court determined first,that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to support claims that the conspiracy to raise the price of linerboard correspondingly raised the price of corrugated products.it went on to conclude that plaintiffs allegations regarding impact,like their allegations regarding conspiracy,will focus the inquiry on defendants actions,not on individual questions relating to particular class members.id.at.
the international paper appellants argue that the district court erred in holding that appellees have sufficiently demonstrated that they will be able to prove common impact at trial.in support of this major premise,they contend that the court erred in applying a legal presumption of impact and failing to apply rigorous scrutiny to plaintiffs proffered impact evidence.they contend also that the court erred in ignoring the individual issues raised by plaintiffs claim of fraudulent concealment.
for their part,the georgia pacific appellants argue that the district court erred because here the existence of injury,and hence potential liability,requires an inherently individualized inquiry.similarly,they argue that the court erred in certifying classes because the existence of fraudulent concealment also requires an inherently individualized inquiry.

the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and a.pursuant to rule f,federal rules of civil procedure,appellants timely petitioned this court for permission to appeal the district court september,order.we granted the petition and allowed the appeal by an order dated december,and now affirm.
in presenting their theory of antitrust liability,appellees averred that even though demand for linerboard was strong and rising between and,the manufacturers prices for linerboard had fallen that the manufacturers attempted to increase prices during,and the first half of,but the price increase announcement did not stick and,therefore,the manufacturers had to rescind them.it was at this point in september,plaintiffs allege,that roger stone,president of stone container corporation,the largest corrugated paper manufacturer,reported that the past five years have been the only period going back as far as the when the containerboard industry has had consistently declining prices.it never happened before,never happened in the depression,but it happened these last five years.app.at.
according to plaintiffs,declining prices were attributed to excess inventory or inventory overhang.they also maintained that stone container masterminded a plan among the manufacturers to lower the industry inventory to a supply for a million ton threshold,in order to implement price increases.the packaging corporation of america stated in the fall of 
weakness in containerboard pricing during the first half of was more than.earlier this year,industry inventories of containerboard hovered above million tons and nearly six weeks of supply,above the million tons and week range usually required to sustain a price increase.
the plan was.first,the manufacturers would close their mills for market downtime,thereby reducing industry inventory at mills and box plants.second,stone would purchase inventory from other manufactures while idling its own mills.in implementing this conspiracy,during late june and early july,roger stone conducted a telephone survey of his competitors.he coordinated the downtime and agreed to have his company purchase a significant volume of linerboard from its competitors rather than meet the requirements from its own production.stone took downtime of approximately tons of containerboard by shutting six of its mills during the following weeks and months.
the manufacturers closed their mills between july and december.by october,they had concerted their actions and had lowered total inventories to the desired level of less than a supply.a total of tons had been withdrawn from the market.inventory reached a low in terms of weeks of supply app.at.in october,appellants successfully increased their prices for containerboard and boxes for the first time in more than two years.each raised its container prices by an identical amount.subsequently,the major manufacturers continued their pattern of taking substantial downtime and implementing price increases.in late november,less than two months after the successful october price increase,stone announced another per ton increase to be effective on january,even though analysts were not expecting another attempt to raise containerboard prices until february or march of that year.other manufacturers joined,and the price increase became effective in march.
in april,appellants justified another containerboard price increase citing low inventory.between the summer of and march,seven containerboard price increases were implemented in the industry.linerboard prices in the eastern united states rose in six consecutive escalations from a low of around to per ton in the third quarter of to per ton by april.plaintiffs allege that the roughly recovery in prices resulted in a sharp resurgence in industry profitability as the containerboard increases were passed through in the form of finished box prices.even the most industry players had returned to profitability by the fourth quarter of.app.at.
thus,plaintiffs theory of antitrust liability is based on polysyllogisms prices in the marketplace are controlled by the economic laws of supply and demand,to wit,if a product is in short supply,the price will increase.during the period in question,linerboard was in short supply.therefore,during this period,the price of linerboard increased.closing down production will create a shortage in supply and a corresponding price increase.the linerboard manufacturers closed down production.therefore,the linerboard manufacturers created a shortage in supply and a price increase.
we address first,the contention that the court erred in applying a presumption of impact,in order to demonstrate that questions of law and fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.the district court did apply such a presumption,relying on the statement in bogosian,familiarly described as the bogosian 
if,in this case,a nationwide conspiracy is proven,the result of which was to increase prices to a class of plaintiffs beyond the prices which would obtain in a competitive regime,an individual plaintiff could prove fact of damage simply by proving that the free market prices would be lower than the prices paid and that he made some purchases at the higher price.if the price structure in the industry is such that nationwide the conspiratorially affected prices at the wholesale level fluctuated within a range which,though different in different regions,was higher in all regions than the range which would have existed in all regions under competitive conditions,it would be clear that all members of the class suffered some damage,notwithstanding that there would be variations among all dealers as to the extent of their damage.the burden of proving the fact of damage under of the clayton act is satisfied by proof of some damage flowing from the unlawful conspiracy zenith radio hazeltine research,d.under these circumstances,proof on a common basis would be appropriate.even if the variation in price dynamics among regions or marketing areas were such that in certain areas the free market price would be no lower than the conspiratorially affected price,it might be possible to designate subclasses to conform with these variations.see in re antibiotic antitrust actions.
bogosian,cir emphasis omitted 
appellants challenge the following determination of the district court 
plaintiffs have shown that they plan to prove common impact by introducing generalized evidence which will not vary among individual class members.for example,plaintiffs contend that even though prices may have varied among regions,the alleged conspiracy caused these prices to rise throughout the country.although the prices for corrugated sheets and boxes may have increased due to demand,because defendants allegedly conspired to reduce production of linerboard,the price was higher than it would have been under competitive conditions.such allegations,supported by the evidence presented,are of the kind contemplated by the third circuit in bogosian and newton.see also,lumco.
the court recognizes that defendants dispute plaintiffs allegations.however,at the class certification stage,the court need not concern itself with whether plaintiffs can prove their allegations regarding common impact the court need only assure itself that plaintiffs attempt to prove their allegations will predominantly involve common issues of fact and law.lumco,at.plaintiffs need only make a threshold showing that the element of impact will predominantly involve generalized issues of proof,rather than questions which are particular to each member of the plaintiff class.id.citing in re disposable contact lens antitrust.therefore,the court concludes that plaintiffs allegations regarding impact,like their allegations regarding conspiracy,will focus the inquiry on defendants actions,not on individual questions relating to particular plaintiff class members.
linerboard,at.
a strong argument can be made that the bogosian concept of presumed impact was properly applied here.the economic laws of supply and demand run in tandem with the tenets of logic.a reduction in supply will cause prices to rise.a deliberate cut in supply,as alleged here,is a deliberate interference with market forces.coincident with this interference with the normal market forces,linerboard prices in the eastern united states rose in six consecutive price increases,from a low of around to per ton in third quarter to per ton by april.reduced to its essence,what appellants say is that there is no correlation between the reduction in supply of linerboard and the subsequent price increases.what they really contend is that plaintiffs argument is anchored on the familiar fallacy of post hoc propter hoc,the fallacy of inferring causation from temporal succession only,a reasoning from what happens in sequence is merely an assumption of a causal connection.
the post hoc accusation is trumped,however,by the laws of economics.if the facts do,in fact,support plaintiffs theory that an individual plaintiff could prove fact of damage simply by proving that the free market prices would be lower than the prices paid and that he made some purchases at the higher price,bogosian,at,this would be a demonstration of the laws of supply and demand at work.
but there is more to this case than exclusive reliance on the presumed impact theory.the district court used a belt and suspenders rationale to support its conclusion that the putative class had met its burden of showing impact.in addition to relying on the bogosian short cut,it credited the testimony of plaintiffs experts,opinions that were supported by charts,studies and articles from leading trade publications.these experts suggested that advanced econometric models could be effectively prepared to establish impact.
in reaching its decision,the district court made note of plaintiffs expert john beyer,who presented two possible means of assessing impact on a regression analysis,and the benchmark or yardstick approach,which he described as methods of showing an antitrust impact by generalized proof.affidavit of john beyer,app.at.see also,in re plastic cutlery antitrust,no.civ,wl,at,in re flat glass antitrust,identifying multiple regression analysis as a method of proving impact.
beyer made an extensive empirical investigation into the behavior of linerboard and corrugated box prices over time,which proved a basis for his opinion of common impact.he stated that he had studied the structure of the industry,including appellants market power,geographical overlap,the fungible nature of the products,the inelastic demand and lack of a substitute.he found that corrugated container prices are strongly influenced by linerboard prices.because of these industry characteristics all class members would be impacted by higher corrugated container prices.app.at.
significantly,beyer stated that he found that linerboard and corrugated box prices were closely correlated.he concluded that linerboard transaction prices,as well as corrugated containerboard prices,behaved similarly over time across different regions of the country and across different types of linerboard.these findings,sometimes referred to as structure in pricing,demonstrated to beyer that d espite any variations in particular boxes or customers,prices for all corrugated containers would have responded over time to linerboard price increases in a similar manner id.based on this qualitative analysis,he concluded that the alleged conspiracy would have had a common,impact,and that all purchasers of corrugated containers would have paid a higher price as a result of the conspiracy.id.at.we deem his conclusion to be significant because it was supported by charts and studies.
in discussing these feasible approaches,which could be used to provide quantitative methods for corroborating his opinion on impact and for estimating damages,he suggested as a potential benchmark,the potential prices charged for linerboard during a competitive period when there would be no effects of the conspiracy.he explained that the necessary data was available to do the analysis and described the types of data he would use.he discussed also a multiple regression model to isolate the effects of various influences on corrugated container prices,thereby allowing a determination of the impact of any one of the variables,including,in this case,the impact of the conspiracy.id.at.
the plaintiffs also presented an affidavit of robin cantor who stated that b ased on my analysis of the pricing data and company records,i conclude that the alleged unlawful conduct to raise linerboard prices would have impacted all members of the proposed class through higher corrugated sheet prices.app.at.we deem this conclusion to also be extremely significant.
such a conclusion was supported by relevant data.for example,she indicated that the containerboard industry is relatively concentrated and that during the relevant period,percent of linerboard and percent of the corrugated medium was produced by the top ten firms and that overall,percent of containerboard production was concentrated in the top ten firms.id.at.she also indicated that benchmark prices are published weekly in a number of sources including the yellow sheet,pulp and paper week and pulp paper north american fact book,and that a ccording to a weyerhaeuser document,linerboard is the industry indicator price.id.at.cantor recognized that c orrugated boxes are the most popular shipping containers in the world.over percent of all products in the united states are shipped in corrugated cardboard boxes.id.at quoting the american forest and paper association website.emphasizing this dominance over the shipping industry,cantor remarked that 
t he market began to turn in the third quarter of when containerboard producers announced an estimated tons of downtime to reduce linerboard and medium inventories just as box shipments began to pick up.quoting linerboard prices soar to record levels as shortage condition prevail,pulp paper week,vol,at.
the industry is gradually responding to the soft linerboard market by announcing significant downtime to be taken in the third quarter.announcements to date of downtime by stone,union camp,ip and packaging corporation of america amount to roughly tons of production or of the industry capacity during the three month period.quoting linerboard report,donaldson,lufkin jenrette securities,august.
she also indicated that there are several accepted statistical or mathematical approaches that could be used to determine the percentage or absolute overcharge due because of the effect of a conspiracy to manipulate prices.app.at.she suggested that benchmarking,which uses competitive prices for other comparable products to estimate the pattern of prices the alleged misconduct,could be effectively employed in this situation.id.another proffered model would compare prices during periods with product prices during the alleged conspiracy,and yet a third approach would use revenue,production and profit data to derive prices that are consistent with yardstick competitive performance levels.
most significantly,she concluded 
in sum,containerboard and corrugated sheet products exhibit sufficient characteristics and their sale and production exhibit sufficient economic conditions to control for product variations in a price analysis.in combination,these characteristics and conditions indicate that a conspiracy would have a common impact on all members of the proposed class and that feasible methods can be used to estimate damages reliably on a basis.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that plaintiffs showed that they could establish injury on a basis.plaintiffs produced affidavits of expert witnesses,beyer and cantor,who effectively utilized supporting data,including charts and exhibits,to authenticate their professional opinions that all class members would incur such damages.we decide that this was not a case where plaintiffs relied solely on presumed impact and damages.
in commenting on plaintiffs submissions,the district court referred to the teachings of newton for the proposition that this court does not require plaintiffs to have selected a particular econometric model for demonstrating impact or proving damages at the class certification stage.in in re corrugated container antitrust,the identical situation was presented to that court where plaintiff had identified two generally accepted methodologies,which he planned on using to determine impact and damages.relying heavily on bogosian,the court accepted that contention and certified the class.id.at.without explicitly so stating,the district court,like the corrugated container court,did not require the experts to pick one particular method over another at the class certification stage,recognizing that the certification stage is early in the overall litigation process.linerboard,at.
accordingly,we reject the contention that plaintiffs did not demonstrate that sufficient proof was available,for use at trial,to prove antitrust impact common to all the members of the class.
a significant portion of appellants briefing,and a major emphasis at oral argument,was that the factual allegations alleged here track precisely the factual scenario in newton,and therefore,the district court erred in not following the holding of newton and denying class certification.at oral argument,counsel for appellants referred to newton as provid ing the guide for resolution in this case and referred to a single sentence contained therein that constituted,in his formulation,a teaching that holds with respect to both of our submissions today.that passage reads as follows if proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual treatment,the class certification is unsuitable.newton,at citing binder gillespie,cir upholding class decertification where presumption of reliance and loss unavailable,cert.denied,d.
we have several problems with this argument.in and of itself,the quotation can be interpreted as the obverse of rule b,federal rules of civil procedure,in the sense that if any questions affecting individual members predominate over questions of law and fact,class certification is unsuitable.clearly,if proof of the essential elements of the cause of action require individual treatment,then there can not be a predominance of questions of law and fact common to the members of the class.
equally important,the quotation at issue must be considered in the precise context in which it was used in newton.it formed the final sentence of a paragraph in which we discussed permissible presumptions,proof of reliance and injury in securities cases.having cited a number of cases upholding presumptions of reliance in rule claims,we stated that where a presumption of reliance and loss was not available,as in binder,it would be necessary for each plaintiff to prove the essential elements of the cause of action,and,if so,class certification would be unsuitable.newton,at.in binder,the court affirmed the denial of class certification,stating that t he district court reasoned that the class would have to satisfy the reliance element through a presumption otherwise individual questions of reliance would predominate over questions common to the class.binder,at.
we consider it useful to identify the precise flashpoint of controversy at stake in newton.roscoe pound taught us that the judicial process distinguishes discrete functions in the appellate decisional process finding or choosing or creating the law where the dispute is over the choice of the controlling legal precept if there is no dispute as to its selection,a disagreement over its interpretation and where there is agreement on the precept and its interpretation,the sole question is the application of the law to the facts,which pound described as a pplication of the abstract grounds of decision to the facts of the particular case.the precise holding in newton was that the facts common to the members of the class did not predominate.no new legal precept was created no new nuance of interpretation was forthcoming.it was merely the application of ruling case law in this court to the facts of that case.
the process of justifying a court decision always requires application of a legal precept to a particular factual situation.the application may be purely mechanical,as it is in most cases.if the facts are similar to those in an earlier case announcing a rule of law,the doctrine of precedent becomes operative.where there is no quarrel over the choice and interpretation of the legal precept,here rule b,the root controversy usually is traced to a value judgment of whether there is sufficient similarity between the fact situations under comparison.edward levi amply described this kind of assessment when he stated t he scope of a rule of law,and therefore its meaning,depends upon a determination of what facts will be considered similar the finding of similarity or difference is the key step in the legal process.to predict a court actions in a controversy,therefore,requires a prediction of what facts in the compared cases a given court,at a given time,will deem either material or insignificant.the facts considered material are adjudicative facts,described by hart and sacks as facts relevant in deciding whether a given general proposition is or is not applicable to a particular situation.
for appellants argument to prevail,therefore,they must demonstrate that the facts in newton are substantially similar to the facts in the case at bar,what logicians call inductive reasoning by analogy,or reasoning from one particular case to another.to draw an analogy between two entities is to indicate one or more respects in which they are similar and thus argue that the legal consequence attached to one set of particular facts may apply to a different set of particular facts because of the similarities in the two sets.because a successful analogy is drawn by demonstrating the resemblances or similarities in the facts,the degree of similarity is always the crucial element.you may not conclude that only a partial resemblance between two entities is equal to a substantial or exact correspondence.
logicians teach that one must always appraise an analogical argument very carefully.several criteria may be used the acceptability of the analogy will vary proportionally with the number of circumstances that have been analyzed the acceptability will depend upon the number of positive resemblances similarities and negative resemblances dissimilarities or the acceptability will be influenced by the relevance of the purported analogies.irving copi keith,informal logic ed arthur goodheart,determining the ratio decidendi of a case,yale,john wigmore,wigmore code of the rules of evidence in trials at law ed john stuart mill,a system of logic ratiocinative and inductive ed.two things resemble each other in one or more respects a certain proposition is true of one therefore it is true of the other.
for appellants to draw a proper analogy,they had the burden in the district court,as they do here,of showing that the similarities in the facts of the two cases outweigh the differences.they can not do so,for two significant reasons.first,in newton it was clear that not all members of the putative class sustained injuries here,all members sustained injuries because of the artificially increased prices.secondly,in newton there were hundreds of millions of stock transactions involved,thus making the putative class extremely unmanageable here,an astronomical number of transactions is not present.the classes are manageable.
we reversed the district court determination of class certification in newton because it involved a putative securities class action in which purchasers of stocks charged that their breached their duty to execute trades on the most favorable terms reasonably available.newton,at.the gravamen of the complaint was that their brokers could have received a better price for securities had they used a computer system other than the central national best bid and offer system nbbo.the evidence disclosed that on some occasions,the nbbo price was better than on other computer systems,at times,the prices were the same,and at other times,the nbbo price was worse than on other systems.id.at.under those circumstances,we concluded that not every class member was injured by the failure of the brokers to find the best possible price.id.at.
critical to our determination of whether class certification was proper,we noted that in determining how to execute a client order,a must take into account order size,trading characteristics of the security,speed of execution,clearing costs,and the cost and difficulty of executing an order in a particular market.id.we were very specific in this respect 
these factors would appear to vary from class member to class member and,for each class member,from trade to trade.whether a class member suffered economic loss from a given securities transaction would require proof of the circumstances surrounding each trade,the available alternative prices,and the state of mind of each investor at the time the trade was requested.this herculean task,involving hundreds of millions of transactions,counsels against finding predominance.
the alleged injuries in newton arise out of the execution of hundreds of millions of trades,not a single act of fraudulent conduct.the distinct facts among the hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs involving hundreds of millions of trades will determine whether securities violations occurred.because plaintiffs claims will require an economic injury determination for each trade,we hold the putative class fails to satisfy the predominance requirement.
contrasting the newton facts with those in the case at bar,here there was no evidence that the individuals and entities who purchased corrugated containers or corrugated sheets from appellants during the relevant period had participated in hundreds of millions of commercial transactions.more important,the newton court was staring a situation in the face where they would necessarily examine every stock purchase or sale because not every member of the putative class was injured.by direct contrast,with certain limited exceptions relating to purchasers whose contracts were tied to a factor independent of the price of linerboard,all purchasers of corrugated sheets and boxes were injured.they were all affected by the increased price of linerboard that reflected in the price paid by plaintiffs.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that we can not accept the analogue so vigorously urged by appellants because the negative resemblances dissimilarities between newton and the case at bar seriously outweigh the positive resemblances similarities.
the court decision in illinois brick illinois,d,bans clayton act lawsuits by persons who are not direct purchasers from the defendant antitrust violator.appellants argue that the district court should have denied class certification,under the teachings of illinois brick,because members of the proposed classes purchased corrugated sheets or boxes,of which linerboard was a mere ingredient,and did not purchase linerboard per se.appellees respond,as they did in the district court,that the facts here come within the purview of our decision and rationale in in re sugar indus.antitrust,cir,in which we held that the purchasers of candy made by the sugar manufacturers were not barred from bringing suit under the of the sherman act,and of the clayton act.
we posed the question succinctly does illinois brick bar suit by a plaintiff who purchases directly from the alleged offender,but buys a product which incorporates the product as one of its ingredients we held that there was no bar.
our reasoning began with an explication of the rationale behind illinois brick 
the court grounded its conclusion on several bases,including the possibility of exposing the defendant to multiple liability and the evidentiary complexities that would arise in apportioning the overcharge among those in the chain who had suffered injury.the court also expressed concern that if the direct purchaser could not make a full recovery of the overcharge,the wrongdoer would be able to keep some of the fruits of its illegality.based on this reasoning,the court held that the plaintiff,which purchased a completed building,was not permitted to sue the manufacturer of concrete block which had been incorporated into the structure.
in re sugar,at.
we then explained why this rule would not apply to the purchasers of candy made with the sugar 
as the defendants here point out,the product which plaintiff purchased competes not with sugar,but with other candy,and more than one ingredient determines the price.to this extent,there will be some additional complications underlying the damage claims.however,this must not be allowed to obscure the fact that the plaintiff did purchase directly from the alleged violator.true,the commodity had been combined with other ingredients to form a different product.but just as the sugar sweetened the candy,the enhanced the profits of the candy manufacturers.the situation is the same as if the general contractor which sold the building to the plaintiff in illinois brick were the manufacturer of the concrete block which went into the structure.in that situation,the concern which the supreme court expressed about the proration of overcharge among a number of entities in the chain would not have been present.
nor is that problem of allocation among various distributors present in the case sub judice.plaintiff is a direct purchaser and,therefore,entitled to recover the full extent of the overcharge.
in the case at bar,the district court met this issue,and we agree completely with its analysis.it emphasized that the putative class plaintiffs purchased corrugated sheets or boxes directly from appellants,and,like the candy in in re sugar,which contained allegedly sugar,the corrugated sheets and boxes contain linerboard that was subject to an agreement on output,which is equivalent to a agreement.accordingly,the putative class members are direct purchasers and are entitled to recover the full amount of any overcharge.see leaseways truck leasing ass n,cir an agreement on output also equates to a agreement if firms restrict output directly,price will rise in order to limit demand to the reduced supply r educing output,and dividing markets have the same anticompetitive effects.
this is not a securities case.it is an antitrust case involving allegations that several united states manufacturers of linerboard engaged in a continuing combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce in violation of of the sherman act.it is well settled that a ny action to enforce any cause of action under section,or shall be forever barred unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued.
appellants contend that appellees claims are because most of the class october to november more than four years before the filing of the sheet and box complaints in may.appellees agree on the time period,but respond that the statute of limitations should be tolled under the doctrine of fraudulent concealment because they had no knowledge of the alleged conspiracy or of any facts that might have led to the discovery thereof in the exercise of reasonable diligence.they contend that it was not until approximately february,when the federal trade commission issued a press release,a complaint and a proposed consent decree against appellant stone container corporation,describing certain facets of conduct,that they became aware of appellants misadventures.
although mandates a statute of limitations for civil antitrust actions,it is well established that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment tolls the limitation period when a plaintiff cause of action has been obscured by the defendant conduct.
i n order to establish the applicability of the doctrine,an antitrust plaintiff must show three things fraudulent concealment failure on the part of the plaintiff to discover his cause of action notwithstanding such concealment and that such failure to discover occurred notwithstanding the exercise of due care on the part of the plaintiff.
where an action implicating fraudulent concealment is sought to be brought in a class posture,we must decide whether the required elements of proof are too individualized to permit such treatment.
it generally has been recognized that the question of concealment by an antitrust defendant is a common question,subject to being uniformly resolved on behalf of all members of the class.in re flat glass,at citing in re nasdaq antitrust,in re fine paper antitrust.however,the question of discovery of the cause of action by a plaintiff presents an individual question.id.similarly,the issue of due diligence seemingly raises an individual question.id.thus,the broad issue of fraudulent concealment presents both common and individual issues therefore,the determination whether an antitrust action involving fraudulent concealment may proceed as a class action turns upon which aspect of the issue may be considered to predominate.id.citing hedges,cont l group.
the cumulative experience of the judiciary has not been uniform in this regard.some courts have regarded the issue of concealment to predominate,and have held that class certification is permissible,even though some individual questions are present.other courts have considered individual questions to be too pervasive to permit it to be handled as a class matter.in this judicial circuit,there has been a division of authority,with some cases supporting each view 
appellants argue that common issues of proof do not predominate with respect to the fraudulent concealment issue and that therefore a class action is not the appropriate vehicle for deciding appellees claims.international paper appellant brief at.they suggest that fraudulent concealment involves a concealment by the defendant and plaintiff actual knowledge of it or failure to use due care to discover can not be established unless both prongs are satisfied.in asserting their position,they rely on the language of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit when the defendant affirmative defenses such as the statute of limitations may depend on facts peculiar to each plaintiff case,class certification is erroneous.broussard meineke disc.muffler shops,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted see also,chevalier baird sav.ass n,in re anthracite coal antitrust,krehl ice cream.
they argue that a number of appellees are barred from asserting a fraudulent concealment defense to the statute of limitations because they either had prior knowledge of the conspiracy,or did not act with the requisite due diligence,emphasizing that this sort of inquiry is highly personal and is susceptible only to individualized proof and,therefore,inappropriate for class treatment 
to be sure,certain determinations involving the fraudulent concealment defense to the statute of limitations will require individualized proof,which might vary among the assorted appellees.however,most courts have refused to deny class certification simply because there will be some individual questions raised during the proceedings.in rejecting the rationale in broussard,the court of appeals for the first circuit determined 
although a necessity for individualized determinations invariably weighs against class certification under rule b,we reject any per se rule that treats the presence of such issues as an automatic disqualifier.in other words,the mere fact that such concerns may arise and may affect different class members differently does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones.as long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together,variations in the sources and application of statutes of limitations will not automatically foreclose class certification under rule b.see james moore et,moore federal practice ed.predominance under rule b can not be reduced to a mechanical,test.
waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.we accept this reasoning as more persuasive than that espoused by
