appellant bayou fleet,appeals from the district court order granting mary and neal clulee motion to amend the partial final consent judgment and the district court final judgment dismissing bayou fleet claims with prejudice.bayou fleet filed this action against ellis alexander charles parish the parish insurer,coregis insurance company neal clulee and his wife mary clulee the clulees and the clulees two companies,home place batture leasing,home place and materials.bayou fleet alleged that the defendants conspired to eliminate it from the sand pit business through challenges to its zoning status and through attempts to persuade authorities against issuing permits.specifically,bayou fleet alleged that the defendants abused its constitutional rights through a civil conspiracy under and violated the sherman act,and,and the louisiana unfair trade practices act.ann,et,through their efforts to put its sand pit operation out of business.
before trial,bayou fleet settled with alexander,charles parish,and coregis insurance company.in lieu of the settlement,the court entered a consent judgment,but later amended portions of the judgment that pertained to bayou fleet zoning status.at the close of a trial,the district judge denied bayou fleet relief against the clulees,holding that the clulees were immune from liability under the doctrine.see bayou fleet,alexander.bayou fleet argues on appeal that the trial court effectively denied its first amendment right of access to the courts,abused its discretion by amending the consent judgment,and erred in its dismissal of the case under the doctrine.
this case involves one of several disputes in a long feud between the durant family and the clulee family in hahnville,louisiana both families own businesses alongside the mississippi river in charles parish.the conflict in this case concerns the clulees attempts to curtail the durants sand pit operations.the durants own bayou fleet,and the clulees own home place and materials.bayou fleet and home place maintained the only active sand pits in hahnville 
in,ronald adams contractors,adams needed sand from the mississippi river to construct roads in a nearby parish.adams required a permit from the army corps of engineers to dredge sand from the mississippi and a permit from the lafourche basin levee district board of commissioners the levee board to operate a sand pit,in which the sand would be stored until trucks hauled it to the construction sites.after receiving bids from local sand pit operators,adams chose bayou fleet.
adams filed for the necessary permits in march of.shortly thereafter,the corps of engineers received a number of complaints from residents near bayou fleet property who opposed the operation of sand pits in the area.the neighbors complained that sand pit operations create health risks from air pollution,safety problems around the pits,and general nuisances from trucks traveling to and from the pits.
robin durant and a representative from adams met with ellis alexander,a parish council member renowned for his oppositions to sand pits.durant and adams assured alexander that all precautions would be taken to reduce the hazards caused by the sand pit operations.alexander did not openly oppose bayou fleet operations at their meeting.
in order to solicit business for his own sand pit,neal clulee set up a meeting with adams to discuss the sale of sand from homplace.at the meeting,clulee informed adams that he opposed the bayou fleet operation and that,unlike bayou fleet,he could keep the local authorities satisfied.bayou fleet,d at.adams declined clulee offer.
bayou fleet claims that the alleged conspiracy between alexander and the clulees began on april.on this date,telephone records show that neal clulee made several attempts to contact alexander.shortly after the calls,alexander informed earl matherne,director of the department of planning and zoning for charles parish,that alexander constituents were objecting to bayou fleet sand pit operations under the parish zoning ordinance matherne submitted the zoning issue to the parish attorney,who,after reviewing bayou fleet business records,concluded that bayou fleet had not lost its use status.
bayou fleet claims that the conspiracy continued from may through december of,in which time alexander argued before the parish council,the charles parish coastal zone advisory committee the zoning committee,and the levee board against bayou fleet sand pit operations.neal clulee made over forty phone calls to alexander home during this time.the telephone company records show that many of these calls corresponded to alexander protests before local authorities 
on may,at a regular zoning committee meeting,alexander and the clulee lawyer,joel chaison,urged the committee to recommend that the parish council submit a letter of objection to the corps of engineers concerning adams permit.seven members of the public also spoke in opposition to adams project at the meeting.that same day,clulee placed two telephone calls to the alexander residence.despite alexander protests,the zoning committee issued a recommendation to the parish council that supported adams project.
on june,at a regularly scheduled meeting of the parish council,alexander proposed a resolution to issue a letter of objection to the corps of engineers urging the denial of adams permit application.alexander suggested that,in the alternative,adams should be required to take extra precautions to eliminate safety and health hazards by using home place access ramp instead of bayou fleet ramp,because the latter was located too close to residential neighborhoods.because there was no road to the clulees ramp from bayou fleet property behind the levee,the alternative proposal had the same effect as the letter of objection.nonetheless,the parish council adopted alexander resolution.prior to the levee board meeting,neal clulee made four calls to alexander home.
alexander forwarded the parish council objection to the levee board,which,in turn,denied adams permit.without the levee board permission to stockpile and move the sand over the levee,the corps of engineers could not issue a permit to dredge the sand out of the river.however,adams was able to postpone a final decision from the corps of engineers until a second meeting of the levee board.
on july,the levee board reconsidered its previous decision and granted adams operation permit.alexander,adams,and durant attended the meeting.although the clulees were not present,neal clulee placed two calls to alexander residence before the meeting.
at the following parish council session,alexander proposed a resolution to audit bayou fleet sales tax returns.although the parish council denied alexander proposition,alexander was able to convince the charles parish tax collection department to conduct a sales tax audit of bayou fleet,which resulted in no tax violations.during this period,the clulees placed two more telephone calls to alexander.
on july,bayou fleet filed the present lawsuit against alexander,the parish,the clulees and the clulees companies,home place and materials.
despite the fervent opposition by alexander to adams operation,the corps of engineers issued adams a permit to dredge on july.
nonetheless,alexander continued his assault against bayou fleet sand pit operation.at the parish council meeting on september,he proposed a new levee law ordinance and a special legal counsel resolution.the council adopted the proposals over the veto of the parish president.the levee law required the permission of the parish council before anyone was allowed to cross over the levee.violation of the ordinance was a criminal offense.the special legal counsel resolution mandated the appointment of legal counsel to conduct an investigation into bayou fleet zoning status.alexander requested that joel chaisson,the clulees attorney,be appointed to the position.
bayou fleet filed for an injunction and for declaratory relief in federal district court.the district court held that the levee law and the special legal counsel resolution was submitted in retaliation to bayou fleet law suit and with a bad faith intent to injure bayou fleet.bayou fleet alexander,wl.the court concluded that the ordinance and resolution violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
on march,alexander filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion and dismissed bayou fleet claims against alexander in his individual capacity under the doctrine.the court held that alexander was personally immune from liability for his appearances before the zoning committee and the levee board.see bayou fleet,alexander,d.
the district court ruling on the parish council ordinances and the court dismissal of the suit against alexander prompted settlement negotiations between the remaining parties.the defendants,with the exception of the clulees,reached a settlement on december.the settlement required the parish council to recognize bayou fleet use status.the district judge signed the consent judgment on january.
before the parties reached their settlement agreement,the clulees filed a mandamus action in state court to challenge bayou fleet operations under the zoning restrictions.in response to the federal court consent judgment,the clulees filed a motion to amend or alter the judgment,claiming that the federal judge consent decree affected their rights in state court.the district judge granted the clulees motion.bayou fleet argues on appeal that the court abused its discretion by amending the consent judgment.
on february,ten days before trial,the district judge ordered bayou fleet and the clulees to submit briefs on whether the clulees were entitled to immunity.bayou fleet argued that because the clulees did not timely raise as an affirmative defense,the issue was waived.the clulees moved for summary judgment,but the court declined to rule on the motion until the conclusion of trial.bayou fleet and the clulees proceeded to trial before the district judge on february.the trial court entered its judgment dismissing bayou fleet case for reasons of immunity on september.
right of access to courts 
in its first point of error,bayou fleet claims that it was denied its first amendment right of access to the courts because of a law clerk improper participation in the trial.bayou fleet claims that the law clerk directed the district judge during the course of proceedings to the extent that the law clerk effectively presided over the trial.it argues that the law clerk participation denied it meaningful access to the courts 
bayou fleet points to several instances in the trial record that it claims are representative of the law clerk leading role in the proceedings.first,the law clerk interrupted the judge regarding the time when the judge could rule on a motion.after the judge answered an attorney question regarding the time when he would rule on a motion,the law clerk interjected stating,judge,there is no way we can rule on it by today because i am sitting in the courtroom right now.to which the judge replied to counsel,it will have to be later.
second,bayou fleet complains that the law clerk questioned witnesses and corrected the judge ruling on the defendants motion for summary judgment.the judge stated that the motion for summary judgment was denied,and the law clerk interrupted stating,judge,it not the merits that are denied,it denied because they set it after trial.the merits of the motion will be addressed in the opinion.bayou fleet argues that this exchange clearly indicates that the law clerk was ruling on the motion instead of the judge.
finally,bayou fleet points out that the judge interrupted court for two days so the law clerk could travel out of town to visit her mother.bayou fleet alleges that the court decision to postpone the trial suggests that the judge was incapable of presiding over the trial without the law clerk present.
the clulees insist that bayou fleet has taken the law clerk behavior out of context.the clulees assert that the judge intervened and ruled on objections throughout the trial without the clerk assistance.they claim that,in any event,after two years of pretrial proceedings that culminated in several published and unpublished opinions,bayou fleet can not convincingly argue that it was denied access to the courts.
access to the courts is a constitutionally protected fundamental right and one of the privileges and immunities awarded citizens under article iv and the fourteenth amendment.see chambers baltimore ohio railroad.the first amendment right to petition the government has as one aspect the right of access to the courts.see california motor transport trucking unlimited,d wilson thompson,cir naacp button,d coastal states marketing,hunt,cir.judge thornberry writing in ryland shapiro,serves to guide our analysis today.relying on bounds smith,d and rudolph locke,cir,we learn in ryland that 
a mere formal right of access to the courts does not pass constitutional muster.courts have required that the access be adequate,effective,and meaningful.
we therefore have reviewed this record to determine whether the unusual and troubling participation in this trial by the judge law clerk served to deny bayou fleet meaningful access to the courts.our review is further guided by the recognition that article iii of the constitution vesting power in the federal courts can only be read to vest the power of the court in its judge.indeed the judge is the only person involved in the trial of cases in federal court who has taken an oath pursuant to article iii.it follows that the constitution requires those functions traditionally comprising the act of judging be performed by the judge.
our review of the record persuades us that bayou fleet was not denied meaningful access to the courts.the judge was engaged in the pretrial stage and the trial itself.he questioned both witnesses and lawyers during the trial,ruled on the evidence and made those decision that were necessary for a traditional trial.we therefore,can not say that in this case that staff usurped the judge role in the process of the trial.the involvement of the judge law clerk in the trial was unfortunate and the judge should take whatever action is necessary to make sure that it does not recur.
b.the consent judgment 
before bayou fleet,the parish,alexander and coregis insurance company reached their settlement agreement,the clulees filed suit in state court to determine whether bayou fleet properly retained its zoning status.after the district judge signed the consent judgment,bayou fleet introduced the judgment in state court claiming that the proceeding was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the clulees filed a motion in federal district court to amend or alter the consent judgment.the district court granted the clulees motion.bayou fleet alleges that the court abused its discretion by amending the judgment.
a consent judgment,also known as a consent decree,is freely negotiated by the parties and has the full effect of res judicata.see united states city of miami,cir en banc rubin.because a consent judgment has a continuing affect on the rights of litigants,courts are required to ascertain whether the parties agreement represents a reasonable factual and legal determination based on the facts of the record id.at.a consent decree must arise from the pleaded case and further the objectives of the law upon which the complaint is based.league of united latin amer.citizens clements,cir citing local,int l ass of firefighters city of cleveland,d.when litigants reach a settlement that also effects third parties,the court must be satisfied that the effect on them is neither unreasonable nor proscribed.city of miami,at.we review the approval or denial of a consent judgment for abuse of discretion.see williams city of new orleans,cir.
bayou fleet argues that the zoning issue was resolved in the court october order,in which the judge held that the parish council levee law and special legal counsel resolution was unconstitutional.bayou fleet also claims that the clulees should not be able to attack the consent judgment simply because they refused to approve the final settlement.
a consent judgment must be founded on the legal and factual issues raised in the pleadings.league of united latin amer.citizens,a
