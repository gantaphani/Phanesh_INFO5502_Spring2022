rambus develops computer memory technologies,secures intellectual property rights over them,and then licenses them to manufacturers in exchange for royalty payments.in,rambus founders filed a patent application claiming the invention of a faster architecture for dynamic random access memory dram.in recent years,rambus has asserted that patents issued to protect its invention cover four technologies that a private organization sso included in dram industry standards.
before an sso adopts a standard,there is often vigorous competition among different technologies for incorporation into that standard.after standardization,however,the dynamic typically shifts,as industry members begin adhering to the standard and the standardized features start to dominate.in this case,of dram production is compliant with the standards at issue,and therefore the technologies adopted in those those over which rambus claims patent a similar level of dominance over their alternatives.
after lengthy proceedings,the federal trade commission determined that rambus,while participating in the process,deceptively failed to disclose to the sso the patent interests it held in four technologies that were standardized.those interests ranged from issued patents,to pending patent applications,to plans to amend those patent applications to add new claims rambus patent rights in all these interests are said to be sufficiently connected to the invention described in rambus original application that its rights would relate back to its date.commission br.at transcript of oral argument at see also.finding this conduct monopolistic and in violation of of the sherman act,the commission went on to hold that rambus had engaged in an unfair method of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices prohibited by a of the federal trade commission act ftc act,id.a.
rambus petitions for review.we grant the petition,holding that the commission failed to sustain its allegation of monopolization.its factual conclusion was that rambus alleged deception enabled it either to acquire a monopoly through the standardization of its patented technologies rather than possible alternatives,or to avoid limits on its patent licensing fees that the sso would have imposed as part of its normal process of standardizing patented technologies.but the merely enabling a monopolist to charge higher prices than it otherwise could have not in itself constitute monopolization.we also address whether there is substantial evidence that rambus engaged in deceptive conduct at all,and express our serious concerns about the sufficiency of the evidence on two particular points.
during the early,the computer hardware industry faced a memory bottleneck the development of faster memory lagged behind the development of faster central processing units,and this risked limiting future gains in overall computer performance.to address this problem,michael farmwald and mark horowitz began collaborating during the late and invented a dram architecture.together,they founded rambus in march and filed patent application the application on april.
as originally filed,the application included a written description of farmwald and horowitz invention,claims,and technical drawings.under the direction of the patent office,acting pursuant to,rambus effectively split the application into several the original one and divisionals.thereafter,rambus amended some of these applications and filed additional continuation and divisional applications.
while rambus was developing a patent portfolio based on its founders inventions,the computer memory industry was at work standardizing dram technologies.the locus of those efforts was the joint electron device engineering council jedec then an activity of what is now called the electronics industries alliance eia and,since,a trade association affiliated with eia and known as the jedec solid state technology association.any company involved in the solid state products industry could join jedec by submitting an application and paying annual dues,and members could receive jedec mailings,participate in jedec committees,and vote on pending matters.
one jedec committee,jc,developed standards for computer memory products.rambus attended its first jc meeting as a guest in december and began formally participating when it joined jedec in february.at the time,jc was at work on what became jedec synchronous dram sdram standard.the committee voted to approve the completed standard in march,and jedec governing body gave its final approval on may.the sdram standard includes two of the four technologies over which rambus asserts patent cas latency and programmable burst length.
despite sdram standardization,its manufacture increased very slowly and asynchronous dram continued to dominate the computer memory market,so jc began to consider a number of possible them specifications it could include in a sdram standard.as part of that process,jc members received a survey ballot in october soliciting their opinions on features of an advanced ultimately emerged as the double data rate ddr sdram standard.among the features voted on were the other two technologies at issue here phase lock and delay lock loops and clocking.the committee tallied and discussed the survey results at its december meeting,which was rambus last as a jedec member.rambus formally withdrew from jedec by letter dated june,saying among other things that the terms on which it proposed to license its proprietary technology may not be consistent with the terms set by standards bodies,including jedec.complaint counsel exhibit cx.
jc work continued after rambus departure.in march the committee adopted the ddr sdram standard,and the jedec board of directors approved it in.this standard retained sdram features including programmable cas latency and programmable burst length,and it added and clocking ddr sdram,therefore,included all four of the technologies at issue here.
starting in,rambus informed major dram and chipset manufacturers that it held patent rights over technologies included in jedec sdram and ddr sdram standards,and that the continued manufacture,sale,or use of products compliant with those standards infringed its rights.it invited the manufacturers to resolve the alleged infringement through licensing negotiations.a number of manufacturers agreed to licenses,see opinion of the commission liability op,in re rambus,docket,at july,discussing cases others did not,and litigation ensued,see id.at.
on june,the federal trade commission filed a complaint under b of the ftc act,b,charging that rambus engaged in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of the act,see id.a.specifically,the commission alleged that rambus breached jedec policies requiring it to disclose patent interests related to standardization efforts and that the disclosures it did make were misleading.by this deceptive conduct,it said,rambus unlawfully monopolized four technology markets in which its patented technologies compete with alternative innovations to address technical issues relating to dram for latency,burst length,data acceleration,and clock synchronization technologies.compl.at,june,see also liability op.at.
proceedings began before an administrative law judge,who in due course dismissed the complaint in its entirety.initial decision alj op.at.he concluded that rambus did not impermissibly withhold material information about its intellectual property,id.at,and that,in any event,there was insufficient evidence that,if rambus had disclosed all the information allegedly required of it,jedec would have standardized an alternative technology,id.at.
complaint counsel appealed the alj initial decision to the commission,which reopened the record to receive additional evidence and did its own plenary review.see liability op.at.on july,the commission vacated the alj decision and set aside his findings of fact and conclusions of law.id.at.the commission found that while jedec patent disclosure policies were not a model of clarity,id.at,members expected one another to disclose patents and patent applications that were relevant to technologies being considered for standardization,plus though the commission was far less clear on these latter items planned amendments to pending applications or anything they working on that they potentially wanted to protect with patents down the road,id.at see generally id.at.based on this interpretation of jedec disclosure requirements,the commission held that rambus willfully and intentionally engaged in misrepresentations,omissions,and other practices that misled jedec members about intellectual property information highly material to the process.id.at see also id.at outlining rambus chronology of concealment.
the commission focused entirely on the allegation of monopolization.see id.at.in particular,the commission held that the evidence and inferences from rambus purpose demonstrated that but for rambus deceptive course of conduct,jedec either would have excluded rambus patented technologies from the jedec dram standards,or would have demanded rand assurances,assurances of reasonable and nondiscriminatory license fees,with an opportunity for ex ante licensing negotiations.id.at see also id.at.rejecting rambus argument that factors other than jedec standards allowed rambus technologies to dominate their respective markets,id.at,the commission concluded that rambus deception of jedec significantly contributed to its acquisition of monopoly power,id.at.
after additional briefing by the parties,see id.at,the commission rendered a separate remedial opinion and final order.opinion of the commission on remedy remedy op,final order.it held that it had the authority in principle to order compulsory licensing,but that remedies beyond injunctions against future anticompetitive conduct would require stronger proof that they were necessary to restore competitive conditions.remedy op.at.applying that more demanding burden to complaint counsel claims for relief,the commission refused to compel rambus to license its relevant patents because there was insufficient evidence that absent rambus deception jedec would have standardized technologies instead of rambus thus,complaint counsel had failed to show that such a remedy was necessary to restore competition that would have existed in the but for world.id.at see also id.at.instead,the commission decided to compel licensing at reasonable royalty rates,which it calculated based on what it believed would have resulted from negotiations between rambus and manufacturers before jedec committed to the standards.id.at.the commission order limits rambus royalties for three years to for sdram and for ddr sdram with double those royalties for certain,products after those three years,it forbids any royalty collection.final order at remedy op.at.
rambus moved for reconsideration,and the commission denied the motion in relevant part on april.rambus timely petitioned for our review of both the commission final order and its denial of reconsideration,see c,and we consolidated those petitions.
rambus challenges the commission determination that it engaged in unlawful thereby violated of the ftc a variety of grounds,of which two are most prominent.first,it argues that the commission erred in finding that it violated any jedec patent disclosure rules and thus that it breached any antitrust duty to provide information to its rivals.second,it asserts that even if its nondisclosure contravened jedec policies,the commission found the consequences of such nondisclosure only in the alternative that it prevented jedec either from adopting a standard,or from extracting a rand commitment from rambus when standardizing its technology.as the latter would not involve an antitrust violation,says rambus,there is an insufficient basis for liability.
we find the second of these arguments to be persuasive,and conclude that the commission failed to demonstrate that rambus conduct was exclusionary under settled principles of antitrust law.given that conclusion,we need not dwell very long on the substantiality of the evidence,which we address only to express our serious concerns about the breadth the commission ascribed to jedec disclosure policies and their relation to what rambus did or did not disclose.
in this case under of the ftc act,the commission expressly limited its theory of liability to rambus unlawful monopolization of four markets in violation of of the sherman act.see liability op.at see also ftc cement.reaches all conduct that violates of the sherman act.therefore,we apply principles of antitrust law developed under the sherman act,and we review the commission construction and application of the antitrust laws de novo.ftc indiana fed of dentists,d polygram holding,ftc.
it is settled law that the mere existence of a monopoly does not violate the sherman act.see verizon commc ns,law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d united states microsoft,en banc per curiam.in addition to the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market,the offense of monopolization requires the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historical accident.trinko,at.quoting united states grinnell,d microsoft,at same.in this case,rambus does not dispute the nature of the relevant markets or that its patent rights in the four relevant technologies give it monopoly power in each of those markets.see liability op.at.the critical question is whether rambus engaged in exclusionary conduct,and thereby acquired its monopoly power in the relevant markets unlawfully.
to answer that question,we adhere to two antitrust principles that guided us in microsoft.first,to be condemned as exclusionary,a monopolist act must have anticompetitive effect.that is,it must harm the competitive process and thereby harm consumers.in contrast,harm to one or more competitors will not suffice.microsoft,at see also trinko,at.brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d covad commc ns.bell atlantic.second,it is the antitrust the government as bears the burden of proving the anticompetitive effect of the monopolist conduct.microsoft,at.
the commission held that rambus engaged in exclusionary conduct consisting of misrepresentations,omissions,and other practices that deceived jedec about the nature and scope of its patent interests while the organization standardized technologies covered by those interests.liability op.at.had rambus fully disclosed its intellectual property,jedec either would have excluded rambus patented technologies from the jedec dram standards,or would have demanded rand assurances,with an opportunity for ex ante licensing negotiations.liability op.at.but the commission did not determine that one or the other of these two possible outcomes was the more likely.see transcript of oral argument at commission counsel confirming that the commission was unable to decide which of the two possible outcomes would have occurred had rambus disclosed.the commission conclusion that rambus conduct was exclusionary depends,therefore,on a syllogism rambus avoided one of two outcomes by not disclosing its patent interests the avoidance of either of those outcomes was anticompetitive therefore rambus nondisclosure was anticompetitive.
we assume without deciding that avoidance of the first of these possible outcomes was indeed anticompetitive that is,that if rambus more complete disclosure would have caused jedec to adopt a different open,standard,then its failure to disclose harmed competition and would support a monopolization claim.but while we can assume that rambus nondisclosure made the adoption of its technologies somewhat more likely than broad disclosure would have,the commission made clear in its remedial opinion that there was insufficient evidence that jedec would have standardized other technologies had it known the full scope of rambus intellectual property.see remedy.therefore,for the commission syllogism to for the commission to have carried its burden of proving that rambus conduct had an anticompetitive must also be convinced that if rambus conduct merely enabled it to avoid the other possible outcome,namely jedec obtaining assurances from rambus of rand licensing terms,such conduct,alone,could be said to harm competition.avins white,cir where a general verdict may rest on either of two supported by the evidence and the other judgment thereon must be reversed.quoting albergo reading,cir.we are not convinced.
deceptive any other have an anticompetitive effect in order to form the basis of a monopolization claim.even an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not,without more,state a claim under the federal antitrust laws,without proof of a dangerous probability that the defendant would monopolize a particular market.brooke group,at.even if deception raises the price secured by a seller,but does so without harming competition,it is beyond the antitrust laws reach.cases that recognize deception as exclusionary hinge,therefore,on whether the conduct impaired rivals in a manner tending to bring about or protect a defendant monopoly power.in microsoft,for example,we found microsoft engaged in anticompetitive conduct when it tricked independent software developers into believing that its software development tools could be used to design java applications when,in fact,they produced ones.the deceit had caused developers who were opting for portability over performance unwittingly to write java applications that ran only on windows.at.the focus of our antitrust scrutiny,therefore,was properly placed on the resulting harms to competition rather than the deception itself.
another case of deception with an anticompetitive dimension is conwood tobacco,cir,where the sixth circuit found that tobacco dominance of the moist snuff market caused retailers to rely on it as a category manager that would provide trusted guidance on the sales strategy and display for all moist snuff products,id.at.under those circumstances,the court held that its misrepresentations to retailers about the sales strength of its products versus its competitors strength reduced competition in the monopolized market by increasing the display space devoted to tobacco products and decreasing that allotted to competing products.id.at,see also lepage,cir calling conwood a good illustration of the type of exclusionary conduct that will support a violation.
but an otherwise lawful monopolist use of deception simply to obtain higher prices normally has no particular tendency to exclude rivals and thus to diminish competition.consider,for example,nynex discon,d,in which the court addressed the antitrust implications of allegations that nynex subsidiary,new york telephone company,a lawful monopoly provider of local telephone services,charged its customers higher prices as result of fraudulent conduct in the market for the service of removing outdated telephone switching equipment called removal services.discon had alleged that new york telephone through its corporate affiliate,materiel enterprises switched its purchases of removal services from discon to a independent firm at t technologies.materiel enterprises would pass the higher fees on to new york telephone,which in turn passed them on to customers through higher rates approved by regulators.id.at.the nub of the deception,discon alleged,was that at t technologies would provide materiel enterprises with a special rebate at year end,which it would then share with nynex.id.by thus hoodwinking the regulators,the scam raised prices for consumers discon,which refused to play the rebate game,was driven out of business discon alleged that this arrangement was anticompetitive and constituted both an agreement in restraint of trade in violation of of the sherman act and a conspiracy to monopolize the market for removal services in violation of.id.at.
as to discon claim,the court held that where a single buyer favors one supplier over another for an improper reason,the plaintiff must allege and prove harm,not just to a single competitor,but to the competitive process.id.at.see generally id.at.nor,as justice breyer wrote for a unanimous court,would harm to the consumers in the form of higher prices change the matter we concede discon claim that the defendants behavior hurt consumers by raising telephone service rates.but that consumer injury naturally flowed not so much from a less competitive market for removal services,as from the exercise of market power that is lawfully in the hands of a monopolist,namely,new york telephone,combined with a deception worked upon the regulatory agency that prevented the agency from controlling new york telephone exercise of its monopoly power.id.at.
because discon based its claim on the very same allegations of fraud,the court vacated the appellate court decision to uphold that claim because u nless those agreements harmed the competitive process,they did not amount to a conspiracy to monopolize.id.at.see also forsyth humana,cir rejecting a claim that an insurance company alleged kickback scheme caused antitrust injury to group health insurance customers where the evidence showed the scheme caused higher copayments and premium payments,but did not explain how the scheme reduced competition in the relevant market,aff on other grounds,d schuylkill energy.power light,cir finding conduct did not violate antitrust laws where absent that conduct consumers would still receive the same product and the same amount of competition.
while the commission brief does mention nynex,much less try to distinguish it,it does cite broadcom qualcomm,cir,which in turn had cited the commission own landmark decision in the case under review here,id.at.there the court held that a patent holder intentionally false promise to a organization that it would license its technology on rand terms,coupled with the organization reliance on that promise when including the technology in a standard,was anticompetitive conduct,on the ground that it increased the likelihood that patent rights will confer monopoly power on the patent holder.id.at accord id.at.to the extent that the ruling which simply reversed a grant of dismissal rested on the argument that deceit lured the sso away from technology,see,it can not help the commission in view of its inability to find that rambus behavior caused jedec choice to the extent that it may have rested on a supposition that there is a cognizable violation of the sherman act when a lawful monopolist deceit has the effect of raising prices without an effect on competitive structure,it conflicts with nynex.
here,the commission expressly left open the likelihood that jedec would have standardized rambus technologies even if rambus had disclosed its intellectual property.under this hypothesis,jedec lost only an opportunity to secure a rand commitment from rambus.but loss of such a commitment is not a harm to competition from alternative technologies in the relevant markets.see hovenkamp et,ip antitrust at supp hereinafter ip antitrust a n antitrust plaintiff must establish that the organization would not have adopted the standard in question but for the misrepresentation or omission.indeed,had jedec limited rambus to reasonable royalties and required it to provide licenses on a nondiscriminatory basis,we would expect less competition from alternative technologies,not more high prices and constrained output tend to attract competitors,not to repel them.
scholars in the field have urged that if nondisclosure to an sso enables a participant to obtain higher royalties than would otherwise have been attainable,the overcharge can properly constitute competitive harm attributable to the nondisclosure,as the overcharge will distort competition in the downstream market.ip antitrust at.the contention that deception has downstream effects is surely correct,but that consequence was equally surely true in nynex though perhaps on a smaller scale and equally obvious to the court.the commission makes the related contention that because the ability to profitably restrict output and set supracompetitive prices is the sine qua non of monopoly power,any conduct that permits a monopolist to avoid constraints on the exercise of that power must be anticompetitive.but again,as in nynex,an otherwise lawful monopolist around price constraints,even when deceptive or fraudulent,does
