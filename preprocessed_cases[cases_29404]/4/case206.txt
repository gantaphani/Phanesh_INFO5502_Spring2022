under the sherman act,a plaintiff making monopoly and attempted monopoly claims must allege a relevant geographic market to help the court determine whether the defendant has monopoly power.in this case,the district court held that supreme court precedent required including in the relevant geographic market definition all locations where product suppliers are headquartered.yet the supreme court case upon which the district court relied,tampa electric nashville coal,requires no such thing.rather,it requires that courts consider,in defining the relevant geographic market,where sellers operate and where purchasers can predictably turn for supplies.if consumers can predictably turn to supplies only in the united states,then the united states is the relevant geographic market.because that is what kolon industries incorporated alleged here,the district court erred in dismissing its counterclaim for failure to sufficiently plead a relevant geographic market.
this is a case about whether du pont de nemours and company dupont attempted to wield,and did wield,monopoly power over the fiber market in violation of section of the sherman act.fibers are strong,complex synthetic fibers used to make,among other things,body armor,tires,and fiber optic cables.three dupont,dutch teijin,and korean their fibers to consumers.other producers exist but do not sell into the market.dupont is the unquestioned industry leader in the market.indeed,for many years,dupont was the only producer in the market,and it currently sells over percent of the fibers purchased in the united states.
in february,dupont brought a trade secrets suit against kolon,a relative newcomer to production.kolon counterclaimed that dupont had monopolized and had attempted to monopolize the market in violation of section of the sherman act,the primary thrust of kolon second amended counterclaim counterclaim is that dupont illegally used supply agreements with fiber customers.those agreements required customers to purchase to percent of their requirements from dupont.kolon alleged that those agreements removed substantial commercial opportunities from competition and limited other fiber producers ability to compete.
dupont moved,under federal civil procedure rule b,to dismiss kolon counterclaim.the district court granted that motion on december,on the bases that a kolon inadequately pled the relevant geographic market within which competition for fibers takes place and b kolon failed to plead adequately unlawful exclusionary conduct on the part of dupont.du pont de nemours kolon,d.the district court allowed kolon to amend,but kolon declined in favor of an immediate appeal.the district court therefore entered a final judgment against kolon under civil procedure rule b.

kolon contends that dupont violated section of the sherman act through its use of exclusive contracts with customers.under section,e very person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade is guilty of an offense and subject to penalties.to prove a section monopolization offense,a plaintiff must establish two elements the possession of monopoly power and willful acquisition or maintenance of that opposed to simply superior products or historic accidents.eastman kodak image technical,cavalier,llc verizon va,cir.an attempted monopolization offense consists of the use of anticompetitive conduct with specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of success.spectrum sports,mcquillan,advanced,radford cmty,cir.
to run afoul of section,a defendant must be guilty of illegal conduct to foreclose competition,to gain a competitive advantage,or to destroy a competitor.eastman kodak,at internal quotation marks omitted.conduct that might otherwise be lawful may be impermissibly exclusionary under antitrust law when practiced by a monopolist.indeed,a monopolist is not free to take certain actions that a company in a competitive market may take,because there is no market constraint on a monopolist behavior.lepage,cir citing aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing.and although not per se illegal,exclusive dealing arrangements can constitute an improper means of acquiring or maintaining a monopoly.see,united states grinnell,tampa electric,at,united states microsoft,advanced,at.
in analyzing sherman act section claims such as the ones kolon makes here,courts begin with a preliminary inquiry into market definition,which serves as a tool to determine the defendant market power.see consul,transco energy,cir.the market definition has two relevant product market and the relevant geographic market.id.at rcm supply,hunter douglas,cir.generally,in a section case,a plaintiff must allege both as a threshold matter.consul,at.here,the parties do not dispute the relevant product market,which is the fiber market.the disagreement here centers on the relevant geographic market.
the relevant geographic market inquiry focuses on that geographic area within which the defendant customers who are affected by the challenged practice can practicably turn to alternative supplies if the defendant were to raise its prices or restrict its output.william holmes,antitrust law handbook west see also herbert hovenkamp,federal antitrust policy west the relevant geographic area for antitrust purposes is some geographic area in which a firm can increase its price without large numbers of its customers quickly turning to alternative supply sources outside the area or producers outside the area quickly flooding the area with substitute products.courts consider,in this context,the lack alternative supplies to which a consumer might practicably turn because alternative supplies constrain an alleged monopolist ability to raise prices or exclude competition.see ball mem l,mut.hosp,cir.
the standard for determining the relevant geographic market announced in tampa has been paraphrased as follows 
t he geographic market should consist of an area in which the defendants operate and which the plaintiff can reasonably turn to for supplies.if you determine that,as a practical matter,plaintiff can only turn for supplies or purchase their relevant supplies in a narrowly defined market,then that market is the geographic market for section purposes.on the other hand,if you determine that plaintiff could turn for supplies in an area broader than the narrowly defined market,then the larger market would be the geographic market for section purposes.

the commercial realities considered when defining the relevant geographic market include where the parties market their products the size,cumbersomeness,and perishability of the products regulatory requirements impeding the free flow of competing goods into or out of the area shipping costs and limitations the area within which the defendant and its competitors view themselves as competing and other factors bearing upon where customers might realistically look to buy the product.see,antitrust law handbook rcm supply,at wampler sw.bell,cir draper son,cir.
the supreme court has noted that although the geographic market in some instances may encompass the entire nation,under other circumstances it may be as small as a single metropolitan area.brown shoe united states.therefore,in brown shoe,a clayton act case,the geographic market was properly limited to cities of a certain size where two shoe companies sold goods.id.similarly,this circuit has stated that the relevant market has been found to be a single city,a group of cities,a state,or several states.am.football league,at footnotes omitted.
consequently,dismissal of an antitrust claim for failure to adequately plead the relevant market can be problematic.as,sotomayor noted in todd

stated differently,dismissals at the,pleading stage remain relatively rare and are generally limited to certain types of glaring deficiencies,such as failing to allege a relevant market.allen dairy farmers of,d,stating that dismissals are generally limited to instances in which the complaint either fails to allege a geographic market or the boundaries of a relevant geographic market defines a geographic market in an unreasonably and implausibly narrow manner or alleges a contradictory and vague delineation of the relevant geographic market.here,none of those glaring deficiencies are present in the amended complaint.as a result,the proper market definition in this case can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the commercial realities faced by consumers.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in this case,kolon pled that the relevant geographic market was worldwide supply of fiber to commercial purchasers in the united states.kolon also pled that the market is distinct from other markets prices are high while supply is low some foreign manufacturers do not sell their fibers to consumers high technical and legal barriers to the paraaramid market exist and dupont dominates the market through the use of essentially exclusive contracts.
in other words,kolon pled that the united states functions as a distinct market for fibers.further,kolon pled market realities that could have led to the united states being a distinct is,technical,legal,and other barriers to entry,as well as dupont anticompetitive contracts with key consumers.kolon therefore pled a plausible,distinct relevant geographic market.indeed,even the district court recognized that kolon pled that consumers have considerable difficulty in turning to the products of foreign manufacturers,that kolon gives specific reasons for these difficulties,and that this and other commercial realities mitigate sic toward the plausibility of kolon proposed market definition.
the district court nevertheless concluded that t he market,per tampa electric,must be expanded to include the areas where the sellers operate,apparently without regard to whether consumers of fibers can practicably turn to supplies in those places.consequently,the district court held 
kolon can not acknowledge,on the one hand,that teijin and kolon sell to american customers while,on the other hand,excluding those countries from the geographic market.thus,the minimum plausible geographic market for kolon allegations must include the netherlands,where teijin is headquartered,and korea,where kolon is headquartered 
the district court so concluded with no information before it,on dupont rule b motion,about what fiber supplies exist in those headquarter countries or the extent to which the presumed supplies in those countries could be diverted to consumers.as a matter of fact,the district court deemed such commercial realities irrelevant even if there is considerable that much of kolon supply is not practically available to consumers in the united states,the wisdom of landes posner counsels the court to include all of kolon sales to all markets within the relevant geographic market for this case.
the district court reached this conclusion despite the fact that no federal appellate court has held that supplier headquarter sites must,as a matter of law,be included in the relevant geographic market definition in sherman act cases.the district court instead relied on a law review landes richard posner,market power in antitrust cases,harv.landes and posner posited that 
if a distant seller has some sales in a local market,all its sales,wherever made,should be considered a part of that local market for purposes of computing the market share of a local seller.this is because the distant seller has proved its ability to sell in the market and could increase its sales there,should the local price rise,simply by diverting sales from other markets.
as the district court itself recognized,however,the model proposed by landes and posner is less persuasive when exclusive dealing arrangements are alleged.when a distant seller id.is prevented from effectively competing in the american market by anticompetitive conduct,the anticompetitive actor exclusive deals prevent the distant seller from injecting a rapid influx of competing product in response to a price increase.that is precisely what kolon alleged in its counterclaim.
further,landes and posner model,by its own terms,applies only to suppliers with nonnegligible sales in the market for a continuous period of several years.this is necessary to deal with the case where distant sellers make sporadic or insignificant sales in the market in question landes posner,supra,at.kolon pled that its sales constituted only percent of the market and that kolon had been in the market since only.even landes and posner would therefore almost surely not include korea in kolon relevant geographic market.and landes and posner also made clear that s ometimes a foreign product will reach just one of the coasts of the united states the west coast,for japanese and other asian producers the east coast,for european producers domestic transportation costs will prevent it from reaching the interior markets of the united states or the other coast.these sellers should not be included in measuring the market power of firms selling to the interior markets or the other coast.id.that caveat could rule both dutch teijin and korean kolon out of the relevant geographic market 
regardless of landes and posner construct,in rcm supply,our paraphrasing of tampa electric standard makes plain that this circuit does not interpret tampa electric to require suppliers headquarter locations to be included in relevant market definition without regard to whether consumers can actually turn to those places for supplies.rcm supply,at.in fact,the rcm supply jury was instructed to find the relevant geographic market to be the washington,area if it found that rcm could practically turn only to supplies in that area.id.the jury was further instructed that,to determine to what area rcm can practically turn for supplies,you should consider whether there are any differences in transportation costs,distribution facilities,customer inventory or any other factor that would cause the plaintiff to turn to the suppliers solely within the washington area.id.that is,one must look at the commercial realities to define the relevant market.
similarly,in united states pabst brewing,a clayton act case,the supreme court approved of a geographic market for beer sales that was limited to wisconsin or a area of wisconsin,illinois,and though a significant portion of the beer sold in wisconsin was brewed elsewhere.see united states pabst brewing,rev,noting that beer was sold in wisconsin by breweries but only breweries were operated in that state.
further,in united states dentsply int l,cir,the third circuit accepted a relevant market definition of the sale of prefabricated artificial teeth in the united states.the government complaint in dentsply,similar to kolon counterclaim here,alleged that dentsply,which held a to market share,stifled artificial tooth competition,including through the use of exclusive agreements.id.at.some of the other manufacturers of prefabricated artificial teeth who sold into the as vita zahnfabrik and heraeus kulzer gmbh would seem to be foreign.id.nonetheless,the relevant market was confined to all prefabricated artificial teeth sales in the united states.id.
rcm supply,brown shoe,pabst brewing,dentsply,and other demonstrate that,in defining the relevant geographic market in an antitrust case,plaintiffs are not required to include supplier headquarter or other sites without regard to whether consumers can predictably turn to those places for supply.and tampa electric neither held nor implied any such requirement.
here,kolon pled a relevant geographic united states.further,kolon pled plausible reasons for limiting the geographic market to the united states.kolon therefore cleared the hurdle of pleading a plausible relevant geographic market.whether kolon proffered relevant geographic market definition will hold up upon a inquiry remains to be seen.but dismissing kolon counterclaim on its face was error.
nonetheless,dupont attempts to preserve its b victory by comparing the inadequate complaint in twombly,to kolon counterclaim here.but this case is no twombly.in twombly,the plaintiffs brought an antitrust conspiracy claim but then failed to allege a conspiracy,an illegal agreement,instead alleging merely parallel business conduct.twombly.here,in contrast,kolon unquestionably alleged a relevant geographic market.as the record shows,kolon alleged a distinct market and then explained why it was so.
dupont further contends that kolon counterclaim must fail because of the berry amendment,which generally prohibits the department of defense from buying supplies from foreign producers such as kolon.see.however,the extent to which dupont dominant market position can be attributed to the berry the district court attempted to analyze by inappropriately going beyond the be determined at the stage.further,kolon counterclaim restricts its market definition to commercial purchasers.under these circumstances,dismissal was inappropriate.
finally,dupont contends that,according to the department of justice and federal trade commission horizontal merger guidelines,considering foreign supply into the market while limiting the relevant geographic market to the united states is appropriate only where price discrimination is alleged.dupont argues that,because kolon did not use the phrase price discrimination in its counterclaim,kolon made no such allegation.
dupont cites no binding authority for either the proposition that such a market definition is permissible only where price discrimination is alleged or the proposition that the specific words price discrimination must be used to allege price discrimination.see united states dean foods,case,wl,at.april,holding that plaintiff was not required to include magic words in order to survive a motion to dismiss when claiming defendant ability to,impose a small but significant and nontransitory increase in price on customers unable to turn to alternative supply.
meanwhile,kolon pled that dupont dominated the market,that consumers pay more than consumers elsewhere,but that,despite high prices,fiber supply in the united states remains low.these allegations suggest price discrimination that would support kolon contention that dupont possessed sufficient market power such that it was a monopolist.see,in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust,cir price discrimination implies market power,that is,the power to charge a price above cost including in cost a profit equal to the cost of equity capital without losing so much business so fast to competitors that the price is unsustainable.
in sum,kolon pled a distinct relevant geographic market and provided numerous reasons for defining the market as it did.kolon plausible relevant geographic market was sufficient to withstand a rule b motion to dismiss,and the district court erred in holding otherwise.
the district court also concluded that kolon failed to adequately plead anticompetitive conduct.kolon contends that this determination rested on information inappropriately considered on a motion to dismiss and on inferences in dupont,instead of kolon,favor.we agree.
facts and inferences on dupont motion to dismiss 
when ruling on a rule b motion to dismiss,a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.erickson,at.see also advanced,at the factual allegations of the plaintiff with respect to the relevant markets and the defendants market shares must be accepted as true at this point.the complaint need only give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.coleman,at internal quotation marks omitted.and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the complainant.nemet chevrolet,at.
in deciding whether a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss,a court evaluates the complaint in its entirety,as well as documents attached or incorporated into the complaint.sec y of state for defence trimble navigation,cir phillips lci int l,cir stating that a court may consider a document outside the complaint in determining whether to dismiss the complaint where the document was integral to and explicitly relied on in the complaint and there was no authenticity challenge.however,the district court can not go beyond these documents on a rule b motion if it does,it converts the motion into one for summary judgment.b,d.such conversion is not appropriate where the parties have not had an opportunity for reasonable discovery.gay wall,f d,cir because gay was not afforded an opportunity for reasonable discovery,the district court treatment of the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment was an abuse of discretion.
additionally,statements by counsel that raise new facts constitute matters beyond the pleadings and can not be considered on a rule b motion.dolgaleva.beach city pub,app x,cir citing hamm rorer,cir smith local,sheet metal workers int l ass n,cir treating a rule b dismissal order as converted into summary judgment because district court relied on materials outside the pleadings,including oral argument.in dolgaleva,rather than considering only the face of the complaint,the district court allowed the defendant to dispute allegations during a hearing.the district court then improperly dismissed the complaint based on statements the defendant made at the hearing.dolgaleva,app x at.citing lee.city of los angeles,cir finding error where the district court assumed the existence of facts that favor defendants based on evidence outside plaintiffs pleadings,and took judicial notice of the truth of disputed factual matters.
similarly,in this case,the district court went beyond kolon counterclaim in ruling on dupont motion to dismiss.the district court relied upon a statement made by dupont counsel during oral argument that kolon had access to all of dupont relevant supply agreements during the time period in question.the district court reiterated several times that dupont asserts that these are the only supply agreements relevant to kolon claims and that dupont has affirmed,at oral argument in open court,that it has disclosed all supply agreements pertinent to kolon claims.the district court then made plain that it accepted the statement as true and would evaluate kolon complaint in light thereof these documents,in essence,are kolon case for anticompetitive conduct.
similarly,the district court stated 
the court will not view these supply agreements as it would the entirety of both parties evidence at summary judgment.but,dupont has affirmed,at oral argument in open court,that it has disclosed all supply agreements pertinent to kolon claims.thus,the legal sufficiency of kolon allegations depends upon whether its claims of market exclusion are plausible given the substance of the supply agreements.
the problem kolon never suggested in its counterclaim that it had received all of dupont contracts relevant to kolon antitrust claims.and it would surely have been difficult for kolon to know whether it had all relevant dupont contracts given that nothing in the record indicates that full discovery had been undertaken 
nevertheless,the district court anticompetitive conduct analysis is riddled with reliance on dupont statement about the contracts.for example,the district court stated that dupont has executed supply agreements,covering various periods from through the end of,with four of its top twelve customers t his percentage does not allow for a plausible claim of substantial foreclosure.in analyzing dupont market share for which kolon was prevented from competing,the district court assumed only four anticompetitive,that four of dupont top twelve customers were constrained from buying kolon or other dupont competitors products.on that basis,the district court calculated an overall market foreclosure percentage of less than percent and held that such a low percentage was not enough to have a significant effect on competition in violation of the sherman act.
we hold that the district court erred in accepting statements beyond the counterclaim and making inferences on that basis in favor of dupont.and because the record indicates that the parties had not yet had the opportunity to conduct reasonable discovery,converting the motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment,where such statements,if appropriately presented,could be considered,would have been error.see gay,at because gay was not afforded an opportunity for reasonable discovery,the district court treatment of the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment was an abuse of discretion.
it remains for us to determine whether the district court error was harmless.where a district court errs in going beyond the complaint on a rule b motion,the error is harmless if the complaint would not have withstood the motion to dismiss on its face.dolgaleva,app x at.stated differently,we can affirm the dismissal of the complaint on any basis fairly supported by the record.eisenberg wachovia bank,cir.we therefore look to kolon counterclaim to determine whether kolon sufficiently pled its two sherman act claims,taking kolon allegations as true and making all reasonable inferences in its favor.see erickson,at nemet chevrolet,at 
kolon monopolization claim 
as stated earlier,a monopolization violation consists of two elements the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market,and willful maintenance of that power.eastman kodak,at cavalier,at.to violate section,a defendant must engage in conduct to foreclose competition,gain a competitive advantage,or to destroy a competitor.eastman kodak,at internal quotation marks omitted.
as to the first element,possession of monopoly power,this court has previously noted that when monopolization has been found the defendant controlled seventy to one hundred per cent of the relevant market.white bag int l paper,cir citations omitted.see also,dentsply,at noting that dentsply has had a persistently high market share between and on a revenue basis,in the artificial tooth market and holding that dentsply share of the market is more than adequate to establish a prima facie case of power internal quotation marks omitted domed stadium hotel,holiday inns,cir supreme court cases,as well as cases from this court,suggest that absent special circumstances,a defendant must have a market share of at least percent before he can be guilty of monopolization.further,some courts have also focused on the durability of the defendant market power,particularly with an eye toward other firms in ability to enter the market.see,reazin blue cross blue shield of kansas,cir.
here,the district court assumed that kolon adequately pled possession of monopoly power.that assumption was correct,given that kolon pled,among other things,that numerous barriers to entry into the fiber market exist and supply is low dupont has long dominated the paraaramid fiber market and dupont currently controls over percent of that market,that dupont market share remains greater than of all sales by purchase volume of fiber in the united states,see advanced,at in its complaints,the plaintiff contends that defendants have a dominant share of the product markets in their respective relevant geographic areas and that this constitutes monopoly power or a dangerous probability of actual monopolization.these allegations could,if proven,support a finding of monopolization or a dangerous probability of monopolization of the relevant dme markets at stake.
further,regarding the relevant market,there is no dispute that the product market is that for fibers.and we have already held that the pled geographic market,paraaramid fiber supply to commercial consumers in the united states,was sufficient to withstand dupont rule b motion.
as to the second element of a monopolization claim,willful maintenance of monopoly power,kolon counterclaim focuses on dupont use of essentially exclusive agreements with key fiber purchasers.although not per se illegal,exclusive dealing arrangements may be an improper means of acquiring or maintaining a monopoly.see,grinnell,at tampa electric,at,microsoft,at.
in tampa electric,the supreme court held that an exclusive dealing arrangement does not violate antitrust law unless its probable effect is to foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected.at.the market share foreclosed is important because,for the contract to adversely affect competition,the opportunities for other traders to enter into or remain in that market must be significantly limited id.at.in tampa electric,the pertinent contract affected less than one percent of the relevant market,which was quite insubstantial,and did not violate the clayton or sherman acts.id.at.because an exclusive deal affecting a small fraction of a market clearly can not have the requisite harmful effect upon competition,the requirement of a significant degree of foreclosure serves a useful screening function for such antitrust cases.microsoft,at.
in microsoft,the circuit indicated that a monopolist use of exclusive contracts,in certain circumstances,may give rise to a sherman act violation even
