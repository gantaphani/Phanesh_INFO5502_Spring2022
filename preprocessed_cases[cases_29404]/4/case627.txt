independent ink,independent appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the central district of california in this patent tying antitrust action.the district court granted summary judgment on plaintiff independent sherman act section claim because independent had failed to produce any evidence of market power over the tying product.indep.ink,trident,d.we hold that a rebuttable presumption of market power arises from the possession of a patent over a tying product.because no rebuttal evidence was submitted by the patent holder,we reverse the grant of summary judgment on the sherman act section claim and remand for further proceedings.as to independent sherman act section claim,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
defendant trident,trident is a subsidiary of defendant illinois tool works,itw.trident is a manufacturer of printheads and holds a patent over its printhead technology.see patent the patent.printer manufacturers the oems use trident printhead technology to manufacture printers.the end users of the printers are usually product manufacturers,who use the printers to place bar codes on cartons.
as disclosed by the patent,ink jet devices for printing bar codes consume a large quantity of ink.the small cartridges typical in other ink jet devices are impractical for such applications.but the use of a large supply of ink poses problems for transferring the ink from the container to the printhead.specifically,one must be able to apply pressure in one direction,forcing ink towards the printhead,without sucking the ink back when that pressure is released.as reflected in the prior art and discussed by the patent,there have been essentially three methods by which this could be done.first,there have been valves that allow release of the pressure without affecting the flow of ink.however,such valves must be sensitive to back pressure while being strong enough to seal the ink,and are difficult to reliably design.second,there have been devices that pressurize the air space above the ink reservoir.but any increase in pressure in the ink container will continue to force ink out even after the pressure is removed p uncturing a hole in the container in the air space above the ink to relieve pressure within the container makes removal of partially filled containers messy.id,ii.third,there have been devices using a peristaltic pump.however,such devices are usually complex and expensive.the patent discloses an ink jet device and supply system using a hand actuated peristaltic pump.the use of hand pumping overcomes the usual complexity and expense of such devices.
trident also manufactures ink for use with its patented printheads.trident standard form licensing agreement allowing the oems to use its patented product requires oems to purchase their ink for systems exclusively from trident.br.of appellees at.specifically,the licensing agreement grants the right to manufacture,use and sell ink jet printing devices supplied by trident only when used in combination with ink and ink supply systems supplied by trident.at.there is now no claim that the ink is protected by any of trident patents we thus have an explicit tying agreement conditioning the sale of a patented product the printhead covered by the patent and possibly other patents as well on the sale of an unpatented one the ink.
independent is a competing manufacturer of ink.it manufactures ink usable in trident printheads.independent filed suit in the united states district court for the central district of california on august,initially seeking a declaratory judgment of and invalidity against trident patents.independent subsequently amended its complaint to allege that trident was engaged in illegal tying and monopolization in violation of sections and of the sherman act,et.both parties moved for summary judgment as to the section claim,and trident moved for summary judgment as to the section claim.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of trident on both claims.
the district court held that for patent tying to constitute a violation of the antitrust laws,the plaintiff must affirmatively prove market power.indep.ink,d at.the district court,in a footnote,dismissed several supreme court cases holding to the contrary as vintage.id.at.addressing the supreme court more recent decision in jefferson parish hospital district hyde,d,it declined to follow the rule announced by the majority in that case that the sale or lease of a patented item on condition that the buyer make all his purchases of a separate tied product from the patentee is unlawful.instead,relying on the concurring opinion in jefferson parish,the dissent from a denial of certiorari by two members of the jefferson parish majority and academic criticisms of the presumption of market power,the district court dismissed the majority opinion of jefferson parish as dictum that should not be followed.indep.ink,d at.the district court found that independent submitted no affirmative evidence defining the relevant market nor proving trident power within it,and therefore could not prevail in either antitrust claim.id.at.
the parties settled all their remaining claims,which were accordingly dismissed with prejudice,and final judgment was entered.this appeal followed.because the complaint originally contained a claim for declaratory judgment of invalidity and of the patent,we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the first issue before us is whether federal circuit or ninth circuit law governs the legality of patent tying under the sherman act,an issue which may arise both in the context of affirmative claims as here and in the context of a patent misuse defense.we have previously held that where an affirmative antitrust claim or antitrust misuse defense is based on procuring or enforcing a patent,the central antitrust question is a matter governed by federal circuit law.nobelpharma ab implant innovations,en banc in relevant part.we conclude that the antitrust consequences of patent tying likewise is a question governed by our law however,as stated in nobelpharma,we will continue to apply the law of the appropriate regional circuit to issues involving other elements of antitrust law,such as defining the relevant market and determining as a factual matter whether power exists within that market.id.at.
we now address the sherman act section claim.this case first requires us to determine whether patent tying is illegal per se or presumptively illegal under the sherman act or whether the plaintiff is obliged to prove as part of its affirmative case that the patent confers market power in the relevant market for the tying product.
this case comes to us with a long history of supreme court consideration of the legality of tying arrangements.earlier supreme court cases dealing with tying agreements were extremely hostile to them,whether the case involved intellectual property or other tying products.the first case that found tying to violate section of the sherman act was a patent tying case.int l salt united states.in standard oil united states,the court commented that t ying agreements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition.in northern pacific railway united states,d,the court held again that 
tying arrangements flout the sherman act policy that competition rule the marts of trade by conditioning his sale of one commodity on the purchase of another,a seller coerces the abdication of buyers independent judgment as to the tied product merits and insulates it from the competitive stresses of the open market.
id.at.quoting publ g united states.the court held that northern pacific conditioning the lease of its land to shipping commodities on its railway lines violated the sherman act,because northern pacific landholdings gave it sufficient economic power to impose an appreciable restraint on free competition in the tied product.id.at.
later supreme court cases reflected divergent treatment,depending on whether statutory intellectual property was involved.those cases not involving patents or copyrights refined the test,holding that tying was only unlawful if the defendant had market power in the market for the tying product.as articulated in united states steel fortner enterprises,d fortner ii,this requirement of market power necessitated an inquiry into whether the seller has the power,within the market for the tying product,to raise prices or to require purchasers to accept burdensome terms that could not be exacted in a completely competitive market.the requirement of demonstrating sufficient market power to raise prices was notably more onerous than the northern pacific requirement that there be some power to appreciably restrain free competition.
the supreme court further explained the requirement for market power in the jefferson parish decision,which involved an agreement requiring patients of a hospital to use a particular anesthesiology firm.the court stated that certain tying arrangements pose an unacceptable risk of stifling competition.at.but the unacceptable risk of stifling competition arises,and consequent liability attaches,only if there is anticompetitive forcing.as explained by the court 
t he essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all,or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms.when such forcing is present,competition on the merits in the market for the tied item is restrained and the sherman act is violated.
id.at.the requirement of proving forcing or market power in cases not involving intellectual property necessitates a definition of the market in which such power is alleged to exist and showing an actual adverse effect on competition.id.at.the supreme court reaffirmed the requirement of market power in such cases in eastman kodak image technical services,d,where it held that tying violates of the sherman act if the seller has appreciable economic power in the tying product market and if the arrangement affects a substantial volume of commerce in the tied market.
the court treatment of tying cases when the tying product is patented or copyrighted,however,has been more consistent.in the international salt case,the defendant held patents over machines for utilization of salt products.at.it leased these machines on the condition that the lessee purchase from the defendant all unpatented salt and salt tablets consumed in the leased machines.id.the supreme court held that this arrangement violated the sherman act,holding that the patents confer no right to restrain use of,or trade in,unpatented salt.id.at.the court found that by tying the lease of machines to the purchase of salt,and contracting to close this market for salt against competition,the defendant engaged in a restraint of trade for which its patents afford no immunity from the antitrust laws.id.at.the court made no inquiry of the defendant market power,finding that the admitted facts left no genuine issue t he tendency of the patent tying arrangement to accomplishment of monopoly seems obvious.id.
in united states loew,d,relying on international salt,the court made clear that,where the tying product is patented or copyrighted,market power may be presumed rather than proven.loew involved the tying of less popular films to popular copyrighted films by movie distributors in their licenses to television stations.the court stated that in tying cases not involving intellectual property the standard of illegality is that the seller must have sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product.id.at.however,t he requisite economic power is presumed when the tying product is patented or copyrighted.id.the loew court confirmed that patent tying is a distinct doctrine when it noted defendants argument that their behavior is not to be judged by the principle of the patent cases,but by the general principles which govern the validity of tying arrangements of nonpatented products.id.at.the loew court also stated that it needed not inquire into whether the distributors had market power.t he mere presence of competing substitutes for the tying product is insufficient to destroy the legal,and indeed the economic,distinctiveness of the copyrighted product.id.at.
the subsequent supreme court cases that have required proof of market power in tying cases not involving intellectual property have consistently reaffirmed the holdings of international salt and loew that no proof of market power is necessary in patent or copyright tying cases.the fortner ii court in expressly restated the presumption of market power in cases of patent tying,stating that the statutory grant of a patent monopoly in international salt represented tying products sufficiently unique to give rise to a presumption of economic power.at.likewise,the jefferson parish court in stated that if the government has granted the seller a patent or similar monopoly over a product,it is fair to presume that the inability to buy the product elsewhere gives the seller market power.at.
in sum,the supreme court cases in this area squarely establish that patent and copyright tying,unlike other tying cases,do not require an affirmative demonstration of market power.rather,international salt and loew make clear that the necessary market power to establish a section violation is presumed.the continued validity of international salt and loew as binding authority,and the distinction between patent tying and other tying cases that was articulated in loew,have been consistently reaffirmed by the court ever since 
defendants attempt to distinguish international salt and loew on the ground that they were cases brought by the united states.specifically,they argue that international salt and loew apply only to government cases because prior to walker process equipment,food machinery chemical,d,private parties could not bring antitrust tying suits.this is simply incorrect.see,switzer,locklin,cir,cert.denied,d private party patent tying case in,four years before walker process.moreover,we can see no persuasive reason to make such a distinction between government and private party plaintiffs.there is no indication whatsoever in either international salt or loew that the court considered it important that it was the united states bringing suit.we further note that the manifest purpose of the statute authorizing private party actions,is to encourage the enforcement of the antitrust laws.zenith radio hazeltine research,d.we conclude that defendants attempt to distinguish international salt and loew as involving suits brought by the united states is without merit.
the defendants argue alternatively that international salt and loew are no longer good law.they offer three theories in support of this contention.first,they point to walker process,where the court stated in a patent antitrust case that it was reluctant to extend per se illegality on the bare pleadings and absent examination of market effect and economic consequences.at.but walker process was a section case asserting claims of monopolization,not a section claim for tying.moreover,the gravamen of walker process was the inappropriate obtaining of the patent,id.at,not the extension of that patent beyond its terms to an unpatented article through a tying arrangement,see int l salt,at.we conclude that walker process does not articulate a rule applicable to patent tying cases 
the defendants next point to justice concurrence in jefferson parish,which was joined by chief justice burger,justice powell and now chief justice rehnquist,stating that it is a common misconception that a patent or copyright suffices to demonstrate market power.at,concurring.defendants argue that the jefferson parish concurrence,coupled with a dissent in the following year joined by two members of the jefferson parish majority imply that a of the court indicated that international salt and loew were no longer good law.the district court relied on this reasoning.indep.ink,d at.it is not persuasive.justice white opinion in data general,joined by justice blackmun,did not expressly contradict internati
