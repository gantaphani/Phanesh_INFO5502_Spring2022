augusta news brought this antitrust case in district court against portland news,hudson news,and news,llc the llc.augusta alleged violations of both section c of the clayton act,c,as amended by the act,pub,stat,and section of the sherman act,after discovery was complete,the district court granted summary judgment on all counts for the defendants and augusta appealed to this court.we begin with a statement of background facts.
prior to,publishers seeking to sell magazines and newspapers in maine sold them to local wholesale distributors who then resold the publications to retailers at a discount off the printed cover price.augusta news and portland news were two of five local wholesale distributors operating in maine in late the others were magazines,winebaum news and maine periodical distributors.each wholesaler served a de facto exclusive territory and operated as the sole supplier of periodicals to all retailers within that locale.
in late,this system began to change in maine and elsewhere at the insistence of the large retail chains like,which comprised much of the distributors sales.rather than deal with numerous distributors,the large retailers sought to consolidate regionally their purchasing of publications and obtain from the chosen regional distributor lower prices,centralized billing,and improved service.in response to such retailer demands,two distributor entities began to compete for chain business on a regional basis in new england in.
the first,retail product marketing rpm,was formed in september by fifteen independent wholesale distributors in new england,including two in maine portland and magazines.although augusta was offered the opportunity to join rpm,it declined to do so.rpm members agreed to bid for large retail chain contracts exclusively through rpm.when an rpm bid was successful,rpm says that it would then determine which rpm member or members would service the retailer various locations throughout new england,based on retailer preference and other considerations such as the location of individual rpm members.
the second became the primary competitor to rpm for regional hudson,a wholesale distributor based in new jersey with operations in new york and parts of new england.in november,hudson signed a contract to supply all stores in the northeast,including four stores previously serviced by augusta accounting for about percent of augusta business.in december,hudson won a bid against rpm to supply all of hannaford stores in the northeast,including stores previously serviced by augusta representing percent of augusta business.
in late december,hudson formed a joint venture with portland the llc under which portland would service all of hudson customers in maine,including customers acquired after the agreement.thereafter,hudson prevailed over rpm in bidding to supply northeast stores march and cumberland farms new england stores late july portland serviced these accounts.however,portland remained a member of rpm,eligible for any business rpm won in competition with hudson.
like hudson,rpm was successful in obtaining business.in march,it won a bid to supply shaw supermarkets locations throughout new england,two of which were in augusta formerly exclusive territory.in april,rpm won over all of christy stores in new england,including eight locations previously served by augusta,and all of cvs stores in maine,four of which had been serviced by augusta.in july,rpm secured the contract for rite aid stores in maine,some of which had been serviced by augusta.
rpm and hudson each offered large fees to the chain retailers.for example,hudson paid hannaford per store and between and per store to secure exclusive contracts.rpm paid from for each existing cvs location to for each rite aid location.the amounts were sometimes paid annually and sometimes spread over the life of the contract.some retailers demanded the fees one,declined to accept them.under the rpm charter,the fees were paid by the member which serviced the store.under the llc agreement,portland agreed to pay the fees for every store it serviced.
augusta,which refused to offer retailers fees,rapidly lost its chain store customers.augusta says that it thought such payments were illegal and unprofitable.augusta also chose not to service customers on a regional level,bidding only for the local or business of the chains.in july,concluding that it could not stay in business without the retail chain stores that it had lost to hudson and rpm,augusta closed its doors.
in june,augusta filed this suit in the federal district court in maine.augusta complaint claimed that fees paid by hudson and portland violated section c of the clayton act,as amended by the act,and section of the sherman act.in addition,augusta charged that hudson and portland and possibly rpm other members had agreed to divide the maine market,in violation of section of the sherman act.
soon after the present suit was brought,hudson merged operations with rpm to form.allegedly,it is now the only regional distributor servicing large retail chains in maine.the new entity also stopped offering fees to retailers on new contracts.
after discovery was complete,hudson and portland moved for summary judgment.in a careful opinion,the magistrate judge recommended granting the motion,finding that the fees were price concessions,rather than brokerage payments,and therefore not covered by section c,and that augusta section claim lacked merit because augusta had failed to show injury to competition.in a brief order,the district court affirmed the recommendation and entered judgment for defendants.this appeal followed.
we begin with augusta claims under the act one,set forth in the complaint and resolved adversely to augusta in the district court,is that the fees paid by hudson and portland were brokerage fees or other concessions forbidden by section c the other is a claim that these payments violated section a restriction on price discrimination,a claim that augusta belatedly sought to introduce into the case after the magistrate judge recommended decision.the relationship between the two provisions is relevant.
as adopted in,the original section of the clayton act simply prohibited sellers from discriminating in price among purchasers of commodities where the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly subject to a cost defense and a meeting competition defense.pub.law,stat.when section was revised in by the act,this ban was as section a with a portion into section b and elaborated in certain respects not pertinent here.
at the same time,congress added section c as a new and more rigid ban on certain brokerage or other payments.the full text of section c is as follows 
it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce,in the course of such commerce,to pay or grant,or to receive or accept,anything of value as a commission,brokerage,or other compensation,or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof,except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods,wares,or merchandise,either to the other party to such transaction or to an agent,representative,or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is acting in fact for or in behalf,or is subject to the direct or indirect control,of any party to such transaction other than the person by whom such compensation is so granted or paid.
this convoluted paragraph has bewildered lawyers and judges ever since,but its history provides some enlightenment.the act,unlike the ordinary antitrust laws,was designed less to protect competition than in the midst of the great depression to protect small businesses against chain stores.a particular target were the discounts that manufacturers furnished to large chain stores.the revamped section a directly addresses such discounts and the protective purpose accounts for certain rigidities in judicial interpretation of what might otherwise appear to be a conventional antitrust statute 
section c was intended to close firmly a potential loophole in the new regime.sellers often employ brokers,who are paid a commission,to seek out and arrange sales one of the
