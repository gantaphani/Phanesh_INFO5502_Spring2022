at issue in this appeal is whether all charges imposed by electronic discovery vendors to assist in the collection,processing,and production of electronically stored information esi are taxable against a losing party as f ees for exemplification or the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case.we have not previously addressed this issue,and the courts that have considered this question have reached conflicting results.compare,in re aspartame antitrust,cv ldd,wl,at,we award costs for the creation of a litigation database,storage of data,imaging hard drives,keyword searches,deduplication,data extraction and processing,with rawal united air lines,c,wl,at,refusing to award electronic processing costs as taxable.
the district court in this case concluded that more than in charges imposed by the electronic discovery vendors,covering such activities as hard drive imaging,data processing,keyword searching,and file format conversion,are taxable,without differentiating between those charges that constitute f ees for exemplification,and the charges that constitute costs of making copies.in view of the significant role that electronic discovery plays in litigation today,involving the collection,processing,and production of huge volumes of data generated as a result of the information technology and communication revolutions,we believe it imperative to provide definitive guidance to the district courts in our circuit on the question of the extent to which electronic discovery expenses are taxable we conclude that none of the electronic discovery vendors activities in this case can be regarded as exemplification of materials.we further conclude that only scanning and file format conversion can be considered to be making copies,an activity that amounts to approximately of the more than in electronic discovery charges taxed in this case.accordingly,we will affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand the matter to the district court to reduce the cost award accordingly.

as would be expected in a case of this nature and magnitude,the parties engaged in extensive discovery of esi.the case management order cmo,issued by the district court in january of,directed the parties to attempt to agree upon a list of keyword search terms,with a party use of such terms carrying a presumption that it had fulfilled its obligation to conduct a reasonable search.the cmo further provided that,unless native file format was reasonably necessary to enable the other parties to review those files,esi was to be produced in tagged image file format,accompanied by a cross reference or unitization file,in standard format opticon,summation dii,or the like showing the bates number of each page and the appropriate unitization of the documents.the cmo further identified specific metadata fields that had to be produced if reasonably available.finally,the cmo directed the parties to produce a n extracted text file or searchable version for each electronic document in a document level text file except for any file produced in native format.
hoosier and dms each retained separate vendors to assist with the production of esi specifically,dms retained capital city consulting ccc,a north carolina firm,and hoosier retained preferred imaging and xact data discovery.based upon the vendors invoices,rta categorized the activities conducted by the vendors as follows preservation and collection of esi processing the collected esi keyword searching culling privileged material scanning and tiff conversion optical character recognition ocr conversion and conversion of racing videos from vhs format to dvd format

following completion of the appeals process,the clerk for the district court proceeded to consider the bills of costs that had been presented by dms and hoosier pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d.on the line of the bill of costs form for f ees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case,dms claimed,and hoosier claimed.in response to rta objection to the dms bill of costs,dms acknowledged that the invoices of its vendor,ccc,were exceedingly confusing and inconsistent.as a result,dms mistakenly included duplicate invoices,and asserted that its actual costs were,an amount that was almost less than its original claim.
the clerk of the district court,in his taxation of costs,stated that t his is the first case in the western district of pennsylvania that a party has requested that electronic discovery costs be taxed.noting that there was no precedent on this issue from this court,and that the district courts across the country are divided on the issue,and further observing that the cmo set forth procedures for complying with electronic discovery requests,the clerk concluded that electronic discovery costs would be consider ed taxable,as opposed to just the costs of litigating.in support of this conclusion,the clerk distinguished the western district of pennsylvania general rule disallowing copying charges as office expenses and part of the costs of litigation,citing krouse american sterilizer,stating that the requirements and expertise necessary to retrieve and prepare these documents were an indispensable part of the process.

rta responded to the clerk taxation of costs by filing with the district court a motion to appoint special master regarding e discovery issues and a motion to review taxation of costs.in a memorandum opinion issued on may,the district court declined to appoint a special master and affirmed the clerk taxation of the electronic discovery vendor charges.see race tires,hoosier racing tire,cv,wl,at.may.after commenting on the contentious nature of the discovery and the extensive amount of esi produced during the litigation,and canvassing the extant case law,the district court concluded that the entire amounts charged by the electronic discovery vendors were taxable.id.in reaching this result,the district court essentially found that the steps the vendor s performed appeared to be the electronic equivalent of exemplification and copying,id.at,reiterating the clerk of court comment that the requirements and expertise necessary to retrieve and prepare documents for production were an indispensable part of the discovery process.id.at.without assessing each of the discrete functions performed by the vendors,the district court also concluded that the vendors charges were necessarily incurred and reasonable.id.at.in support of this conclusion,the district court noted that the amounts charged by the vendors in this case were within the parameters set forth in the case law.id.finally,the district court made clear that it regarded its taxation of electronic discovery vendor costs as not establishing a precedent as to how this court or any other member of this court will rule on future disputes regarding costs of,explaining that it regarded the facts and circumstances of this case to be unique.id.at.

federal rule of civil procedure d states that u nless a federal statute,these rules,or court order provides otherwise,costs other than attorney fees should be allowed to the prevailing party.although rule d stipulates that costs should be allowed to the prevailing party,emphasis added,congress,in,specified the litigation expenses that qualify as taxable costs.see crawford fitting gibbons,section defines the term costs as used in rule d.section provides

at issue in this case is,f ees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case.following the example of the late judge edward becker in addressing other issues pertaining to the taxation of costs,we first examine a page of history to assist us in our understanding of.in re paoli yard pcb,cir quoting trust eisner,upon this point a page of history is worth a volume of logic.
section is the modern codification of the fee act of,ch,stat.see alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y.prior to the act,the federal courts taxation of costs against losing litigants conformed to the state rules governing such matters,resulting in great diversity in practice among the courts and losing litigants being unfairly saddled with exorbitant fees for the victor attorney.id.at.to avoid these problems,congress undertook to standardize the costs allowable in federal litigation.id.the result was a act specifying in detail the nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the federal courts.id.at.

the question presented here is whether authorizes the taxation of an electronic discovery consultant charges for data collection,preservation,searching,culling,conversion,and production as either the exemplification or the making of copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case.this language first appeared in of the act,which in part provided that the lawful fees for exemplifications and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use on trial shall be taxed by a judge or clerk of the court.stat.section language was carried over through to the revision of the judicial code with two substantive changes.see judiciary and judicial procedure act,ch,stat.the act broadened the recoverable exemplification and copy fees from those obtained for use on trials to those obtained for use in the case.id.it also replaced the mandatory language of the prior statute,which read that costs shall be taxed,to provide,consistent with the discretionary language of rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure,that the court may tax as costs any of the enumerated categories of expenses.id.
the subdivision providing for the award of fees for exemplification and copying costs has been amended only once since.in,the statute reference to copies of papers was replaced with the costs of making copies of any materials.judicial administration and technical amendments act of,stat.emphasis added.this amendment to originated with a recommendation of the judicial conference committee on court administration and case management.see judicial conference of the,report of the proceedings of the judicial conference of the united states.the committee was asked to consider whether the list of taxable costs should be amended to include expenses associated with new courtroom technologies.id.at.the committee,c oncluding that adding the full range of such costs might go well beyond the intended scope of the statute,recommended that the judicial conference endorse two limited amendments to.id.at.one of the two proposed limited amendments was to permit taxing the costs associated with copying materials,whether or not they are in paper form.id.
rta argues that the electronic discovery costs taxed against it do not constitute fees for exemplification or the making of copies.appellant br.hoosier and dms argue that their incurred electronic discovery costs fall within the statute allowance for costs for exemplification and making copies,without drawing any real distinction between the two terms.dms br,hoosier br,internal citations omitted.we,however,do not think that the terms are interchangeable or synonymous.it is a canon of statutory interpretation that the use of different words or terms within a statute demonstrates that congress intended to convey a different meaning for those words.mccarthy,cir citations omitted.as we remarked in tavarez klingensmith,i f possible,we must give effect to every clause and word of a statute,and be reluctant to treat statutory terms as surplusage,cir citations,internal quotation marks,and alteration omitted.
accordingly,we first determine whether the services for which the district court taxed costs qualify as exemplification of materials.the courts that have differentiated exemplification from making copies in the context of have reached different conclusions as to the term meaning.in kohus cosco,the federal circuit,applying sixth circuit law,reversed an award of the costs for producing a video exhibit.observing that congress did not use the broad phrase demonstrative evidence in section,and predicting that the sixth circuit would apply the narrow legal definition of exemplification as an official transcript of a public record,authenticated as a true copy for use as evidence,id at quoting black law dictionary ed,the court ruled that the district court lacked statutory authority to award costs for the video.id.
the seventh circuit has interpreted exemplification expansively,as the act of illustration by example,a definition broad enough to include a wide variety of exhibits and demonstrative aids.cefalu vill.of elk grove,cir citing merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.thus,in the seventh circuit,exemplification fees may be awarded s o long as the means of presentation furthers the illustrative purpose of an exhibit.id at.
there is no need to decide whether congress used the term exemplification in its narrow legal sense,or in the broader sense adopted by the seventh circuit.the electronic discovery vendors work in this case did not produce illustrative evidence or the authentication of public records.their charges accordingly would not qualify as fees for exemplification under either construction of the term.
we next consider allowance for the costs of making copies.the noun copy is defined as an imitation,transcript,or reproduction of an original work.webster third new international dictionary ed.the dictionary definition is consistent with its common use to denote something that is made to duplicate something else,usually an original.for example,a year old copy of the ten commandments recently went on display in new york.the term copy helps to convey that we are not referring to the original stone tablets on which the commandments were inscribed what is on display is a parchment copy of the original stone tablets.the word copy is frequently utilized to refer to photocopies or xerox copies reproductions of documents made using copy machines.indeed,since the advent of photocopying technology,the allowance for fees for copies under has been relied upon by prevailing parties to recover photocopying costs.see,northbrook excess surplus ins.procter gamble,cir tokyo electron,discreet indus,cas.of am.stanchfield.the most recent amendment to the statute,however,permitting an award to the prevailing party of the cost of making copies of materials,plainly signifies that allowance for copying costs is not limited to paper copying.we must accordingly decide whether any of the electronic discovery vendor charges in this case qualify as the costs of making copies of any materials.
the invoices that hoosier and dms submitted in support of their bills of costs are notable for their lack of specificity and clarity as to the services actually performed.for instance,preferred imaging invoices appended to the bill of costs have thousands of dollars in charges for edd processing,without explaining what that activity encompasses.and while preferred image use of the phrase performing may be less obtuse,the invoices provide no indication of the rationale for these activities,nor their results in terms of the actual production of discovery material.these activities also amount to thousands of dollars in charges.the ccc invoices are similarly replete with technical jargon that makes it difficult to decipher what exactly was done.rta brief was helpful in categorizing the invoices numerous entries,and with its guidance,we identify the following general categories of services comprising the vendors electronic discovery services collecting and preserving esi processing and indexing esi keyword searching of esi for responsive and privileged documents converting native files to tiff and scanning paper documents to create electronic images.
of the activities undertaken by the vendors,only the conversion of native files to tiff the default format for production of esi,and the scanning of documents to create digital duplicates are generally recognized as the taxable making copies of material.see,hecker deere,cir costs of converting computer data into a readable format in response to plaintiffs discovery requests are recoverable under.bdt prods.lexmark int l,cir e lectronic scanning and imaging could be interpreted as exemplification and copies of papers.brown mcgraw hill,d,t he electronic scanning of documents is the equivalent of copies of paper,and,therefore,can be taxed pursuant to.we agree that scanning and conversion of native files to the format for production of esi constitute making copies of materials.
in this case,the charges for scanning and tiff conversion comprise only approximately of the more than in electronic discovery charges awarded in this case.rta agrees that the format conversion charges are authorized under,but asserts that there has been no showing that the resulting digital copies were necessarily obtained for use in the case.once statutory authority to tax costs has been established,however,the amount awarded is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.see in re paoli yard pcb,at given the district court discretionary equitable power to award costs under rule d,taxation of costs is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.citations omitted.in light of the volume of esi produced in this case,we can not find that the inclusion of all scanning and tiff conversion costs was an abuse of the district court discretion.accordingly,we will affirm the taxation of,representing the scanning and tiff conversion undertaken on behalf of hoosier 
although perhaps not falling within the technical expertise of electronic discovery vendors,the cost of transferring vhs recordings to dvd format similarly qualifies as making copies.rta,while acknowledging that this activity is taxable,disputes the amount taxed,observing that only of converted videos were produced to it.once again,however,the question of the amount of costs to be taxed for copies necessarily obtained for use in the case falls within the district court ample discretion,and we can not find an abuse of discretion in the district court decision to tax the cost for transferring all of the videos,totaling.
the district court,while acknowledging the lack of controlling precedent and the division of opinion among the federal courts outside of this circuit,held that hoosier and dms were entitled to an award of all electronic discovery charges imposed by their electronic discovery vendors.in reaching this decision,the district court placed special reliance on cbt flint partners,llc return path,d,vacated,in that case,the district court rejected the plaintiff objections to the defendant claim for in fees charged by the defendant electronic discovery vendor to collect,search,identify and help produce electronic documents from the defendant network files and hard drives in response to the plaintiff discovery requests.id.at.in overruling the plaintiff objection,the district court reasoned that the vendor highly technical services were not the type of services that attorneys or paralegals are trained for or are capable of providing.id.at.the district court,acknowledging the statutory requirement,then remarked that the services are the century equivalent of making copies.id.the district court did not explain how all the various services performed by the vendor to achieve the production of electronic documents amounted to making copies,seemingly concluding that,because all the various services were necessary to the ultimate production of electronic copies,the services were equivalent to one entire act of making copies.
the district court cited the cbt flint partners,llc court reasoning in affirming the clerk of court taxation of hoosier and dms electronic discovery costs,writing a careful review of the vendor invoices reveals that the services provided were not the type of services that attorneys or paralegals are trained for or are capable of providing.the services were highly technical.race tires,wl,at.the district court also found it significant that the services performed by hoosier and dms electronic discovery vendors to retrieve and prepare these documents for production,were an indispensable part of the discovery process.id.
indeed,in the view of courts that have upheld the taxation of electronic discovery costs pursuant to,the indispensability of the services to the ultimate act of production of intelligible electronic documents has been a significant factor.those courts,like the cbt flint partners,llc court,exp
