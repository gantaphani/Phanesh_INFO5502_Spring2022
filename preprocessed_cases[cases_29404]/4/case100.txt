spggc,llc,a seller of prepaid gift cards,sued to prevent the connecticut attorney general from enforcing a state consumer protection law that regulates the terms and conditions of such cards.the united states district court for the district of connecticut underhill,granted the attorney general motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.at issue in this appeal is whether spggc stated valid claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the attorney general enforcement efforts are federally preempted or that they violate the commerce clause of the united states constitution.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
because this appeal is from the dismissal of a complaint under rule b,we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw inferences in favor of spggc.united states baylor.med,cir.
a.the simon giftcard 
spggc is a subsidiary of simon property group,which operates shopping malls in more than thirty states,including connecticut.the simon giftcard,a prepaid,payment card,is sold in simon malls,as well as through simon website.
at the time spggc filed its second amended complaint,the giftcards were issued by bank of america,boa,a national bank,and operated on the visa debit card infrastructure.simon are similar in size and appearance to credit or debit cards,and carry a visa logo along with simon accepted by any merchants that accept visa debit cards.spggc acknowledged selling several thousands of giftcards each year in connecticut.all of spggc revenue,and any profit,from the giftcards derives from the fees associated with them.several such fees are imposed directly on giftcard purchasers,including upfront fees,and potentially applicable maintenance,replacement,and call center fees.
boa is a visa member bank,and as such may issue various forms of visa payment cards.see generally united states visa,d,visa i,aff,cir visa ii.issuers generally act as the liaison between the network,visa and the individual cardholder,and collect an interchange fee each time a transaction is executed.visa ii,at.as a visa member bank,boa must adhere to visa bylaws and operating regulations.see visa i,d at.pursuant to its relationship with spggc,all simon giftcards and cardholder agreements identified boa as the issuer.the cards themselves were identified as property of boa.
in addition,boa retained review and approval authority over all terms and conditions for the giftcards,as well as design of the cards and card carriers with which they were sold.these terms and conditions were uniform across the united states,and,according to spggc,were modeled after those used for boa own branded gift cards.they included a monthly service fee,to be deducted from any balance remaining on the giftcard after six months from the date of purchase.in addition,to comply with visa regulations,all simon giftcards carried a expiration date.according to spggc complaint,boa approved these terms.
b.the connecticut giftcard law 
the connecticut gift card law prohibits the sale of any gift certificate subject to inactivity or dormancy fees or to an expiration date.see.pub.acts,june,spec.sess.codified at.gift certificates are defined to include gift cards and other cards.
under the general heading escheats,the gift card law provides that a holder of a gift certificate may not impose on the property a dormancy charge or fee,abandoned property charge or fee,unclaimed property charge or fee,escheat charge or fee,inactivity charge or fee,or any similar charge,fee or penalty for inactivity with respect to the property.id.elsewhere,the law provides that n o person may sell or issue a gift certificate that is subject to an expiration date.id.a.
the attorney general maintains that the gift card law applies only to the sale of gift cards in connecticut,not their use,and thus permits cards purchased out of state to be used in connecticut despite any restrictions or fees such cards may carry.the intent of the law,he suggests,is to protect connecticut consumers from being deprived unwittingly of the value of gift cards they have purchased in the state.
proceedings below 
in november,the connecticut attorney general informed spggc that the state intended to bring an enforcement action against it for violating the connecticut gift card law.in response,spggc filed an action in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that the attorney general proposed enforcement action was preempted by the national bank act,et.three days later,the attorney general sued spggc in state court,alleging that simon giftcards carry expiration dates and impose on consumers a variety of fees in violation of the gift card law.spggc removed the attorney general action to federal court,where it was consolidated with the original suit.spggc amended its complaint to add a claim under the commerce clause.spggc also sought an injunction preventing the attorney general from pursuing any further enforcement action against it in state court.
the attorney general moved to dismiss spggc complaint for failure to state a claim.judge underhill granted the motion.spggc moved for reconsideration on three bases that the court had failed to consider our decision in wachovia bank,burke,cir,which was issued a few weeks prior to the district court ruling that the court had clearly erred in its analysis of spggc commerce clause claim and that under an agreement scheduled to take effect in september,the simon giftcard would be issued jointly by a national bank and a federal savings association,subjecting it to oversight by the office of thrift supervision ots as well as the office of the comptroller of the currency occ.the court granted reconsideration,but adhered to its prior decision dismissing spggc complaint.see spggc,blumenthal,d.
spggc appeals,arguing that the district court erroneously dismissed both its preemption and its commerce clause claims.spggc arguments focus exclusively on its relationship with to this has since terminated but was in effect throughout the proceedings in the district court.spggc,llc ayotte,cir noting that after spggc ended its relationship with boa in september,it entered into contracts with bank,a national bank,and metabank,a national thrift,and describing the terms of those contracts.accordingly,we will not consider the new contractual arrangements,which spggc raised in its motion to reconsider but which were never included in an amended complaint and were not the subject of briefing before this court.as the attorney general continues to seek civil penalties from spggc relating to its issuance of simon giftcards in conjunction with boa,the issues presented herein survive the termination of sppgc relationship with boa.

preemption 
federal preemption of a state statute can be express or implied,and generally occurs where congress has expressly preempted state law,where congress has legislated so comprehensively that federal law occupies an entire field of regulation and leaves no room for state law,or where federal law conflicts with state law.burke,at.federal regulations have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes.fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.at issue here is conflict preemption,which occurs when compliance with both state and federal law is impossible,or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objective of congress.united states locke,d internal quotation marks omitted.spggc contends that applying the connecticut gift card law to simon giftcards would frustrate the purposes of the national bank act nba and occ regulations.
the nba authorizes national banks to exercise several enumerated powers as well as all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.seventh.the supreme court has interpreted grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily preempting,contrary state law.barnett bank of marion county,nelson,d.as the agency charged with implementing the nba and overseeing national banks in the exercise of their powers thereunder,the occ has broad authority from congress to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out its responsibilities.see nationsbank of,variable annuity life ins,d.this includes the authority to define the incidental powers of national banks and to authorize activities beyond those enumerated in the statute.id.at.burke,at.
one activity the occ has authorized national banks to engage in is offering electronic stored value systems.a.such systems include payment cards that enable individual cardholders to store value outside of a conventional consumer demand deposit bank account relationship.conditional approval,see also bull,guidance on electronic financial services consumer compliance ffiec guidance july,electronic stored value products are retail payment products in which value is recorded on a personal electronic device or on a magnetic strip or computer chip in exchange for a predetermined balance of funds.it is thus beyond genuine dispute that national banks have the authority,under federal law,to develop and market gift cards that function in generally the same way as those at issue here.moreover,occ regulations appear to permit,or at least not to prohibit,the attachment of expiration dates and dormancy or inactivity fees to such cards.see,a authorizing national banks to impose charges and fees on their customers bull,stored value card systems,noting that stored value systems may have limits on the amount of electronic cash that can be stored or cards that expire after some established time period.
without conceding the point,the attorney general does not dispute that as applied to a national bank,the connecticut gift card law would be preempted by the occ conflicting regulations regarding stored value systems.assuming that is the case,it follows that the gift card law would also be preempted as applied to national bank operating subsidiaries.unless otherwise provided by federal law or occ regulation,state laws apply to national bank operating subsidiaries to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank.see watters wachovia bank,d.
spggc is neither a national bank nor the operating subsidiary of a national bank.however,spggc contends that because of its association with boa,the simon giftcard was a national bank product and therefore subject to the occ exclusive supervision.the crux of spggc argument is that compliance with the connecticut gift card law not only restricts its own ability to offer gift cards on terms it deems appropriate,but also limits boa ability to issue such cards and have them operate on visa electronic payment platform.
spggc attempts to analogize its relationship with boa to the relationship between an operating subsidiary and its parent national bank,over which the occ has exclusive regulatory jurisdiction.see watters.at burke,at.the district court rejected this analogy,observing that spggc did not plead any facts to indicate that it is a subsidiary of a national bank,such that the nba would apply to its activities.d at.at best,the court found,spggc had a close agency or business relationship with boa but that is not sufficient to entitle it to protection under the nba.id.at.the court acknowledged that if boa were a plaintiff,a different analysis might be required.id.at.
in response to a request for amicus briefing by this court,the occ argued that the district court took too narrow a view of the preemption question,particularly in light of the supreme court intervening decision in watters wachovia.watters,like burke,involved a state banking commissioner effort to enforce regulations pertaining to real estate lending against a national bank operating subsidiary.see watters.at.the supreme court emphasized that in analyzing whether state law hampers the federally permitted activities of a national bank,we have focused on the exercise of a national bank powers,not on its corporate structure.id.at emphasis in original.the occ contends that the district court preemption analysis should have focused less on the identity of the plaintiff,spggc,than on whether and to what extent the simon giftcard represented an exercise of boa powers as a national bank.
we agree with this contention as far as it goes.however,we believe that it would be a mistake to read watters so broadly as to obscure the unique role assigned to operating subsidiaries in the context of national banking regulation.the court in watters observed that unlike other types of national bank affiliates,an operating subsidiary is tightly tied to its parent by the specification that it may engage only in the business of banking as authorized by the act.id.at emphasis added citations omitted.moreover,the authority of national banks to do business through operating subsidiaries is itself a power that congress granted to the banks through the nba.see id.at the authority to engage in the business of mortgage lending comes from the nba,as does the authority to conduct business through an operating subsidiary.citations omitted.by contrast,the relationship between boa and spggc enjoys no special status under the statute.g a distinguishing operating subsidiaries from other financial subsidiaries,b defining national bank affiliates.
it is possible that,in certain instances,a national bank decision to carry out its business through an unaffiliated third party such as spggc might constitute an exercise of the bank incidental powers under the nba,seventh.but it does not follow that a state attempt to regulate the third party conduct is necessarily preempted as it would be if directed toward the bank itself or toward an operating subsidiary.significantly,the occ does not view the regulation of spggc collection of fees as an encroachment on boa power,stating specifically in its amicus brief that we do not believe that the state restrictions on simon charging a monthly service fee in connection with the gift cards would burden or interfere with national bank powers to issue cards as a payment mechanism.emphasis in the original.in any case,we must ask whether the regulation at issue actually affects the national bank exercise of any authorized powers or whether it limits only activities of the third party which are otherwise subject to state control.
although boa was the issuer of the simon giftcard,spggc bore the costs of administering the program and also collected and retained maintenance and other fees associated with the cards.boa,by contrast,was compensated exclusively through visa interchange fees generated on a basis.while boa had review and approval authority over any terms and conditions the giftcards carried,nowhere in its complaint does spggc allege that boa had the authority to establish such terms or conditions in the first instance.that power belonged solely to spggc.
we have no difficulty the occ suggests in its amicus spggc has failed to state a valid claim for preemption of the connecticut gift card law insofar as it prohibits spggc from imposing inactivity and certain other fees on consumers of the simon giftcard.see.the attorney general enforcement of the law,in this respect,does not interfere with boa ability to exercise its powers under the nba and occ regulations.rather,it affects only the conduct of spggc,which is neither protected under federal law nor subject to the occ exclusive oversight.granting the occ authority to examine the affairs of a national bank and its affiliates,as shall be necessary to disclose fully the relations between such bank and such affiliates and the effect of such relations upon the affairs of such bank.we do not address whether we would reach a different conclusion were the fees in question established and collected by the issuing bank rather than by spggc.see,ayotte,at holding that new hampshire gift card regulations are preempted where bank,the national bank that issued the cards,had sole control over their terms and conditions and was solely responsible for compliance with such terms that is not the case presently before this court.
spggc,however,does state a valid claim for preemption insofar as the connecticut gift card law prohibits expiration dates.see.stat.a.unlike the various administrative and maintenance fees associated with simon giftcards,spggc alleged in its complaint that an expiration date is necessary to implement visa fraud prevention and card maintenance requirements applicable to all prepaid cards bearing the visa logo.taking this allegation as true,an outright prohibition on expiration dates could have prevented a visa member bank such as boa from acting as the issuer of the simon giftcard.boa is legally entitled to use the visa payment network,and,contrary to the attorney general suggestion,a visa issuer benefits directly from having the cards operate on the visa network due to the interchange fees received each time a gift card transaction is executed.as a result,connecticut attempt to prohibit expiration dates must be analyzed separately from the state ban on inactivity fees for purposes of federal preemption.in the absence of further factual development concerning the precise nature of visa requirements,as well as boa involvement in setting the expiration date for the simon giftcard,we are not at this point prepared to conclude that spggc claim is entirely lacking in merit accordingly,we vacate and remand this only this the judgment below so that the district court can reconsider spggc preemption claim as to the state ban on expiration dates.we express no view on the resolution of the merits of this claim.
commerce clause 
spggc claims that,as applied to the simon giftcard,the connecticut gift card law also violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution.the commerce clause authorizes congress t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states.const.art.i,cl.in addition,courts have long interpreted the commerce clause as an implicit restraint on state authority,even in the absence of a conflicting federal statute.united haulers ass n,solid waste mgmt,d.state laws that clearly discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce are considered virtually per se invalid.or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality of,d.discrimination,in this context,means differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.id.
by contrast,we will uphold a nondiscriminatory statute that affects interstate commerce only incidentally,unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.pike bruce church,d.to prove that a state law is either per se invalid or fails the pike balancing test,a plaintiff must at least show that the law has a disparate impact on interstate commerce.automated salvage,wheelabrator envtl,cir see also freedom holdings spitzer,cir.
spggc identifies two ways in which the connecticut gift card law allegedly impacts interstate commerce it effectively regulates commerce occurring outside of connecticut and it conflicts with the gift card regulations of other states.because spggc has failed to plead facts sufficient to support either theory,the district court properly dismissed its dormant commerce clause claims.
extraterritoriality 
a state law may burden interstate commerce when it has the practical effect of requiring commerce to be conducted at the regulating state direction.am.booksellers found.dean,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also mfrs.ass sorrell,cir.when a statute directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a state,it is invalid under the commerce clause because it exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting state authority.healy beer,d.we have analyzed the extraterritorial effects of state regulations as a form of excessive burden under the pike balancing test,see,sorrell,at,and also as a basis for per se invalidity,see,wheelabrator,at see also freedom holdings,at.although it is not entirely clear from our dormant commerce clause precedents which test should apply in this case,it is irrelevant the facts alleged by connecticut gift card law does not regulate commerce.am.trucking ass ns.pub.serv.comm n,d scalia,concurring distillers state liquor,d recognizing that there is no clear line separating the category of state regulation that is virtually per se invalid under the commerce clause,and the category subject to the pike bruce church balancing approach.
spggc attempts to analogize the connecticut gift card law to regulations the supreme court held unconstitutional in healy beer institute and distillers new york state liquor authority.healy and both concerned state laws that pegged the instate prices of liquor or beer to prices charged outside the states in question.see healy,at.describing connecticut beer statute,at.describing new york alcoholic beverage control law.although the statutes at issue in those two cases differed somewhat in operation,each had the undeniable effect of controlling commercial activity occurring wholly outside the boundary of the state.healy,at.in,the court found that new york had project ed its legislation into other states by effectively requiring distillers to seek the approval of the new york state liquor authority before lowering prices elsewhere.at.internal quotation marks omitted.likewise,in healy,the court observed that connecticut had require d shippers to forgo the implementation of schemes in markets because those pricing decisions are imported by statute into the connecticut market regardless of local competitive conditions.at.holding both statutes unconstitutional,the court noted that states may not deprive businesses and consumers in other states of whatever competitive advantages they may possess based on the conditions of the local market.id.quoting,at.spggc suggests that the gift card law,like the liquor and beer price regulations,benefits connecticut consumers at the expense of consumers in other states.
none of the factual allegations in spggc complaint supports its bald assertion that the gift card law operates as a form of economic protectionism in favor of connecticut consumers,at.were we to accept spggc theory,almost every state consumer protection law would be considered protectionist in a sense prohibited by the constitution.the meaning of the dormant commerce clause is far narrower.see united haulers.at the dormant commerce clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake,and what activities must be the province of private market competition.and because consumer protection is a field traditionally subject to state regulation,w e should be particularly hesitant to interfere with the state efforts under the guise of the commerce clause.see motors abrams,cir.
spggc fails to allege any facts tending to show,specifically,how the effects of the gift card law might be projected into other states.the attorney general has stipulated that the law applies only to sales of gift cards in connecticut.unlike the laws in healy and,the gift card law does not,by its terms or its effects,directly regulate sales of gift cards in other states.nor does it prevent other states from regulating gift card sales differently within their own territories.
spggc argues that the gift card law nonetheless operates as an extraterritorial restriction because it forces the costs of compliance onto consumers.we do not agree that consumers must inevitably be the ones to bear such costs.instead,they could be passed on to connecticut gift card consumers in the form of fees or else absorbed by spggc in the form of lower profits.in sorrell,we rejected an argument virtually identical to the one spggc makes here.we observed that simply because a state regulation would force the regulated manufacturers to bear some of its costs,it does not automatically violate the commerce clause.sorrell,at.
spggc further argues that because visa generally requires that payment cards carry an expiration date to operate on its network,the gift card law would effectively ban visa products in connecticut and thereby impact the worldwide market for electronic payment instruments.this argument is significantly overstated.even if the
