in this appeal,we determine the impact on a settlement agreement,partially resolving a class action,of a second settlement agreement resolving the remainder of the same action.
tobacco farmers commenced this antitrust class action against several tobacco manufacturers and dealers,alleging that the defendants conspired to violate the federal antitrust laws.the parties,except for reynolds tobacco company rjr,settled the case with a settlement agreement dated may,the first settlement agreement.the first settlement agreement included two provisions for adjusting benefits to the plaintiff class,and the triggering of these adjustments depended on the existence and timing of a later settlement agreement with rjr.the first provision adjusted the monetary payments that the settling defendants agreed to make to the class based on the terms of any settlement that the class might reach with rjr on or before the day before the first day of trial.the second provision adjusted the amounts of tobacco that the settling manufacturers agreed to purchase from class members based on the terms of any settlement that the class might enter into with rjr before the beginning of trial.
the tobacco farmer class did subsequently enter into a settlement agreement with rjr dated april,the rjr settlement or the second settlement.the district court found that the rjr settlement was reached when it was signed on april,which was also the date scheduled for the beginning of trial.on motions filed by settling defendants philip morris usa,philip morris and lorillard tobacco company lorillard to trigger the adjustments available in the first settlement agreement based on the rjr settlement,the district court entered an order dated june,concluding that the settling defendants were not entitled to either of the adjustments because the rjr settlement was not reached or entered into before the triggering times specified in the first settlement agreement.philip morris and lorillard appealed.
for the reasons given hereafter,we deny the class motion to dismiss this appeal based on its assertions that the language of the first settlement agreement made the district court resolution of the issues and that the district court order interpreting the first settlement agreement was not a final appealable order.because we conclude that the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding as a fact that the rjr settlement was reached after the day before the first day of trial,we affirm the district court denial of the adjustment for any monetary payment required by the first settlement agreement.we reverse,however,the district court legal interpretation of the first settlement agreement that the rjr settlement was not entered before the beginning of trial.thus,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
in february,seven tobacco farmers commenced this antitrust action against philip morris,lorillard,brown williamson tobacco corporation,rjr,and several leaf tobacco dealers,alleging that the defendants conspired to fix prices at tobacco auctions and to reduce tobacco growing quotas,in violation of the sherman act.the tobacco farmers purported to represent a class of hundreds of thousands of tobacco farmers that the district court certified as a class on april,describing the class as 
all persons including corporations and other entities holding a quota under the federal tobacco program to grow or burley tobacco in the united states at any time from february to the present and all domestic producers of or burley tobacco who sold such tobacco in the united states at any time from february to the present.
on may,the tobacco farmers class and all of the defendants,except rjr,entered into the first settlement agreement,and the district court approved that agreement on october.
the first settlement agreement provided two principal benefits to the tobacco farmers class two cash payments consisting of a first installment of million and a later conditional installment of million,and a commitment by the settling manufacturers to purchase leaf tobacco in specified amounts over specified years.each of these commitments was subject to a reduction adjustment should the class enter into a settlement with rjr during a specified period.the second payment of million was subject to a proportionate reduction if the plaintiff class reached settlement with rjr on or before the day before the first day of trial.and the manufacturers agreement to purchase tobacco was subject to a most favored nations clause under which the settling manufacturers obligations under the first settlement agreement would be no less favorable to them than those terms agreed to in any agreement with rjr.the adjustment,however,applied only if a settlement with rjr was entered before the beginning of trial.
following the district court approval of the first settlement agreement on october,the litigation continued against rjr,and trial was ultimately scheduled to commence on april,at 
during a settlement conference between counsel for the class,counsel for rjr,and the district judge on friday,april,counsel for rjr explained that it had not settled the case earlier because we assumed we were going to try the case because the settlement for us late would have been prohibitive.that clause the most favored nations clause ends,as i understand it,the day before the trial.the court recognized the problem for a settlement,explaining,a final agreement,in my opinion,if you reach an agreement,should come only after the impaneling of the jury.the court stated further that it saw nothing wrong in an attempt to settle this case today,with an understanding that this case will not be settled,if it is settled,until next thursday when we impanel a jury.later on april,after the court had left the attorneys to discuss settlement further,the parties indicated to the court that they had not tentative settlement.the district judge recalled,about that report 
i heard that there was some agreement,or each of the parties at least had indicated,and this was some time later,that an amount of poundage and an amount of payment was,in fact,within the realm of what each one of them thought they could do.i indicated that i thought one of those two figures was not what it should be,and i asked them to go back and talk.
and we came back and talked about the matter.and at that time,i think class counsel indicated that is where they were at that point,and then it was a matter that he could take up with his clients and that after that,both sides indicated that they,i thought,said,i think we can work this out.
the following monday,april,class counsel assured counsel for philip morris that no settlement with rjr had been reached.accordingly,as required by the first settlement agreement,on april day before the trial was scheduled to morris wired the second installment of million to the class.
on the morning of april when the jury venire was in the jury room and the judge in his chambers,the class and rjr signed the second settlement agreement at the courthouse and submitted it to the court.when the district judge entered the courtroom,he stated 
good morning,everybody.i believe that i have heard that we have some signed papers.i have in chambers just reviewed some papers,which i find to be in order.and we will talk more about that in a few moments.but we do have a number of people waiting upstairs who have given of their time to be here.
so,without objection,i going to bring those jurors down at this point and let them go.
i do believe that the papers are signed now.is that correct,wiseman 
when counsel for both parties confirmed that the papers had been signed,the jury panel was called into the courtroom and told,j ust about five minutes ago,the parties have signed an agreement in this case,and the agreement is that they have settled their differences for that reason,you are not going to have to serve as a juror in this case.the court then released the venire.on the same day,the district court preliminarily approved the rjr settlement,subject to the class action notice and final approval procedure.
the rjr settlement contained the same two components as were included in the first settlement agreement.rjr agreed to pay the class million in cash and agreed to purchase from class members million pounds of tobacco annually for at least a total of million pounds.the court observed with approval that the million pounds per year rjr agreed to purchase,coupled with the million pounds per year agreed to by the other manufacturers,provided a total commitment to purchase million pounds of tobacco each year.
because of the rjr settlement,a week later philip morris filed a motion for the return of its second settlement payment in the amount of million and for discovery relating to the rjr settlement,and both philip morris and lorillard filed notices with the court of the triggering of the most favored nations clause in the first settlement agreement.they argued that the class and rjr had reached a settlement on april,or at least by april,and that even if the rjr settlement had not been entered into until april,at that time the trial had not yet begun.
the district court issued an order on june,denying philip morris motion for return of the million payment and concluding that the most favored nations clause had not been triggered.the district court found that the earliest the settlement was reached was april,the date on which it was signed,and since this was after the day before the first day of trial,philip morris was not entitled to a reduction of its second settlement payment.with respect to the most favored nations clause,which would not have been triggered if the trial had begun,the district court recognized conflicting authority for when a trial begins and reasoned that because there is a public policy against the strict enforcement of most favored nations clauses,a settlement entered into on the day trial was scheduled to start,at the time the case was called for trial,with a jury venire present,was not entered into before the beginning of trial.it thus rejected all of philip morris and lorillard claims for adjustments under the first settlement agreement based on the rjr settlement.
from the district court june order,philip morris and lorillard filed this appeal.thereafter,the class filed a motion to dismiss this appeal,contending that the first settlement agreement bars appellants resort to this court for interpretation of the settlement agreement terms.they relied on of the first settlement agreement,which provides that any unresolved disputes relating to the tobacco leaf volume commitments must be brought to the district court for its final and resolution,and c,which provides continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the settlement,including its administration,in the district court.the class also argues in their brief that the district court order was not an appealable order under.
at the outset,we address the class motion to dismiss the appeal based on contractual waiver and an absence of finality of the district court order.we address its arguments in order.
pointing to and c of the first settlement agreement,the class contends that the appellants agreed to waive any right to appeal.the class argues that these sections evidence the parties intent to streamline dispute resolution through mediation and district court resolution.section states that i n the event of a disagreement regarding compliance with the tobacco leaf volume commitments,the parties shall first engage in mediation if the parties are still unable to resolve their disputes,the parties shall bring the matter to the district court for its final and resolution.the class argues that the dispute over the most favored nations clause is a disagreement regarding compliance with the tobacco leaf volume commitments that is addressed in.and section c reserves to the district court continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the settlement,including its administration.the class argues that the only construction that here gives meaning to both continuing and exclusive is one that bars appellate jurisdiction.
the first settlement agreement provides that north carolina law governs its interpretation,and the parties agree that we are to apply north carolina law.under that state law,as under general principles of contract law,our task is to give ordinary words their ordinary meanings.internet east,duro communications,see also harris latta,in construing contracts ordinary words are given their ordinary meaning unless it is apparent that the words were used in a special sense weyerhaeuser carolina power light,when the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous,effect must be given to its terms,and the court,under the guise of constructions,can not reject what the parties inserted or insert what the parties elected to omit.if the plain language of a contract is clear,the intention of the parties is inferred from the words of the contract.walton city of raleigh,see also fidelity bankers life ins.dortch.
giving the language of the first settlement agreement its ordinary and natural meaning,we do not read and c to support the class motion to dismiss.while the most favored nations clause,if triggered,would affect the volume of appellants purchase commitments,this action is not a disagreement regarding compliance with those commitments,as governed by.rather,it is a dispute over the interpretation of a contractual term in another section of the agreement.
similarly,we conclude,given the provision plain language,that the class reading of c is too broad.the district court maintenance of continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over an agreement is not inconsistent with this court exercise of appellate jurisdiction to review the district court orders.marino pioneer edsel sales,cir discussing continuing jurisdiction in terms of a district court ability to resolve disputes related to its prior orders meade meade,cir noting that a presumption of continuing and exclusive jurisdiction in one state court discourages resort to the courts of a second state.indeed,c does not include any language.
accordingly,we deny the class motion to dismiss the appeal based on the contractual language of and c of the first settlement agreement.
the class also asserts that the portion of the district court order addressing the most favored nations clause is not a final judgment because it does not resolve all claims for all parties.the class points to the district court continuing administration and oversight of the tobacco leaf commitments to which the most favored nations clause relates and resolution of conflicts thereunder.moreover,it notes that the rjr portion of the litigation is still not finally resolved.
first,we note that there are no pending issues about whether settling defendants have complied or will comply with tobacco purchase commitments.when such an issue arises,if it does arise at all,it will be addressed by the settlement agreements and by the district court continuing jurisdiction that is analogous to a court jurisdiction over an injunction.but the issues before us are not of that character.they relate to the discrete issue of whether the rjr settlement triggers the adjustments provided for in the first settlement agreement.if the district court order determining that the provisions of the first settlement agreement are not triggered by the rjr settlement is a final order with respect to the monetary payment under the first settlement agreement,as the parties seem to agree,it follows that it is also a final order with respect to the district court determination that the most favored nations clause is not triggered by the rjr settlement.for,the interpretation and application of the first settlement agreement will not be subjected to any further trial or legal analysis by the district court.
this conclusion is apparent because orders,of the kind before us,resolve completely the issues raised and do not present the same risks for piecemeal appeal that prejudgment orders do.thus,we agree with the third circuit approach to issues arising in connection with settlement agreements,finding it appropriate that the requirement of finality be given a practical rather than a technical construction.plymouth mut.life ins.life ins,cir quoting gillespie steel,d.the court there continued,this is
