this appeal is about whether the plaintiff,coalition for icann transparency,using antitrust statutes drafted in the late century,has successfully stated claims in connection with the administration of the internet domain name system,so essential to the operation of our sophisticated century communications network.the district court ruled that the plaintiff failed.with the benefit of extensive briefing,collegial discussions and amicus participation on appeal from other players in the domain name system,we hold that the plaintiff has stated claims under both sections and of the sherman act.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
plaintiff coalition for icann transparency cfit is an organization composed of participants in the internet domain name system dns,including website owners.the heart of the it industry is located in the silicon valley,which lies within the northern district of california.cfit filed its complaint in in the northern district against defendant verisign,the corporation that acts as the sole operator of the and domain name registries.
verisign operates each registry pursuant to a contract with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann,a oversight body that coordinates the dns on behalf of the united states department of commerce.pursuant to these contracts,verisign receives a certain price for registering each domain name.it is not disputed that there can only be one operator for each domain name registry at any one time.therefore,the only viable competition can take place in connection with obtaining a new contract after expiration of the old one.the.com agreement entered into by icann and verisign in,after no competitive bidding,provides that the price of domain names can increase by seven percent over four of the six succeeding years.the.net agreement,which was entered into as a result of competitive bidding,contained price caps that were set to expire on december,leaving no limitation on the price that could be charged for.net names.each contract has a presumptive renewal provision.
cfit complaint endeavored to state claims against verisign under section of the sherman act and under california counterpart,the cartwright act,for conspiracy in restraint of trade in connection with the terms of the.com and.net contracts pricing and renewal provisions.in essence,cfit sought to show that the prices were artificially high and that the renewal provisions wrongfully restrained competition for successor contracts.
the complaint also endeavored to state claims under section of the sherman act,alleging that verisign conduct in obtaining the provisions constituted monopolization or attempted monopolization of the.com and.net registration markets.in addition,the complaint sought an injunction against verisign proposed service for registration of expiring domain names,on the ground it constituted an attempted monopolization of that allegedly separate market.
the district court,after some discovery and several opportunities for cfit to amend the complaint,dismissed the action with prejudice for failure to state claims under state or federal law in connection with either the.com or the.net contract.it held that cfit had not sufficiently alleged that either the terms of the contracts or verisign conduct in obtaining the contracts amounted to antitrust violations.the court also held that cfit failed sufficiently to allege that a market for expiring domain names existed separate and apart from the market for newly registered domain names.
in this appeal,cfit contends that the district court failed to appreciate the seriousness of the allegations of conduct and that,in rejecting the existence of a separate market for expiring domain names,the district court improperly relied on already outdated authority from earlier in this young century.we now agree with cfit,at least with respect to the claims challenging the terms and award of the.com contract and asserting the existence of a separate market for expiring domain names.we therefore reverse.
ii.the players 
plaintiff cfit is a corporation composed of dns stakeholders,including domain name registrars and owners of domain names registrants.cfit alleges that its members,including both registrars and registrants,have an interest in ensuring that conditions in the domain name registration market remain fair and competitive.
icann is a nonprofit corporation that was created in,in response to a policy directive of the department of commerce,to administer the domain name system on the department behalf.icann is charged by the department of commerce with selecting and entering into agreements with registry operators such as verisign.icann was named as a defendant in cfit original complaint and in its first amended complaint,but cfit dropped icann as a defendant in the second amended complaint,from which this appeal arises.it seeks to maintain claims only against verisign.
defendant verisign is a corporation that,through its contractual relationship with icann,acts as the sole operator of the.com and.net domain name registries.this means that verisign manages the definitive databases of registered.com and.net domain names.verisign has held this position since,prior to which its,network solutions,nsi,managed the databases.
iii.nature and terms of the agreements 
verisign has been the sole operator of the.com and.net registries since,when it entered into two separate agreements with icann the.com agreement and the.net agreement,respectively.those agreements supercede icann previous agreements with nsi.the agreements imposed on verisign a price cap of per year for registration,renewal,or extension of any domain name.each of the agreements contained a renewal provision that allowed icann to place the contract up for competitive bidding upon its expiration.
when the.net agreement expired in,there was a competitive bidding process that resulted in the selection of verisign bid.verisign entered into a new agreement with icann the.net agreement.before the.com agreement was due to expire in,however,verisign and icann agreed to extend it with a new contract the.com agreement.both the.com agreement and the.net agreement provide for automatic renewal upon expiration unless a court or arbitrator issues a final order finding verisign to be in breach of the agreement,and verisign fails to cure the breach.the.com agreement also increases the maximum price verisign can charge for domain name registrations.the previous contract cap was maintained until december,but the new contract provides that cap may be increased seven percent per year in four of the following six years.the.net agreement does not contain an express price increase provision.its price cap of per domain name expired on december,leaving no cap in its place.
iv.cfit claims 
cfit complaint included claims under sections and of the sherman act.cfit sought to state a section claim,for conspiracy in restraint of trade,in connection with the pricing and renewal provisions of both the.net agreement and the.com agreement.cfit claimed that verisign and icann conspired to restrain trade by setting prices for verisign registry services that were substantially above the prices that would result from a competitive market.moreover,cfit alleged that verisign and icann violated section by imposing a presumptive renewal provision in both the.com and.net agreements,all but ensuring verisign continued market dominance by reducing or eliminating competition for successor contracts.
cfit first claim under section was for monopolization and attempted monopolization of the.com and.net markets.cfit alleged that verisign engaged in improper and predatory conduct,including financial pressure,vexatious litigation,and negative press coverage,in order to induce icann to enter into agreements with terms that unlawfully favored verisign.cfit claimed that verisign eventually settled its allegedly vexatious suit against icann by offering to pay icann a dollar fee in exchange for favorable terms in the.com and.net agreements,thus doing away with any competition for the next contract.cfit second claim under section concerned the existence of a separate market for expiring domain names.expiring domain names are names that have fallen back,or are about to fall back into the registry database as a result of by their current owners.cfit alleged that expiring domain names are sufficiently distinct from other types of domain names as to constitute a separate market for antitrust purposes.
cfit further alleged that verisign planned to leverage its monopoly in the.com and.net markets into the market for expiring names.according to cfit complaint,pursuant to a term in the.com agreement permitting verisign to launch new services,verisign planned to launch a central listing service cls to replace the current system for registration of expiring domain names.cfit alleged that verisign proposed cls system will allow it to leverage its existing monopoly in the.com and.net registration markets to achieve a monopoly of the market for expiring domain names.
legal analysis 
cfit claims under section of the sherman act 
section of the sherman act prohibits contract s,combination s in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspirac ies,in restraint of trade or commerce.to state a claim under section,a plaintiff must allege facts that,if true,will prove the existence of a conspiracy,intention on the part of the to restrain trade,and actual injury to competition.kendall visa,cir citing les shockley racing hot rod ass n,cir.
cfit sought to state a section claim in connection with the pricing and renewal provisions of the.com agreement and the.net agreement.cfit alleged that icann and verisign conspired to set artificially high prices for verisign services and to ensure that verisign would receive successor contracts with icann without having to go through a competitive bidding process.we conclude that cfit adequately alleged a section violation with respect to the.com agreement.
cfit challenged the renewal term in both the.com and.net contracts providing that verisign will receive automatic renewal upon expiration of each contract unless a court or arbitrator issues a final order finding verisign to be in breach of the agreement,and verisign fails to cure the breach.cfit alleged the renewal term unlawfully restrains competition because the provision that would trigger a competitive for the contract is illusory,and that at the time they executed the agreement s,both icann and verisign understood that the provision never would be triggered.cfit alleged that the threat of losing each contract in a competitive is essential to protect competition in that it benefits consumers by keeping prices in check,by maintaining solid and reliable performance of the registry,and by preventing the registry from undertaking abusive practices that would financially benefit the registry at the expense of the experience.the district court found that cfit complaint was insufficient to state a challenge to the renewal provision,concluding that cfit allegation regarding the illusory nature of the provision was conclusory and speculative,and insufficient to allege a violation of antitrust law.
we have expressly held,however,that concerted action between to eliminate competitive bidding for a contract is an actionable harm to competition.harkins amusement,cinema,cir.in harkins,the defendants were distributors and exhibitors of films who rigged a bidding process in order to ensure that the exhibitors would obtain licenses to display films released by the distributors,thus excluding from competition the plaintiff,a rival film exhibitor.id.at.we found a section violation for injury to competition even though the only entity harmed,in the particular circumstances of that case,was the plaintiff.id.at.the allegation in this case regarding the elimination of competitive bidding at the expiration of each successive registry agreement means that any other potential registry operator is excluded from competition,making the alleged harm to competition in this case even more severe than that at issue in harkins.
cfit complaint is not limited to alleging that the renewal provision harms individual competitors in the dns.rather,cfit alleged that competition itself has been eliminated as a result of verisign and icann conspiratorial conduct.this is precisely the type of allegation required to state an injury to competition.austin mcnamara,cir to state injury to competition,plaintiff must allege conduct that actually causes injury to competition,beyond the impact on the claimant.cfit has also alleged that consumers are harmed by this restraint,in the form of higher prices for registration of domain names,and potentially services.in combination with the allegations regarding the existence of the conspiracy between verisign and icann as well as the intent to restrain competition,these allegations of harm to competition are sufficient to state a claim under section.kendall,at.
because restraint of trade claims under section do require the showing of a conspiracy whose members intended to restrain trade,see,we conclude that cfit allegations regarding the renewal provision in the contracts is made out only with respect to the.com contract.cfit has adequately pled the existence of a conspiracy between verisign and icann,and that verisign had the intent to restrain trade when it entered into the.com contract.however,the.net contract was reached after a competitive bidding process.cfit has not adequately alleged that conspiratorial conduct to restrain trade was involved in the making of the.net agreement.cfit allegations concerning icann and verisign adoption of the presumptive renewal provision are therefore sufficient to make out a section claim for restraint of trade with respect to the.com agreement alone.
cfit further alleged in its complaint that the increase in the allowable fee under the.com agreement exceeds the rate competitive market conditions would produce.cfit complaint stated that if the.com agreement had been put out for competitive bidding,the costs of domain name registrations would have fallen to at least as low as per domain name,with at least the same level and quality of services provided by verisign.counsel for cfit stated at oral argument before the district court that potential competitors of verisign had stated publicly that,if awarded the.com contract,they could and would offer registry services at or below per domain name.
the district court held that cfit had not stated a cognizable claim regarding the pricing provisions in the.com agreement,finding that an increase in the price of services,standing alone,did not give rise to antitrust liability.the district court relied primarily on alaska airlines,united airlines,cir,in which this court held that a high price alone is not an antitrust violation.we stated in alaska airlines that while setting a high price may be a use of monopoly power,it is not in itself.id.at quoting berkey photo,eastman kodak,cir.
the district court reliance on alaska airlines was misplaced,however,because the pricing claims at issue in that case were monopolization claims arising solely under section of the sherman act.see id.at.in this case,by contrast,cfit allegation is that the pricing provision in verisign and icann.com agreement unlawfully restrains trade,in violation of section.alaska airlines itself distinguishes between the proper inquiries the court should undertake in the section and section contexts while concerted conduct is subject to sanction under section if it merely restrains trade,unilateral conduct is subject to sanction under section only if it either actually monopolizes or threatens monopolization.id.at citing copperweld indep.tube,d.in other words,an entity can not be held liable for antitrust violations if it simply unilaterally increases its prices,absent a showing that it either conspired with another entity in order to restrain trade,or acted in a market in which it holds or is attempting to hold a monopoly.see copperweld,at.congress treated concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior because c oncerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk.
in this case,cfit allegation is not that verisign took unilateral action to increase the price of its services,bu
