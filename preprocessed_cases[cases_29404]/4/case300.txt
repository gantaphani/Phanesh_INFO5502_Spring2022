alpine industries,and william converse,alpine president and chief executive officer,collectively referred to as alpine appeal a judgment against the company in an enforcement action brought by the government for violating a federal trade commission consent order the consent order.the consent order forbade the company,an organization engaged in marketing and distributing devices,from making product claims without the support of competent and reliable scientific evidence.the case was bifurcated into a liability phase,which was tried in front of a jury in the fall of,and a remedy phase,which was tried by the court in january.in november,the jury found that alpine had violated the consent order.in particular,the jury found that alpine had advertised that its air cleaning products removed over separately titled but in many cases overlapping categories of indoor air pollutants controlled ambient ozone levels,and produced various health benefits,without competent and reliable scientific evidence to support these claims.however,the jury also found that alpine product claims regarding the ability of its air cleaning products to remove smoke,tobacco smoke,and cigarette smoke,were supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.the district court final judgment against alpine was entered in april and included,in addition to injunctive relief,an award of in civil penalties.
following the district court final judgment,alpine filed motions to amend the district court judgment,for jnov,or for a new trial.the district court denied these motions.alpine appeals the district court denials of its motions to amend the judgment and for jnov,arguing that the government did not present sufficient evidence to support the jury findings.alpine also appeals the district court denial of its motion for a new trial,arguing that the jury verdict is internally inconsistent and that the special verdict form was worded in such a way as to place the burden of proof improperly on alpine instead of the government.alpine additionally argues that it was entitled to seek judicial reformation of the underlying consent order on the grounds of mutual mistake and that it was prejudiced by the district court exclusion of parol evidence surrounding the consent order.finally,alpine argues that the injunctive relief embodied in the permanent injunction issued by the district court,intended to prevent further representations by alpine regarding the efficacy of its machines without competent and reliable scientific evidence,does not accurately reflect the jury verdict and that furthermore,the penalty imposed by the district court against alpine is excessive.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court judgment.
in the early,the ftc conducted an investigation of claims made by alpine in promoting,advertising,and selling its machines.the investigation concluded when alpine agreed to an ftc consent order,effective october,which reads in relevant part 
for the purposes of this order,the following definitions shall apply 
a.the term air cleaning product shall mean any product,equipment,or appliance designed or advertised to remove,treat,or reduce the level of any pollutant s in the air.

on december,the government initiated an action alleging violations of the consent order,requesting injunctive relief,consumer redress,and civil penalties against alpine.alpine requested a jury trial,which the district court granted with respect to the issue of liability for civil penalties.on november,after a trial,the jury filled out a form containing over questions.the jury found that in all cases but smoke,tobacco smoke,and cigarette smoke,alpine claims were not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.
alpine moved for a directed verdict at the conclusion of the government case in chief and again at the close of evidence,and later moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.we review the district court denial of alpine motions for judgment as a matter of law motions for a directed verdict and renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict de novo.moore kuka welding robot,cir citing k t enters.zurich ins,cir and wehr ryan family steak houses,cir.in doing so,we use the same standard of review used by the district court.phelps yale,cir.in order to prevail,alpine must demonstrate that no reasonable juror could have found for the nonmoving party.moore,at.in applying this standard,we can not weigh the credibility of witnesses and can not substitute our judgment for that of the jury.k t,at.instead,we are to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the government and give the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences.ibid.
alpine contends that the burden was on the government to establish a prima facie case and that the government did not meet this initial burden,so that alpine is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,notwithstanding the jury verdict.the government conceded in a pretrial hearing that it had the burden of proving at trial that alpine had made claims or representations that fell within the terms of the consent order,and that alpine did not possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence at the time such claims or representations were made.alpine takes issue with the second requirement in this appeal.alpine contends that the government did not present sufficient proof that alpine did not possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence at the time it made representations regarding all of the indoor air pollutants listed on the jury form with the exception of smoke,cigarette smoke,and tobacco smoke,and regarding the health benefits bestowed on users by the product.alpine does not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the government regarding the product ability to maintain indoor ozone concentrations at a particular level.
alpine,however,misconstrues the level of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case under these circumstances.during the hearing that led to the order establishing the shifting burden of proof in this case,some explanation was offered as to how the government would fulfill this requirement,recognizing that the government was being asked to prove a negative.the government lawyer stated that she understood the government burden as being met if expert testimony were offered for the proposition that such experts were unaware of scientific data supporting alpine claims or,if testimony has been offered in support of alpine,which explained that the information produced by alpine pursuant to the consent order in support of their claims was insufficient or incompetent.the court stated that it was inclined to agree with the government lawyer assessment and that upon receipt of such testimony,alpine would be expected to rebut the government proffer and the jury would determine whether or not alpine had done so effectively.given that the consent order puts the onus on alpine to make available on request all information relied upon by alpine in making representations regarding the efficacy of its devices,we agree that the government burden for making a prima facie case is satisfied if evidence was offered at trial that the information provided pursuant to the consent order was either insufficient or incompetent.the government certainly need not have proven that there was no competent or reliable basis upon which alpine might have rested its claim.if the experts knew of none and information received from alpine was insufficient to provide such a basis or was deemed unreliable,it was up to alpine to provide further information that would convince the jury.
during the long trial,the government produced experts in the fields of air pollution,ozone chemistry,and the efficacy of air cleaners,all of whom testified that they were unaware of any competent and reliable evidence to support various claims made by alpine.these experts also discussed tests they had participated in,which further discredited alpine claims.moreover,the ftc officer assigned to alpine case testified that the evidence submitted by alpine to the ftc in support of its claims regarding the efficacy of its machines was evaluated by experts and deemed to be insufficient.in response,alpine provided its own experts,who described in their testimony the various tests they had done on the machines,and the evidence they had relied on in support of the claims made by alpine.
in particular,alpine points out that the government experts focused on tests done on particles in tobacco smoke and states that there was no evidence presented regarding any of the other particulates such as dust,animal dander,insect parts,and so on.on this basis,alpine contends that a verdict must be directed in its favor with regard to all particulates and some microbe and allergen claims.however,the government experts explained in their testimony that the results of these tests can be applied to other particulates,such as those at issue in this case,since they are in the same size range as those found in tobacco smoke as it turns out,alpine does not dispute this fact,but instead argues that because the results garnered from the tests on tobacco smoke can be extrapolated to all other particulates within the same size range,including microbes,and because the jury found that alpine claims regarding the efficacy of its devices with respect to tobacco smoke were supported by reliable and competent scientific evidence,it is not possible for the evidence to support the jury findings against alpine on the other particulates and microbes in that size range.although we will address this argument,it is not properly raised here,as it goes not to the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the government in their prima facie case,but rather to the consistency of the jury verdict.
next,alpine argues that the government did not address alpine claims that its devices introduce ozone into the air,which kills microbes through ionization.however,government expert eugene cole testified to the fact that tests published by the american industrial hygiene association demonstrated that exposure of a large variety of organisms,including microbes and fungi,to concentrations of ozone at the same or at higher concentrations than those claimed to be maintained by the alpine products,had an impact on some organisms but were not ultimately effective at removing any of them according to industry standards furthermore,cole testified that in his expert opinion he was unaware of reliable scientific evidence to support the claims made by alpine with respect to the impact of ozone on microbes and fungi.this testimony is sufficient evidence to support the jury findings of liability.
alpine further contends that because none of the government experts were medical doctors,toxicologists,or health officials,they were not qualified to opine on whether its machines provide medical and benefits and their testimony can not,therefore,be considered sufficient evidence to support the jury finding of liability on this question.this argument is unpersuasive.alpine experts and the government experts did not disagree on which indoor pollutants cause health problems,the issue in dispute between them was whether alpine products were capable of removing the pollutants that cause health problems.thus,the expertise needed under these circumstances was not that of a medical doctor,toxicologist,or health official,but rather an expert on the removal of indoor air pollutants.the jury simply determined that the government experts were more credible on this point and we are compelled to defer to the jury judgment.k t,at.
finally,alpine contends that the government offered no proof that alpine did not rely on competent and reliable evidence for its claims with respect to its product ability to remove certain chemical gases from indoor air specifically styrene,isoprene,and.and moreover,that weschler testimony for the government supported alpine claims that hydrogen sulfide,volatile organic chemicals,odiferous chemicals,acrolein,body odor,indole,scatole,garlic odor,and thyocyanite could be reduced through the use of ozone.
weschler did in fact testify to the fact that even a relatively small concentration of ozone tends to break down styrene,hydrogen sulfide,and,which suggests that alpine might prevail with respect to these compounds at least.yet,if one views the evidence in a light most favorable to the government and gives the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences as we must,one finds that there was other evidence presented through weschler testimony and cole expert report on ozone that can explain the jury findings on these chemical pollutants.it is alpine contention that all of these pollutants are broken down and thus removed from the environment by alpine devices through their reaction with ozone.however,there are two problems with this theory.first,this process requires a certain concentration of ozone,and the evidence presented in cole report and through other expert testimony is that alpine has not provided reliable test results that demonstrate the ability of its machines to maintain that level of ozone concentration.in fact,alpine does not contest on appeal the jury separate finding that alpine claim that t he sensor in its air cleaning products maintains indoor ozone concentrations at parts per million or less is not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.it is not unreasonable to assume that if the machine ability to maintain a concentration of ozone is unsubstantiated,then its ability to remove certain pollutants by way of a reaction with ozone is also unsubstantiated.
second,we return to weschler testimony.although weschler did say that concentrations of ozone will generally react with compounds containing double bonds,such as the ones mentioned above,he particularly noted that it an important thing to remember when we speak about ozone reacting with compounds in the air because often you might initially have one pollutant,and you result sic in two pollutants.in other words,rather than cleaning the air,as suggested in alpine literature,the ozone introduced by alpine devices may change a given molecule into two new compounds,which may be more concerning than what existed previously.as an example of this phenomenon,weschler described an experiment he had conducted in which ozone had in fact lowered the amount of styrene,and in a controlled environment,but had nevertheless increased the level of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the air.given this information,it is not unreasonable for a juror to determine that a claim by alpine that a user environment will be cleaned of a pollutant by its product is unsupported by competent and reliable scientific evidence,when in fact the pollutant may be broken down into other,even more noxious,pollutants.thus,viewed in a light most favorable to the government,there was sufficient evidence presented at trial with respect to the jury findings.
motion for a new trial 
a district court decision to deny a new trial on the basis of the weight of the evidence shall be reversed only upon finding an abuse of discretion.see bruner dunaway,cir.alpine contends that the jury verdict was inconsistent and irreconcilable,that the district court allowed for an improper shifting of the burden of proof in the jury special verdict form and through a comment made to the jury,and that the district court improperly excluded evidence relating to the negotiation history of the consent order,consumer satisfaction surveys,and marketing information that alpine believed would have allowed the jury to perceive alpine marketing promotions in context.
inconsistent verdict 
as we noted in section ii,the government experts in addressing the viability of alpine claims regarding particulates focused on testing the ability of various devices in removing particles found in tobacco smoke,which the experts testified to be representative of the particles at issue in this case and therefore a good surrogate for testing the efficacy of a device in removing these other particles.alpine accepts this premise,but argues on appeal that if the government experts are right,the jury verdict must be considered inconsistent and irreconcilable,since the jury found alpine claims regarding the ability of its devices to remove smoke was supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence,but that none of its other claims made with respect to other particulates were supported by such evidence.in sum,alpine argues that if the results of smoke testing could be extrapolated to all other indoor air particulate at issue,then it would appear that the jury,because it found for alpine on smoke,had no basis for a finding against alpine on all the other particulates listed on the jury verdict form.this logic would also extend to the question of microbes and allergens in particulate form and within the relevant size range.
in gallick baltimore and,d,the supreme court stated in relevant part 
i t is the duty of the courts to attempt to harmonize the answers,if it is possible under a fair reading of them we therefore must attempt to reconcile the jury findings,by exegesis if necessary,before we are free to disregard the jury special verdict and remand the case for a new trial.
the sixth circuit has also held that w hen requested,a trial court faced with an apparent inconsistency between a jury answers and the court instructions must attempt to reconcile the two.holloway mcintyre,wl,at cir,citing waggoner mosti,cir.
the district court reconciled the apparent inconsistency in the jury verdict by determining that the jury had in fact been referring to visible smoke rather than the particulates in smoke,and we are persuaded that this is a reasonable conclusion.alpine reasoning assumes that the jury favorable determination on the smoke removal claims reflected an implicit determination that alpine air purifiers effectively removed the particulate elements of smoke,when in fact smoke contains much more than particulate matter.in fact,weschler noted in his testimony at trial that in addition to the particulates present in tobacco smoke,there are thousands of chemicals.
furthermore,the jury was presented at trial with evidence concerning the removal of visible smoke.alpine had a videotape demonstration,which showed its machines removing visible smoke from a small transparent chamber.the jury also heard from the government expert,sextro,who stated in doing his tests on particulates in smoke w e did test the effectiveness of the filter against smoke gases.we did look at i mean,i do know if there was any absorption by the hepa filter of any of the environmental smoke gases or not that was the purpose of our study.based on this information,the jury could have concluded that alpine had adequate substantiation to claim that its devices removed visible smoke,which would be entirely consistent with the rest of the jury determinations with regard to particulate claims.
burden of proof 
alpine contends that the district court improperly shifted the burden of proof during the course of the trial.alpine maintains that the jury special verdict form is improperly worded,with the second part of each question reflecting a burden on alpine to provide scientific evidence of the various contaminants that it could remove.that part of the question states was the claim made by alpine with regard to a particular contaminant supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence at the time the claim was made alpine had requested instead that a different text be used has plaintiff proved that the defendants did not possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence for claims that their air purifiers eliminate,remove,clear or clean a particular contaminant yes no 
alpine also points to a statement made by the magistrate judge near the end of trial in which he addressed the jury and stated in relevant part 
y ou recall that your area of inquiry will be if alpine and converse made certain representations as described in the consent order,and you will be given a copy of the consent order that will be the first thing for you to decide,did alpine after the date of that consent order make representations as,as described in the consent order,question.question,if they did,with regard to any particular representation,did alpine and or converse,as the case may be,have in their possession at that time and rely upon at that time on competent and reliable scientific evidence.let that be burned into the back of your mind because that is the area of inquiry that what you will be called upon ultimately to decide.
alpine argues that the verdict form was ultimately prejudicial and that as a result,alpine did not receive a fair trial.
the district court responded to alpine claims,noting that 
the jury was instructed,on more than one occasion,that the government had the burden of proving that the defendants made a particular representation,which was not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.the wording on the verdict form could not reasonably be read as contradicting the court explicit instructions regarding the burden of proof.
a special verdict form will only provide grounds for reversal if it is confusing,misleading,or prejudicial when viewed as a whole.see hostetler consolidated rail,cir.in this case,the form should be viewed along with the jury instructions,which clearly stated where the burden of proof lay 
the verdict form asks you a set of two questions as to each alleged claim first,has the government proven by a preponderance of the evidence that alpine and converse,individually and as an officer of alpine,made a claim covered by the terms of the consent order and,second,if yes,did the government prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants at the time such claim was made did not possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate it,that claim or representation 
these jury instructions reflect the proper placement of the burden of proof,which starts with the government and moves to alpine,once the government offers enough evidence to make its prima facie case.
parol evidence 
alpine objects to the district court use of the parol evidence rule to exclude evidence of the negotiations with the ftc that led to the execution of the consent order,which ultimately prevented alpine from explaining that it
