spectators communication network and its owner,frank mitchell appeal from the summary judgment entered in favor of,the only remaining defendant in their antitrust suit alleging that spectators was excluded from broadcasting professional golf tournaments.spectators contends that the pga and the other defendants organized a group boycott of spectators in order to put it out of business.we conclude that spectators made an adequate showing of an antitrust conspiracy that makes economic sense.although spectators has not shown a horizontal boycott that would constitute a per se violation of the sherman act,it should be allowed the chance to prove its case under the rule of reason.we therefore reverse the entry of summary judgment for on spectators antitrust claim.however,we affirm the district court entry of judgment for on spectators state law claims.
spectators pioneered the use of radio broadcasting at professional golf tournaments.because golf fans at a tournament can only see a small part of the action going on at any time,spectators began to report events taking place at other locations at the tournament.broadcasts were available only on the golf course and were transmitted through special radios.spectators made money by selling advertising rights for commercials and for logos which were placed on the special radios.
the world of professional golf,in which spectators operates,consists of several tiers of interests that figure in this case.at the top is the professional golf association,or pga,which controls the golfers through contracts that restrict the golfers from playing in events if they wish to remain on the pga tour.
the second tier of interests is composed of the sponsors,which in turn consist of two classes tournament sponsors,who organize and conduct the tournament as with the pga,typically to raise money for local charities and corporate sponsors,who support the tour tournaments financially in exchange for publicity.the sponsors were associated in an organization called american golf sponsors,which included nec,and,all of whom were corporate sponsors of tournaments.through a standard sponsor agreement,the pga required the tournament sponsors to transfer all media rights,including television and radio broadcast rights,to the pga and to give the pga veto power over any radio broadcasting equipment that would be placed on the golf course.
the third tier of interests consists of spectators and its competitors in the broadcasting business.eventually,the pga took over the broadcasting niche itself,arranging to have the tour events broadcast by vanguard international,llc,broadcasting as the pga tour radio network.
spectators contends that the relevant market is the market for advertising at golf tournaments.according to spectators,this market is not interchangeable with other kinds of sports advertising because of the unusually desirable demographic characteristics of the people who attend golf tournaments,in that the spectators are affluent,highly educated,and busy.
from to,spectators dealt directly with the pga,which reserved the right to exercise extensive controls and to charge spectators a fee for the privilege of broadcasting.their relationship ended in,and spectators sued the pga.in the summer of,the pga gave spectators permission to enter broadcasting deals with the sponsors of individual tournaments.that fall spectators and entered a contract for spectators to broadcast sporting events as the budweiser spectators network,which involved advertising products and putting logos on the spectators radios at one golf tournament,a car race,and a tennis match.in november,confirmed by letter that it had agreed with spectators to sponsor the broadcast of seven unspecified events in,with a formal contract to be drafted later.in april,and spectators entered a contract for advertising in connection with broadcasts at three golf tournaments the greater greensboro open,the classic,and the nec world championship.spectators completed the first two broadcasts,but was unable to do the third because the sponsor,nec,refused to permit spectators to broadcast from the golf course.frank mitchell,the owner of spectators,testified in an affidavit that he learned from barbara burdick,an employee of nec,that nec had succumbed to the pga requests not to allow spectators to broadcast the nec tournament.similarly,mitchell testified that in the fall of,a representative of the greater greensboro open told him that the pga would not allow the greensboro tournament or other tournaments to let spectators broadcast at their tournaments.
beginning in july,mitchell tape recorded several conversations with david brunette in which brunette said that was under pressure from the pga not to use spectators 
you know,so i do know,i mean they the pga tour do want to give you,they do mind if we do them broadcasts,but they do want us using you 
the gist of these conversations was that the pga,and in particular,gary stevenson of the pga,was hostile to spectators because of spectators lawsuit against the pga and that the pga would try to prevent from working with spectators.for instance,brunette reported 
i t just that obviously,the pga just concerned about the fact that you know we trying to deal with you and at the same time you suing them.it something that they have to grant us.we want to have the rights to do this and if they not willing to grant us those rights,uh,you know,you got somewhat of a battle if you start trying to do these things i mean,they just pretty adamant about the fact that they do,they not very happy with what going on and they do cherish the fact that we be working with you,but that still does have anything to do with the fact that the funding is tight.
spectators contends that the pga also made concessions in other aspects of its regulation of tournaments to persuade not to deal with spectators.spectators contends that the pga previously had in place a no alcohol policy though the extent of such a policy is unclear,at the least the pga commissioner limited the advertising of alcoholic products in connection with the tour.on september,representatives met with the pga gary stevenson and leo mccullagh.they reached an agreement on an extensive program called the michelob hole program,which involved becoming a sponsor of the tour championship,advertising during golf events on television,using the pga logo in product promotions,and maintaining a hole pavilion,a mobile exhibit that included substantial advertising at the tournament site.shortly after this meeting,wrote spectators,cancelling the april contract.
eventually,michelob beer became the official beer of the pga tour.
spectators brought this suit against colonial country club,nec,american golf sponsors,and the pga tour and its employee,stevenson.the complaint alleged state commercial law and federal antitrust claims,in particular,that the defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to restrain trade in the market for professional golf tournament advertising services.
eventually,all the defendants except were dismissed,either by the court or pursuant to agreements with the plaintiffs.moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.the court held that spectators failed to perform its obligation under the contract to broadcast the nec tournament and therefore could not bring an action to enforce the contract.the court held that the plaintiffs claim for civil conspiracy under texas law failed for lack of evidence of conspiracy or any unlawful overt acts pursuant to the alleged conspiracy.as for the antitrust conspiracy,the court rejected spectators group boycott theory.the court held that the evidence did not show had entered a combination with the intent to restrain competition in the market for advertising,and,in fact,such a claim would be nonsensical,since would not rationally act to cause injury to purchasers of advertising,a class which includes itself.the court concluded that no anticompetitive combination was shown by evidence that pga conditioned the hole package on discontinuation of business with spectators at best,plaintiffs raise a fact issue regarding whether decided not to engage in further business relations with spectators because it desired to engage in more lucrative business relations with others,and was concerned that its chances of securing the latter might be hampered by the former.emphasis added.the court held that spectators evidence showed nothing more than competitive behavior by the defendants,and therefore spectators was injured by too much competition,not too little.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.see stewart glass mirror,auto glass discount centers,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to entry of judgment as a matter of law.see id.the party opposing the summary judgment motion must do more than show there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
under section of the sherman act,the substantive law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence.see matsushita,at.in particular,courts will not draw inferences to support a claim that makes no economic sense such a claim will require unusually persuasive evidence to withstand summary judgment.see id.at.rational economic actors do not ordinarily conspire to injure themselves.
spectators claims that the pga combined with and other tournament sponsors to freeze spectators out of the advertising market so that the pga could appropriate spectators business for itself.according to spectators,the pga accomplished this both by coercion and by enticement.the pga could coerce the sponsors by invoking rights in its sponsorship contracts giving the pga the power to control broadcasts of pga tour tournaments.the enticement took the form of changing the existing pga policies about advertising so that could purchase advertising opportunities,such as the hole program,directly from the pga.according to spectators,this concession was conditioned upon not using spectators for broadcasts.
a claim under section of the sherman act requires proof of three elements that the defendant engaged in a conspiracy that restrained trade in a particular market.see stewart glass,at.to prove conspiracy or concerted action,the plaintiff must prove that the conspirators had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.monsanto serv,d.
the district court held,and argues,that there was not sufficient evidence of a combination or conspiracy,because it would have been irrational for to conspire to restrain competition in a market in which it was a purchaser 
as a consumer of advertising at professional golf tournaments,has no economic incentive to reduce competition in the market because doing so would bring about its own economic harm.a theory of liability attributing irrationality to consumers does not get very far.indeed,where an antitrust claim simply makes no economic sense,more persuasive evidence is required than would otherwise be necessary.plaintiffs fail to provide such evidence.

by reasoning that a consumer would never wish to bring about a restraint of trade in the market where it buys,the district court has ignored salient facts of this case spectators contends that was both coerced and enticed to comply with the pga wishes.though in the abstract would have nothing to gain from freezing a competitor out of the broadcasting market,in the actual case at hand,spectators alleges that the pga made it worth while to cooperate,by opening up the new opportunity to advertise through the hole exhibit and the designation of michelob as the official beer of the pga tournament on the condition that not do business with spectators.additionally,spectators alleges that the pga coerced to boycott spectators by exercising its contractual power to control radio broadcasts of tour events.
antitrust law has never required identical motives among conspirators,and even reluctant participants have been held liable for conspiracy.in united states paramount pictures,the supreme court refused to distinguish between conspirators who fomented the conspiracy and those who only participated because they were coerced 
there is some suggestion that large exhibitors with whom defendants dealt fathered the illegal practices and forced them onto the defendants.but as the district court observed,that circumstance if true does not help the defendants.for acquiescence in an illegal scheme is as much a violation of the sherman act as the creation and promotion of one.
the supreme court describes group boycotts as joint efforts by a firm or firms to disadvantage competitors by either directly denying or persuading or coercing suppliers or customers to deny relationships the competitors need in the competitive struggle.northwest wholesale stationers,pacific stationery and printing,d internal quotation omitted emphasis added.this description implicitly recognizes that an integral part of a boycott is often bringing pressure to bear persuading or coercing on other participants who have no direct motive to restrain trade.conspirators who are not competitors of the victim may have no interest in curtailing competition in a market in which they do not compete nevertheless,when they have been enticed or coerced to share in an anticompetitive scheme,there is still a combination within the meaning of the sherman act.
the third circuit rejected the idea that parties to a conspiracy must share an identical motive in fineman armstrong world industries,cir.the court held that where an otherwise disinterested party had some interest in the ringleader economic success,the conspiracy could make economic sense.in fineman,a flooring manufacturer,which wished to develop its own video program,convinced a wholesaler not to deal with a company that developed a video magazine to be used as a sales aid in the flooring business.the video magazine company sued the manufacturer on a vertical boycott theory.the manufacturer argued that there was no illegal combination because the wholesaler did not compete with the video magazine company and therefore had no interest in eliminating it as a competitor of the manufacturer.the district court granted the manufacturer a directed verdict on this theory.the third circuit reversed,saying 
we conclude that the district court novel approach is misplaced as it renders section claims unavailable to private litigants suffering antitrust injury as a result of concerted action in a vertical matrix.such a restrictive rule fails to recognize the difference between motive and objective and would dramatically alter the antitrust landscape in a manner unjustified by either precedent or policy considerations a rational factfinder could infer agreement with the objective from knowledge of the objective and action calculated to achieve the objective despite differing motives.
id.at.although the wholesaler did not act from the same motive as the manufacturer,that did not mean that it had no motive to conspire.rather,its motive derived from its relationship with the manufacturer because the wholesaler relied upon sales of the manufacturer products for percent of its gross revenues,however,it would naturally perceive that that which is in the manufacturer interest also inures to the wholesaler own benefit.id.at.accord full draw productions easton sports,cir boycott by customers against supplier could make economic sense because customers controlled competing supplier.
another way a ringleader can persuade a vertically aligned actor to boycott the ringleader competitor is by coercion.in mcm partners,associates,cir,two exhibition contractors refused to rent equipment from mcm because of threats of labor disruption by a union official in cahoots with the monopolist,id.at,a competitor of mcm.the effect of the exhibitors acquiescence to the coercion was to raise the price they had to pay for the equipment,obviously not a result they would have chosen in the absence of the threat.see id.at.mcm sued the exhibitors for participating in a vertical boycott.the exhibitors argued in their defense that they had only participated because of coercion.the seventh circuit rejected the coercion defense,conc
