plaintiff travel agencies appeal the district court dismissal of their amended complaint for failure to state a claim under of the sherman antitrust act.plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to reduce,cap,and eventually eliminate the payment of base commissions in a concerted effort to drive plaintiffs out of business in violation of.we affirm.in doing so,we hold that plaintiffs claims against united airlines were discharged in bankruptcy and that plaintiffs claims against the remaining defendants failed to allege sufficient facts to plausibly suggest a prior illegal agreement.
plaintiffs are the owners of travel agencies engaged in the business of selling defendants airline services when a plaintiff sold an airline ticket before,it received a sales commission from the servicing airline that equaled a percentage of the purchased ticket price.this practice,commonly referred to as the payment of base commissions,was.
plaintiffs allege a conspiracy based on a series of uniform base commission cuts adopted by defendants over a period.according to plaintiffs,each defendant decision to match its competitors base commission cut was the product of defendants prior illegal agreement to eliminate the practice of paying all base result achieved in march.
plaintiffs assert the conspiracy began in,when delta,american,northwest,united,and continental each announced a cap on base commissions for domestic tickets and a cap for domestic tickets.plaintiffs further contend that united decision to cut its base commission rate on september,from of the purchased ticket price to is further evidence of the alleged illegal agreement because american,delta,northwest,airways,continental,and america west each matched united commission cut on or before september.on march,frontier airlines announced that it,too,would reduce its base commission rate from to,as did alaska airlines on september.
plaintiffs allege that defendants conspiracy continued into,when united imposed base commission caps of and for and international airfare,respectively.by december,american,delta,continental,northwest,and airways each adopted united and base commission caps.
almost one year later,on october,united instituted its third commission cut,reducing its base commission rate from to on all domestic and international flights.american,delta,northwest,continental,and airways each adopted united commission cut by the following week.america west and alaska each matched united commission cut on october,as did frontier in november.
on august,american implemented base commission caps of for tickets and for tickets,effective the following day.within ten days,united,delta,northwest,continental,airways,and america west each adopted american and caps.frontier and alaska followed suit on september,and november,respectively.
finally,on march,delta announced that it would eliminate its practice of paying base commissions to travel agencies for both domestic and international airfare,effective immediately.within ten days,american,united,northwest,continental,airways,and america west likewise eliminated the payment of base commissions.frontier and alaska followed suit in late may.
plaintiffs allege that each defendant decision to cut,cap,and eventually eliminate its practice of paying travel agencies a base commission would not have occurred without collusion because such action,if taken independently,was contrary to the individual defendant economic.plaintiffs point to united unsuccessful attempt to cut base commission rates in and american similar failed attempt in as evidence of collusion in the present case.in addition,plaintiffs amended complaint refers to the deposition of a former american airlines executive,michael gunn,who testified that industry consensus was necessary for commission cuts to hold.gunn also testified that he had to match commission cuts exactly or he would undercut the movement.plaintiffs assert that gunn statements are persuasive evidence of defendants common motive to conspire.
as additional support for the alleged conspiracy,plaintiffs point to several meetings where defendants had an opportunity to conspire,including committee meetings of the international air transport association in and,as well as industry meetings such as the conquistadores del cielo conquerors of the sky,the air transport association,the japan air summit,the british air summit,the paris air show,the alex brown transportation conference,the international aviation symposium,and the merrill lynch conference.plaintiffs do not identify defendants attendees by name or title.
more specifically,the amended complaint asserts that in an executive of marketing distribution for northwest airlines,a senior vice president of planning for airways,and a senior vice president of marketing for american met for three hours in a dallas hotel conference room.plaintiffs further allege that i n,a delta senior executive met for a weekend of golf and socializing at the home of an american executive responsible for setting american commission levels.
by may,each defendant had eliminated its practice of paying travel agencies a base commission.in addition,several defendants filed for and have emerged from chapter bankruptcy,including delta,northwest,and united 
on april,plaintiff tam travel,and other travel agencies filed a complaint against defendants for illegally agreeing to cap,cut,and eliminate base commissions in violation of of the sherman antitrust act.on september,plaintiffs had dismissed defendants airways and airways group from the suit without prejudice.on september,the district court determined that the supreme court decision in bell atlantic twombly,d,could impact the present case and allowed plaintiffs to file an amended complaint.on september,several defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the amended complaint under.b.
on october,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,ruling that plaintiffs failed to allege any conduct other than sporadic parallel conduct regarding america west,alaska,frontier,and horizon plaintiffs failed to allege any parallel conduct as to klm the emergence of northwest,united,and delta from bankruptcy discharged plaintiffs claims with regard to continental and united,plaintiffs failed to aver sufficient facts to plausibly suggest an illegal agreement under twombly and with regard to aag,a holding company that does not itself pay commissions,plaintiffs failed to allege any facts.
plaintiffs filed a timely motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied on march.this appeal followed 
plaintiffs first contend that the district court erred when it ruled that their claims against united were discharged by the bankruptcy court.by operation of the bankruptcy code,confirmation of a reorganization plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of confirmation.d.section of the bankruptcy code defines a debt as liability on a claim.pursuant to,a claim includes a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,or unmatured.
the district court ruled that because united filed for bankruptcy in december and its reorganization plan was not confirmed until january,united emergence from bankruptcy discharged any liability on claims that arose before its reorganization.because plaintiffs alleged that united made its last commission cut in march,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims against united as discharged debt under.
as a preliminary matter,plaintiffs brief does not challenge the district court decision to dismiss united under,other than to mention in a single sentence that e ach of these airlines emerged from bankruptcy before travel agents filed their complaint.moreover,the record and the amended complaint refute this assertion.because plaintiffs present only a perfunctory argument regarding united dismissal under,plaintiffs have waived this argument.see united states phinazee,cir issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.in any event,we find no error in the district court ruling that united potential liability qualified as discharged debt under.
plaintiffs assert that united is nonetheless liable under a continuing violation theory because united allegedly rejoined the conspiracy after emerging from bankruptcy in.specifically,plaintiffs contend that united decision to continue the conspiracy commission rate which,at this point,was after its reorganization created a new claim under the sherman act.
as a general rule,a successfully reorganized debtor under chapter of the bankruptcy code is liable for any independent conduct that arises after the confirmation of its bankruptcy plan.in re worldcom,cir county of orange,cir.in short,the debtor gets a fresh start,but that does not provide a continuing license to violate the law.id.in the present case,the district court concluded that united commission policy did not create a new claim because its decision was merely a reaffirmation of a previous act.
plaintiffs rely on klehr smith,d,to argue that united conduct qualifies as a continuing violation.the klehr case,however,did not involve a formerly bankrupt corporation.id.at.klehr simply reiterates that the antitrust laws recognize continuing violations and,more precisely,that a new claim arises each time a company sells a product.id.at.
we have held that an antitrust cause of action accrues each time a defendant commits an act that injures the plaintiff business.dxs,siemens med,cir citing zenith radio hazeltine research,d.t he focus is on the timing of the causes of injury,the defendant overt acts,as opposed to the effects of the overt acts.peck motors,cir per curiam emphasis added.t he fact that injuries have a rippling effect into the future only establishes that plaintiffs might have been entitled to future damages id.
here,we reject plaintiffs attempt to characterize united decision to maintain its commission policy as an overt act.since the supreme court decided zenith,federal courts have uniformly defined a continuing antitrust violation as one in which the plaintiff interests are repeatedly invaded.peck,at quoting pace,three phoenix,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.although united participation in the alleged conspiracy would certainly create a rippling effect,plaintiffs assert that united final act to effectuate that conspiracy occurred in,long before united emerged from bankruptcy.we also can not ignore the consequence of concluding that an overt act occurred under these facts.if we were to adopt plaintiffs continuing violation theory,the applicable limitations period for a claim would be antitrust plaintiff could routinely salvage an otherwise untimely claim by asserting that it continues to lose revenue because of past alleged anticompetitive conduct.we therefore hold that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs claims against united.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of plaintiffs amended complaint under.b.johnson city of detroit,cir.in twombly,the supreme court held that a complaint alleging violations under of the sherman act can not survive a motion to dismiss unless it avers facts that raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of an illegal agreement.twombly,at.in the wake of twombly,allegations of parallel conduct and bare assertions of conspiracy no longer supply an adequate foundation to support a plausible claim.id.
specifically,the complaint f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,id.at,and state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at.of course,we must still construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept its allegations as true,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.jones city of cincinnati,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.yet,to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.eidson state of.dep t of children,cir.we need not accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences,jones,at alteration and internal citation omitted,and c onclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual allegations will not suffice.eidson,at internal citation omitted.
allegations of concerted action by competitors are frequently based on a pattern of uniform business conduct,which courts often refer to as conscious parallelism.conscious parallelism,however,is not in itself prohibited under of the sherman act.as the supreme court explained in twombly 
because of the sherman act does not prohibit all unreasonable restraints of trade but only restraints effected by a contract,combination,or conspiracy,copperweld independence tube,d,t he crucial question is whether the challenged anticompetitive conduct stem s from independent decision or from an agreement,tacit or express,theatre enters.paramount film distrib.while a showing of parallel business behavior is admissible circumstantial evidence from which the fact finder may infer agreement,it falls short of conclusively establish ing agreement or itself constitut ing a sherman act offense.id.at.even conscious parallelism,a common reaction of firms in a concentrated market that recogniz e their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions is not itself unlawful.brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d.
the inadequacy of showing parallel conduct or interdependence,without more,mirrors the ambiguity of the behavior consistent with conspiracy,but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.accordingly,we have previously hedged against false inferences from identical behavior at a number of points in the trial sequence.an plaintiff with evidence showing nothing beyond parallel conduct is not entitled to a directed verdict,see theatre,supra proof of a conspiracy must include evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action,see monsanto serv,d and at the summary judgment stage a plaintiff offer of conspiracy evidence must tend to rule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently,see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
twombly,at.some internal citations omitted.
the twombly decision provides an additional safeguard against the risk of false inferences from identical behavior at an earlier stage of the trial pleading stage.a district court early assessment of the sufficiency of a claim under.b or.c addresses the dilemma of the extensive litigation costs associated with prosecuting and defending antitrust lawsuits.as the twombly court acknowledged,the costs of modern federal antitrust litigation and the increasing caseload of the federal courts counsel against sending the parties into discovery when there is no reasonable likelihood that the plaintiffs can construct a claim from the events related in the complaint.id.at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
in ashcroft iqbal,d,the supreme court explained the twombly decision as follows 
in twombly,we considered the sufficiency of a complaint alleging that incumbent telecommunications providers had entered an agreement not to compete and to forestall competitive entry,in violation of the sherman act.recognizing that enjoins only anticompetitive conduct effected by a contract,combination,or conspiracy,copperweld independence tube,d,the plaintiffs in twombly flatly pleaded that the defendants ha d entered into a contract,combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry and ha d agreed not to compete with one another.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the complaint also alleged that the defendants parallel course of conduct to prevent competition and inflate prices was indicative of the unlawful agreement alleged.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
the court held the plaintiffs complaint deficient under rule.in doing so,it first noted that the plaintiffs assertion of an unlawful agreement was a legal conclusion and,as such,was not entitled to the assumption of truth,at.had the court simply credited the allegation of a conspiracy,the plaintiffs would have stated a claim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce.the court next addressed the nub of the plaintiffs,nonconclusory factual allegation of parallel determine whether it gave rise to a plausible suggestion of conspiracy,at.acknowledging that parallel conduct was consistent with an unlawful agreement,the court nevertheless concluded that it did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it was not only compatible with,but indeed was more likely explained by,lawful,unchoreographed behavior.id.at.because the fact of parallel conduct,accepted as true,did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement,the court held the plaintiffs complaint must be dismissed,at.
id.emphasis added.
plaintiffs first argue that twombly is distinguishable because their amended complaint makes independent allegations of actual agreement.plaintiffs contend that,and independently allege an illegal agreement.in,plaintiffs use the word agreement,asserting that the conduct of defendants described hereinabove,and the agreement between and among defendants to reduce,cap and eliminate commissions paid to plaintiffs violates the sherman act.emphasis added.this averment is nothing more than a legal conclusion masquerading as a factual allegation.see eidson,at.the supreme court rejected a similar argument in twombly,holding that a few stray statements speak ing directly of agreement are merely legal conclusions resting on prior allegations.twombly,at.
paragraphs and of the amended complaint assert that defendants executives,who were responsible for setting commission levels met frequently during the period of cuts and caps,which afforded these persons the opportunity to conspire and communicate with one another for the purpose of implementing their common plan these allegations,however,aver only an opportunity to conspire,which does not necessarily support an inference of illegal agreement.in fact,and are located in a section of the amended complaint entitled opportunities for defendants to combine and conspire.we conclude that plaintiffs attempt to distinguish twombly on the basis that plaintiffs allege actual agreement fails.
next,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred when it dismissed their claim against alaska,aag,horizon,and america west because the amended complaint contained more than bare assertions of conspiracy and parallel conduct.we disagree.
in each of the four references to alaska in the amended complaint,plaintiffs allege only that alaska adopted uniform commission cuts in,and.the amended complaint does not contain any factual allegations to support alaska involvement in the conspiracy,beyond its parallel behavior.america west is also referred to four times but,like alaska,plaintiffs allege parallel conduct alone and fail to aver facts sufficient to implicate america west in any conspiracy.
aag and horizon are also named defendants and parties to this appeal,but neither is mentioned in the body of the amended complaint,nor do plaintiffs specify how these defendants are involved in the alleged conspiracy.consequently,if these defendant s sought to respond to plaintiffs allegations in the context,they would have little idea where to begin.twombly,at.
plaintiffs attempt to implicate these defendants in the purported conspiracy by relying on several vague allegations contained in the amended complaint that refer to defendants or defendants executives.however,plaintiffs reliance on these indeterminate assertions is misplaced because they represent precisely the type of naked conspiratorial allegations rejected by the supreme court in twombly.see twombly,at.stating that where complaint furnishes no clue as to which defendants supposedly agreed or when and where the illicit agreement took place,the complaint fails to give adequate notice as required by.a statement of parallel conduct,even conduct consciously undertaken,needs some setting suggesting the agreement necessary to make out a claim without that further circumstance pointing toward a meeting of the minds,an account of a defendant commercial efforts stays in neutral territory.id.at.for these reasons,we hold that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs claim against alaska,aag,horizon,and america west.thus,only defendants continental and american remain.
finally,plaintiffs argue that factual allegations in their amended complaint raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal circumstantial evidence sufficient to suggest an antitrust conspiracy similar to that present in interstate circuit united states.in this regard,plaintiffs amended complaint alleges that 
each defendant knew that concerted action to reduce and cap commissions was contemplated and invited.each defendant adhered to the common scheme to reduce and cap commissions and participated in it.each defendant was advised that every other defendant was invited to participate.each defendant knew that cooperation was essential to successful operation of the plan.
in interstate circuit,the supreme court held that a pattern of uniform admission ticket prices at theaters was sufficient to permit a to infer the existence of an illegal agreement plaintiffs focus on the following language of interstate circuit 
each was aware that all were in active competition and that without substantially unanimous action with respect to the restrictions for any given territory there was risk of a substantial loss of the business and good will of the and independent exhibitors,but that with it there was the prospect of increased profits.
however,plaintiffs fail to acknowledge the salient evidence of unlawful collusion presented in interstate circuit.specifically,in interstate circuit,a texas movie theater chain sent an identical letter to eight major movie distributors threatening to discontinue showing their films if the distributors did not require all theaters to charge a minimum admission price of cents.id.at.the admission price customarily charged in independently operated theaters in texas at that time was less than cents.id.at.soon thereafter,each distributor required all theaters showing their films to charge a minimum of cents.
the supreme court concluded that interstate circuit letter,which listed all eight distributors as addressees,provided uncontested evidence that each distributor knew about the involvement of the others and constituted persuasive evidence of a conspiracy,particularly because the defendants could offer no alternative reason for their parallel pricing demands.id.
plaintiffs point to the airline reporting corporation arc,which is an information clearinghouse for airlines.the arc provides information on ticket distribution,reporting and settlement services,and base commission rates paid to travel agents.however,there is no allegation in the amended complaint that arc could provide defendants with commission reduction information before defendants implemented their rate reductions.according to the amended complaint,every leader airline the first to announce and implement a commission cut publicly announced its cut and implemented the change almost immediately.thus,defendants access to arc does not suggest a viable means to collude on commission rates before such reductions occurred.
in monsanto service,d emphasis added,the supreme court established the modern standard to evaluate evidence bearing on concerted action 
the correct standard is that there must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action that is,there must be direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the defendant and others had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.
we applied this standard in int l,realty one,cir,wherein the plaintiff,a national real estate brokerage franchiser,sued two local real estate firms,alleging a violation of of the sherman act under the local firms policy,whenever agents were involved in a transaction,defendants paid them only or percent of the commission,rather than the industry norm of a split.alleged that the policy,the means by which defendants controlled the market for hiring real estate agents,violated.at.claimed that the policy lowered its sales revenue and prevented it from recruiting knowledgeable and experienced sales agents because both defendants adopted a policy that paid its agents less than the industry norm.id.
we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants,holding that the plaintiff provided sufficient circumstantial evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent conduct.id.at.we concluded the following plus factors were important when evaluating circumstantial evidence of concerted action 
whether the defendants actions,if taken independently,would be contrary to their economic whether defendants have been uniform in their actions whether defendants have exchanged or have had the opportunity to exchange information relative to the alleged conspiracy and whether defendants have a common motive to conspire.ordinarily,an affirmative answer to the first of these factors will consistently tend to exclude the likelihood of independent conduct.
id.at internal citation omitted.
key to our decision in was evidence that use of the policy would not be in either defendant independent economic interest.if only one defendant adopted the policy,agents would simply deal with the other defendant,and thus sales and revenue would shift away from one defendant to the other.id.at.moreover,even if one defendant adopted the adverse splits policy on its own a highly unlikely event in the first place,the other local real estate firm had a strong incentive not to do likewise.id.thus,we concluded that the local firms decision to adopt the policy,despite a natural inclination not to do so,was persuasive evidence of prior agreement.id.
citing,plaintiffs assert that no rational airline would attempt to cut commission rates without entering into a prior agreement because the leader airline would lose revenue to its competitors.in support of this position,plaintiffs point to american unsuccessful attempt to cut base commission rates from to in and united similar attempt to reduce base commission rates in.plaintiffs assert that both airlines quickly retracted their base commission cuts because the travel agencies retaliated by booking their customers on airlines that maintained the status quo commission rate.plaintiffs contend that when one of defendants competitors announced a base commission cut,each defendant had a strong incentive not to adopt that cut because its natural economic inclination would be to absorb any revenue shifted away from its competitor.
first,michael gunn,former executive vice president of marketing and planning at american,testified that an independent reduction in commission rates would advance each defendant economic.each defendant could have calculated reasonably that a successful commission cut would yield greater net revenue than the likely net loss due to business diverted by plaintiffs to their competitors.this decision is especially plausible in a marketplace that has changed fundamentally since due to technological advances in airline ticket purchasing.defendants contend that new,alternate methods for airfare direct purchases by customers on the a greater economic incentive to cut commission rates on a basis.defendants also assert that it was simple and inexpensive for a leader airline to innovate and then wait and see,with the hope and expectation that its competitors would institute similar cuts.if the industry did not follow,the leader airline could simply retract the cut.thus,defendants have offered a reasonable,alternative explanation for their parallel pricing behavior.in addition,if we follow plaintiffs argument to its logical end,it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a commission cut could ever occur without collusion.based on these facts,we conclude that each defendant had a reasonable,independent economic interest in adopting a competitor commission cut rather than to maintain the status quo.
we therefore hold that plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts plausibly suggesting not merely consistent with an agreement in violation of of the sherman act because defendants conduct was not only compatible with,but indeed was more likely explained by,lawful,unchoreographed behavior.ashcroft iqbal.at pursuant to twombly,district courts must assess the plausibility of an alleged illegal agreement before parties are forced to engage in protracted litigation and bear excessive discovery costs.twombly,at.in this regard,we note that the plausibility of plaintiffs conspiracy claim is inversely correlated to the magnitude of defendants economic in making the cuts see matsushita,at defining ambiguous evidence as that which is as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy.we are not persuaded by plaintiffs argument that defendants would not seek to reduce base commissions independently,especially during the late and into,where changes in the marketplace provided consumers with alternate options.as the court stated in twombly,there is no reason to infer that these defendants had agreed among themselves to do what was only natural anyway.at.
next,plaintiffs rely upon of their amended complaint,which includes an excerpt from the deposition of michael gunn.gunn testified that industry consensus on new commission levels was necessary for the commission cuts and caps to hold.gunn also testified that he had to match commission cuts exactly or he would undercut the movement.plaintiffs argue that gunn testimony provides strong evidence of an antecedent agreement.we disagree.
the district court reviewed gunn deposition testimony in its entirety and carefully considered all of the factual allegations which,taken as true,could plausibly imply that defendants entered into a preceding agreement.after doing so,the district court ruled that there were insufficient facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery would reveal evidence of an illegal agreement.in reaching its conclusion,the district court noted the importance of the following portion of gunn testimony 
alioto counsel for plaintiff it was,in fact,represented to you by another person at american that in order for these reductions of commissions to work that you had to get common agreement of the industry that was the most important thing 
gunn i would respond again that my belief is you have to be matched if the cut is to be successful.but i do know i do care if there a common agreement or other.all i care about is how people behave if i do something or how i believe if they do something.to me that not consensus.that taking a common action after the fact which is to me a lot different than consensus.consensus speaks to prior agreement.there certainly was any prior agreement in these cases.
based on the facts alleged by plaintiffs,it is just as likely that american commission cap was an effort to reduce its internal commission costs,with the ancillary hope that its competitors would follow its lead.as stated by a respected antitrust authority 
when one oligopolist raises its price,each of its rivals must decide whether to follow.continuing the previous price would allow each of the others to increase its sales if the leader persists in charging a higher price.but each knows that the leader is likely to retract an increase that is not followed.accordingly,each rival asks itself whether it is better off at the lower price when it is charged by all or at the higher price when charged by all.if the latter,as will often be the case,the leader price increase is likely to be followed.
the price leader may assume that others have made a similar calculation about which price will maximize profits.or the leader may simply proceed by trial and error raise the price and see what happens,especially where reversing an unfollowed price rise is not very costly.
phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law ed.
in addition,the matching of american commission cap by the other defendants is not necessarily indicative of prior agreement.on this issue,the seventh circuit has observed that 
a firm in a concentrated industry typically has reason to decide individually to copy an industry leader.after all,a price might lead a customer to buy elsewhere,while a price might simply lead competitors to match the lower price,reducing profits for all.one does not need an agreement to bring about this kind of effect in a concentrated industry.
reserve supply fiberglas,cir.thus,each defendant decision to match a new commission cut was arguably a reasoned,prudent business decision.moreover,if each defendant asked itself whether it was better off paying base commissions paid by all or not paying base commissions eliminated by all,each defendant would plausibly elect the latter from a purely economic standpoint.
plaintiffs also argue that their factual allegations regarding defendants opportunities to conspire are enough to nudge their claim across the line from conceivable to plausible.twombly,at.specifically,plaintiffs rely upon,which alleges that an executive of marketing distribution for northwest airlines,a senior vice president of planning for air,and a senior vice president of marketing for american met for three hours in a dallas hotel conference room and upon as well,which avers that in,a delta senior executive met for a weekend of golf and socializing at the home of an american executive responsible for setting american commission levels.four months later,american led an reduction on commission caps from to 
however,plaintiffs amended complaint does not cite any specific meetings that involved both continental and american,the only two remaining defendants.the fact that american and continental gathered at industry trade association meetings during the period when defendants reduced commission rates should not weigh heavily in favor of suspecting collusion.the supreme court rejected a similar argument in twombly 
from the allegation that defendants belong to various trade associations,the dissent playfully suggests that they conspired to restrain trade,an inference said to be buttressed by the common sense of adam smith.if adam smith is peering down today,he may be surprised to learn that his remark would be authority to force his famous pinmaker to devote financial and human capital to hire lawyers,prepare for depositions,and otherwise fend off allegations of conspiracy all this just because he belonged to the same trade guild as one of his competitors when their pins carried the same price tag.
twombly,at.internal citation omitted.moreover,a mere opportunity to conspire does not,standing alone,plausibly suggest an illegal agreement because american and continental presence at such trade meetings is more likely explained by their lawful,behavior.iqbal.at.
finally,plaintiffs argue that we should rely upon a statement made in by a former american airlines executive who approved commission cuts that are the subject of this action.plaintiffs allege that this unnamed american executive encouraged an executive of a competitor airline also unnamed to increase its fares by to make more money.
plaintiffs presumably refer to a statement made by robert crandall,former president of american,to howard putnam,former president of the braniff airlines.see united states am.airlines,cir.first,we note that crandall made this statement more than years ago.second,the amended complaint avers only that crandall approved commission cuts and fails to allege that he was actually involved in the conspiracy at issue here.in addition,we note that crandall retired from american in,placing his departure as ceo at the very beginning of plaintiffs conspiratorial time line.
we conclude that crandall prior statement is too remote in time to support a plausible inference of agreement.we also do not view his statement as tending to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of an illegal agreement between continental and american.see twombly,at.
for these reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in the recent twombly and iqbal cases,quoted and discussed at length by my colleagues in their majority opinion,the supreme court has started to modify somewhat,but not drastically,the notice pleading rules that have reigned under conley gibson,d a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.these two cases now require more than simple notice and conclusory statements of ultimate facts about the case.instead plaintiffs must plead sufficient factual matter to state a legal claim or cause of action that is not only conceivable but also plausible,independently of the notice given and the legal conclusions short,a set of factual allegations that make the cause of action plausible.iqbal.at.the supreme court majority has made clear that it is not making a major change in the law of pleading with twombly and its progeny 
as with any other new,general legal standard,the nature and meaning of the newly modified standard can be understood and followed only by analyzing how the standard is applied in actual cases like this case.here my colleagues have seriously misapplied the new standard by requiring not simple plausibility,but by requiring the plaintiff to present at the pleading stage a strong probability of winning the case and excluding any possibility that the defendants acted independently and not in unison.my colleagues are requiring the plaintiff to offer detailed facts that if true would create a clear and convincing case of antitrust liability at trial without allowing the plaintiff the normal right to conduct discovery and have the jury draw reasonable inferences of liability from strong direct and circumstantial evidence.
twombly itself was a telephone antitrust case in which the only factual allegations in the complaint of a contract,combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade was that the former baby bell telephone companies continued to do business in their former home territories and did not attack and try to take market share away from the other operating baby bell companies in their home region.this was the full extent of the twombly factual allegations of behavior.there was no allegation of action,as opposed to nonaction,misfeasance as opposed to nonfeasance.the supreme court sensibly pointed out that there could be many explanations for this similar economic nonaction other than the kind of agreement not to compete required for liability under of the sherman act.thus the supreme court held that this one specific factual allegation of similar conduct was insufficient alone to state a plausible claim,though the court seems to say that this kind of factual statement alone makes the pleading issue close.twombly,at.allegation of parallel conduct gets the complaint close to stating a claim.
if the twombly pleading issue was close,but insufficient,based only on similar,nonfeasance toward each other historical territory,the allegations concerning the in unison,affirmative behavior of the airlines in this case are obviously sufficient.the factual allegations in this case create an overwhelming case for the plaintiff to get by a motion to dismiss on the pleading.
five times the airlines acted affirmatively,aggressively and publicly in unison to cut,fix and hold the price the airlines would pay the travel agents.although at present there is no written contract to that effect,the facts alleged present so plain a case that they might as well have put the plan in writing.
the complaint alleges that united and american tried in and,respectively,to fix the price lower to the travel agents but the other airlines would not go along.the allegations recite the statements of an american airlines executive that the airlines learned not to try again until everyone was on board.the complaint alleges inside information tantamount to a partial confession.
then when they tried again in the plan went like.everyone followed the leader five straight times until the price reached zero.the allegations of fact,based on testimony of insiders,was that the plan could not work without agreement but could work if the airlines acted in unison.since the plan worked like a charm,the allegati
