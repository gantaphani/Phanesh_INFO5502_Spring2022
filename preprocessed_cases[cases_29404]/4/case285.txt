brought this suit in federal district court,alleging that centurytel,centurytel violated federal and state law by using deceptive billing practices to bill customers for wirewatch,a wire maintenance program.brought suit under the federal communications act of,et,the federal communications commission act,et,and the michigan consumer protection act.comp.laws et.moved the district court for class certification and for judgment on the pleadings on count i of the complaint,which alleged that centurytel engaged in unjust and unreasonable billing practices in violation of b and.the district court certified claims and granted judgment on the pleadings as to count centurytel appeals only the district court decision to certify the class.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court order to certify the class on its claims under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule.we further remand the claims to the district court to conduct a rule analysis.
factual background 
centurytel is a telecommunications service provider.as the eighth largest telephone company in the united states,centurytel provides telephone services to more than million customers in states,including michigan.centurytel offers its customers a service entitled wirewatch,an inside wire maintenance plan,described by the company as follows 
wirewatch covers the cost of diagnosis and repair of inside wiring jack damages that can interrupt your phone service.once your telephone wiring enters your house,it becomes your responsibility to maintain it and typical repairs can be costly.for a low monthly fee,enjoy the convenience and satisfaction of having a certified centurytel tech to diagnose and make any necessary repairs.
wirewatch is an unregulated service,and therefore is not covered by centurytel tariffs or rate filings.ja compl.centurytel does not require its customers to subscribe to wirewatch as a condition to obtaining or keeping the company tariffed telephone and transmission services.id.as the district court pointed out,wirewatch varies from state to state in some states,centurytel has offered wirewatch for a number of years,but in others,such as alabama and missouri,wirewatch only recently has become available through centurytel to its customers.beattie centurytel.
allege that centurytel began billing customers for wirewatch as early as.ja compl.from until,the price of wirewatch gradually increased,starting from as little as per month in,increasing to per month in,and capping off at per month in.ja compl.until january,centurytel billed customers for wirewatch using the description services under a section of its bill titled monthly service detail.ja compl.in or around january,centurytel reorganized its telephone bills,changing the description used to bill customers for wirewatch from services to inside wire maintenance plan.ja compl.centurytel also changed the heading under which it billed for wirewatch to reflect that these charges were for other services or equipment,and not for transmission services.id.it was this change,the allege,which triggered complaints from customers who were unaware that they were being billed for wirewatch.appellee br.ja compl.numerous customer complaints have been lodged against centurytel since january,when centurytel first revealed that it had been systematically billing and charging customers for wirewatch.
centurytel explains that historically customers have enrolled in wirewatch via oral communications with a customer service representative,such as when a customer calls to set up service,or to add or change their existing service.appellant br.according to centurytel,it is during these calls that a centurytel representative will inform customers of the benefits and costs of wirewatch.id.centurytel maintains that it does not utilize a script with regard to these oral communications concerning wirewatch.id.
however,allege that centurytel has routinely and systematically charged customers for its optional inside wire maintenance program by cramming charges onto customers telephone bills.ja compl.the federal communications commission fcc defines cramming as the practice of placing unauthorized,misleading,or deceptive charges on a customer telephone bill.entities that fraudulently cram people appear to rely largely on confusing telephone bills in order to mislead consumers into paying for services that they did not authorize or receive.ja compl.the complaint alleges that w hile centurytel has never provided plaintiffs or other customers with an application form or other materials describing the supposed terms and obligations of centurytel inside wire maintenance program,centurytel has continuously billed customers for this service each month for at least the last several years.id.
procedural history 
the named plaintiffs are two individual,residential customers of centurytel,each of whom reside in michigan.ja compl.the complaint alleges that plaintiff barbrasue beattie paid for wirewatch,unbeknownst to her,from november until january,when centurytel change to its billing statements alerted beattie to this unauthorized charge.id.beattie contacted centurytel and asked for a refund of the charges.id.although centurytel admitted,in a march,letter,that no authorization for wirewatch was on file for beattie account,the company refused to credit beattie for the charges paid prior to may.id.like beattie,plaintiff james sovis unknowingly paid for wirewatch from until january.ja compl.
on october,brought suit in federal district court,pleading six counts centurytel engaged in misleading or deceptive billing practices in violation of b,and count i centurytel unjust and unreasonable practices constitute cramming in violation of b,and count ii under,seek a a declaratory judgment that centurytel violated b and the fcc act,and b an injunction barring centurytel from continuing to violate these laws and regulations count iii centurytel breached its contract with and breached its corresponding duties of good faith and fair dealing by engaging in unjust and deceptive billing and cramming practices in violation of state law count iv centurytel unlawful,unconscionable,and deceptive practices have led to its unjust enrichment,and the company should be forced to disgorge any of the charges,monies,and fees that it derived from its unlawful and deceptive billing practices count v and centurytel unlawful billing practices violated the michigan consumer protection act.comp.laws et.count vi.ja compl.
brought this action on behalf of themselves and a putative class under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the parameters of the class were defined as follows 
a ll persons who have paid centurytel,for charges described in centurytel residential telephone bills as services or inside wire maint.plan during the fullest period allowed by law the class.
excluded from the class are centurytel its subsidiaries,affiliates,officers and directors any entity in which centurytel has a controlling interest and the legal representatives,heirs,successors and assigns of any such excluded party.
ja compl.on august,moved to certify the class.also moved for judgment on the pleadings as to count i of their complaint under federal rule of civil procedure c.on march,the district court certified the class,concluding that the had satisfied all the prerequisites under rule a,beattie,at,and had satisfied the requirements for certification under rule b.id.at.the district court also granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to count id.at based on the allegations and admissions in the pleadings,the court concludes that the defendant practice of billing for its wirewatch program using the description services constitutes a violation of section b of the telecommunications act as a matter of law.
centurytel filed this timely appeal.
standard of review 
this court permits interlocutory appeals of a district court order to certify a class.f,and reviews such orders for an abuse of discretion,alkire irving,cir.the district court maintains substantial discretion in determining whether to certify a class,as it possesses the inherent power to manage and control its own pending litigation.reeb ohio dep t of rehab.and,cir citing stout byrider,cir but see sprague motors,cir en banc explaining that a district court may not certify any class without rigorous analysis of the requirements of rule.the district court decision certifying the class is subject to a very limited review and will be reversed only upon a strong showing that the district court decision was a clear abuse of discretion.olden lafarge,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on erroneous findings of fact,applies the wrong legal standard,misapplies the correct legal standard when reaching a conclusion,or makes a clear error of judgment.reeb,at.
class certification 
it is the plaintiff burden to establish his right to class certification.alkire,at quoting senter motors,cir.under federal rule of civil procedure a,there are four prerequisites to a class action 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
a.in alkire,this court explained that the class may only be certified if,after a rigorous analysis,the district court is satisfied that these prerequisites have been met.at quoting.falcon,d.
in addition to the prerequisites of rule a,a plaintiff must also show that her suit falls within one of the three types of class actions under federal rule of civil procedure b.here,the sought,and the district court granted,class certification under rule b,which requires the district court to find that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b.lastly,rule does not require a district court,in deciding whether to certify a class,to inquire into the merits of the plaintiff suit.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d we find nothing in either the language or history of rule that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.daffin ford motor,cir.
a rule a typicality 
centurytel challenges the district court conclusion that the have satisfied the typicality requirement of rule a because the resolution of the named plaintiffs claims depends upon facts unique to them,and would not prove that other members of the class were misled,crammed or injured.appellant br.conversely,contend that the typicality requirement is satisfied here because the claims of plaintiffs and all class members arise from the same practice unlawful billing,that affected them in the same manner all received and paid bills that unlawfully described the plan as service,and are based on the same legal theory violation of b and.appellee br.
the district court concluded that the typicality requirement was satisfied,explaining that the key issue is whether the billing language cited by the plaintiffs satisfies the requirements of the statute and regulation.beattie,at.the court explained that centurytel argument,that a myriad of legal and factual issues exist between the class representative and the putative class members,confounds the matters of liability and damages.id.
under rule a,the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class.a.a claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members,and if his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.in re am.med,cir.in sprague,the court explained that t ypicality determines whether a sufficient relationship exists between the injury to the named plaintiff and the conduct affecting the class,so that the court may properly attribute a collective nature to the challenged conduct.at citing in re am.med,at.on the other hand,the sprague court explained,the typicality requirement is not satisfied when a plaintiff can prove his own claim but not necessarily have proved anybody else claim.id.lastly,for the district court to conclude that the typicality requirement is satisfied,a representative claim need not always involve the same facts or law,provided there is a common element of fact or law.senter motors,cir.
in daffin,for instance,this court concluded that the typicality requirement was satisfied because the plaintiff claim that ford breached its express warranty by providing vehicles with defectively designed throttle body assemblies involved the same defective throttle body assembly as the other class members.at.the court found the lead plaintiffs claims to be typical despite the different factual circumstances regarding the manifestation of the accelerator sticking and ford attempts to remedy manifested sticking.id.at noting that t he mere fact that daffin throttle assembly stuck,while other class members throttles have not stuck,does not render daffin atypical.although ford argued that an owner who has not experienced accelerator sticking and has not sought repair for the problem can not prove an express warranty claim,this court explained that a district court should not inquire into the merits of the suit in assessing typicality.id.similarly,the claim that centurytel violated and by billing for wirewatch under a misleading description is typical of the claims of the class members.the mere fact that some class members may have enrolled in wirewatch after receiving a billing statement with the misleading description does not make the claims atypical.
claims arise from the same allegedly deceptive billing practice that gives rise to the claims of the other class members,namely,centurytel practice of billing for wirewatch under a misleading description.here,allege that centurytel violated b because it billed customers for wirewatch under the description services,which is inherently ambiguous and misleading,and therefore unjust and unreasonable under the statute.this is the same allegation any other class member would bring against centurytel,and therefore resolution of centurytel liability under b with regards to claim will also resolve the company liability as to claims brought by other class members.see sprague,at explaining that the typicality requirement is satisfied if as goes the claim of the named plaintiff,so go the claims of the class.
further,centurytel argument that individual issues of liability predominate over common issues,and thereby preclude a finding of typicality,is unavailing.whether the customer authorized her enrollment in wirewatch,or whether the customer would have terminated her enrollment in wirewatch if the billing description had been clearer is,as the district court concluded,an issue that goes to damages and can thereby be resolved through resort to subclasses.see,in re visa antitrust,cir explaining that t here are a number of management tools available to a district court to address any individualized damages issues,such as bifurcating liability and damage trials,or appointing a magistrate judge or special master to preside over individual damages proceedings.to establish liability,must show that centurytel billed its customers for wirewatch under a misleading and ambiguous heading a violation of b,and that customers nonetheless paid for wirewatch satisfying injury requirement.whether the customer authorized her enrollment in wirewatch or benefitted from the plan service,despite being billed for the service under a misleading description,goes only to the issue of damages and does not preclude a finding that the typicality requirement is satisfied.thus,the fact that some of the class members may have enrolled in wirewatch does not make the claim atypical.spicer chicago bd.options,no.cv,wl,at,concluding that the fact differences relating to the price at which each series traded do not undermine typicality,since plaintiffs legal allegations and most of their general fact allegations are the same for the representatives and all other members of the class.
b rule a adequacy 
centurytel also challenges the district court conclusion that the adequacy requirement of rule a is satisfied.centurytel maintains that were required to introduce evidence showing how each class member enrolled in wirewatch to establish substantial uniformity,and because failed to do so,they can not adequately represent the class members.appellant br.the district court rejected centurytel argument and concluded that the adequacy requirement of rule a was satisfied.beattie,at.the court explained that t he interests in this case,while of varying degrees,seem to all focus in the same direction.id.
the adequacy inquiry under rule a serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.amchem,windsor,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in stout,this court explained that it reviews the adequacy of class representation to determine whether class counsel are qualified,experienced and generally able to conduct the litigation,and to consider whether the class members have interests that are not antagonistic to one another.at see also in re am.med,at explaining that the representative must have common interests with unnamed members of the class,and it must appear that the representatives will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel citations omitted.
based on this standard,the district court did not err in concluding that the adequacy requirement of rule a was satisfied.the court stated that plaintiffs attorney is an experienced practitioner in this area because of the numerous class action cases in which counsel has participated,and centurytel did not argue otherwise.beattie,at.further,the district court determined that the interests of the named plaintiffs were not antagonistic to those of the class members.id.the facts support the district court conclusion,because there is no indication of a conflict of interest between the named plaintiffs and the class members.see int l union,united,aerospace,agric.implement workers of am.motors,wl,at noting that adequacy of representation turns in part on absence of conflicts of interest internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the and the class members suffered the same were billed for wirewatch under a misleading,therefore,there is every reason to believe that the will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class.id.class representatives are adequate when it appear s that they will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel,which usually will be the case if the representatives are part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.alterations in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.taken together,these factors indicate that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the requirement of rule a is satisfied.
the district court also held that the requirements of rule b were satisfied.beattie,at.in concluding that common questions predominate over questions affecting individual class members,the district court determined that 
a lthough damages may be individualized and not all customers who received ambiguous bills will say that they did not order or authorize the inside wire maintenance insurance program,the overarching question of whether the billing itself violates section b or rule predominates and must be determined before any customer has a right to recover under that theory.
id.at.in response to centurytel argument that the need to prove causation for each plaintiff to show liability demonstrates that individual issues predominate,the district court stated that the necessity of each plaintiff proving the amount of his or her damages is generally not an impediment to class certification.id.the court explained that 
the questions of causation and damages in this case can be addressed later in the proceedings by means of a special master,representative trials,or other means.however,because the liability issue predominates,this case falls easily into the category of cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.
id.at quoting windsor,at.
centurytel maintains that each class member must establish injury to prove liability under and,and fact of injury is not a common issue among class members.appellant br.according to centurytel,the district court confounded the need of each class member to establish injury with the need to establish damages.id.centurytel contends that causation and injury,unlike damages,must be established on a basis.id.
a predominance requirement 
a class action may be maintained only if it qualifies under one of the subsections of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.ball union carbide,cir.under rule b,a class action is appropriate where 
the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.the matters pertinent to the findings include a the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum d the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.
b.the rule b predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.windsor,at.see also in re visa antitrust,cir.to satisfy the predominance requirement in rule b,a plaintiff must establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof,and thus applicable to the class as a whole,predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.in re visa antitrust,at quoting rutstein avis,cir internal quotation marks omitted.further,the fact that a defense may arise and may affect different class members differently does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones.id.at quoting waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.lastly,c ommon issues may predominate when liability can be determined on a basis,even when there are some individualized damage issues.id.at.
