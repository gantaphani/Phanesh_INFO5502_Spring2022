plaintiffs brought this action against the defendant state officials,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for alleged violations of the first amendment.the district court denied the plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction,as well as their motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs now appeal the denial of the preliminary injunction we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.because supreme court precedent protects the commercial speech at issue here,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
background 
the state of utah exercises strict control over the importation,distribution,marketing,and sale of alcoholic beverages within its borders.in this case,we are asked to decide whether one aspect of that restrictions on commercial advertisements for infringes upon the first amendment rights of that state citizens.
both parties in this case recognize that the amendment gives utah broad powers to regulate alcoholic beverages.see,amend.xxi,ziffrin,reeves.however,in,appellants henceforth collectively referred to as ulba,for utah licensed beverage association sued defendants henceforth utah.ulba argued that in light of certain recent first amendment decisions by the supreme court,utah laws restricting commercial advertising by vendors of wine and distilled spirits could no longer be considered a proper exercise of the state amendment powers.see aplt br.at citing liquormart,rhode island,d,and rubin coors brewing,d.
three years later,the district court denied ulba motions for summary judgment and for a preliminary injunction.it concluded that ulba had not demonstrated that the state restrictions on advertising of alcoholic beverages are an unconstitutional infringement upon ulba first amendment rights,and had failed to establish any of the elements necessary to support a preliminary injunction.aplt app.at memorandum decision addressing plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction,dated,at.ulba now appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion see johnson,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs only when the trial court bases its decision on an erroneous conclusion of law or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for the ruling.hawkins city and county of denver,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.elements necessary to obtain a preliminary injunction 
in order to obtain a preliminary injunction,a movant must establish that it has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits that it will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is denied that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs the injury that the opposing party will suffer under the injunction and that the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.see country kids n city slicks,sheen,cir.because a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,the right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.scfc ilc,visa usa,cir citation omitted.
iii.ulba likelihood of success on the merits 
ulba contends that despite our deferential standard of review,it has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits,because the district court made an error of law and misapplied the test set forth in central hudson gas electric public service comm of new york,d.as a consequence,ulba maintains that it has satisfied the first requirement for preliminary injunctive relief.
under central hudson,laws restricting commercial speech are subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny.the supreme court stated 
in commercial speech cases,then,a analysis has developed.at the outset,we must determine whether the expression is protected by the first amendment.for commercial speech to come within that provision,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,we ask whether the asserted government interest is substantial.if both inquiries yield positive answers,we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.
id.at.in order to determine whether the district court made an error of law when it concluded that ulba had not established a likelihood of success on the merits,we must review that court application of the central hudson test.
a.the district court central hudson analysis 
the district court considered the four part central hudson test in detail in its memorandum decision addressing plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,which it incorporated by reference into its memorandum decision addressing plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction.
with respect to the first part of the central hudson test,whether the regulated speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading,the district court agreed with ulba that a number of the challenged statutes regulated lawful,nonmisleading speech.it rejected utah argument that the majority of the statutes regulated conduct,not speech,and were thus constitutional.the court stated that,because c onsumption of alcoholic beverages involves lawful conduct,and c ommercial speech about lawful conduct is subject to first amendment protection,utah could not escape review of its legislation by asserting that the challenged conduct is unlawful under the very same legislation being reviewed.aplt app.at.
in the second part of the test,which requires the court to assess the substantiality of the government interest,the district court found that the interests cited by utah in support of its advertising restrictions were in fact substantial.the court identified these interests as the operation of a public business,with the goal of satisfying public demand for alcoholic beverages while protecting the public interest including the rights of citizens who do not wish to be involved with alcoholic products,as well as the promotion of the public welfare,including concerns such as temperance,health,safety,consumer protection and protecting minors.id.at citing utah code ann.the court rejected ulba argument that protecting from alcohol advertising could not be a substantial interest,stating that where operating a public business involves alcoholic beverages it seems clear that a substantial interest is involved,even when a stated goal is to protect.id.at.
the district court then turned to the third part of the test,inquiring whether the utah laws directly advanced the interests identified by the state.the court noted statistics put forth by ulba which supposedly demonstrated that the repeal of advertising restrictions would not lead to an increase in overall demand for alcohol.it then reviewed the evidence submitted by utah,in the form of testimony and affidavits by various physicians and public health officials,who opined that the state public welfare interest is real and materially advanced by the state regulation of alcoholic beverage advertising.id.at.the court concluded that there is sufficient evidence of record to place in dispute the issue of whether the state asserted interests in restricting advertising of alcoholic beverages are directly and materially advanced by the challenged restrictions on advertising alcoholic beverages.id.at.
finally,the district court reached the fourth part of the central hudson test,whether the speech restriction is no more extensive than is necessary to serve the government interest.id.at.it cited the supreme court recent discussion in greater new orleans broadcasting ass n,united states,d,where the court stated that in the fourth part of the test,t he government is not required to employ the least restrictive means conceivable,but it must demonstrate narrow tailoring of the challenged regulation to the asserted fit that is not necessarily perfect,but reasonable.aplt app.at quoting greater new orleans,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court determined that utah had again succeeded in placing in dispute the issue of whether its statutes satisfied the fourth part of central hudson.aplt app.at.it stated that utah statutes fell short of being a total or blanket ban against dissemination of any information about alcoholic beverages,and that l ess burdensome alternative methods to advance the somewhat contradictory interests of the state do not readily come to mind.id.at.it described those contradictory interests as utah goals of operating its alcoholic beverage business using sound business practices to service public demand,while at the same time operating under the stricture that it not promote the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages.id.at.
application of central hudson to utah challenged regulations 
we now turn to the question of whether the district court application of the central hudson test was correct.as we do so,we are mindful of the supreme court consistent admonition that in cases raising first amendment issues an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.bose consumers union of united states,d quoting new york times sullivan,d see also lytle city of haysville,cir.this searching review is a consequence of the primacy of first amendment speech protections broad interpretations of the freedom of speech have repeatedly attracted substantial majorities of the supreme court.see,greater new orleans,d hustler falwell,d brandenburg ohio,d.
regulation of truthful,nonmisleading speech 
the district court found that several of the statutes in controversy restrict truthful,nonmisleading commercial speech,not conduct,and thus satisfy the first part of central hudson.unsurprisingly,ulba does not contest this finding.utah,however,claims that some of these statutes are permissible prohibitions on the advertising of unlawful conduct.for instance,utah code ann.prohibits the advertising or use of any means or media to offer alcoholic beverages to the general public without charge.utah code ann.utah reasons that because the state may ban alcohol giveaways,it may also ban the advertising of such giveaways,and thus this statute is not unconstitutional under central hudson.aple br.at.
we agree with the district court that such statutes are distinguishable from those challenged on appeal by ulba.ulba brief describes the main utah statutes at issue herein as utah code ann,which provides that 
the advertising or use of any means or media to induce persons to buy liquor is prohibited,except 
a a restaurant licensee,an airport lounge licensee,a manufacturing licensee,or a private club licensee may display a sign on the front of,in the window of,and inside its premises stating department of alcoholic beverage control licensee,dabc licensee,or state liquor licensee in a form approved by the department 
b a restaurant licensee may use the designation department of alcoholic beverage control licensee,dabc licensee,or state liquor licensee in magazines,newspapers,telephone book advertising pages,and other advertising in a nonbold type face 
c a permittee may use the designation department of alcoholic beverage control permittee,dabc permittee,or state liquor permittee in a form approved by the department when informing the public or its invited guests about the event or service for which the permit was obtained 
d a restaurant licensee may advertise liquor availability in menus only to the extent authorized in chapter 
e a hotel may advise its guests of liquor availability at its outlets in informational materials and 
f as otherwise authorized by this title or the rules of the commission.
utah code ann.as well as,which provides that 
the display of liquor or price lists in windows or showcases visible to passersby is prohibited.
utah code ann.and,which provides that 
any person who violates this title or the commission rules adopted under this title is guilty of a class b misdemeanor,unless otherwise provided in this title.
utah code ann.these statutes are the only statutes clearly raised on appeal.see aplt br.at.because they restrict the speech of individuals engaged in otherwise lawful,nonmisleading commercial activity,we find no error in the district court conclusion that they satisfy the first part of central hudson.
substantiality of the government interest in regulation 
the second part of central hudson asks whether the interests asserted by the state in order to justify the speech regulations are substantial.again,because of the importance of first amendment speech protections,the government bears the responsibility of building a record adequate to clearly articulate and justify these state interests.west,federal communications comm n,cir.not only is this the government burden,but courts may not help the supreme court has clearly stated that courts may not supplant the precise interests put forward by the state with other suppositions.edenfield fane,d.
as stated above,the district court found that utah had substantial interests in the operation of liquor sales as a public business including protecting nondrinkers,and in the public welfare,including temperance,health,and safety.on appeal,ulba argues that utah has identified no constitutionally substantial state interests other than temperance.aplt br.at.it should be noted that this argument is itself tempered by ulba broad definition of the term.even if temperance is understood to include essentially all public health related goals ulba does not object to the district court characterization of temperance as a state interest that can satisfy the second part of central hudson.
however,ulba proposes that utah alleged public interest in operating a well managed public business in selling alcohol is not substantial such as to allow first amendment infringement that its interest in protecting nondrinkers from liquor advertising is contrary to the basic concepts of free expression and that its goal of protecting consumers from improper claims or overreaching can not justify general restrictions on advertising.aplt br.at aplt reply br.at.ulba also states that utah has failed to articulate and justify any of these state interests in a manner sufficient to satisfy central hudson second part.
in opposition,utah does not present new arguments in support of these interests,but merely asserts that temperance,operating a public business,protecting the public welfare,protecting nondrinkers,and all activities subsidiary to those aims were determined by the district court to be legitimate and substantial interests of the state.in support of the district court conclusion,utah does contend that the amendment,granting the states the right to completely control alcohol in its sic borders,as well as the public safety,health and welfare interests and the police power all combine to make,as the court below found,these state interests substantial.aple br.at.
if the term is broadly defined to include goals such as promoting public health,discouraging underage consumption,and the like,both parties seem to agree that utah has established temperance as an adequate basis for state regulation under the second part of the test.see liquormart,at.discussing a state interest in promoting temperance,defined as reducing alcohol consumption.operating liquor sales as a public business qualifies as an additional substantial interest,as the state monopoly over liquor sales not only affects temperance,but also supplies revenue.
however,supreme court precedent suggests that even if protecting nondrinkers from involvement with alcohol is part of a public business,it can not constitute a substantial state interest under central hudson.in bolger youngs drug products,d,the court struck down a federal statute prohibiting the unsolicited mailing of contraceptive advertisements.the court stated that the government asserted interest,the shielding of recipients of mail from materials they are likely to find offensive carries little weight.bolger,at.it held that 
in striking down a state prohibition of contraceptive advertisements in carey population services international,d,we stated that offensiveness was classically not a justificatio n validating the suppression of expression protected by the first amendment.at least where obscenity is not involved,we have consistently held that the fact that protected speech may be offensive to some does not justify its suppression.we specifically declined to recognize a distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech that would render this interest a sufficient justification for a prohibition of commercial speech.
id.at.citations and footnote omitted.we can see little distinction between the offensiveness rationale that the court deemed unsubstantial in bolger,and that of protecting nondrinkers.because bolger also concerned commercial speech,we construe it to mean that protecting nondrinkers can not constitute a substantial state interest justifying utah speech restriction,even as one aspect of operating a public business.
we conclude that utah has identified two substantial state interests that potentially justify its speech restrictions temperance expansively defined,and the operation of a public business.
whether utah laws directly advance the state interests 
ulba next contends that the district court was incorrect when it concluded that,for the purpose of surviving summary judgment,utah laws satisfied the third part of central hudson.the third part of central hudson concerns the relationship between the harm that underlies the state interest and the means identified by the state to advance that interest.lorillard tobacco reilly,d.we must therefore consider whether utah laws restricting liquor advertising directly and materially advance its interests in temperance and the operation of a public business.see greater new orleans,at.
the supreme court has stated that t he party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it.bolger,at.this burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture in order to meet its burden,utah must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.edenfield,at.in addition,a speech regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.greater new orleans,at.quoting central hudson,at.the court cautions us that these requirements are critical,for otherwise,a state could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression.coors,at.quoting edenfield,at.
ulba suggests utah has failed to carry its burden for three reasons.the first two of these concern the reality of the alleged harms,and the third pertains to their alleviation.first,since,when utah amended its laws and repealed a prior ban on beer advertising,there has apparently been no significant increase in the consumption of beer within the state.from this,ulba concludes that beer advertising evidently does not affect beer consumption,and that the same is likely to be true with respect to liquor and the liquor advertising ban.second,ulba argues that the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence,including the expert testimony supporting ulba motion for preliminary injunction,tends to show that advertising does not increase alcohol consumption.aplt br.at.in ulba view,these two facts demonstrate that the liquor advertising ban does not prevent any real harm 
third,ulba proposes that utah also fails central hudson third part because the state inconsistent treatment of different types of alcohol ensures that its speech restrictions will not alleviate the harms they are designed to redress,thus making the scheme irrational under coors.in coors,the supreme court applied central hudson and struck down a federal statute that prohibited the disclosure of alcohol content on the labels of containers of beer.the federal government asserted interest was to prevent strength wars among beer manufacturers,and the statute sought to accomplish this by banning both numerical indications of alcohol content and descriptive terms such as strong and extra strength.coors,at.
in applying the third part of the central hudson test,the court stated that the challenged beer label restriction can not directly and materially advance the government asserted interest because of the overall irrationality of the government regulatory scheme,under which there were additional provisions within the same statute,as well as other federal laws,that undermined any tendency of the labeling ban to prevent strength wars.coors,at.these included provisions that permitted descriptions of alcohol content in alcohol advertising,and permitted the disclosure of alcohol content on the labels of alcoholic beverages other than beer.id.at.
according to ulba,unless one form of alcohol is more harmful or dangerous than another,temperance can not be promoted by a statutory scheme that permits some types of alcohol advertising and proscribes others.but,ulba argues,utah itself engages in a public health advertising campaign which states that there is no meaningful difference,other than equivalent liquid volume,among different kinds of alcohol.see aplt app.at advertisement declaring alcohol is alcohol is alcohol it not what you drink.it how much.because utah has presented no sound reason why advertising restrictions on wine and liquor confer more temperance benefits than comparable but nonexistent restrictions on beer advertising,ulba concludes that utah ban on the advertising of only certain kinds of alcoholic beverages is irrational,and consequently unconstitutional,under greater new orleans and coors.aplt br.at.
utah makes several counterarguments with respect to central hudson third part.first,utah contends that under board of trustees of state university of new york fox,d,it is only required to achieve a reasonable fit,not a perfect fit,between its regulations and its goals.aple br.at quoting fox,at.under fox,utah states that in regulating commercial speech,it must employ not necessarily the least restrictive means but a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.id.utah concludes that this gives it some latitude in selecting a permissible advertising restriction.second,utah argues that ulba completely ignore s evidence submitted by the state,especially the statements of three physicians and public health officials,suggesting that alcohol advertising does affect the problems utah identified as its substantial state interests.see aple br.at aplt app.at.
third,utah defends its distinctions between beer and liquor advertising as a permissible consequence of its decision,pursuant to its amendment powers,to apply different regulations to beer and liquor sales.because beer sales are not operated as a public business by the state,utah suggests that it is not irrational to regulate beer advertising differently from liquor advertising.the state attributes this distinction to the fact that beer with a sufficiently low alcohol content was not considered an intoxicating beverage banned under the eighteenth amendment,and that when the eighteenth amendment was repealed by the,utah continued to regulate beer in a manner different from other alcoholic beverages.see aple br.at.
before we conduct our own analysis of central hudson third part,we must note an issue raised by utah arguments concerning the burden of proof.utah seems to imply that because ulba is appealing the denial of a preliminary injunction,it is ulba burden to affirmatively attack the utah statutes,rather than utah burden to defend them.for example,utah states that ulba has failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that ulba had failed to show that there was a likelihood they would prevail on the issue of whether the regulations directly advance the state interests.aple br.at.evidently,utah either conflates the central hudson test and the test for the issuance of a preliminary injunction,or assumes that the allocation of burdens within this part of the central hudson test will shift as a consequence of the case procedural posture.
utah cites no authority in support of the notion that the central hudson burden should shift away from the state,due to the procedural posture of this case.however,we note that in its recent decision in lorillard,the supreme court mentioned the procedural posture of that case in evaluating whether the state had met its evidentiary burden under th
