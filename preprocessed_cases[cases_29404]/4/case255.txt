appellants,water craft management llc,la boating centre water craft and its members douglas wayne glascock and nick martrain,sued appellee mercury marine alleging,inter alia,price discrimination in violation of sections a and of the clayton act,as amended by the act,a.following a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of mercury on their act claim we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
water craft was a mercury marine retail dealership selling mercury marine outboard motors in baton rouge,louisiana.it was founded on november,by its two members,nick martrain and douglas glascock,and went out of business roughly two years later,on december.water craft then filed this suit against one of its suppliers,mercury marine,for price in violation of sections a and of the clayton act,as amended by the act,a.section a provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce,in the course of such commerce,either directly or indirectly,to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce,or to injure,destroy,or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination,or with customers of either of them 
water craft alleges that mercury marine discriminated in favor of water craft largest competitor,travis boating center travis,by offering travis discounts on motors that far exceeded the discounts available to water craft or other mercury retail dealerships in the baton rouge market.mercury does not dispute the fact that travis got a better deal on motors than water craft,but mercury explains that it was forced to offer these lower prices to travis in order to compete with the outboard marine corporation omc one of mercury principal competitors.
before mercury began selling motors to travis,mercury was losing market share to omc in the gulf coast region because the travis chain,which until october of had a sales agreement with omc but not with mercury,was rapidly expanding,sometimes buying out mercury dealerships and converting them to travis retail stores which did not sell mercury products.during his testimony at trial,jeffery behan,a marketing research director at mercury,explained that mercury approached travis several times in an effort to sign them up,but was rebuffed because their prices were not competitive with omc.
with this explanation for its price discrimination,mercury invoked the meeting competition defense,an affirmative defense provided under section b of the act that permits a seller to rebut a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that his lower price was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor b 
the district court,after a bench trial,agreed that the meeting competition defense applies and entered judgment in favor of mercury,finding,inter alia that mercury has proved the required elements of the meeting competition defense by more than a preponderance of the evidence.water craft appeals from that judgment.
discussion 
water craft argues that the district court erred in applying the meeting competition defense for two reasons.first,in their brief to this court,water craft challenges the district court factual finding that mercury price discrimination was a good faith response to omc lower prices.second,in a theory not advanced until oral argument,water craft challenges the district court legal determination that the meeting competition defense applies even though mercury fell short of actually meeting omc low prices.
the standard of review for a bench trial is well established findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed de novo.in re towing,cir.clear error exists if the findings are without substantial evidence to support them,the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence,and although there is evidence which if credible would be substantial,the force and effect of the testimony,considered as a whole,convinces the court that the findings are so against the preponderance of credible testimony that they do not reflect or represent the truth and right of the case.moorhead mitsubishi aircraft int l,cir.reversal for clear error is warranted only if the court has a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.canal barge torco oil,cir.
we find water craft first argument unpersuasive and hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that mercury lower pricing to travis was made in a good faith attempt to meet omc prices.the act was passed in response to the rapid growth of chain stores,which,by exploiting the efficiencies of centralization,were able to threaten the existence of small,independent retailers.great atlantic pacific tea,d see also,sess.directing the federal trade commission to investigate and report to it on operators richard posner,the act calling the act the mark of the movement.however,congress did not seek by the act either to abolish competition or so radically to curtail it that a seller would have no substantial right of against a price raid by a competitor.standard oil ftc.to this end,as noted above,it is an absolute defense to liability under the act that the price discrimination is the result of price concessions made in good faith for the purpose of meeting the competitor price.falls city industries,vanco beverage,d federal trade commission sun oil company,d.
our focus,then,is on mercury motivation for discriminating,since a belief,rather than absolute certainty,that a price concession is being offered to meet an equally low price offered by a competitor is sufficient to satisfy the b defense.united states united states gypsum,d.furthermore,the court has emphasized that the concept of good faith,which is at the heart of the meeting competition defense,is flexible and pragmatic,not technical or doctrinaire.id.at.indeed,r igid rules and inflexible absolutes are especially inappropriate in dealing with the b defense the facts and circumstances of the particular case not abstract theories or remote conjectures,should govern its interpretation and application.id.
some guidelines,however,do emerge from the supreme court opinions.in united states gypsum,for example,the court sustained a meeting competition defense,holding that although casual reliance on uncorroborated reports of buyers or sales representatives without further investigation may not be sufficient to make the requisite showing of good faith,the defense can be satisfied by efforts falling short of interseller verification id.at.the court then identified certain indicia of good faith that are relevant to determining whether the meeting competition defense should apply among these are whether the seller had received reports of similar discounts from other customers whether the seller was threatened with a termination of purchases if the discount were not met whether the seller made e fforts to corroborate the reported discount by seeking documentary evidence or by appraising its reasonableness in terms of available market data and whether the seller had past experience with the particular buyer in question.united states gypsum.at.
the court applied this checklist one year later in great atlantic pacific tea,supra,holding that a seller,borden,was entitled to the meeting competition defense,and that the buyer,who faced derivative liability under the act for having demanded a discriminatorily low price,was also so entitled.in that case,after borden submitted its first bid to,a customer,the buyer responded,i have a competing bid in my pocket.you borden people are so far out of line it is not even funny.at.the buyer then warned borden that it was in danger of losing its business in the chicago area unless borden came up with a better offer.when borden asked for details about the competing offer,it was refused.even though borden eventual winning offer was actually below the competing offer,the court ruled that borden had adequately established its good faith.first,the court noted,the s
