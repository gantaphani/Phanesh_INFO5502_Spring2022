we set out each case in turn.
raychem misappropriations case.
in the,raychem,a delaware corporation engaged in the production of materials,began work on developing a device for controlling power surges.the work resulted in two layers of conductive foil surrounding a mixture of a nonconductive polymer and conductive carbon black.when current in the device becomes excessive,its lattice bonds break and stop the current on cooling,the lattice reforms and current automatically resumes.this simple and elegant device is known as a polymeric positive temperature coefficient device or pptc.in the,raychem became the first mass producer of pptcs.in,raychem licensed bourns,a california corporation engaged in distributing and manufacturing electronic components,to distribute pptcs in europe for a limited range of applications.
by,raychem had committed million to the development of its pptc business,but was uncertain as to how successful it would be.it commissioned its national sales manager for pptc business,steve hogge,to be the coleader of a team of fifteen technologists and marketing specialists to make a strategic analysis of its pptc business.the team drew on internal interviews with the company technologists and manufacturing people as well as with customers and outside technologists.the resulting plan,drafted by hogge,was classified by the company as confidential and was intended to influence its on nearly million worth of investment and to be used for further research allocations.on becoming an employee of raychem in,hogge had signed a contract agreeing to keep in confidence any proprietary information he received from the company.he had further agreed on termination of his employment to deliver to the company any company documents or data in his possession.
at the end of december,hogge left raychem.in violation of his contract with the company he took the strategic plan he had drafted and other proprietary information belonging to the company.his first plan was to develop his own company,but in march hogge approached bourns with a plan for marketing pptcs.parts of the plan were copied verbatim from raychem strategic plan even typographical errors were faithfully reproduced.gordon bourns,president of bourns,responded to hogge and met with him in april and then almost weekly in the period may through july.hogge agreed not to tell raychem of these conversations.by may,hogge was working on a pptc plan for bourns.by june,hogge was interviewing former and current raychem employees for jobs at bourns.bourns,which was negotiating for more licenses from raychem,denied to raychem that hogge was working for it.
in august,hogge,on the advice of lawyers for bourns,sent a letter to raychem untruthfully denying that he was aware of having received any sensitive information from raychem.hogge letter also denied that he had any raychem documents in his possession.at trial,hogge testified that this statement was truthful because he had burned the documents on august,two days after getting a letter from raychem inquiring about them.this testimony was contrary to hogge deposition testimony that he burned the documents after august,when he had received from raychem a copy of his exit interview there and had been reminded that he had promised to return all documents to the company.by his new agreement with bourns,hogge had the right to of the profit generated by bourns new pptc business,up to a cap of million on the total to be divided.
on october,bourns hired chan,a former employee of raychem,to supervise the technical work necessary for bourns to produce pptcs.a memo marked confidential and dated august,from hogge to bourns management had urged the speedy conclusion of an agreement with chan who was in a rather unique position to accomplish what we are asking based on his access to facilities,people and his training and experience cmc will be able to deliver to us a fully capable manufacturing cell for the pptc business first of all getting someone like cmc onboard for this project is critical to its success both in terms of the probability of developing the material,and time to market.chan went to work for bourns in hong kong.there he was joined by another employee,mike zhang.
as early as may,a plan drafted for bourns by hogge had recommended the acquisition of the basic pptc technology either through the acquisition of personnel or thermacon.raychem acquired thermacon in june,so only the first alternative remained.in september,the general manager of bourns presented a memorandum to the bourns board of directors stating the general approach to manufacturing development is to hire a sic former raychem employees in a consultant capacity to develop the formulations,compounding and initial manufacturing processes associated with core material.employing zhang,chan,and hogge,bourns carried out this plan.within months,bourns brought pptc products to market.
proceedings 
in december,raychem sued bourns in san mateo superior court for its actions in regard to raychem former employees,confidential information and trade secrets.this case was ultimately removed by bourns on the ground of diversity to federal district court and tried to a jury in january.the jury awarded raychem million compensatory damages against bourns and million in punitive damages,as well as million against hogge.the district court reduced the compensatory damages against bourns to million and against hogge to and the punitives to million.raychem accepted the remittitur.
bourns appeals.
jury instructions.bourns focuses on a jury instruction that read 
you may find misappropriation where it is inevitable that a former employee would use his or her former employer trade secrets in working for a competitor.thus,raychem or thermacon may support their claim of trade secret misappropriation by demonstrating that hogge,zhang or chan employment with bourns inevitably led them to rely on or disclose raychem or thermacon trade secrets.
in making this determination,you should consider whether the new employment is likely to result in the disclosure of a former employer trade secrets,or whether it would be impossible for an employee to perform his or her new job without using or disclosing those trade secrets.
bourns contends that the references to inevitable disclosure,to jury consideration of likelihood of disclosure,and to jury consideration of the impossibility of hogge,chan,and zhang not using trade secrets add up to an instruction contrary to california policy of permitting and even encouraging mobility among employees.it argues that the district court erred in referring to the inevitable disclosure doctrine in these cases because they allowed raychem to circumvent the requirement of showing an actual misappropriation of trade secrets.instead,they permitted the jury to rely on evidence that the jobs taken by former raychem employees at bourns were so similar that it would be impossible for an employee to perform his or her new job without using or disclosing those trade secrets.
bourns correctly asserts that no california court has adopted the inevitable disclosure doctrine.in fact,the only published california decision addressing the inevitable disclosure doctrine held that the inevitable disclosure doctrine can not be used as a substitute for proving actual or threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.whyte schlage lock,th,d.bourns further contends that,even if california had adopted the inevitable disclosure doctrine,it was error to apply the doctrine in a case in which damages,rather than injunctive relief,were sought.
we need not decide whether the california supreme court would adopt the inevitable disclosure doctrine nor whether the doctrine can properly be used to prove actual misappropriation in an action for damages because,even assuming that the instructions were erroneous,any error was harmless.a n error in instructing the jury in a civil case does not require reversal if it is more probably than not harmless.mangold cal.pub.util.comm n,cir quoting benigni city of hemet,cir.although some of the instructions suggest that proof of inevitable disclosure could replace proof of actual misappropriation,those instructions were embedded in instructions that qualified them and gave the law as bourns says it should have been given.
the jury was instructed that mere similarity between the jobs was not enough to support a finding of misappropriation.first the court instructed the jury that raychem must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence that bourns hogge have misappropriated raychem trade secret.then immediately preceding the instruction objected to,the court instructed 
an employee has a right,after the termination of his or her employment,to use general knowledge or skills or experience relating to a business and to use information that is not the property of his or her former employer.
immediately following the instruction to which bourns objects,the court instructed 
an employee has the right to accept employment in the field in which he or she is trained.simply because an employee works in a similar position for a competitor of his or her former employer does not by itself prove misappropriation of the former employer trade secrets.
the court went on to instruct 
matters of broad public knowledge or general knowledge in the industry can not constitute confidential information or trade secrets of raychem or thermacon it is not unlawful for a business to solicit the employee of a competitor,so long as one does not use unlawful means or engage in acts of unfair competition.
viewed in context,the instructions as a whole did not allow the jury to find actual misappropriation based on inevitable disclosure alone.taken together,the instructions indicate that,although the similarity of the positions at the two companies was some evidence of misappropriation,proof that trade secrets were actually disclosed or used by the employee was necessary for a verdict in raychem favor.any error in including the inevitable disclosure instruction was,more probably than not,harmless.
sufficiency of the evidence of misappropriation.
bourns moved for a directed verdict,then for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and now for reversal on the grounds that raychem did not identify the trade secrets with particularity and that what raychem claimed as trade secrets were in the public domain or made available to the public by being set out as teaching in raychem patents.each time bourns has had to meet a high legal standard to show without weighing the credibility of the witnesses there can be but one reasonable conclusion to the verdict.brady southern ry.in each instance raychem has disputed bourns factual assertions and offered witnesses,who,if believed,would prove its trade secrets to have been taken.we can not enter into this conflict of witnesses and,like the district court,we find that raychem described its secrets with sufficient specificity,the jury was properly instructed that public knowledge could not be a secret,and that there was ample evidence in the record supporting the jury conclusion.
sufficiency of the evidence of bourns interference with raychem contracts with hogge,chan,and zhang.
here again bourns tries for the third time to obtain a ruling in its favor as a matter of law where the evidence,to say the least,is in dispute.bourns did not deny that it was aware of the agreements the raychem employees had entered into with their employer to keep its information confidential.as the district court observed on the basis of the evidence at trial,bourns placed such employees in positions where it was virtually inevitable that they would use such knowledge and took virtually no precautions to ensure that such employee did not use protected information.bourns showed its awareness of its illegal conduct by covering up its use of the raychem information.this tort of interference with the employees contracts is distinct from bourns violation of the statutory trade secrets act.cal.civil code b.imax cinema technologies,cir.
raychem damages.bourns denies that raychem proved that it suffered million in damages.raychem replies by pointing to bourns enrichment by its torts.according to hogge,the burn rate,or development cost,on pptcs was million per year.according to credible evidence from the industry,bourns saved at least three years of development by its torts.as the district court found,this unjust enrichment is fairly recoverable by raychem.
emphasizing the egregiousness of bourns malfeasance,the district court awarded punitives of million against bourns or,in the alternative,exemplary damages under cal.civil code c in the same amount.bourns challenges this result by denying that raychem proved its claims for compensatory damages.we have already noted the failure of this argument.
hogge appeal.mutatis mutandis,hogge makes the same arguments on appeal as bourns.he fares no better.
for the reasons stated,the judgments of the district court in and are affirmed.
ii bourns antitrust case.
pptcs are used in a variety of products,including automobiles,batteries,computers,consumer electronics,industrial controls,and instruments of telecommunications.pptcs are not the only devices available to control excess current but,depending on price and supply,may be preferable in many contexts to competing methods such as fuses or ceramic positive temperature coefficients or bimetallics breakers.raychem used its patents to achieve a dominant position where pptcs were highly preferred.
beginning in with its role as a pptc distributor for raychem in europe,bourns contemplated the possibility of itself becoming a maker of pptcs.indeed,as bourns puts it in its brief,as early as bourns had proposed the marriage in which raychem contributed its technology with bourns to provide the manufacturing and marketing expertise.the proposal was not accepted.bourns took no steps to prepare to manufacture pptcs until sometime in.on december,its board approved a proposal to produce pptc with hogge leading the effort.
proceedings 
in,after raychem had brought its action for misappropriation and after discovery in connection with that litigation,bourns brought this suit against raychem in the district court.bourns first amended complaint charged raychem with a variety of acts violative of sections and of the sherman act and section of the clayton act.in the course of the proceedings,a number of these charges were eliminated by rulings of the district court that have not been appealed.the heart of bourns case remained raychem had prevented bourns from competing in the pptc business by threatened enforcement of its invalid patents.
the jury that heard the case returned a special verdict,stating that bourns had proved by clear and convincing evidence that raychem had acquired four specified patents by intentional fraud on the patent office and had threatened to enforce these patents against bourns and that raychem acquired or maintained monopoly power in a relevant market by these threats.to the question,identify the relevant market or relevant markets in which raychem willfully acquired or maintained monopoly power,the jury replied lithium batteries.to the question,on what date after may,did bourns first have the intent and preparedness to enter the business of making and selling pptc devices the jury answered december.the jury stated that the damages bourns suffered amounted to million.
raychem moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that bourns had established no antitrust injury after december,the date the jury had determined that it had antitrust standing as a potential competitor.the district court denied the motion,stating,here the jury could
