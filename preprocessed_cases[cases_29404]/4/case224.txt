this appeal presents the question of whether the allegations of the complaint in this case,which state ostensible violations of and of the telecommunications act of,stat.codified at et,state a claim of a monopolization violation of of the sherman act.
cavalier telephone,llc cavalier entered the local telecommunications service business pursuant to an interconnection agreement with verizon virginia,incorporated verizon,an incumbent provider of telecommunications services in central and northeastern virginia.the agreement made verizon lines and facilities available for use by cavalier,as mandated by the telecommunications act.problems in the implementation of the interconnection agreement,which cavalier contends were deliberately created by verizon to exclude cavalier as a competitor,prompted cavalier to file this action,alleging,among other things,that verizon monopolized or attempted to monopolize the relevant telecommunications market,in violation of of the sherman act.
the district court granted verizon motion to dismiss the antitrust claims under federal rule of civil procedure b,concluding that cavalier allegations merely represent violations of the telecommunications act dressed up in antitrust garb.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the facts for purposes of this appeal are those alleged in cavalier complaint,which we take to be true in deciding whether cavalier stated a claim under of the sherman act upon which relief can be granted.see.b estate constr.miller smith holding,cir.
cavalier,a corporation whose principal place of business is in richmond,virginia,was formed in to enter into the business of providing basic telecommunications services to customers in the richmond,tidewater,and northern virginia areas.cavalier defines basic telecommunications services to include traditional local telephone service,internet access,digital subscriber line dsl services,voice and data services,voice mail,access to services,and any other service that could be provided over copper wire and cable linking consumers with the office of a service provider.this portion of a copper wire or fiberoptic network that takes telecommunications services into individual homes and businesses is commonly referred to as the last mile of facilities.
until,the predecessor of verizon,a company also located in richmond,was the telecommunications franchisee in the richmond,tidewater,and northern virginia areas that had been regulated by the commonwealth of virginia as a natural monopoly.verizon owns the wire and cable facilities in its service area.
in,congress enacted the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act or the act to promote competition in local telecommunications markets.the act opens local telecommunications services to competition and requires existing telecommunications service providers,referred to in the act as incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,to enter into interconnection agreements that make their facilities available to new entrants in the market,often referred to as competing local exchange carriers clecs,such as cavalier.also in,virginia lifted its ban on competition in local telecommunications markets,authorizing the state corporation commission to grant certificates to applicants proposing to furnish local exchange telephone service in the service territory of another certificate holder.c.the virginia state corporation commission,however,retained continuing supervision over the services provided by existing and competing carriers.
acting under the authority of the telecommunications act,cavalier leased telecommunications facilities from verizon by entering into a comprehensive interconnection agreement with verizon predecessor dated january,that was approved by the virginia state corporation commission.the interconnection agreement states that verizon has undertaken to make such terms and conditions available to cavalier hereby only because of and,to the extent required by,section i of the telecommunications act,which required verizon to make interconnections,services,and network elements available to cavalier to the same extent as provided to another party through another interconnection agreement pursuant to the telecommunications act.through the interconnection agreement,verizon agreed to resell its telecommunications services to cavalier to lease and make available trunks to permit cavalier to interconnect with verizon operations to allow access to verizon network elements to participate in collocation,allowing cavalier to have a location in verizon central offices to house cavalier equipment to allow access to verizon equipment and to facilitate telephone number portability.the agreement also governed the process by which verizon was to bill cavalier and made provision for the resolution of disputes.
as enabled by the interconnection agreement,cavalier acquired customers in the richmond,tidewater,and northern virginia areas,and by the fall of,it provided services to customers over approximately telephone lines through its access to facilities owned by verizon.
shortly after the interconnection agreement was approved by the state corporation commission,problems in implementation of the agreement developed between cavalier and verizon.according to verizon,after july,cavalier did not pay one cent for those lines or for listing services that verizon has provided,and now owes verizon approximately million.verizon acknowledges that some of that amount was disputed but that over million was undisputed.it asserts that even with respect to the million amount due,cavalier president refused to allow any money to be paid to verizon because doing so would reduce cavalier leverage in negotiating with verizon.
but cavalier complaint filed in this case,which we must accept as true at this stage,describes a significantly different and larger problem that developed between the parties.
first,cavalier alleges that verizon erected obstacles to cavalier interconnection with verizon network by delaying the provision of trunks communication lines linking cavalier and verizon systems required for cavalier to compete and by not establishing adequate trunks to carry telephone traffic between cavalier customers and verizon customers.cavalier asserts that the inadequate trunking blocked between and of calls intended for cavalier customers and caused a complete outage for cavalier in northern virginia.
second,as to collocation,cavalier alleges that verizon used its control over the central office to raise cavalier costs,delay competition,and blockade entry.cavalier points to verizon initial decision to charge for a area for space preparation and its subsequent decision to charge only,an amount cavalier contends was still far higher than comparable charges for the same space preparation in states such as massachusetts and rhode island.cavalier also alleges that verizon delayed the provision of space,forc ing cavalier to wait over days for space in some verizon central offices,and that verizon charged noncompetitive prices and imposed arbitrary and unnecessarily complex and burdensome rules for collocation.
third,as to cavalier ability to order facilities and services from verizon,cavalier complains that verizon made the process of identifying and ordering facilities excessively lengthy,complex,and expensive.cavalier also alleges that verizon employees made misrepresentations to existing or potential customers of cavalier after cavalier requested customer service records from verizon.in addition,cavalier alleges that the methods verizon provided for ordering facilities were inferior,stating that they were either frequently slow or completely down for the entire day or did not function as well,or in the same manner as,the systems that verizon itself uses.
fourth,in the area of assignment of facilities,cavalier alleges that,when verizon assigned facilities to cavalier,it used systems and procedures that were intentionally flawed and unnecessarily complex,and expensive.for example,cavalier alleges that verizon database had inaccuracies that led verizon to refuse to connect facilities to a certain port that verizon said did not exist or was already being used by another customer,even when such was not the case.
fifth,as to verizon provision of its facilities,cavalier alleges that verizon used systems and procedures that were flawed,overly complex,and expensive.cavalier claims that verizon refuse d to provide cavalier with facilities on integrated digital loop carriers which serve d almost of verizon lines in virginia.integrated digital loop carriers were designed to eliminate steps in providing telecommunications services and thus yield significant savings in equipment and operations.cavalier contends that verizon explanation that provision of the facilities was not technically feasible was unsupportable,given that other companies provide access to such facilities.cavalier also claims that the facilities that verizon provided had a disproportionately high number of problems and that verizon also imposed costs on cavalier existing or potential customers through the premature disconnection of customers who unexpectedly los t telephone service in the process of switching to cavalier as their provider of basic telecommunications services.in addition,cavalier alleges harm from verizon intentionally costly approach to both directory assistance and directory publications.and cavalier complains that verizon rates were anticompetitive,stating that verizon proposed to offer facilities services at a price lower than cavalier retail cost for facilities,or at a price so low that cavalier could not profitably offer such services if forced to obtain facilities at retail cost.
sixth,cavalier complains that verizon imposed an unnecessarily complex,lengthy,and expensive process for cavalier to mount its fiber on verizon utility poles or to pull its fiber th r ough conduit systems owned by verizon,delaying cavalier network building as long as days.cavalier also complains that verizon was disingenuous when it claimed that cavalier requested process for using verizon spare fiberoptic cable was not technically feasible.cavalier alleges that when verizon did provide its spare cable,cavalier experienced problems in that verizon interrupted all service to cavalier northern virginia switch for a period of several hours.
and seventh,cavalier complains of verizon bills.cavalier alleges that verizon bills suffered from application of the wrong rate elements and with conditions imposed by the merger order between bell atlantic corporation and gte corporation forming verizon.cavalier complains that verizon billing burdened cavalier with voluminous paper bills that verizon refuse d to provide in electronic format,leaving cavalier unaware of how much it truly owe d and thus unable to plan its financing reliably,and serv ing as a pretense for verizon to deny and threaten to deny the continued provision of services.
the complaint asserts that verizon served approximately of the relevant,local telecommunications service in the richmond,tidewater,and northern virginia geographical that through the seven categories of activities alleged in the,verizon monopolized or attempted to monopolize the relevant market,in violation of of the sherman act and the analogous virginia statute 
verizon has attempted to,and has,maintained its monopoly power in the relevant product and geographic markets through a series of exclusionary acts,each of which is aimed at either reducing or eliminating cavalier ability to reach end users,or raising the costs to cavalier of competing with verizon.
the complaint also alleges that verizon activities violated the lanham act,the communications act of,the merger order between bell atlantic corporation and gte corporation forming verizon as approved by the fcc,and the uniform trade secrets act.it also alleges that verizon conduct amounted to tortious interference with contract,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,intentional or negligent misrepresentation,and breach of contract,all under virginia law.cavalier demanded million in treble damages,million in punitive damages,injunctive relief,and attorneys fees and costs.
shortly after commencing this action,cavalier filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction,which the district court denied.verizon then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rules of civil procedure b and b,which the district court granted by order dated march,relying on rule b to dismiss cavalier federal claims and rule b to dismiss its claims.in disposing of the claims asserted under the sherman act and the analogous virginia statute,the district court stated 
it is evident that cavalier is not asserting a monopolization claim under the sherman act,but rather is detailing alleged violations of duties imposed upon verizon by the telecommunications act.often the issue is not whether verizon is providing the facility or service as directed by the act,but whether verizon is providing the facility or service to cavalier in a manner that fits within the standard of reasonableness established by the act.regardless of whether such factual allegations have merit,they do not state a claim for monopolization.
from the district court order,cavalier filed this appeal,initially challenging all of the rulings made by the district court in dismissing the complaint.prior to oral argument,however,cavalier limited its appeal to the contention that its complaint states viable claims of monopolization and attempted monopolization under federal and state law,abandoning its appeal of all other issues.
cavalier contends that when the district court found that cavalier allegations amounted to ostensible violations of the telecommunications act of,it erred in failing to analyze whether the same allegations also stated claims under the sherman act,particularly when the court recognized that the antitrust claims were not precluded through any implied repeal of,or immunity from,the antitrust laws.cavalier challenges as error the district court conclusion that cavalier can not state a claim under of the sherman act if it alleges violations of affirmative duties created by the act.cavalier maintains to the contrary that even if conduct violates the telecommunications act,it can also violate of the sherman act 
i f verizon alleged conduct consisted of exclusionary acts sufficient to state a claim for violation of of the sherman act,and the telecommunications act also happens to regulate some or even all of that conduct,then that anticompetitive conduct would almost certainly also violate affirmative,duties under the act.
cavalier maintains that the district court,by failing to recognize this,improperly immunized verizon from antitrust liability based on the telecommunications act.when conducting the antitrust analysis,cavalier states that it met its burden by alleging a relevant market,anticompetitive conduct by verizon aimed at maintaining verizon monopoly of that relevant market,and anticompetitive effects that included driving or attempting to drive cavalier out of business and depriving consumers of lower prices,better services,and innovation.
verizon contends that the allegations of cavalier complaint set forth only complaints about verizon implementation of its regulatory duties to help cavalier,imposed by the telecommunications act.it asserts that without the act,cavalier could not demand such duties.verizon notes that under established antitrust principles,a lawful monopolist has no general duty to help its competitors,even though it can be prohibited from active,unjust impairment of a competitor efforts to challenge the monopoly.accordingly,it concludes that the duties set forth in the telecommunications act exist outside the parameters of antitrust law and that alleged breaches of those duties,while ostensibly constituting violations of the telecommunications act,do not constitute violations of the sherman act.
the requirements for alleging a monopolization claim are well known.section of the sherman act provides in relevant part 
every person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,shall be deemed guilty of a felony.
the clayton act makes this provision enforceable by any person injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.to state a monopolization claim under,a plaintiff must allege that the defendant possesses monopoly power in the relevant market and that the defendant willfully acquired or maintained that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.eastman kodak image technical,d quoting united states grinnell,d.conduct that merely has the consequence of shutting out competition does not rise to the level of anticompetitive behavior subject to antitrust liability the monopolist must have acted with the intent to prevent competitors from entering the market.see aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d noting that intent is a necessary element of claims under otter tail power united states,d use of monopoly power to destroy threatened competition is a violation of the attempt to monopolize clause of of the sherman act.
cavalier complaint,contending that verizon,as a monopolist,deliberately attempted to exclude cavalier from the relevant market,does conclusorily allege all of the required elements of a monopolization claim under of the sherman act.but the breaches of duties on which those allegations depend and which the complaint attributes to verizon require us to determine,by looking at the complaint in its entirety,whether the complaint allegations advance a legal theory on which antitrust relief can be granted.see.b goldwasser ameritech,cir.
both parties recognize that cavalier allegations state breaches of duties imposed by the telecommunications act and by the interconnection agreement.that act required verizon to surrender its theretofore legal monopoly and to lease its facilities to carriers such as cavalier who wished to compete in the market.accordingly,cavalier entered into competition with verizon by entering into an interconnection agreement with it as mandated by the telecommunications act.all of the untoward conduct attributed to verizon in the complaint arises from duties imposed on verizon by the telecommunications act.thus,for example,cavalier alleges that verizon delayed the provision of trunk lines,provided inadequate trunk lines,charged cavalier too much for collocation,delayed the provision of collocation space and made collocation arrangements unnecessarily complex,made procedures for obtaining facilities overly complex,which delayed cavalier access to such facilities,provided inferior facilities,delayed cavalier network building,and submitted overly complex and even erroneous bills to cavalier.all of these alleged failures are failures in the performance of duties set forth in the interconnection agreement,and,as that agreement provides,verizon would not have entered into such an agreement except as required by the telecommunications act.
cavalier alleges that the motives behind verizon breaches of its duties under the act were to exclude cavalier as a competitor and to preserve the monopoly that verizon had enjoyed before,in violation of the sherman act.to determine whether these allegations are sufficient to state an antitrust claim,it is necessary to review the role and scope of the telecommunications act and its special relationship to the sherman act.
the telecommunications act amended the communications act of,ch,stat.codified at et.even before the enactment of the communications act of,verizon ancestor,the american telephone and telegraph company at t,operated as a natural monopoly.by,at t owned of the local telephone lines and services in the united states.goldwasser,at.when congress passed the communications act in,it established the federal communications commission fcc and imposed a scheme that divided regulation of at t and others on the basis of intrastate and interstate services.the communications act vested the fcc with authority previously exercised by the interstate commerce commission over interstate matters and left intrastate matters to state public utility commissions.granting the fcc authority to regulate interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio but preventing it from regulating intrastate communication service see also bell atlantic,mci worldcom,cir,vacated on other grounds sub nom.verizon,pub.serv.comm n,d.the communications act,however,did not break up the natural monopoly held by at t through its bell system.rather,it regulated at t in its interstate services by requiring it to provide services at just and reasonable rates.the act permitted duplication of services and competition only when public convenience and necessity require d it.id.a.
following a lawsuit commenced by the united states against at t,which alleged that at t violated the antitrust laws,judge harold greene of the united states district court for the district of columbia approved a settlement in through a consent decree that broke up at t and required it to divest itself of,among other things,the bell operating companies that were providing local services.united states.by then,at t had become the largest corporation in the world by any reckoning.id.at.under the consent decree,service or interstate service was opened up to competition,but local service remained in the hands of regional bell operating companies subject to regulation as natural monopolies by state utility commissions.
the government suit against at t was legitimized by judge greene rulings that anticompetitive conduct attributed to at t in both interstate and local markets was not immunized or protected by either the communications act of or by state law except to the extent that those laws expressly authorized and pervasively regulated the anticompetitive conduct.see id.at united states.finding nothing to that effect in either the communications act or state law as to at t interstate conduct,judge greene permitted the government to proceed on its sherman act claims against at t.but the companies,including verizon,that were spun off as the product of at t were permitted to continue to operate in local markets under monopoly franchises conferred by state utility commissions,and they were not subject to the antitrust laws regarding their regulated conduct.
that all changed with the enactment of the telecommunications act of and with virginia repeal of its monopoly grant to verizon earlier the same year.with the passage of the telecommunications act,congress made markets open to competition as had been the case for services pursuant to the at t consent decree.the stated purpose of the act was to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.telecommunications act of,stat.congress sought to provide for a,national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies and services to all americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition.conf,at conf,at emphasis added.
to further its goal,the telecommunications act imposes duties on incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs to provide access to their facilities and equipment to competing carriers.more particularly,in a and b,the act imposes on every telecommunications carrier an affirmative duty to interconnect with other carriers,to follow stated rules regarding resale,and to provide nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers and operator services,telephone poles,ducts,conduits,and.id.a,b.under c,the incumbent local exchange carrier bears additional duties,including the duty to negotiate interconnection agreements with any new carrier so requesting,to provide access to its network elements on an unbundled basis,to offer its retail telecommunications services for resale at wholesale rates,and to provide for collocation.id.c.section governs negotiation and arbitration of interconnection agreements.id.agreements voluntarily made may be entered into without regard to the specific duties imposed by b and c.section identifies the procedure for agreements reached through mandatory arbitration,which are not exempted from the requirements outlined in.in short,and of the act imposed commands on incumbent local exchange carriers to interconnect with and assist new that telecommunications carriers did not previously have and would not have had under a regime.within two years after the act enactment,approximately agreements were reached under.see united states telephone association,competition in the local loop,at http.
through the telecommunications act,congress also substantially altered oversight responsibility previously exercised by the fcc and by state commissions.compared to its authority under the communications act of,the fcc was given a much stronger role under the act in regulating the telecommunications industry.its new role also released the district of columbia district court from oversight responsibilities under the consent decree.and although states continue to play an important role in local markets,the fcc has the responsibility of coordinating the national telecommunications market and thus is given the authority to control a significant part of the telecommunications scheme.in furtherance of the new role of the fcc,the telecommunications act granted the fcc authority,after notice and comment,to preempt the laws of any states that prohibited competition in local telecommunications services markets,bringing under federal control much of the transition from regulated local monopolies to industry.see d.
thus,although deregulatory in tone,the act is nonetheless still regulatory in effect.peter huber et,federal telecommunications law ed.congress broadly extended its law into the field of intrastate telecommunications,even though in a few areas such as interconnection agreements,it left control with state regulatory commissions rather than subjecting the field to complete federal control or releasing the industry to the invisible hand of the free market.iowa utils,d.although the act removed pillars of traditional regulation associated with protected monopolies,the act imposes other requirements some pages of impenetrably dense and convoluted prose to transition the industry from monopolies to competition.see huber et,supra,at.the sheer volume of regulation has increased dramatically,placing the industry at the mark of regulation.id.at.
consistent with its purpose and with the findings made by judge greene about the applicability of the antitrust laws to,the telecommunications act provides that telecommunications companies continue to be subject to the antitrust laws 
n othing in this act or the amendments made by this act,shall be construed to modify,impair,or supersede the applicability of any of the antitrust laws.
b,stat.at codified at note.in a similar vein,the general savings clause states that this act and the amendments made by this act shall not be construed to modify,impair,or supersede federal,state,or local law unless expressly so provided in such act or amendments.id.c.consistent with these provisions,the fcc explained in adopting regulations implementing and of the act that nothing in sections or or our implementing regulations is intended to limit the ability of persons to seek relief under the antitrust laws,other statutes,or common law.in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,at.
the parties to this case do not dispute the general principle that they are subject both to the regulation of the telecommunications act and to the applicable principles of existing antitrust laws.see law offices of curtis trinko,bell atlantic,cir the savings clause unambiguously establishes that there is no plain repugnancy between the telecommunications act and the antitrust statutes,cert.granted,d,covad communications bellsouth,cir it is clear that plain repugnancy can not be found between the act and the antitrust laws in view of the act express language reserving the applicability of the antitrust laws goldwasser ameritech,cir our principal holding is thus not that the act confers implied immunity on behavior that would otherwise violate the antitrust law.such a conclusion would be troublesome at best given the antitrust savings clause in the statute.but simply noting the conclusion that companies subject to regulation under the telecommunications act are not thereby immunized from the antitrust laws does not address the special relationship between the laws that is necessary to understand in order to resolve the issue presented in this the particular allegations in cavalier complaint state a monopolization claim when that claim is based on duties imposed by the telecommunications act.stated otherwise,while the provisions of the telecommunications act do not limit the applicability of the antitrust laws to verizon,we must still determine whether violations of and of the telecommunications act as alleged in the complaint before us support a claim under the antitrust laws.
we begin the analysis by noting that the process for fostering competition changed dramatically with the enactment of the telecommunications act.we observe that even though the antitrust laws applicability is preserved and their purpose of promoting competition is similar to the telecommunications act purpose of creating competition in local telecommunications markets,congress adopted independent methods for giving effect to the two laws purposes,and the difference in those methods is material to reaching the appropriate disposition of this case.
when enacting the telecommunications act,congress could well have elected to rely only on the antitrust laws to create competition in local telecommunications markets by simply implementing the supremacy clause to preempt state laws that granted exclusive franchises in local markets.but foreseeing the inefficiency of that approach,congress opted to take the proactive approach of creating new duties under the telecommunications act.by and accelerating the creation of competition in the local markets through enactment of and of the telecommunications act,congress imposed more dramatic obligations on the local monopolies than would have been imposed simply by subjecting them to preexisting antitrust liability.this was necessary because the antitrust laws alone do not require legitimate monopolies to give up their monopolies or to help competitors.even under the essential facilities doctrine applied in otter tail,d,a legal monopoly can not be forced to get into a business it was not traditionally in simply to respond favorably to a new competitor demand for use of its facilities.in otter tail,the utility was in the business of wheeling power and selling electricity at wholesale,and its refusal to engage in such business with municipalities that posed a competitive threat to the utility was found to be an improper maintenance of monopoly power.id.at.but if a company such as verizon,which was a longstanding legal monopoly,were asked to share its office space and to rent its telephone lines and other facilities to a competitor when it was not already in the business of renting office space,lines,or facilities,it could have legally refused the request to expand into such a business without violating of the sherman act.see goldwasser,at these are precisely the kinds of affirmative duties to help one competitors that we have already noted do not exist under unadorned antitrust laws abcor am int l,cir observing that a lawful monopolist generally has no duty to help its competitors.
once it is recognized that the creation of competition in local markets through enforcement of the antitrust laws could be slow and inefficient,then congress adoption of the telecommunications act as a parallel but distinctly different approach to and accelerate competition can be understood.as a leading backer of the telecommunications act in the senate stated,the enactment of the telecommunications act is kind of almost a this legislation says you will not control much of anything.you will have to allow for nondiscriminatory access on an unbundled basis to the network functions and services of the bell operating companies network that is at least equal in type,quality,and price to the access a bell operating company affords to itself.verizon communications,fcc,d quoting the remarks of senator breaux,cong.rec.see also goldwasser,at i n an effort to the development of competitive local markets,congress imposed a host of special duties on incumbent local exchange carriers.and similarly,the conference reports explained that enactment of the telecommunications act was intended to accelerate competition in local markets.see conf,at conf,at.
in furtherance of its intent to or accelerate competition in local markets through means independent of the antitrust laws,congress enacted and of the telecommunications act to impose entirely new duties,which were in addition to the duties imposed by of the sherman act.see verizon communications,at.the wholesale market for leasing network elements is something brand new under the telecommunications act.under and of the telecommunications act,an incumbent telecommunications carrier must assist a competitor entry into the market by entering into an interconnection agreement,reselling service,and making facilities available.see c verizon communications,at.these obligations exceed the duties imposed by the antitrust laws,and failure to fulfill them would not have supplied the foundations of a monopoly claim.see goldwasser,at a complaint like this one,which takes the form x is a monopolist x did help its competitors enter the market so that they could challenge its monopoly the prices i must pay x are therefore still too high does not state a claim under section.moreover,even though duties imposed by law might serve to support a monopoly claim where the duties were violated with anticompetitive intent,we conclude,as explained below,that the special,indeed idiosyncratic,relationship between the telecommunications act and the sherman act prevents the sherman act from taking on the role of enforcing duties imposed for the first time by the telecommunications act.
that it was congress design to rely on the telecommunications act and the sherman act enforced independently is revealed in two ways.first,the telecommunications act stated explicitly that even though antitrust laws would remain applicable,the telecommunications act was not altering preexisting antitrust laws.see b,stat.at n othing in this act shall be construed to modify,impair,or supersede the applicability of any of the antitrust laws emphasis added.this may be understood to mean that just as congress did not intend that the telecommunications act would immunize conduct illegal under the antitrust laws,it also did not intend to have the duties imposed by the telecommunications act modify or expand the scope of the sherman act.legislative history confirms this concept that the telecommunications act was intended to preserve the role of the antitrust laws as they stood at the time of the act enactment.see,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of pressler this bill does not affect our antitrust laws.the antitrust laws stay in place cong.rec.daily ed.june,statement of hollings section of the sherman antitrust act is untouched,absolutely untouched cong.rec.daily ed.june,statement of breaux no one can say that this bill somehow guts the department of justice role in enforcing antitrust laws,because it makes no changes in that.thus,it appears that congress wished to have both acts further competition in local telecommunications services markets through independent means.stated otherwise,congress intended that even as it imposed new duties through enactment of the telecommunications act that would fall outside the parameters of the antitrust laws,it intended that the duties imposed by the antitrust laws would be left untouched.
second,the procedures and remedies used to enforce each law are distinct.the telecommunications act provides for state regulatory commission approval of interconnection agreements and ongoing supervision of the obligations imposed by the agreements.see bell atlantic,at.if congress did not intend to rely on those procedures independently,it would not have inserted the entirely new scheme of and.it would have simply relied on the antitrust laws enforcement in federal district courts under the clayton act,which authorizes treble damages and attorneys fees to private litigants.see.instead,in enacting the telecommunications act,congress was imposing new duties precisely focused to break up local monopolies,and its selection of duties,coupled with the remedial procedures of the telecommunications act,was to be in addition to duties imposed and remedies afforded by the sherman act.see goldwasser,at the act in fact has an elaborate enforcement structure that congress created for purposes of managing the transition from the former regulated world to the competitive markets of the future.
we must remain clear,however,that even as we conclude that the telecommunications act and the sherman act impose independently enforceable duties,we do not conclude that every complaint that states violations of and of the telecommunications act can not for that reason alone also state a claim for violations of the sherman act.in circumstances where facts state a claim under both statutes construed independently of each other,they may give rise to relief under each act.
moreover,our rationale should not be taken so broadly as to preclude a monopolization claim built on conduct made illegal by statutes other than the telecommunications act.rather,we conclude only that a natural monopolist legal refusal to deal is not made an illegal refusal to deal under the antitrust laws when congress requires the monopolist to deal with competitors through duties imposed by the telecommunications act.the special relationship between the telecommunications act and the antitrust laws,acting in parallel but through distinct schemes to promote the general goal of competition,supports this conclusion.
were we to conclude otherwise,every violation of and of the telecommunications act could be asserted as a violation of the sherman act merely by alleging that the conduct was undertaken with an intent to monopolize,and the intent element would be supplied by noting that the defendant simply resisted compliance with the telecommunications act,which is aimed at breaking up monopolies.in such a case,the procedures and remedies specified by congress for violations of the telecommunications act would become subservient to,indeed overrun by,the sherman act.this result would be directly contrary to congress choice of furthering competition through newly crafted affirmative duties and procedures,which were in addition to and beyond the duties imposed under of the sherman act.enforcement under the sherman act would effectively collapse enforcement of the telecommunications act,leaving only one effective suit.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that the sherman act continues to apply in its own traditional domain,applying as it did before the telecommunications act,and the telecommunications act imposes new duties that may be enforced in accordance with its own provisions but not under the sherman act unless the conduct otherwise would have supported a claim under the sherman act absent the authority of the telecommunications act.see goldwasser,at.but see trinko,at permitting antitrust claims to proceed by applying general antitrust principles covad,at same.
thus,when we focus on the conduct alleged by cavalier in the complaint before us to determine whether it amounts to breaches of duties imposed for the first time and only by the telecommunications act,we conclude that the conduct alleged would not,independent of the telecommunications act,violate duties imposed under the sherman act.when virginia lifted its ban on competition in the local telecommunications industry,verizon would not have been obligated to rent its facilities and provide access to its elements to competitors to enable them to enter the market,and a complaint that alleges that it had a duty to do so under the antitrust laws would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.although the telecommunications act did impose these obligations on verizon,cavalier recourse is to the
