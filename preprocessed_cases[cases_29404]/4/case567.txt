the telecommunications act of prohibits bell operating companies,known as baby bells,from discriminating in favor of their affiliates in the provision of services.responding to a complaint filed by at t,the federal communications commission found that one of the baby bells,bellsouth telecommunications,violated the act by creating a volume discount plan that,though facially neutral,favored small and growing companies such as its own affiliate.because we find the commission explanation for its action wanting,we vacate and remand.
this case concerns the market for what are known as special access services.providers of special access,such as petitioner bellsouth telecommunications,offer their customers a dedicated connection between two points.see worldcom fcc,describing special access services.purchasers of special access are typically retailers and internet service providers,as well as other companies that connect local customers to broader networks.
in,bellsouth created the transport savings plan tsp,which gave its customers the option of earning price discounts in exchange for committing to purchase certain volumes of services for no less than five years.the tsp offered discounts on a tiered schedule,increasing with the number of years the customer had spent in the plan and with the customer committed volume level.five years into the tsp,purchasers committing to at least million of annual services received a discount,those committing to million received,those committing to million received,those committing to million received,and those committing to million received.according to bellsouth,it chose this discount structure in order to provide meaningful discounts to its entire eligible customer base,including small customers,which comprised a growing segment of its market.
as a condition of receiving these discounts,bellsouth required customers to commit for five years to purchase each year no less than of what they purchased on an annualized basis in the six months preceding their subscription to the plan.the tsp left customers seeking greater discounts free to increase their volume commitments,but at the time the commission ruled on decision at issue tsp prohibited them from lowering their committed volume levels without permanently leaving the plan.customers withdrawing early were liable for termination charges and those failing to meet their commitments were liable for shortfall charges.at the end of five years,bellsouth customers retained the option of extending their discounts year by year at the same committed volume level and at the same discount.bellsouth explains that it adopted the commitment requirement to maintain lasting and stable rates of utilization on its objective that,according to bellsouth,is critical for companies like it that have high fixed costs and low marginal costs.
by,the tsp had attracted thirteen subscribers three at the lowest committed volume level,six at the next lowest level,two at the million level,one at the million level,and one at the million level.entering the tsp the day it debuted,at t committed to the minimum of of past purchases.in the third year of the plan,at t,seeking greater discounts,voluntarily increased its committed volume level to the next highest tsp revenue band.in so doing,at t committed itself to just under of its purchases at that time,or of its annualized purchases in the six months before entering the tsp.at t presumably made this choice expecting continued growth in demand,but after another year of solid growth in,the company began feeling the effects of a market downturn.by,at t headroom the margin between its committed volume level and its actual volume shrunk to single digits in percentage terms,limiting at t flexibility to move its traffic between carriers and increasing the risk of shortfall penalties.
in that year,at t filed a complaint with the federal communications commission seeking to invalidate the tsp on the ground that the plan unlawfully discriminated in favor of bellsouth affiliate,bellsouth long distance.bellsouth created bellsouth long distance in and over the next two years applied unsuccessfully to the commission to secure operational authority for it.see d requiring that bell operating companies apply to the fcc for affiliate operational authority.not until,three years into the tsp,did bellsouth finally obtain operational authority for bellsouth long distance.although the affiliate grew rapidly,it remained a relatively small purchaser of special access services,occupying the second lowest band of the discount structure ranging from million to million and capturing less than of the total discounts over the life of the tsp.
in its complaint,at t alleged,among other things,that bellsouth had violated c and e.section c provides that bell operating companies may not discriminate between its affiliate and any other entity in the provision or procurement of goods,services,facilities,and information,or in the establishment of standards.section e has a narrower scope,providing that a bell operating company shall charge its affiliate an amount for access to its telephone exchange service and exchange access that is no less than the amount charged to any unaffiliated interexchange carriers for such service.under the statute sunset provision,section c ceases to apply to a bell operating company three years after its affiliate has been authorized to provide services section e,however,remains in force.f.
treating sections c and e as interchangeable,the commission split its inquiry in two,ruling that the tsp discount structure and the commitment requirement each independently violate section.bellsouth now petitions for review,finding fault with both rulings.in the meantime,bellsouth and at t have agreed to merge and now await regulatory approval.approval of the merger would not moot this case because the commission has ordered bellsouth to terminate the tsp with respect to all customers,not just at t.in the matter of at t bellsouth,fcc rcd,hereinafter fcc order.we review the commission decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard,affirming if the commission considered the relevant factors and articulate d a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.earthlink,fcc,citation omitted.
underlying its approach to both the discount structure and the commitment requirement is the commission construction of section construction that has two key elements.first,drawing on its own precedent,the commission decided that a facially neutral plan offered by a bell operating company may violate section bar on discrimination when such a plan is in fact tailored to its affiliate specific size,expansion plans,or other needs.fcc order at quoting safeguards order,fcc rcd.second,the commission concluded that a bell operating company may violate section even absent a showing of discriminatory intent so long as its action discriminates in effect.fcc order at.based on this reading,the commission declared itself free to disregard evidence tending to show that bellsouth lacked discriminatory intent when it created the tsp.such evidence included the fact that bellsouth initiated the tsp three years before its affiliate obtained operational authority and that when bellsouth long distance entered the tsp it received a minuscule portion of the plan overall discounts.
bellsouth hinted both in its brief and at oral argument that the commission interpretation of the statute may be unreasonable.indeed,to defend its reading against a more frontal challenge than the one presented here,the commission would have had to explain why the benefits of reading section as broadly as it has done justify the inefficiencies that may result from frustrating bell operating companies attempts to maintain stable utilization rates on their networks or to lower their prices.nevertheless,we need not consider that issue because,even assuming the commission correctly interpreted the statute,neither of its conclusions applying that interpretation withstand arbitrary and capricious review.
