background 
the forests west of the cascade mountains in oregon and washington contain sufficient hardwood to support the only concentration of hardwood sawmills in the western united states.these mills are part of what is often called the alder industry after the area predominant hardwood species,which accounts for of the annual pacific northwest hardwood lumber production.the three principal players in the alder portion of the hardwood industry are timberland owners and loggers who supply alder sawlogs production facilities,including sawmills,that buy sawlogs and process them into finished alder lumber and purchasers who buy hardwood lumber from production facilities.both parties in this case fall under the second category they operate sawmills.
the,hardwood lumber company,was a pioneer in the alder lumber business,starting in.it operated its mill in longview,washington continuously until it went out of business in.from to,experienced modest prosperity,but from to,its production declined.from to,sawlog prices increased while finished lumber prices decreased.this was unusual historically,the price of alder sawlogs fluctuated with the price of finished lumber.because its materials costs went up and its production went down,incurred losses totaling nearly million,forcing it to shut down in.blamed its failure on weyerhaeuser.
the,weyerhaeuser company,was established in.in,it acquired northwest hardwoods,also weyerhaeuser,and now owns six hardwood sawmills in the pacific northwest.weyerhaeuser is one of the largest manufacturers of hardwood lumber in the world.from to,the period in which profits dropped,weyerhaeuser share of the pacific northwest market for alder sawlogs was approximately.
alleged that weyerhaeuser artificially increased sawlog prices to drive and other competitors out of business.at trial,offered testimony and other evidence to prove that weyerhaeuser attempted to eliminate competitors by driving up sawlog prices and restricting access to sawlogs through predatory overbidding,paying a higher price for sawlogs than necessary overbuying,buying more sawlogs than it needed entering restrictive or exclusive agreements with sawlog suppliers and making misrepresentations to state officials in order to obtain sawlogs from state forests.weyerhaeuser attributed failure to substandard equipment,inefficient operations,poor management,and inadequate capital investment.
the court instructed the jury on the applicable law,including the elements of both monopoly and attempted monopoly,the law regarding anticompetitive conduct in the form of predatory overbidding,and the issue of damages.with respect to overbidding,the court instructed the jury that,if it found that weyerhaeuser paid higher prices than necessary for sawlogs,the jury could regard that as an anticompetitive act.the jury found for on both the monopolization and attempted monopolization claims,and awarded damages of.after trebling the damages award,the court entered judgment in the amount of against weyerhaeuser.the court then denied weyerhaeuser motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial,and awarded attorneys fees and costs to.
weyerhaeuser appeals the judgment,arguing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it had no market power in the alder sawlog market and the alleged anticompetitive acts were not actionable under of the sherman act,it is entitled,in the alternative,to a new trial because the jury instructions misstated the law of predatory overbidding,and it is entitled to reversal of the judgment because damages theory was speculative.weyerhaeuser also appeals the court grant of attorneys fees and costs to so that any reversal of the judgment or remand for a new trial would also result in reversal of the award of attorneys fees and costs.
ii.analysis 
weyerhaeuser challenges to the court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial present us with a legal question of first impression whether the prerequisites set forth in brooke group brown williamson tobacco for establishing liability in predatory pricing cases apply in cases where a defendant engages in predatory bidding by raising the cost of inputs.we address this legal issue at the outset,applying a de novo standard of review for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that brooke group does not control in the predatory bidding context at issue here.
our conclusion that brooke group does not apply here disposes of weyerhaeuser challenge regarding a new trial due to erroneous jury instructions in its entirety.the court properly instructed the jury regarding predatory overbidding.our holding that brooke group is inapplicable also partially resolves weyerhaeuser challenge regarding judgment as a matter of law.because weyerhaeuser further contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict,we must examine that contention,however.after doing so,we conclude that substantial evidence did support the jury finding of attempted monopolization.thus,we affirm the court denial of weyerhaeuser motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.
two issues remain unresolved after we address the issue related to brooke group.they are damages,and attorneys fees and costs.we resolve them as follows.first,we uphold the jury award of damages because it was based upon an appropriate estimate of damages.second,we conclude that the court properly granted attorneys fees and costs in favor of.accordingly,we affirm.
issues related to brooke group 
inapplicability of brooke group 
monopoly power exercised on the of the market is called monopsony power,and can violate of the sherman act both sides of the market affect allocative efficiency,and hence consumer welfare antitrust laws are thus concerned with competition on the of the market as much as on the of the market 
weyerhaeuser argues that,regardless of whether a case involves predatory pricing or predatory bidding,the same standard of liability should apply.weyerhaeuser invites the court to borrow the standard of liability set forth in brooke group,a predatory pricing case.in brooke group,the court created a high standard of liability,holding that a plaintiff bringing a claim under of the sherman act based on predatory pricing must show that the prices complained of are below an appropriate measure of its rival costs,and a dangerous probability existed that the rival would later recoup its investment in prices once it stopped such pricing thus,to establish liability under brooke group,a plaintiff had to show that its competitor operated at a loss and was likely to recoup its losses.weyerhaeuser contends that the same standard should apply in predatory bidding cases.specifically,weyerhaeuser argues that the jury instructions were erroneous because the court did not instruct the jury that overbidding for sawlogs could be anticompetitive conduct only if weyerhaeuser operated at a loss and a dangerous probability of its recoupment of losses existed similarly,weyerhaeuser argues that,as a matter of law the alleged predatory overbidding was not actionable anticompetitive conduct under the sherman act because did not satisfy the two brooke group requirements.we reject weyerhaeuser arguments regarding the applicability of brooke group.
the brooke group court established a high liability standard for predatory pricing cases because of its concern with the facts that consumers benefit from lower prices and that cutting prices often fosters competition the court stated that l ow prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set,and so long as they are above predatory levels,they do not threaten competition.the court further recognized that pricing is either competition on the merits,or is beyond the practical ability of a judicial tribunal to control without courting intolerable risks of chilling legitimate.as a result,the court did not want to make the standard of liability so low that antitrust suits themselves became a tool for keeping prices high.
we recognize that in predatory bidding cases,as in predatory pricing cases,the price level itself is the anticompetitive weapon.however,an important factor distinguishes predatory bidding cases from predatory pricing cases benefit to consumers and stimulation of competition do not necessarily result from predatory bidding the way they do from predatory pricing we turn now to the and effects of predatory bidding.
in a predatory bidding scheme,a firm pays more for materials in the short term,and thereby attempts to squeeze out those competitors who can not remain profitable when the price of inputs increases no consumer benefit results during this predation period if the firm raises or maintains the same price level for its finished products.although consumers might temporarily benefit if a firm lowered prices during the predation period,a reduction in prices would place even greater pressure on competitors,thereby increasing the threat to competition arising from the predatory bidding thus,even though a benefit to consumers might occur in some predatory bidding situations,serious concerns about the threat to competition would concurrently arise in those situations.moreover,predatory bidding claims do not directly challenge a firm decision to cut prices instead,they focus on a firm decision to raise the cost of inputs.therefore,the concerns the brooke group court expressed about depriving consumers of the temporary benefit of low prices do not necessarily apply when predatory bidding is at issue 
in the long run,to carry out a predatory bidding scheme successfully,a firm would have to recoup the higher costs it had paid for its materials.if it succeeded in driving out competition,during this recoupment period the firm would likely pay less for its materials while charging consumers a higher price the firm would have little incentive to pass on the benefit of lower input prices to consumers when it possessed greater market power and needed to recoup the higher costs it had paid for its materials.thus,the overall effect of a predatory bidding scheme would result in harm to consumers 
although in some situations rising input prices might encourage new companies to enter the supply side of the market and expand output,thereby increasing innovation and efficiency so that consumers benefit in the long run through price decreases and product improvements,this is not such a situation.the nature of the input supply at issue here does not readily allow for market expansion.the evidence shows that,during the alleged predation period,the supply of alder sawlogs remained relatively stable or declined.nothing suggests this situation will sawlogs are a natural resource of limited annual supply in a relatively inelastic market.thus,at least in this case,predatory bidding is less likely than predatory pricing to result in a benefit to consumers or the stimulation of competition.as a result,the concerns that led the brooke group court to establish a high standard of liability in the predatory pricing context do not carry over to this predatory bidding context with the same force.therefore,the standard for liability in this predatory bidding case need not be as high as in predatory pricing cases.accordingly,we hold that the high standard of liability in brooke group does not apply here because this case involves predatory bidding in a relatively inelastic market,not predatory pricing.
our decision in reid.logging ketchikan pulp provides further support for our holding today that the prerequisites in brooke group do not apply here.although the supreme court decided brooke group after we decided reid brooke group involved a different factual situation and did not overrule reid in reid,we affirmed a finding of liability under of the sherman act that was based in part on a predatory buying claim the plaintiff in reid argued that the defendants conspired to bid preclusively on timber sales at higher prices than necessary to block the plaintiff from buying necessary timber the defendants argued that the district court erred by finding predatory bidding when there was no evidence that the high prices paid for timber would prevent the defendants from covering their marginal costs on the ultimate sale of the processed timber we rejected the defendants argument and held that such a blind application of a numerical test would only frustrate the intent of the sherman act.this statement that a rigid,numerical test should not apply when a overbidding scheme was at issue further supports our holding that brooke group is inapplicable here.thus,our conclusion that brooke group does not apply is consistent with our precedent.we now turn to the effect our conclusion has on weyerhaeuser arguments for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law.
we generally review a court ruling on a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion however,because weyerhaeuser motion for a new trial rested solely on the ground that the jury instructions misstated the law regarding overbidding claim,we review the court denial of the motion for a new trial de novo because we hold today that brooke group does not govern in this case,the court did not need to instruct the jury that overbidding for sawlogs could be anticompetitive conduct only if weyerhaeuser operated at a loss and a dangerous probability of weyerhaeuser recoupment of its losses existed.the instructions as a whole provided sufficient guidance regarding how to determine whether conduct was anticompetitive 
moreover,the instructions were consistent with supreme court precedent stating that a defendant violates the sherman act by using monopoly power to foreclose competition,to gain a competitive advantage,or to destroy a competitor.thus,the jury instructions fairly and adequately cover ed the issues presented,correctly state d the law,and we re not misleading.accordingly,we affirm the court denial of weyerhaeuser motion for a new trial.
judgment as a matter of law 
we review the district court denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.our holding regarding the inapplicability of brooke group resolves one of the issues related to weyerhaeuser challenge to the denial of judgment as a matter of law weyerhaeuser contention that,as a matter of law,the alleged predatory overbidding could not be actionable anticompetitive conduct under of the sherman act because did not show that weyerhaeuser operated at a loss and that a dangerous probability of weyerhaeuser recoupment of its losses existed.because brooke group does not apply in this case,did not have to meet the high standard of liability in brooke group before relying upon predatory overbidding to satisfy the anticompetitive conduct requirement.our holding regarding brooke group does not resolve weyerhaeuser argument that evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict,however.accordingly,we now turn to the issue of whether substantial evidence supports the jury verdict we conclude that the record contains substantial evidence.
substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.when reviewing the record as a whole,we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,keeping in mind that c redibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.in reviewing a defendant entitlement to judgment as a matter of law in the antitrust context,we presume that a reasonable jury know s and understand s the law,the facts of the case,and the realities of the market.
to establish attempted monopolization under of the sherman act had to demonstrate that weyerhaeuser engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct,had a specific intent to monopolize,and a dangerous probability of weyerhaeuser achievement of monopoly power in the relevant market existed additionally,had to show causal antitrust injury we first examine whether the record contains substantial evidence of anticompetitive conduct.
anticompetitive conduct 
anticompetitive or predatory acts are those that tend to exclude or restrict competition on some basis other than efficiency.the record contains substantial evidence of overbidding for sawlogs to support the jury finding of anticompetitive conduct.the evidence shows that during the period of alleged predation sawlog prices increased while prices for finished lumber decreased,weyerhaeuser had a dominant share of the market for alder sawlogs and an ability to control alder sawlog prices,weyerhaeuser suffered declining profits due to the high prices it was paying for raw materials,and weyerhaeuser employed a strategy of raising sawlog prices.based on this evidence,the jury could reasonably have concluded that weyerhaeuser engaged in anticompetitive conduct by overbidding for sawlogs.we need not analyze whether substantial evidence supports the other alleged anticompetitive acts because the evidence of predatory overbidding sufficiently supports the finding that weyerhaeuser engaged in anticompetitive conduct we now turn to the issue of whether substantial evidence supports the jury finding of specific intent.
specific intent 
attempted monopolization requires proof of intent to monopolize or eliminate competition the record contains substantial evidence of specific intent to eliminate competition based on weyerhaeuser anticompetitive conduct itself,the testimony of weyerhaeuser employees,and weyerhaeuser business projections regarding sawlog prices.
anticompetitive conduct alone can satisfy the specific intent requirement if the conduct form s the basis for a substantial claim of restraint of trade or is clearly threatening to competition or clearly exclusionary.as discussed above,offered evidence that weyerhaeuser overpaid for sawlogs while its profits declined.weyerhaeuser overbidding for sawlogs clearly threatened competition because it restricted competitors access to the limited supply of sawlogs.thus,weyerhaeuser conduct on its own supports a reasonable inference of specific intent to eliminate competition.
the testimony of weyerhaeuser employees further showed that weyerhaeuser intended to control prices and eliminate competition.one of weyerhaeuser former senior analysts,eugene novak,acknowledged on the stand that weyerhaeuser had the was aware of its influence prices in the alder sawlog market.novak also authored a memorandum regarding the costs of sawlogs and lumber in which he stated that the increase in sawlog prices despite weyerhaeuser predominant market share made no sense.novak estimated that,due to the excessive prices weyerhaeuser paid for sawlogs,it had given up some to million dollars in the last three years.he testified that his boss,vicki mcinnally,who was a member of the senior management team,told him that that was the strategy that weyerhaeuser designed.a former sales manager for weyerhaeuser,cliff chulos,also testified that it was taken as a given by everyone that weyerhaeuser could influence price that weyerhaeuser had to be a major influence.thus,the testimony in the record supports the finding that weyerhaeuser specifically intended to eliminate competition.
moreover,weyerhaeuser business projections about sawlog prices indicated that it planned to lower the prices it paid for sawlogs after acquiring a greater market share as a result of decreased competition.weyerhaeuser tracked competitors profit margins and estimated the potential effects of targeted increases in sawlog costs on the ability of competitors to survive.such evidence also supports an inference that weyerhaeuser sought to foreclose competition rather than simply to increase its own business thus,when viewed in its entirety,the evidence sufficiently supports a finding of specific intent to control prices and eliminate competition.we now turn to the question of whether substantial evidence supports the finding that a dangerous probability of weyerhaeuser achievement of monopoly power existed.
dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power 
monopoly power is the power to control prices or exclude competition.in determining whether there is a dangerous probability of monopolization,we consider the relevant market and the defendant ability to lessen or destroy competition in that market.to control prices unilaterally,weyerhaeuser had to have obtained market power could demonstrate that weyerhaeuser had market power either by presenting direct evidence of the injurious exercise of that power or by presenting circumstantial evidence that defined the relevant market,demonstrated that the defendant held a dominant share of the market,and showed that significant barriers to entry into and expansion within the market exist we hold that substantial evidence supports the jury finding that a dangerous probability of weyerhaeuser achievement of monopoly power existed.
the record contains some direct evidence that could support the jury finding that a dangerous probability of weyerhaeuser achievement of monopoly power existed.the testimony from weyerhaeuser employees showed that weyerhaeuser had the power to influence prices and had used its power to raise the price of sawlogs.this direct evidence of weyerhaeuser injurious exercise of market power is substantial enough by itself to support the jury finding of a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.we nonetheless examine the circumstantial evidence as well because that evidence provides additional support for the jury finding.
i market share 
weyerhaeuser does not dispute data that,during the relevant time period,weyerhaeuser share of the relevant market was approximately.weyerhaeuser business records showed that its share was in,with projected increases.we have held a market share sufficient as a matter of law to support a finding of market power for attempted monopolization thus,we conclude that weyerhaeuser approximately market share supports a finding of market power.
market share alone,however,does not raise an inference of a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power if there are low entry barriers or other evidence of a defendant inability to control prices or exclude competitors.we therefore turn to the issue of whether significant barriers to entry and expansion existed.
ii barriers to entry and expansion 
entry barriers are additional costs that were not incurred by incumbent firms but must be incurred by new entrants,or factors in the market that deter entry while permitting incumbent firms to earn monopoly returns.such barriers may include legal license requirements,control of an essential resource,entrenched buyer preferences,and higher capital costs for new entrants entry barriers that justify a finding of market power must be capable of constraining the normal operation of the market to the extent that the problem is unlikely to be.we conclude that the high capital costs new entrants faced and the limited availability of sawlogs were barriers to entry that justified an inference of monopoly power.
at the outset,we address weyerhaeuser argument that the entry of four new mills during the alleged predation period demonstrated a lack of barriers to entry.we have held that the entry of new competitors does not necessarily demonstrate a lack of barriers to entry if new entrants are insufficient to take significant business away from the predator,they are unlikely to represent a challenge to the predator market power.the evidence did not sh
