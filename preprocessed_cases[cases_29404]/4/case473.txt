background 
digital images alleges that most filmed entertainment product in the united states was edited during the on editing systems,a digital technology based method of efficiently accessing and rearranging film images and audio tracks.until september,two competing manufacturers of editing systems existed in the united states film market,tektronix and avid,the defendants in this case.according to plaintiff digital images complaint,tektronix and avid were powerful rivals who engaged in fierce economic and innovative competition from which digital images and other end users of their respective products materially benefitted across the board.tektronix called its system lightworks.avid referred to its competing product by the company name,avid.
digital images was in the business of leasing to film companies for their own use editing equipment which it purchased from the manufacturer,and using these systems to perform professional editing services for customers in the film industry.digital images purchased its entire stock of editing equipment,lightworks,from tektronix and relied on the manufacturer for service,features,upgrades,and support.in antitrust terms,digital images was in the purchase market a who obtained goods and related services in the relevant market from the defendants.as counsel argued to the court,digital images was,among other things,a buyer for its own use.er.digital images alleges also that it competed with the manufacturers avid and tektronix in the rental market as a rental equipment and service provider resp.the point of competition alleged was the decision by film production companies either to buy a machine from the manufacturer,or rent one from a resp.it is in these capacities that we examine its standing to bring this action.
at a series of meetings between april and october,tektronix representatives met with lightworks customers,including digital images.during these meetings,tektronix representatives asserted that tektronix would continue to improve and aggressively to market lightworks.between and august,the representatives discussed tektronix business plans during meetings with digital images,and at industry conventions and trade shows.based on tektronix presentations,digital images alleges it chose to remain with lightworks instead of switching to tektronix competitor,avid.
by september,avid had succeeded in controlling of the film editing machine market.on september,abruptly,without warning,and contrary to previous representations,avid and tektronix entered into an alliance whereby tektronix agreed to cease manufacturing and selling its lightworks system,and to become a distributor for its previous competitor avid film editing products.to quote digital images second amended complaint,
b avid and tektronix agreed jointly to market avid current and future editing products to the broadcast market,and tektronix was prohibited from selling the avid editing product to film market resps,rental equipment and service providers,such as digital images.when the parties agreed to end competition,which they recognized would be viewed as anti competitive conduct,they colluded to conceal the true facts from the public.this was done through a variety of maneuvers,including false filings concerning lightworks,false statements at press conferences,and an incentive system under which tektronix would effectively be precluded from competing with though the joint venture agreements did not contain an express clause and c avid and tektronix agreed to stop competing in markets for the sale of editing equipment to the broadcast industry,and instead to combine their products into a single product that would eliminate the news editing equipment set the stage for avid and tektronix to split the profits that would be realized from the elimination of competition in these markets.further to that scheme,avid and tektronix formed a corporation called avstar systems llc.the agreement between tektronix and avid was an egregious act of unlawful market division 
er.emphasis added.
digital images alleges that this joint venture was purposefully and caused its film producer customers to refuse to have their films edited with lightworks technology after they discovered that the system had been discontinued.unable to switch products because of costs and allegedly insurmountable complications,this agreement between avid and tektronix effectively ruined digital images lightworks reliant business,and forced digital images out of business.as the district court noted,as a result of this joint venture plaintiff business was abruptly destroyed.
notwithstanding a string of prior consistent representations to the industry to the contrary,on october,tektronix claimed to the security and exchange commission in justification of its decision to collaborate with avid that it had entered into the alliance because lightworks was near the end of its product life cycle.whatever the reason,the alliance allegedly had the effect of eliminating all competition in the relevant market wherein digital images was both a and a.digital images asserts that the agreement gave avid a monopoly in the relevant market.interbrand competition was dead.
digital images filed this private antitrust lawsuit on march,alleging that the agreement violated antitrust sherman act,the clayton act,and the cartwright act cal.bus.digital images alleged also state law claims against tektronix for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and promissory estoppel,and a claim against avid for interference with prospective business advantage.
digital images alleged in its complaint that tektronix representations regarding its intentions were both material and false,and that digital images relied on these statements in two principal ways digital images repeated tektronix misrepresentations to its customers which caused it to lose business and credibility when the representations turned out to be false and digital images remained an exclusive lightworks vendor which included substantial capital investments in lightworks equipment,which caused digital images to suffer unrecoverable losses when tektronix failed to deliver on its representations and then suddenly,collusively,and unlawfully exited the editor business in september.
on september,the district court dismissed digital images first amended complaint with leave to amend.glen holly entm t,tektronix,d,glen holly entm t,tektronix,d.digital images filed its second amended complaint on november,alleging the same claims as its first amended complaint and attempting to cure deficiencies identified by the district court.the district court dismissed the second amended complaint claims of federal and state antitrust law violations against avid and tektronix after it concluded that digital images had failed to allege the necessary injury.
the district court dismissed also,in part,digital images fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims,and dismissed its promissory estoppel claim in its entirety.the court reasoned that most of the alleged misrepresentations were not actionable as fraud or negligent misrepresentation because they constituted mere puffery or were too vague.the court dismissed digital images promissory estoppel claim because the alleged promises were too vague or indefinite,and because no allegations supported the conclusion that injustice could only be avoided by enforcing them.the district court concluded,however,that five alleged misrepresentations were facially actionable as fraud and negligent misrepresentation and not subject to b dismissal.
on july,however,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of tektronix on the basis of digital images five remaining claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation because digital images had failed to present a disputed issue as to whether it justifiably relied on the alleged misstatements.the district court entered final judgment on august,and digital images timely appealed.
discussion 
section of the clayton act provides that any person injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore a.this law effectively allows private persons to sue for antitrust violations previously restricted by statute to government enforcement.digital images claims that the agreement violated federal antitrust law,principally sections and of the sherman antitrust act,by creating a monopoly,destroying competition in the relevant market,and restraining trade,all to the detriment of digital images business and its property.to quote its brief,digital images was injured by the collusive restructuring of markets to the benefit of the colluders and to the detriment of other market participants including those who buy products 
only those who meet the requirements for antitrust standing may pursue a claim under the clayton act and to acquire antitrust standing,a plaintiff must adequately allege and eventually prove antitrust injury.american ad,at citing associated contractors of,cal.state council of carpenters,d emphases added.
antitrust injury is defined not merely as injury caused by an antitrust violation,but more restrictively as injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick pueblo,d.in brunswick,for example,the supreme court held,as we explained in pool water prods.olin,cir,that a plaintiff must prove that his loss flows from an anticompetitive aspect of the defendant behavior if the injury flows from aspects of the defendant conduct that are beneficial or neutral to competition,there is no antitrust injury,even if the defendant conduct is illegal per se.pool water,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.applying this test the supreme court concluded in brunswick that antitrust damages are not available where the sole injury alleged is that failing competitors were continued in business by the defendant acquisition of them,thereby denying plaintiffs an anticipated increase in market shares.at.similarly,the court concluded in cargill,monfort of colorado,d that loss or damage to a competitor due merely to increased competition,such as a possible diminution of profits due to price competition following a merger by other competitors is not antitrust injury.the court pointed out that the antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition,not competitors.id.at.quoting brunswick,at.quoting brown shoe united states,d.

in addition,we impose a fifth requirement,that the injured party be a participant in the same market as the alleged malefactors.id.at quoting bhan nme hospitals,cir.in other words,the party alleging the injury must be either a consumer of the alleged violator goods or services or a competitor of the alleged violator in the restrained market.eagle foods,cir.in fact,and as the district court recognized,consumers in the market where trade is allegedly restrained are presumptively the proper plaintiffs to allege antitrust injury.see sas puerto rico,cir t he presumptively proper plaintiff is a customer who obtains services in the threatened market see associated contractors carpenters,at.as the legislative history shows,the sherman act was enacted to assure customers the benefits of price competition,and to protect the economic freedom of participants in the relevant market.
the district court analysis 
the district court examined digital images first amended complaint and determined in connection with defendants rule b motion that the defendants conduct as alleged was wrongful under the antitrust laws,that digital images damage resulted from the defendants conduct,that the injury suffered by digital images flowed from that which made the defendants conduct unlawful,and that the discontinuation of the lightworks product line had a negative effect on competition.d.the court said,there is no question that plaintiff has alleged conduct that would violate the antitrust laws.id.at.the court correctly noted also that the antitrust laws 
do not preclude any manufacturer from independently discontinuing a product line any more than they preclude a manufacturer from independently raising prices however,when a manufacturer discontinues a product in return for a benefit from a competitor,this conduct may violate the antitrust laws.
id.at.with respect to the second amended complaint,however,the district court concluded that digital images,which it regarded primarily as a displaced distributor,had failed to allege an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent er.brunswick at.the district court said,
granting relief to plaintiff for a reduction in the value of its inventory as a result of a merger would,therefore,have the perverse effect of punishing mergers that lead to the production of better products in proportion to the superiority of the merged entity products.
the court was influenced by digital images failure to allege that it intends to make or has made purchases in the market as well as its failure to claim predatory pricing on the part of the allied defendants.the court concluded also that digital images allegation that its inventory had become obsolete was not an injury suffered in the new purchase market.finally,the court opined that mergers that result in better products are and should not be rendered actionable under our antitrust laws.
defendants argue not that their alliance was lawful,but that antitrust injury is not present here because the same harm would have resulted if tektronix had merely gone out of business.they rely on cases recognizing that loss incurred because of an unlawful acquisition that would also have been incurred had the acquisition been lawful is not antitrust injury.lucas auto.eng g,cir citing brunswick,d alberta gas chems.du pont de nemours and,cir.defendants argue also that i f the injury flows from aspects of the defendant conduct that are beneficial or neutral to competition,there is no antitrust injury,even if the defendant conduct is illegal per se.pool water,at quoting rebel oil arco,cir.
type of injury 
the main argument on appeal involves american ad fourth requirement whether digital images injury is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.at.in this respect,the intentions of the antitrust laws are well synthesized in apex hosiery leader.
the end sought by the sherman act prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade was the prevention of restraints to free competition in business and commercial transactions which tended to restrict production,raise prices or otherwise control the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services,all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury.
id.at.emphasis added.t he central purpose of the antitrust laws,state and federal,is to preserve competition.it is competition that these statutes recognize as vital to the public interest.knevelbaard dairies kraft foods,cir.every precedent in the field makes clear that the interaction of competitive forces is what will benefit consumers.id.
the district court first error was to characterize digital images role in the market as a distributor,a role which digital images protests it did not play.typically,a distributor is a wholesaler who sells products chiefly to retailers and commercial users,usually as part of a contractual relationship with the primary manufacturer of the product,or with a franchisor.digital images complaint establishes no such relationship with either defendant.we agree with digital images that this focus was a mistake and that terminated distributor cases,such as john lenore olympia brewing,cir,are unhelpful.thus,the district court conclusion that digital images had suffered no antitrust injury as a distributor was simply irrelevant.
unfortunately,the district court mistaken view that digital images was a distributor of tektronix products carried over into its analysis of digital images allegation that it competed as a resp in the rental market with the defendant manufacturers.the court dismissed this assertion on the ground that the rule that canceled distributors do not have antitrust standing does not have an exception merely because the manufacturer is also a seller of the products to that is also sold to by the distributor.plaintiff role in the market is really undistinguishable for sic its role as a distributor.
as indicated,the court decision fatally to pigeon hole digital images as a distributor is simply wrong.digital images disclaims any such relationship with tektronix,and there is nothing sufficient in the pleadings to impeach this assertion.thus,for standing purposes,digital images alleged enough to establish factually that it is both a customer and a competitor in a slightly different market.
the court third error was to limit a actionable antitrust injury to situations where the has made or intends to make purchases in the relevant market which,as the result of antitrust activity,now suffers from artificially increased prices,or artificially less innovative products.glen holly entertainment,tektronix,d.with all respect,this understanding of antitrust injury is too restrictive 
the agreement detrimentally changed the market and limited consumers choice to one source of output.one form of antitrust injury is c oercive activity that prevents its victims from making free choices between market alternatives.amarel connell,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the injury alleged flowed from the discontinuation of the only competing product on the market by agreement between the only two competitors in the market.digital images and its customers no longer had a viable choice between market alternatives.
defendants reliance on cases where courts found no antitrust injury because the harm resulted from lower prices,continued competition,or increased competition simply do not apply to the instant case.see atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d brunswick,d cargill,d.nothing in the record indicates that the agreement lowered prices or enhanced competition.additionally,none of the cases relied on by the defendants involved the elimination of all competition similar to that alleged by digital images.nothing in the record indicates that a finding of antitrust injury under the circumstances of this case would punish behavior that the laws are designed to promote.
blue shield of virginia mccready,d provides us with assistance in deciding the dispositive issue in this case.virginia mccready was a blue shield subscriber who sought the professional services of a psychologist for a mental and nervous disorder.blue shield refused to cover these services on the ground that the services had been provided not by a psychiatrist,but by a psychologist.mccready then sued blue shield and the neuropsychiatric society of virginia,claiming an unlawful conspiracy in violation of section of the sherman act,to exclude and boycott clinical psychologists from receiving compensation under the blue shield plans.id.at.the district court dismissed her lawsuit on the ground that she had no antitrust standing.a divided panel of the fourth circuit reversed.the dissenting judge saw mccready injury not as a design or good of any antitrust violation,but rather as a consequence thereof.
the supreme court affirmed the fourth circuit,holding that mccready as a customer had standing to sue 
as a consumer of psychotherapy services entitled to benefits under the blue shield plan,we think it clear that mccready was within that area of the economy endangered by that breakdown of competitive conditions.
at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the supreme court dismissed as irrelevant the defendant arguments,which are similar to the defendants arguments made here,that mccready did not visit a psychiatrist whose fees were artificially inflated as a result of the competitive advantage he gained by the alleged conspiracy,that mccready suffered no additional expenses because of the conspiracy,and that her psychologist bills were no higher because of the conspiracy.the court said,
brunswick is not so limiting.indeed,as we made clear in a footnote to the passage,a plaintiff need not prove an actual lessening of competition in order to recover.c ompetitors may be able to prove antitrust injury before they actually are driven from the market and competition is thereby lessened,at.at.thus while an increase in price resulting from a dampening of competitive market forces is assuredly one type of injury for which potentially offers redress,see reiter sonotone,d,that is not the only form of injury remediable under.we think it plain that mccready injury was of a type that congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust laws.
mccready charges blue shield with a purposefully scheme.she seeks to recover as damages the sums lost to her as the consequence of blue shield attempt to pursue that scheme.she alleges that blue shield sought to induce its subscribers into selecting psychiatrists over psychologists for the psychotherapeutic services they required,and that the heart of its scheme was the offer of a hobson choice to its subscribers.those subscribers were compelled to choose between visiting a psychologist and forfeiting reimbursement,or receiving reimbursement by forgoing treatment by the practitioner of their choice.in the latter case,the antitrust injury would have been borne in the first instance by the competitors of the conspirators,and the customers of the competitors in the form of suppressed competition in the psychotherapy market in the former case,as it happened,the injury was borne directly by the customers of the competitors.mccready did not yield to blue shield coercive pressure,and bore blue shield sanction in the form of an increase in the net cost of her psychologist services.although mccready was not a competitor of the conspirators,the injury she suffered was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists and the psychotherapy market.in light of the conspiracy here alleged we think that mccready injury flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful within the meaning of brunswick,and falls squarely within the area of congressional concern.
at.emphasis added internal footnotes omitted.
the parallels here to mccready are apparent.in each case,a customer was directly damaged by an act alleged to be in violation of the antitrust laws.the customer was not required to show that the reduced competition increased the basic market cost of the service involved,only that she was directly and economically hurt by the alleged violation.
ftc indiana fed of dentists,d supports our conclusions.in that case,dentists conspired to refuse to submit to insurers for use in evaluating claims for benefits.in sustaining the ftc conclusion that this practice unreasonably and conspiratorially restrained trade in violation of of the sherman act,the court said,
the federation policy takes the form of a horizontal agreement among the participating dentists to withhold from their customers a particular service that they forwarding of xrays to insurance companies along with claims forms.while this is not price fixing as such,no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character of such an agreement.a refusal to compete with respect to the package of services offered to customers,no less than a refusal to compete with respect to the price term of an agreement,impairs the ability of the market to advance social welfare by ensuring the provision of desired goods and services to consumers at a price approximating the marginal cost of providing them.
granted that this discussion was directed at whether the restraint in question was unreasonable,but we note that the reason it was regarded as unreasonable is that it restricted customers choices by purposefully eliminating something from the market without any redeeming procompetitive effect.as the court said,the federation is not entitled to the working of the market by deciding for itself that its customers do not need that which they demand.id.at.see also ncaa board of regents of of,d thus the ncaa plan to restrict television broadcasts of football games is inconsistent with the sherman act command that price and supply be responsive to consumer preference.phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law.ed.antitrust law addresses distribution restraints in order to protect consumers from the higher prices or diminished choices that can sometimes result from limiting intrabrand competition.dental ass med.serv.ass of,cir citation omitted a n agreement limiting consumer choice by impeding the ordinary give and take of the marketplace can not be sustained under the rule of reason.
the defendants rely in large measure on cases that are sufficiently distinguishable to be inapposite and unhelpful.this case at this stage is not brunswick,it is not cargill,it is not pool water,and it is not lucas automotive in the brunswick line of cases,the alleged injury was simply a loss of greater profits caused by increased competition stemming from the alleged wrongful acts.here,as the record now stands,there is no pro competitive aspect of the defendant strategic alliance,none.conduct,such as an agreement to restrain trade,is inherently destructive of competitive conditions and may be condemned even without proof of its actual market effect.amarel,at,quoting associated contractors carpenters,at.moreover,whatever might have happened to digital images,had some other event occurred resulting in the demise of lightworks,is irrelevant in this context.the strategic alliance set out to exterminate lightworks and allegedly succeeded,leaving only one product,no choices,and no competition in its wake.furthermore,this case is not strictly a merger case,or a case involving the simple discontinuation of a product line,or one involving the termination of a distributor.to repeat,it is a case where the plaintiff has alleged an unlawful agreement,dressed up as a competitor collaboration,to kill off a product in order to end competition,and a case where the plaintiffs business which used that product was directly and intentionally strangled in the consummation of that agreement.digital images suggests that the agreement prohibited tektronix from selling the only remaining product to it as a resp.in this connection,and to borrow from mccready,the injury and the damage suffered by digital images to its property and business was inextricably intertwined with an agreement by two separate manufacturers which the district court recognized as clearly in violation of the sherman act.
digital images allegation of loss stems from a aspect or effect of defendants behavior,atlantic richfield,at.given that customers are the intended beneficiaries of competition,and that customers are presumptively those injured by its unlawful elimination,for pleading purposes we conclude that digital images has satisfied the requirement that it adequately allege antitrust injury to its business in its pleadings,digital images presents an allegation of that was reasonably proximate to the violation without undue duplication,complex apportionment,or alternative plaintiffs more directly affected by the violation.phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law.ed.
if the antitrust laws are designed to protect customers from the harm of unlawfully elevated prices,and from agreements between competitors at the same level of the market structure to allocate territories in order to minimize competition,united states topco,d,it is no stretch to conclude that these same laws protect customers from harm directly related to the unlawful removal of a competitive product from the market.if as mccready quoting brunswick suggests,competitors may be able to prove antitrust injury before they actually are driven from the market and competition is thereby lessened,mccready,at,one would think that a customer in business directly driven from the market by an agreement in restraint of trade would be able to do the same.it is one thing for a business to have cast its fate with a product that disappears because of the normal forces of the market it is another to have the rug pulled out from under a business by a conspiratorial agreement to eliminate a competing product from the process upon which our economic model depends in order to promote social welfare.as the supreme court has said,
antitrust laws in general,and the sherman act in particular,are the magna carta of free enterprise.they are as important to the preservation of economic freedom and our systems as the bill of rights is to the protection of our fundamental personal freedoms.
