this antitrust case stems from a protracted dispute over baltimore scrap attempt to install a scrap metal shredder in baltimore,maryland in.baltimore scrap alleges that the defendants violated the sherman act,by surreptitiously financing litigation in state court in order to prevent or delay baltimore scrap entry into the market.the defendants argue that the doctrine immunizes those who petition the courts from antitrust liability.the district court ruled that although the defendants conduct was wrong,it was nonetheless protected by.see baltimore scrap v.the david joseph,d.because neither the sham exception nor the fraud exception to immunity applies here,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on july,baltimore scrap leased land in the city of baltimore in order to install a metal shredder there.baltimore scrap proposed shredder caused great concern among two groups.the first was comprised of citizen associations of baltimore who opposed the shredder on environmental grounds.these organizations voiced their opposition to the maryland department of environment and to the mayor of baltimore in august of.
the defendants,including the david joseph djj,shapiro,and the shapiro family,composed the second group.the defendants controlled the only other metal shredder in the baltimore area.djj and shapiro wanted to ensure that their shredder maintained its monopoly in that area.unlike the citizen groups,however,djj and shapiro did not publicly voice their concerns about baltimore scrap proposed shredder.indeed,until their role was inadvertently revealed in late march of,the defendants plan to prevent baltimore scrap from building a shredder was a secret.
in september of,baltimore scrap applied for a zoning permit from the baltimore city board of municipal and zoning appeals.in november,the leaders of the citizen groups testified against the permit.one week later,the board denied baltimore scrap application.baltimore scrap appealed this decision to the baltimore city circuit court,which upheld the board.
in may of,baltimore scrap filed a new zoning application with the board.because the baltimore zoning code does not allow the board to consider substantially the same proposal until twelve months after the previous application was denied,baltimore scrap changed its application to add new protections against soil contamination at the site.the board ruled that the application was different enough to warrant a new hearing even though twelve months had not elapsed since the previous denial of a permit.the board then approved a permit for baltimore scrap on august.
at this point,shapiro decided to secretly fight the approval of the permit.shapiro attorney contacted another lawyer,david irwin,to handle the appeal.an employee from a different company by shapiro contacted gloria sipes.sipes was the president of one of the citizen groups,the community of curtis bay association.the employee told sipes that local businesses would pay for an attorney if the citizen groups wanted to appeal the board decision.the employee told sipes to contact david irwin for the appeal.the caller did not reveal her identity,or who she represented.sipes consulted with the other citizen groups,and they decided to accept the support of their unknown benefactor.the citizen organizations did not ask who was funding the appeal and did not care who paid the lawyer.
irwin filed his appeal on behalf of the citizen groups on august.irwin understood that djj and shapiro controlled the appeal.baltimore scrap moved to dismiss the appeal based upon the citizen groups lack of standing.after the statutory appeal period expired,sipes moved to intervene in the lawsuit as an individual party.judge ward of the baltimore city circuit court ruled that the citizen groups and sipes all had standing,and granted sipes motion to intervene.he thus denied baltimore scrap motion to dismiss.
chief judge hammerman,also of the baltimore city circuit court,heard the citizen groups appeal on the merits on january.he agreed with judge ward that sipes motion to intervene was timely.after originally ruling for the citizen groups on the merits,chief judge hammerman eventually affirmed the board decision to grant baltimore scrap a permit once the board clarified a technical point.the citizen groups filed a motion with chief judge hammerman to stay his decision pending appeal.
throughout this time,djj and shapiro left no public trace of their involvement in the lawsuit.in late march,however,a errant fax exposed the role of the defendants.this fax was supposed to go to a lawyer working for djj and shapiro,but instead was sent to a friend of baltimore scrap president.on april,irwin met with representatives from the citizen groups involved in the lawsuit.he told them that djj and shapiro were funding the litigation.he asked them whether they wanted to continue with the appeal.the citizen groups decided to keep pursuing the appeal,despite the knowledge of djj and shapiro involvement.
baltimore scrap argued in its opposition to the motion to stay that the lawsuit was a fraud because djj and shapiro were the real parties in interest.irwin responded in his pleadings that the notion that the defendants directed the conduct of this case or drafted the previous motion was preposterous,inflammatory,and not based in reality.irwin emphasized in open court during an april hearing on the motion to stay that the citizen groups were the only parties he represented.when chief judge hammerman questioned irwin about the errant fax,irwin told the judge that nothing in the errant fax says my law firm is involved with djj and shapiro.irwin stated to the court,i continue to deny,as my papers do,that i am representing anyone but the people represented here.chief judge hammerman denied irwin motion to stay because he thought that the citizen groups did not have a likelihood of success on appeal.in reaching this decision,chief judge hammerman observed that he saw the hand of the defendants in the lawsuit,and that they have gone from the role of an interested observer to the role of an active participant.
despite the denial of the motion to stay,the citizen groups appealed to the maryland court of special appeals.in a opinion,the court of special appeals denied the appeal.see sipes board of municipal and zoning appeals.it called the case dead on arrival in the circuit court because the citizen groups did not have standing since they were neither an aggrieved party nor a taxpayer.id.at accord id.at.although sipes as an individual did have standing,her motion to intervene was as a logical extension of the citizen groups lack of standing.id.at.the citizen groups did not pursue an appeal from this decision.baltimore scrap shredder became fully operational in july.
baltimore scrap sued djj,the shapiro family,and the shapiro family companies.the complaint alleged violations of the sherman act,violations of maryland antitrust law,ann.com.law.ii et,and various state common law tort claims including malicious use of process,abuse of process,and fraud.the district court found that the defendants actions were deceitful,underhanded,and morally wrong.baltimore scrap,d at.nevertheless,the district court dismissed baltimore scrap claims because of the defendants immunity.see id.baltimore scrap now appeals.
the doctrine guarantees citizens their first amendment right to petition the government for redress without fear of antitrust liability.see eastern presidents conference noerr motor freight,d united mine workers of am.pennington,d.in noerr,the supreme court held that the sherman act does not prohibit two or more persons from associating together in an attempt to persuade the legislature or the executive to take particular action with respect to a law that would produce a restraint or a monopoly.noerr,at.indeed,the court emphasized that t he right of petition is one of the freedoms protected by the bill of rights,and we can not,of course,lightly impute to congress an intent to invade these freedoms.id.at.
antitrust law was thus not intended to impose a barrier between the people and their government.because it is neither unusual or illegal for people to seek action on laws in the hope that they may bring about an advantage to themselves and a disadvantage to their competitors,the supreme court has made clear that the sherman act generally does not prohibit the petitioning of public bodies for relief.id.at.indeed,an anticompetitive purpose does not illegalize concerted attempts to influence public officials even though the resulting official action damaged other competitors at whom the conduct was aimed.pennington,at.
immunity from antitrust laws extends to petitioning the courts as well.see california motor transport trucking unlimited,d.federal antitrust law is thus generally not an appropriate means of collaterally attacking state judicial judgments because of holding that the rights of petition and association trump any anticompetitive effects that might occur from asking the government for redress.any other rule would allow the specter of satellite litigation to restrict the primary right of citizens to seek justice from the judicial system.
immunity from lawsuits has two main exceptions,however sham litigation and,arguably,fraudulent litigation.see professional real estate investors,columbia pictures,d pre accord noerr,at.baltimore scrap argues that both exceptions operate to strip the defendants of any immunity.
we address the sham exception to immunity first.sham litigation must meet a test.see pre,at.first,the lawsuit must be objectively baseless.a lawsuit is objectively baseless only if no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.pre,at.if an objective party can conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome,the suit is immunized under noerr,and an claim premised on the sham exception must fail.id.by definition,a winning lawsuit is a reasonable effort at petitioning for redress and therefore not a sham.id.at.second,in the event the challenged litigation is found to be objectively baseless,the lawsuit must further conceal an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.id.at.because the litigation at issue in this case was not objectively baseless,our analysis stops after the first prong of the test.
lawsuits are not objectively baseless simply because a litigant lost.in pre,the supreme court held that columbia pictures had a reasonable basis for believing it might win a copyright infringement case despite the fact that the ninth circuit dismissed the lawsuit as a matter of law.see pre,at.the court pointed to the fact that two other circuits expressly declined to follow the ninth circuit holding as well as the criticism that the ninth circuit opinion engendered among commentators.see id.even in the absence of this contrary authority,the court held that columbia pictures would have been entitled to press a novel claim if a similarly situated litigant could have perceived some likelihood of success.see id.at.
baltimore scrap argues that the litigation was a sham because the defendants knew that the citizen groups did not have standing and sipes did not timely move to intervene.baltimore scrap cites in re burlington northern,cir,and landmarks holding bermant,cir,to support its claim.in burlington northern,railroad companies allegedly tried to prevent or delay the construction of a coal pipeline by engaging in sham petitioning of the courts.see at.some of the railroad companies knew that they had no standing or had no reasonable basis for asserting standing.still,they joined in the lawsuit.see id.at.the court held that the defendants actions were not protected by because the litigation was baseless.id.in landmarks holding,owners of a shopping mall sued a competing shopping mall knowing that they lacked the standing to do so.see at.these owners also subsidized litigation by various citizens to stop the competing mall without the citizens knowledge that the shopping mall owners were funding the lawsuit.see id.at.the court held that because all the lawsuits were meritless,did not protect the defendants actions.see id.at.
the case at bar differs substantially from both burlington northern and landmarks holding.first,both these cases were decided before the supreme court enunciated its test for sham litigation in pre.second,and more importantly,in both cases the defendants knew or reasonably should have known that they lacked standing and therefore that their claims were baseless.
in this case,an objective litigant could reasonably expect to achieve success on the merits.although the zoning lawsuit was eventually dismissed due to lack of standing,judge ward ruled for the citizen groups on the standing issue and allowed sipes to intervene.chief judge hammerman indicated that after his independent research,he probably would agree with judge ward if he needed to rule on standing.the court of special appeals disagreed,but only after making a logical extension of its intervention rule and after a reasoned opinion.sipes,at.as the district court noted,the success before two judges of the circuit court for baltimore city demonstrates a reasonable basis for the litigation position.d at.the fact that the court of special appeals ultimately dismissed the lawsuit on the standing issue makes no difference in deciding whether an objective litigant could reasonably expect to have success on the merits.judged by this latter standard,the zoning litigation was not a sham.
baltimore scrap maintains,however,that analysis is inapplicable to this case because djj and the shapiro family did not petition the government since they were not parties to the zoning litigation.baltimore scrap argues that protects litigants only,not third parties who covertly funded the lawsuit.see pre,at.if an objective litigant could conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome emphasis added.
pre is not so restrictive as to protect only the litigant from later antitrust liability.see liberty lake investments,magnuson,cir.the fact that a third party funded the litigation can not govern the analysis of the objective merit of a lawsuit.see id.as the sixth circuit put it,i t would avail an plaintiff nothing to show that the defendant had surreptitiously caused a front man to institute a lawsuit against the plaintiff,even if the suit proved to be without merit,absent a showing of clear abuse of process.opdyke investment city of detroit,cir.
baltimore scrap again relies on burlington northern for the proposition that a third party who does not have standing to pursue a in its own right does not receive immunity.see burlington northern,at.in burlington northern,union pacific railroad did not join the litigation against the coal pipeline company as a party.however,it provided legal assistance to the state of nebraska.most parties,as well as the district court,did not know of union pacific involvement in the lawsuit.see id.at.the court held that if union pacific did not have standing against the company in its own right,it would not receive the protection of.see id.at and.
baltimore scrap argues that since the defendants in this case likewise did not have standing to pursue the appeal,they do not receive immunity.we are wary of relying on burlington northern,however,given the fact that the supreme court in pre specifically disapproved of burlington northern in fashioning its sham litigation test.see pre,at.indeed,post pre cases with similar facts have recognized that the defendant standing to bring a lawsuit is not germane in deciding whether the lawsuit itself was objectively meritless.see,liberty lake,at.in liberty lake,a developer named harry magnuson solicited and financed straw parties to prosecute an environmental challenge against a competing business.see liberty lake,at.the liberty lake court undertook the normal,two part analysis for sham litigation despite the fact that magnuson was behind the litigation.see id.at.in a case decided before pre,this circuit declined as well to deny immunity to.see hospital building rex hospital,cir who caused a government entity to file litigation entitled to jury charge of immunity.
in this case,we need not decide whether the defendants themselves had independent standing
