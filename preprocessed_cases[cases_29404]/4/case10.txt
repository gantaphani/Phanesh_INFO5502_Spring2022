the arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on animalfeeds public policy argument for permitting class arbitration under the charter party arbitration clause.however,because the parties agreed that their agreement was silent on the class arbitration issue,the arbitrators proper task was to identify the rule of law governing in that situation.instead,the panel based its decision on arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were based on a rule derived from the faa or on maritime or new york law.rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a default rule permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitration absent express consent,the panel proceeded as if it had a court authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule for such a situation.finding no reason to depart from its perception of a consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration was beneficial in numerous settings,the panel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration.the panel few references to intent do not show that the panel did anything other than impose its own policy preference.thus,under faa b,this court must either direct a rehearing by the arbitrators or decide the question originally referred to the panel.because there can be only one possible outcome on the facts here,there is no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.
b bazzle did not control resolution of the question whether the instant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this class.
no single rationale commanded a majority in bazzle,which concerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers that had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class arbitration.the plurality decided only the question whether the court or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were silent on the class arbitration issue,concluding that it was the arbitrator.justice stevens opinion bypassed that question,resting instead on his resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate decisionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows class arbitration,and whether,under whatever standard is appropriate,class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.
the bazzle opinions appear to have baffled these parties at their arbitration proceeding.for one thing,the parties appear to have believed that bazzle requires an arbitrator,not a court,to decide whether a contract permits class arbitration,a question addressed only by the plurality.that question need not be revisited here because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitration panel,and no party argues that this assignment was impermissible.both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have misunderstood bazzle as establishing the standard to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration is permitted.however,bazzle left that question open.
c imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the faa.
the faa imposes rules of fundamental importance,including the basic precept that arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion.volt board of trustees of leland stanford junior.the faa requires that a written provision in any maritime transaction calling for the arbitration of a controversy arising out of such transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,and permits a party to an arbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order directing that arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement,thus,this court has said that the faa central purpose is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.volt,at.whether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,courts and arbitrators must give effect to the parties contractual rights and expectations.ibid.the parties intentions control,mitsubishi motors soler,and the parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit,mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton.they may agree to limit the issues arbitrated and may agree on rules under which an arbitration will proceed.they may also specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their disputes.see eeoc waffle house.
it follows that a party may not be compelled under the faa to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.here,the arbitration panel imposed class arbitration despite the parties stipulation that they had reached no agreement on that issue.the panel conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foundational faa principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.it may be appropriate to presume that parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitrator to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties agreement.see howsam dean witter reynolds.but an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an agreement to arbitrate.the differences between simple bilateral and complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.

petitioners are shipping companies that serve a large share of the world market for parcel tankers seagoing vessels with compartments that are separately chartered to customers wishing to ship liquids in small quantities.one of those customers is animalfeeds international hereinafter animalfeeds,which supplies raw ingredients,such as fish oil,to producers around the world.animalfeeds ships its goods pursuant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a charter party numerous charter parties are in regular use,and the charter party that animalfeeds uses is known as the vegoilvoy charter party.petitioners assert,without contradiction,that charterers like animalfeeds,or their agents not the shipowners typically select the particular charter party that governs their shipments.accord,trowbridge,admiralty law institute symposium on charter parties the history,development,and characteristics of the charter concept,tulane,voyage charter parties are highly standardized,with many commodities and charterers having their own specialized forms

in,a department of justice criminal investigation revealed that petitioners were engaging in an illegal conspiracy.when animalfeeds learned of this,it brought a putative class action against petitioners in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,asserting antitrust claims for supracompetitive prices that petitioners allegedly charged their customers over a period of several years.
other charterers brought similar suits.in one of these,the district court for the district of connecticut held that the charterers claims were not subject to arbitration under the applicable arbitration clause,but the second circuit reversed.see jlm industries.while that appeal was pending,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation ordered the consolidation of actions against petitioners,including animalfeeds action,in the district of connecticut.see in re parcel tanker shipping services antitrust litigation,supp,and jpml.the parties agree that as a consequence of these judgments and orders,animalfeeds and petitioners must arbitrate their antitrust dispute.
in,animalfeeds served petitioners with a demand for class arbitration,designating new york city as the place of arbitration and seeking to represent a class of a ll direct purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services globally for bulk liquid chemicals,edible oils,acids,and other specialty liquids from petitioners at any time during the period from august,to november.internal quotation marks omitted.the parties entered into a supplemental agreement providing for the question of class arbitration to be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to follow and be bound by rules through of the american arbitration association supplementary rules for class arbitrations as effective.app.to pet.for cert.these rules hereinafter class rules were developed by the american arbitration association aaa after our decision in green tree financial bazzle,and class rule,in accordance with the plurality opinion in that case,requires an arbitrator,as a threshold matter,to determine whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.app.
the parties selected a panel of arbitrators and stipulated that the arbitration clause was silent with respect to class arbitration.counsel for animalfeeds explained to the arbitration panel that the term silent did not simply mean that the clause made no express reference to class arbitration.rather,he said,a ll the parties agree that when a contract is silent on an issue there been no agreement that has been reached on that issue.at.
after hearing argument and evidence,including testimony from petitioners experts regarding arbitration customs and usage in the maritime trade,the arbitrators concluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration.they found persuasive the fact that other arbitrators ruling after bazzle had construed a wide variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration,but the panel acknowledged that none of these decisions was exactly comparable to the present dispute.see app.to pet.for cert.petitioners expert evidence did not show an inten t to preclude class arbitration,the arbitrators reasoned,and petitioners argument would leave no basis for a class action absent express agreement among all parties and the putative class members.at.
the arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the parties to seek judicial review,and petitioners filed an application to vacate the arbitrators award in the district court for the southern district of new york.see a authorizing a district court to make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration where the arbitrators exceeded their powers petition to vacate arbitration award,sdny in app.in,citing a as a ground for vacatur of the award see also,at to,invoking the district court jurisdiction under and and.the district court vacated the award,concluding that the arbitrators decision was made in manifest disregard of the law insofar as the arbitrators failed to conduct a analysis.supp,sdny.see wilko swan,t he interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject,in the federal courts,to judicial review for error in interpretation see also petition to vacate arbitration award,supra,at,alleging that the arbitration panel manifestly disregarded the law had such an analysis been conducted,the district court held,the arbitrators would have applied the rule of federal maritime law requiring that contracts be interpreted in light of custom and usage.supp,at.
animalfeeds appealed to the court of appeals,which reversed.see a e an appeal may be taken from an order vacating an award as an initial matter,the court of appeals held that the manifest disregard standard survived our decision in hall street associates,mattel,as a judicial gloss on the enumerated grounds for vacatur of arbitration awards under,at.nonetheless,the court of appeals concluded that,because petitioners had cited no authority applying a federal maritime rule of custom and usage against class arbitration,the arbitrators decision was not in manifest disregard of federal maritime law,at.nor had the arbitrators manifestly disregarded new york law,the court of appeals continued,since nothing in new york case law established a rule against class arbitration,at.
we granted certiorari.
petitioners contend that the decision of the arbitration panel must be vacated,but in order to obtain that relief,they must clear a high hurdle.it is not enough for petitioners to show that the panel committed an error or even a serious error.see eastern associated coal mine workers,paperworkers misco.it is only when an arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively dispense s his own brand of industrial justice that his decision may be unenforceable.major league baseball players garvey,per curiam quoting steelworkers enterprise wheel car.in that situation,an arbitration decision may be vacated under a of the faa on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers,for the task of an arbitrator is to interpret and enforce a contract,not to make public policy.in this case,we must conclude that what the arbitration panel did was simply to impose its own view of sound policy regarding class arbitration 
in its memorandum of law filed in the arbitration proceedings,animalfeeds made three arguments in support of construing the arbitration clause to permit class arbitration 
the parties arbitration clause should be construed to allow class arbitration because a the clause is silent on the issue of class treatment and,without express prohibition,class arbitration is permitted under bazzle b the clause should be construed to permit class arbitration as a matter of public policy and c the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable if it forbade class arbitration.app.in,at to emphasis added.
the arbitrators expressly rejected animalfeeds first argument,see app.to pet.for cert,and said nothing about the third.instead,the panel appears to have rested its decision on animalfeeds public policy argument.because the parties agreed their agreement was silent in the sense that they had not reached any agreement on the issue of class arbitration,the arbitrators proper task was to identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.had they engaged in that undertaking,they presumably would have looked either to the faa itself or to one of the two bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing,either federal maritime law or new york law.but the panel did not consider whether the faa provides the rule of decision in such a situation nor did the panel attempt to determine what rule would govern under either maritime or new york law in the case of a silent contract.instead,the panel based its decision on arbitral decisions that construed a wide variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.app.to pet.for cert.the panel did not mention whether any of these decisions were based on a rule derived from the faa or on maritime or new york law 
rather than inquiring whether the faa,maritime law,or new york law contains a default rule under which an arbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitration in the absence of express consent,the panel proceeded as if it had the authority of a court to develop what it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a situation.perceiving a consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in a wide variety of settings,the panel considered only whether there was any good reason not to follow that consensus in this case.app.to pet.for cert.the panel was not persuaded by court cases denying consolidation of arbitrations,by undisputed evidence that the vegoilvoy charter party had never been the basis of a class action,or by expert opinion that sophisticated,multinational commercial parties of the type that are sought to be included in the class would never intend that the arbitration clauses would permit a class arbitration.at.accordingly,finding no convincing ground for departing from the arbitral consensus,the panel held that class arbitration was permitted in this case.app.to pet.for cert.the conclusion is inescapable that the panel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy 
it is true that the panel opinion makes a few references to intent,but none of these shows that the panel did anything other than impose its own policy preference.the opinion states that,under bazzle,arbitrators must look to the language of the parties agreement to ascertain the parties intention whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action,and the panel added that t his is also consistent with new york law.app.to pet.for cert.but the panel had no occasion to ascertain the parties intention in the present case because the parties were in complete agreement regarding their intent.in the very next sentence after the one quoted above,the panel acknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the vegoilvoy charter party was silent on whether it permit ted or preclude d class arbitration,but that the charter party was not ambiguous so as to call for parol evidence.ibid.this stipulation left no room for an inquiry regarding the parties intent,and any inquiry into that settled question would have been outside the panel assigned task.
the panel also commented on the breadth of the language in the vegoilvoy charter party,see,at,but since the only task that was left for the panel,in light of the parties stipulation,was to identify the governing rule applicable in a case in which neither the language of the contract nor any other evidence established that the parties had reached any agreement on the question of class arbitration,the particular wording of the charter party was quite beside the point.
in sum,instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision derived from the faa or either maritime or new york law,the arbitration panel imposed its own policy choice and thus exceeded its powers.as a result,under b of the faa,we must either direct a rehearing by the arbitrators or decide the question that was originally referred to the panel.because we conclude that there can be only one possible outcome on the facts before us,we see no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.
the arbitration panel thought that bazzle controlled the resolution of the question whether the vegoilvoy charter party permit s this arbitration to proceed on behalf of a class,app.to pet.for cert,but that understanding was incorrect.
bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender green tree and its customers.these contracts contained an arbitration clause but did not expressly mention class arbitration.nevertheless,an arbitrator conducted class arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the customers.
the south carolina supreme court affirmed the awards.bazzle green tree financial.after discussing both seventh circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority to order classwide arbitration under of the faa,see champ siegel trading,and conflicting california precedent,see keating superior court of alameda,cal,the state supreme court elected to follow the california approach,which it characterized as permitting a trial court to order arbitration under adhesive but enforceable franchise contracts,at,at.under this approach,the south carolina court observed,a trial judge must b alanc e the potential inequities and inefficiencies of requiring each aggrieved party to proceed on an individual basis against resulting prejudice to the drafting party and should take into account factors such as efficiency and equity.at,and,at,and.
applying these standards to the case before it,the south carolina supreme court found that the arbitration clause in the green tree contracts was silent regarding arbitration.at,at emphasis deleted.the court described its holding as follows 
w e hold that arbitration may be ordered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it would serve efficiency and equity,and would not result in prejudice.if we enforced a mandatory,adhesive arbitration clause,but prohibited class actions in arbitration where the agreement is silent,the drafting party could effectively prevent class actions against it without having to say it was doing so in the agreement.at,at footnote omitted.
when bazzle reached this court,no single rationale commanded a majority.the opinions of the justices who joined the judgment that is,the plurality opinion and justice stevens opinion collectively addressed three separate questions.the first was which decision maker court or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts in question were silent on the issue of class arbitration.the second was what standard the appropriate decision maker should apply in determining whether a contract allows class arbitration.for example,does the faa entirely preclude class arbitration does the faa permit class arbitration only under limited circumstances,such as when the contract expressly so provides or is this question left entirely to state law the final question was whether,under whatever standard is appropriate,class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.
the plurality opinion decided only the first question,concluding that the arbitrator and not a court should decide whether the contracts were indeed silent on the issue of class arbitration.the plurality noted that,i n certain limited circumstances,involving gateway matters,such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy,it is assumed that the parties intended courts,not arbitrators,to make the decision,at.but the plurality opined that the question whether a contract with an arbitration clause forbids class arbitration does not fall into this narrow exception.ibid.the plurality therefore concluded that the decision of the state supreme court should be vacated and that the case should be remanded for a decision by the arbitrator on the question whether the contracts were indeed silent.the plurality did not decide either the second or the third question noted above.
justice stevens concurred in the judgment vacating and remanding because otherwise there would have been no controlling judgment of the court,but he did not endorse the plurality rationale,at opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part.he did not take a definitive position on the first question,stating only that a rguably the interpretation of the parties agreement should have been made in the first instance by the arbitrator.ibid.emphasis added.but because he did not believe that green tree had raised the question of the appropriate decision maker,he preferred not to reach that question and,instead,would have affirmed the decision of the state supreme court on the ground that the decision to conduct a arbitration was correct as a matter of law.ibid.accordingly,his analysis bypassed the first question noted above and rested instead on his resolution of the second and third questions.thus,bazzle did not yield a majority decision on any of the three questions.
unfortunately,the opinions in bazzle appear to have baffled the parties in this case at the time of the arbitration proceeding.for one thing,the parties appear to have believed that the judgment in bazzle requires an arbitrator,not a court,to decide whether a contract permits class arbitration.see app.transcript of argument before arbitration panel counsel for states what bazzle says is that the contract interpretation issue is left up to the arbitrator,that the rule in bazzle in fact,however,only the plurality decided that question.but we need not revisit that question here because the parties supplemental agreement expressly assigned this issue to the arbitration panel,and no party argues that this assignment was impermissible.
unfortunately,however,both the parties and the arbitration panel seem to have misunderstood bazzle in another respect,namely,that it established the standard to be applied by a decision maker in determining whether a contract may permissibly be interpreted to allow class arbitration.the arbitration panel began its discussion by stating that the parties differ regarding the rule of interpretation to be gleaned from the bazzle decision.app.to pet.for cert.emphasis added.the panel continued 
claimants argue that bazzle requires clear language that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class action.the panel,however,agrees with respondents that the test is a more general one arbitrators must look to the language of the parties agreement to ascertain the parties intention whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action.ibid.
as we have explained,however,bazzle did not establish the rule to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration is permitted the decision in bazzle left that question open,and we turn to it now.
while the interpretation of an arbitration agreement is generally a matter of state law,see arthur andersen llp carlisle,slip,at perry thomas,the faa imposes certain rules of fundamental importance,including the basic precept that arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion,volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior.
in,congress enacted the united states arbitration act,as the faa was formerly known,for the express purpose of making valid and enforceable written provisions or agreements for arbitration of disputes arising out of contracts,maritime transactions,or commerce among the states or territories or with foreign nations.stat.reenacted and codified in,see stat.the faa provides,in pertinent part,that a written provision in any maritime transaction calling for the arbitration of a controversy arising out of such transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,under the faa,a party to an arbitration agreement may petition a united states district court for an order directing that arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.consistent with these provisions,we have said on numerous occasions that the central or primary purpose of the faa is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.volt,supra,at mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,see also doctor associates,casarotto.see generally.
whether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,courts and arbitrators must give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties.volt,supra,at.in this endeavor,as with any other contract,the parties intentions control.mitsubishi motors soler.this is because an arbitrator derives his or her powers from the parties agreement to forgo the legal process and submit their disputes to private dispute resolution.see technologies,communications workers,a rbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes only because the parties have agreed in advance to submit such grievances to arbitration mitsubishi motors,supra,at by agreeing to arbitrate,a party trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration see also steelworkers warrior gulf nav,an arbitrator has no general charter to administer justice for a community which transcends the parties but rather is part of a system of created by and confined to the parties internal quotation marks omitted.
underscoring the consensual nature of private dispute resolution,we have held that parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.mastrobuono,supra,at see also technologies,supra,at.for example,we have held that parties may agree to limit the issues they choose to arbitrate,see mitsubishi motors,supra,at,and may agree on rules under which any arbitration will proceed,volt,supra,at.they may choose who will resolve specific disputes,app.alexander,burchell marsh,how,see also international produce,rosshavet,the most arbitrators are those who are prominent and experienced members of the specific business community in which the dispute to be arbitrated arose cert.denied.
we think it is also clear from our precedents and the contractual nature of arbitration that parties may specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their disputes.see eeoc waffle house,n othing in the faa authorizes a court to compel arbitration of any issues,or by any parties,that are not already covered in the agreement emphasis added moses cone memorial hospital mercury constr,a n arbitration agreement must be enforced notwithstanding the presence of other persons who are parties to the underlying dispute but not to the arbitration agreement steelworkers,supra,at an arbitrator has no general charter to administer justice for a community which transcends the parties internal quotation marks omitted accord,first options of chicago,kaplan,a rbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties it is a way to resolve those disputes but only those disputes that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration emphasis added.it falls to courts and arbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations,and when doing so,courts and arbitrators must not lose sight of the purpose of the exercise to give effect to the intent of the parties.volt,at.
from these principles,it follows that a party may not be compelled under the faa to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.in this case,however,the arbitration panel imposed class arbitration even though the parties concurred that they had reached no agreement on that issue,see app.the critical point,in the view of the arbitration panel,was that petitioners did not establish that the parties to the charter agreements intended to preclude class arbitration.app.to pet.for cert.even though the parties are sophisticated business entities,even though there is no tradition of class arbitration under maritime law,and even though animalfeeds does not dispute that it is customary for the shipper to choose the charter party that is used for a particular shipment,the panel regarded the agreement silence on the question of class arbitration as dispositive.the panel conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foundational faa principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.
in certain contexts,it is appropriate to presume that parties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are necessary to give effect to the parties agreement.thus,we have said that procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide.howsam dean witter reynolds,quoting john wiley sons,livingston.this recognition is grounded in the background principle that w hen the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties,a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.restatement second of contracts.
an implicit agreement to authorize arbitration,however,is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of the parties agreement to arbitrate.this is so because arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it can not be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator.in bilateral arbitration,parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution lower costs,greater efficiency and speed,and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.see gilmer lane,mitsubishi motors,at see also penn plaza llc pyett,slip,at parties generally favor arbitration precisely because of the economics of dispute resolution citing circuit city stores,adams,supra,at parties usually choose an arbitrator because they trust his knowledge and judgment concerning the demands and norms of industrial relations but the relative benefits of arbitration are much less assured,giving reason to doubt the parties mutual consent to resolve disputes through arbitration.first options,supra,at noting that one can understand why courts might hesitate to interpret silence or ambiguity on the who should decide arbitrability point as giving the arbitrators that power,for doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate contrary to their expectations.
consider just some of the fundamental changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to arbitration.an arbitrator chosen according to an procedure,see,supra,at,no longer resolves a single dispute between the parties to a single agreement,but instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of parties.see app.w e believe domestic class members could be in the hundreds and that t here could be class members that ship to and from the who are not domestic who we think would be covered see also,bazzle,at,at involving a class of individuals that was awarded damages,fees,and costs of more than million by a single arbitrator.under the class rules,the presumption of privacy and confidentiality that applies in many bilateral arbitrations shall not apply in class arbitrations,see addendum to brief for american arbitration association as amicus curiae class rule a,thus potentially frustrating the parties assumptions when they agreed to arbitrate.the arbitrator award no longer purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitration agreement,but adjudicates the rights of absent parties as well.ortiz fibreboard,noting that the burden of justification rests on the exception to the general rule that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process internal quotation marks omitted.and the commercial stakes of arbitration are comparable to those of litigation,app.in,at,even though the scope of judicial review is much more limited,see hall street,at.we think that the differences between bilateral and arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,consistent with their limited powers under the faa,that the parties mere silence on the issue of arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings 
the dissent minimizes these crucial differences by characterizing the question before the arbitrators as being merely what procedural mode was available to present animalfeeds claims.post,at.if the question were that simple,there would be no need to consider the parties intent with respect to class arbitration.see howsam,supra,at committing procedural questions presumptively to the arbitrator discretion internal quotation marks omitted.but the faa requires more.contrary to the dissent,but consistent with our precedents emphasizing the consensual basis of arbitration,we see the question as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class arbitration.here,where the parties stipulated that there was no agreement on this question,it follows that the parties can not be compelled to submit their dispute to class arbitration.
for these reasons,the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

we have equated to final decisions a slim set of collateral orders that share these characteristics they are conclusive,they resolve important questions separate from the merits,and they are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.mohawk industries,carpenter,slip,at quoting swint chambers county comm n.o rders relating to class certification in federal court,it is settled,do not fit that bill.coopers lybrand livesay,

section of the faa,governing appellate review of district court arbitration orders,lists as an appealable disposition a district court decision confirming or denying confirmation of an award or partial award.a d.notably,the arbitrators in the matter at hand labeled their decision partial final clause construction award.app.to pet.for cert.it can not be true,however,that parties or arbitrators can gain instant review by slicing off a preliminary decision or a procedural order and declaring its resolution a partial award.hall street associates,mattel,faa,which provide for expedited review to confirm,vacate,or modify arbitration awards,substantiat e a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.

receptivity to review of preliminary rulings rendered by arbitrators,however,is hardly universal.see dealer computer,dub herring ford,arbitration panel preliminary ruling that contract did not bar class proceedings held not ripe for review arbitrators had not yet determined that arbitration should proceed on behalf of a class metallgesellschaft,at,feinberg,dissenting piecemeal review will make arbitration more like litigation,a result not to be desired.it would be better to minimize the number of occasions the parties to arbitration can come to court on the whole,this benefits the parties,the arbitration process and the courts.
while lower court opinions are thus divided,this much is plain no decision of this court,until today,has ever approved immediate judicial review of an arbitrator decision as preliminary as the partial award made in this case 
even if had a plea ripe for judicial review,the court should reject it on the merits.recall that the parties jointly asked the arbitrators to decide,initially,whether the arbitration clause in their shipping contracts permitted class proceedings.see supra,at.the panel did just what it was commissioned to do.it construed the broad arbitration clause covering a ny dispute arising from the making,performance or termination of this charter party,app.to pet.for cert.and ruled,expressly and only,that the clause permitted class arbitration.the court acts without warrant in allowing essentially to repudiate its submission of the issue to the arbitration panel,and to gain,in place of the arbitrators judgment,this court de novo determination.
the controlling faa prescription,a authorizes a court to vacate an arbitration panel decision only in very unusual circumstances.first options of chicago,kaplan.the four grounds for vacatur codified in a restate the longstanding rule that,i f an arbitration award is within the submission,and contains the honest decision of the arbitrators,after a full and fair hearing of the parties,a court will not set the award aside for error,either in law or fact.burchell marsh,how.
the sole ground invokes for vacating the arbitrators decision is a.the question under that provision is whether the arbitrators had the power,based on the parties submissions or the arbitration agreement,to reach a certain issue,not whether the arbitrators correctly decided that issue.dirussa dean witter reynolds,comprehensive accounting rudell.the parties supplemental agreement,referring the issue to an arbitration panel,undoubtedly empowered the arbitrators to render their decision.that scarcely debatable point should resolve this case.
the court characterization of the arbitration panel decision as resting on policy,not law,is hardly fair comment,for policy is not so much as mentioned in the arbitrators award.instead,the panel tied its conclusion that the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration,app.to pet.for cert,to new york law,federal maritime law,and decisions made by other panels pursuant to rule of the american arbitration association supplementary rules for class arbitrations,at.
at the outset of its explanation,the panel rejected the argument,proffered by animalfeeds,that this court decision in green tree financial bazzle,settled the matter by requir ing clear language that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class action.app.to pet.for cert.emphasis added.agreeing with in this regard,the panel said that the test it employed looked to the language of the particular agreement to gauge whether the parties intended to permit or to preclude class action s.ibid.concentrating on the wording of the arbitration clause,the panel observed,is consistent with new york law as articulated by the new york court of appeals and with federal maritime law.ibid 
emphasizing the breadth of the clause in question any dispute arising from the making,performance or termination of this charter party shall be put to arbitration,at the panel noted that numerous other partial awards had relied on language similarly comprehensive to permit class proceedings in a wide variety of settings.at.the panel further noted that many of the other panels had rejected arguments similar to those advanced by.at.
the court features a statement counsel for animalfeeds made at the hearing before the arbitration panel,and maintains that it belies any argument that the clause in question permits class arbitration all the parties agree that when a contract is silent on an issue there been no agreement that has been reached on that issue.ante,at quoting app.see ante,at,and.the sentence quoted from the hearing transcript concluded therefore there has been no agreement to bar class arbitrations.app.emphasis added.counsel quickly clarified his position it also undisputed that the arbitration clause here contains broad language and this language should be interpreted to permit class arbitrations.at.see also,at noting consistent recognition by arbitration panels that a silent broadly worded arbitration clause,just like the one at issue here,should be construed to permit class arbitration at b road language silent as to class proceedings should be interpreted to permit a class proceeding.
the panel acknowledged,had vigorously argued,with the support of expert testimony,that the bulk of international shippers would never intend to have their disputes decided in a class arbitration.app.to pet.for cert.that concern,the panel suggested,might be met at a later stage if a class is certified,the panel noted,class membership could be confined to those who affirmatively opt in to the proceeding.ibid.
the question properly before the court is not whether the arbitrators ruling was erroneous,but whether the arbitrators exceeded their powers.a.the arbitrators decided a threshold issue,explicitly committed to them,see supra,at,about the procedural mode available for presentation of animalfeeds antitrust claims.shady grove orthopedic associates,allstate ins,plurality opinion slip,at r ules allowing multiple claims and claims by or against multiple parties to be litigated together neither change plaintiffs separate entitlements to relief nor abridge defendants rights they alter only how the claims are processed.that the arbitrators endeavored to perform their assigned task honestly is not contested.courts do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in reviewing decisions of lower courts.paperworkers misco.the arbitrators here not merely arguably,but certainly,constru ed the contract with fidelity to their commission.ibid.this court,therefore,may not disturb the arbitrators judgment,even if convinced that serious error infected the panel award.ibid.
the court not only intrudes on a decision the parties referred to arbitrators.it compounds the intrusion by according the arbitrators no opportunity to clarify their decision and thereby to cure the error the court perceives.section b,the court asserts,invests in this tribunal authority to decide the question that was originally referred to the panel.ante,at.the controlling provision,however,says nothing of the kind.section b reads,in full if an award is vacated and the time within which the agreement required the award to be made has not expired,the court may,in its discretion,direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.emphasis added.just as a provides no justification for the court disposition,see supra,at and this page,so,too,b provides no grounding for the court peremptory action.
for arbitrators to consider whether a claim should proceed on a class basis,the court apparently demands contractual language one can read as affirmatively authorizing class arbitration.see ante,at a party may not be compelled under the faa to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.ante,at.the breadth of the arbitration clause,and the absence of any provision waiving or banning class proceedings will not do.ante,at.
the court ties the requirement of affirmative authorization to the basic precept that arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion.ante,at quoting volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior.parties may specify with whom they choose to arbitrate,the court observes,just as they may limit the issues they choose to arbitrate.ante,at.but arbitrators,in delineating an appropriate class,need not,and should not,disregard such contractual constraints.in this case,for example,animalfeeds proposes to pursue,on behalf of a class,only claims arising out of any charter party agreement that provides for arbitration.app.to pet.for cert.emphasis added.should the arbitrators certify the proposed class,they would adjudicate only the rights of persons with whom agreed to arbitrate,and only issues subject to arbitration.ante,at emphasis omitted.
the court also links its requirement to the parties right to stipulate rules under which arbitration may proceed.see ibid.the question,however,is the proper default rule when there is no stipulation.arbitration provisions,this court has noted,are a species of clauses.see scherk.suppose the parties had chosen a new york judicial forum for resolution of any dispute involving a contract for ocean carriage of goods.there is little question that the designated court,state or federal,would have authority to conduct claims like animalfeeds on a class basis.why should the prospect vanish when the any dispute clause is contained in an arbitration agreement connecticut general life ins.sun life assurance of canada,reading contract authorization to arbitrate a ny dispute to permit consolidation of arbitrations.if the court is right that arbitrators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class proceedings,see ante,at,then the claimant should retain its right to proceed in that format in court.
when adjudication is costly and individual claims are no more than modest in size,class proceedings may be the thing,without them,potential claimants will have little,if any,incentive to seek vindication of their rights.amchem products,windsor,carnegie household int l,the realistic alternative to a class action is not million individual suits,but zero individual suits,as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for.mindful that disallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the dimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can mount,i note some stopping points in the court decision.
first,the court does not insist on express consent to class arbitration.class arbitration may be ordered if there is a contractual basis for concluding that the part ies agreed to submit to class arbitration ante,at see ante,at,we have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support a finding that the parties agreed to authorize arbitration.second,by observing that the parties here are sophisticated business entities,and that it is customary for the shipper to choose the charter party that is used for a particular shipment,the court apparently spares from its requirement contracts of adhesion presented on a basis.ante,at.while these qualifications limit the scope of the court decision,i remain persuaded that the arbitrators judgment should not have been disturbed.
for the foregoing reasons,i would dismiss the petition for want of a controversy ripe for judicial review.were i to reach the merits,i would affirm the second circuit judgment confirming the arbitrators decision.
