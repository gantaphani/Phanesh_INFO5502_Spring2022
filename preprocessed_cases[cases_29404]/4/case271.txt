kentucky speedway,llc kys sued both the national association of stock car auto racing,nascar and an affiliated company that owns multiple racetracks called international speedway corporation isc,alleging that they violated federal antitrust laws by not sanctioning a sprint cup race at kys racetrack in kentucky and by preventing kys from purchasing other racetracks that already host such a race.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nascar and isc after determining that the opinions of kys expert witnesses were unreliable.summary judgment was also granted because kys failed to establish sufficient proof of an antitrust injury.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual.nascar 
nascar races are among the most popular sporting events in the country.organized in,nascar grew from humble beginnings by racing cars at daytona beach,florida.today,nascar sanctions races at tracks in states and abroad.the company is privately owned by the france family,including james france and his niece,lesa france kennedy.another member of the france family,bill france,served as the chairman and ceo of nascar until.
nascar is in the business of sanctioning races.sanctioning is the process of organizing and staging a race,including the selection of venues,picking drivers,and setting the rules.races are highly coveted by the owners of racetracks around the country due to the consistently high quality and profitability of these events.
but not all nascar events are created equal.one kind of event is prized by racetrack owners above all others a nascar sprint cup race.sprint became the sponsor of this racing series in immediately prior to the series was sponsored by nextel.this racing series is widely considered to be the major leagues of racing.all other events,like the busch series,are analogous to the minor leagues.in terms of market share,kys alleges that nascar owns a share of the market the sanctioning market.we will assume that this allegation is true for the purposes of this opinion.
not every racetrack capable of hosting a sprint cup race,however,can obtain one.this is because nascar selects locations for sprint cup races based on a number of factors,including the condition of the facility,the market area,whether the area has a history of supporting motor sports and whether it is a promising area for expansion,the competition schedule,the travel requirements for the drivers and officials,weather conditions,the history of facility operations and management,the financial health of the facility,prior relationships with nascar,historical preservation,and nascar business goals.
there can be no sprint cup any other races for that racetracks.bill france,realized this and so,in,incorporated isc,the other defendant in this case.over the years,isc has raised funds through public offerings of its shares,which it has used to finance the acquisition and development of additional racing facilities.although isc is a public company subject to the oversight of isc board of directors,the france family retains control and has made all major decisions for the company,including but not limited to the selection of track locations,asset acquisitions,asset sales,and growth of which isc has disclosed in its filings with the securities and exchange commission.
isc sought to expand into new geographic markets and acquire and construct new venues beginning in the.before,isc owned interests in four facilities that currently host sprint cup races.between and,isc acquired ownership interests in eight additional venues,which also host the sprint cup races.percent of all sprint cup races are currently held at racetracks owned at least in part by isc.the remaining operate on independent tracks that are not parties in this case.speedway motorsports,smi is the only company other than isc that owns more than one racetrack hosting a sprint cup race.kys calls the market for hosting sprint cup races the hosting market.again,for the purpose of this opinion,we will assume that this market definition is accurate.
in addition to acquiring ownership stakes in racing venues,isc sought and obtained rights of first refusal from several independent racetracks already hosting nascar events.one such agreement gave isc the right to be first in line to negotiate for the purchase of the pocono raceway in long pond,pennsylvania if a third party contacted the owner seeking to purchase a share of the facility.according to isc,t hese agreements do not preclude another buyer from purchasing the facilities,they have never resulted in the purchase of a track by isc,and they offer no guarantee that isc will purchase or even bid on the track subject to that right.kys has not contested this claim.
isc does not impose any exclusive dealing arrangement,which means that companies other than nascar have been permitted to sanction races at isc racetracks.one of isc corporate representatives has nevertheless conceded that isc has the ability,hypothetically,to prevent sanctioning bodies other than nascar from running races on isc tracks by denying access to our asphalt,by simply declining to allow the alternative sanctioning body to use isc venues.
kys and its racetrack 
as nascar popularity surged in the,kys investors started planning the construction of a mile racetrack in northern kentucky.prior to kys completion,nascar warned kys that the area surrounding kentucky was saturated with sprint cup races held at facilities in indianapolis,indiana bristol,tennessee talladega,florida and richmond,virginia.construction nevertheless continued.in,the racetrack was completed.
the kys facilities have received rave reviews.even nascar former chairman bill france,acknowledged that kys did everything right.echoing that praise,john saunders,chief operating officer and executive vice president of isc,called kys a asset.drivers have also praised the track.championship driver darrell waltrip,for example,said that he never talked to a driver that did like the racetrack.
attendance records bolster the claim that kys facility is.in june,kys hosted a craftsman truck race.tickets sold out,luxury suites were full,and the race had a roster full of impressive sponsors.indeed,the craftsman truck race at kys facility continues to be among the in the craftsman series nationwide.craftsman truck races are events.
other racing events held at the racetrack have been similarly successful.kys hosted an indy racing league irl race in and now regularly hosts irl races.in,kys branched out and hosted a race.although no longer sponsors this racing series,we will continue to refer to the series as the busch series for the sake of simplicity.the busch race sold out and was one of the and busch races in the country.kys continues to host races.the busch series is also sanctioned by nascar.
despite this string of successes,kys has failed to attract a race from the most profitable and racing sprint cup.kys claims,in essence,that it built a facility that has not been able to attract a event.
alleged anticompetitive conduct 
kys blames its failure to obtain a sprint cup race on allegedly anticompetitive conduct by nascar and isc,pointing to several alleged practices that purportedly show that nascar and isc have colluded to shut out competition in the sanctioning and hosting markets,respectively.these practices include acting jointly to set the nascar cup schedule,to develop new markets,and to decide which tracks will host premium races.
kys also complains about nascar and isc practice of working together to obtain agreements from independent racetracks for little or no consideration.these agreements allow isc to be the bidder for independent racetracks in the event that the owners of the racetrack express an interest in selling the same.
two other nascar and isc business practices,however,are particularly objectionable to kys.first,nascar and isc have purportedly conspired to increase isc share of the hosting market.for example,nascar allegedly refused to sanction a sprint cup race at the speedway in florida until isc was permitted to purchase a major interest.kys also claims that nascar threatened to pull sprint cup races from the las vegas motor speedway in nevada unless isc was allowed to purchase the facility.isc has thus allegedly increased its share of the hosting market by using nascar sprint cup series as a bargaining chip.
second,kys asserts that nascar and isc have enlisted at least one other independent help them dominate their respective markets.kys has tried to obtain a sprint cup race by purchasing an independent racetrack that already has this race so that kys can move the race to its northern kentucky facility.but no independent track has agreed to sell,even though kys has allegedly submitted good offers.moreover,kys alleged that isc and smi have agreed not to compete with each other in the hosting market by,for example,entering into a joint venture to purchase dover motorsports,the owner of an independent speedway in delaware,while kys unsuccessfully sought to purchase the same company in order to secure a sprint cup race.
the sole injury that kys claims to have suffered is the failure to host a sprint cup race,which kys contends has caused it a loss of at least million.according to kys,this injury flows from nascar and isc anticompetitive conduct,calculated to drive independent racetracks like kys out of the hosting market while preventing future businesses from challenging nascar dominance in the sanctioning market.
procedural background 
convinced that nascar and isc conduct has been anticompetitive,kys filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of kentucky in july,alleging that nascar and isc violated sections and of the sherman antitrust act,and.kys specifically alleged unlawful monopolization of the sanctioning market by nascar under,illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade by nascar and isc under involving an alleged conspiracy between themselves and other companies that control tracks hosting events,conspiracy to monopolize the hosting and sanctioning markets under based on the same allegations as the conspiracy,and attempted monopolization of the hosting market by isc under.
nascar and isc filed separate motions to dismiss in september of the same year.in january,the district court denied the motions,concluding that kys had properly alleged antitrust claims.the court also noted,however,that i t may well be that plaintiff case will fail when scrutinized after discovery under the higher standards of proof that will prevail on summary judgment or at trial.speedway,llc nascar,d.
after discovery was complete,and after kys filed a second amended complaint,nascar and isc filed a joint motion for summary judgment in august.the district court granted the motion in january,holding that there was insufficient evidence supporting kys definitions of the hosting and sanctioning markets because the reports and deposition testimony of kys experts could not withstand scrutiny under the supreme court test laid out in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.alternatively,the court concluded that kys suit was indistinguishable from a straightforward jilted distributor case,meaning that kys could not survive summary judgment because kys had failed to establish an antitrust injury.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standards of review 
as to the admissibility of expert testimony,this court applies the standard.hardyman norfolk ry,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.brown raymond,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
with regard to the grant of summary judgment,we review the district court decision de novo.allen highlands hosp,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
exclusion of expert testimony 
turning now to the issues on appeal,kys first argues that the district court erroneously excluded the testimony of its two key experts.kys claims are governed by rule of the federal rules of evidence,which controls the admissibility of all types of expert testimony.the rule provides as follows 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
according to daubert,a district court task in assessing evidence proffered under rule is to determine whether the evidence both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.at.the district court must consider whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.id.at.
as an initial matter,kys urges us to review the district court order de novo because of the court alleged failure to perform its function.de novo review,however,is appropriate only where the district court excludes expert testimony on the basis of an incomplete record,or after conducting nothing more than a perfunctory review.see,jahn equine,psc,cir reversing under the de novo standard of review where the district court prematurely excluded experts reports without conducting a daubert hearing or allowing the parties to submit briefs goebel denver rio grande,cir reviewing de novo where t here is not a single explicit statement on the record to indicate that the district court ever conducted any form of daubert analysis whatsoever.because the district court analysis in the present case does not suffer from these deficiencies,de novo review is inappropriate.
regarding the district court analysis,kys contests the court decision to exclude the expert opinions of andrew zimbalist and keith leffler.kys argues that zimbalist used several reliable and methods that pass muster under daubert and other caselaw for defining the relevant markets.as for leffler,kys contends that the court erroneously determined that his opinions relied entirely on zimbalist definition of the relevant markets,when in fact leffler views regarding nascar and isc allegedly anticompetitive conduct should survive even if zimbalist opinions are excluded.we will discuss each exclusion in turn.
zimbalist was hired by kys primarily to define the relevant markets in this sanctioning market and the hosting market.but he also opined on the question of whether nascar and isc conduct was anticompetitive in nature,concluding that their practices did in fact have anticompetitive consequences.
the district court struck zimbalist report and deposition testimony because he had included only busch series and races as possible substitutes for attending live nascar racing events or watching them on television.it concluded that zimbalist should have considered other possibly other forms of substitutes.furthermore,the court concluded that the ssnip test which stands for small but significant increase in price zimbalist used to define the markets did not meet the daubert criteria.specifically,the court found that zimbalist used his own version of the test,a version that had not been tested,had not been subjected to peer review,had no controlling standards,had no demonstrable showing of support within the scientific community,and was produced solely for purposes of the instant litigation.our independent review of the record convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in so ruling.
kys bears the burden of defining the relevant market within which the alleged anticompetitive effects of nascar and isc actions occur.see worldwide basketball sport tours,ncaa,cir f
