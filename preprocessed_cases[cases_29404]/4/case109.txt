members of a class of present and former professional models,and their counsel appeal from two orders entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,approving settlements and awarding attorneys fees in a class action brought against defendant modeling agencies for conspiracy to fix commissions charged to members of plaintiff class,in violation of the sherman act.also before us are appeals from an order denying reconsideration of those orders and an order allocating the proceeds of settlement with a bankrupt defendant.the appellants contend that the district court erred in ordering the distribution of settlement proceeds in excess of recognized losses to various charities rather than to the class members as treble damages and prejudgment interest allocating the funds derived from the estate of a bankrupt defendant without additional notice to the class and applying the wrong standard in awarding counsel fees,with the result that the fee allowance to counsel for is inadequate.
for the reasons that follow,we vacate the orders appealed from insofar as they relate to the distribution of settlement proceeds and the award of counsel fees and remand the case to the district court for reconsideration of those matters and we affirm the orders in all other respects.
background 
litigation and settlement 
in plaintiffs counsel began to investigate various business practices in the modeling agency industry.through this investigation,plaintiffs counsel purportedly developed evidence that the leading new york modeling agencies,acting in concert since the,falsely claimed exemption from the commission rate cap imposed on employment agencies under article of the new york general business law by asserting that they were managers and only incidentally involved in procuring employment for their models,and raised the standard rate of model commissions from to,where it has stayed since the late.no government agency participated in the investigation or the ensuing litigation.
the plaintiffs filed their first complaint alleging violation of section of the sherman act,new york general business law article,and new york common law on june.the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants conspired to uniformly charge models a commission of exceeding the maximum allowed by new york law for employment that the defendants used their trade association,model management corporation international model managers association,to advance their collusive scheme.this action eventually was consolidated with four similar actions.on september,the plaintiffs filed their first consolidated amended complaint.on november,the district court determined that it would address class certification before permitting discovery on the merits.the district court referred discovery matters relating to class certification to magistrate judge henry pitman.
responding to various motions to dismiss the complaint,the district court,by opinion and order dated january,declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims,denied the motion to dismiss as to the claims of under the sherman act within the period allowed by the statute of limitation,and gave leave to the tolling of claims arising prior to june.masters wilhelmina model agency,civ,wl.in a later order,the district court dismissed claims accruing prior to june,as barred by the statute of limitations.masters wilhelmina model agency,civ,wl.
a second consolidated amended complaint was filed on february,and a third on april.the district court granted the motion for class certification on july,certifying a plaintiff class consisting of current and former models who had oral or written contracts with any of the defendants from june onward.fears wilhelmina model agency,civ,wl july.appellant,boies,schiller flexner llp appellant or boies schiller,was approved as lead class counsel.id.at.thereafter,next petitioned this court for interlocutory review of the district court july class certification order.the petition was denied on december.
the district court then permitted discovery on the merits to proceed,again with magistrate judge pitman supervising the process.the discovery process was a long and difficult one,marked by delay and resistance.during the process,magistrate judge pitman admonished both sides and twice sanctioned plaintiffs attorneys for their discovery practices.in the course of discovery,the plaintiffs identified,obtained,inspected and analyzed more than pages of documents produced by the defendants and nonparties.there were formal conferences,as well as several informal conferences,before magistrate judge pitman during merits discovery.these conferences were required in order to resolve disputes relating to interrogatories,document production,and depositions.toward the end of the discovery process,magistrate judge pitman imposed a sanction against plaintiffs attorneys and ordered them to exclude certain of their time from their fee petition as a further sanction.
at the conclusion of merits discovery,motions by defendants for summary judgment were filed and the submissions were voluminous.on march,the district court denied summary judgment as to all but defendant q model management on plaintiffs claims.fears wilhelmina model agency,civ,wl.the court determined that q model management was founded long after the formation of the alleged conspiracy and never held membership in the trade association.with regard to the other defendants,the district court determined that plaintiffs evidence would support a jury finding that the modeling agency business was an industry inundated with collusion.id.at.
settlement negotiations began with certain defendants only after the court denied defendants motions for summary judgment and were heavily influenced by the real prospect of the defendants bankruptcy.from late march until the scheduled trial date of june,the plaintiffs reached preliminary settlements with all defendants except for click.these preliminary settlements took the form of letter agreements the letter agreements signed in or about may of by the attorneys for each of the settling defendants and the class attorneys.the letter agreements outlined the settlement terms,including the amount of each defendant contribution and the manner of payment.each of these agreements included the following provision 
this is a binding agreement.any future disagreement s as to the form or content of the formal settlement agreement and final judgment,any other ancillary papers,will be resolved by the honorable harold baer,without right of appeal.
jury selection for the trial against click commenced on june,and opening statements were delivered on june.the plaintiffs presented lay witnesses during the first day of trial,including two of the class representatives,carolyn fears and tiffany connor.on june,the plaintiffs reached a settlement with click,and the jury was dismissed.the parties thereafter proceeded to negotiate a formal settlement agreement to be presented to the district court for approval.a sticking point in the negotiations was the disposition of unclaimed or unpaid funds the excess funds that might remain after payment to the class members of their actual losses.appellants accused defendant next of a repudiation of the settlement for failure to provide for the reversion of excess funds.next denies that its repudiation was last minute,contending that its counsel had notified all other counsel in the case three months before the settlement agreement was signed that his client was not on board with regard to the proposed disposition of excess funds.
in any event,the final settlement agreement the agreement was signed on october,with i boss models,ii click model management,iii dna model management,llc iv ford models,v gerard ford vi images management vii img models,viii img worldwide,ix next management and x wilhelmina international,and xi zoli management.the agreement created a settlement fund in excess of,which was to be distributed pro rata to class members based on the amount of commissions paid by each member in excess of,plus interest.
as to distribution of the settlement fund,paragraph of the agreement specifically provided 
b every authorized claimant shall be paid from the net settlement fund a portion of his or her total recognized loss,which shall be calculated as follows 
an authorized claimant recognized loss for any transaction on which he or she paid a commission to a defendant during the relevant period shall be the difference,if any,between a the commission that the authorized claimant paid to the defendant and b ten percent of the amount of the transaction.there shall be no recognized loss for any transaction on which the authorized claimant paid no commission,or for any transaction on which the authorized claimant paid a commission of ten percent or less.
an authorized claimant total recognized loss shall be the sum of all of his or her recognized losses.
if the sum of the total recognized losses of all authorized claimants who submit valid and timely proof of claim forms is equal to or greater than the amount of the net settlement fund,then the net settlement fund shall be distributed to all authorized claimants on a pro rata basis 
if the sum of the total recognized losses of all authorized claimants who submit valid and timely proof of claim forms is less than the amount of the net settlement fund,then the court shall,in its discretion,determine the disposition of the amount representing the difference between the two figures,after hearing the views of the parties hereto as to such disposition.
as to awards to counsel and certain representative plaintiffs,the agreement provided 
plaintiffs settlement counsel may submit an application or applications the fee and expense application for distributions from the settlement fund for a an award of attorneys fees plus b reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with prosecuting the action c plus any interest on such attorneys fees and expenses at the same rate and for the same periods as earned by the settlement fund until paid as may be awarded by the court and d for incentive awards and reimbursement of expenses to certain representative plaintiffs in prosecuting the action.plaintiffs settlement counsel reserve the right to make additional applications for fees and expenses incurred.however,fees or expenses of plaintiffs counsel may be paid from the settlement fund only after the final settlement date occurs for a settling defendant from whose settlement payments such fees or expenses will be paid.
the portion of the fee and expense award attributable to any settling defendant shall be paid to plaintiffs settlement counsel from the settlement fund,as ordered,after the final settlement date for such settling defendant,and after the court executes a written order awarding such fees and expenses,notwithstanding the existence of any timely filed objections thereto,or potential appeal therefrom,subject to the joint and several obligation of plaintiffs settlement counsel to make appropriate refund repayments to the settlement fund as more particularly set forth below in paragraph.plaintiffs settlement counsel shall thereafter allocate the attorneys fees amongst plaintiffs counsel in a manner in which plaintiffs settlement counsel in good faith believe reflects the contributions of such counsel to the prosecution and settlement of the action.
the agreement also provided for a number of injunctive provisions that were designed to address and end certain practices which disadvantaged models prior to the commencement of the litigation.such provisions included disclosure by settling defendants of all bookings and compensation received for each model,utilization of contracts with models specifying relevant compensation terms and practices and management services,and a prohibition against joining any model agencies or managers trade associations in the united states.
approval of the settlement 
a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement proposed in the agreement and for authorization to disseminate notice and claims forms was granted by the district court by order dated october.by that order,the district court found that the proposed settlements with the settling defendants set forth in the settlement agreement,subject to final determination following a hearing after notice to the class,is sufficiently fair,reasonable and adequate to authorize dissemination of the notice.the order specified the form and manner of service of the notice and dates for filing objections to the settlement,exclusion from the class,and papers in support of the settlement.it fixed december,for a hearing to determine whether the settlement should be approved and whether the motion of plaintiffs counsel for an award of attorneys fees and expenses and for payments to certain representative plaintiffs should be granted.
by affidavit dated december,the claims administrator appointed by the court reported that notices had been mailed to potential class members by mail and that a summary notice of the proposed settlement had been published in usa today on october.the notice advised that the deadline for filing proofs of claim had been fixed at january.by opinion and order dated may,the district court granted in part and denied in part the motion originally filed by plaintiffs on december,for approval of the final proposed settlement,including incentive awards and distributions to claimants,attorneys fees and expenses and distribution of residual funds.fears wilhelmina model agency,civ,wl may.
opinion and order approving settlement and directing distribution 
with respect to the terms of settlement,the court reviewed the provisions of the settlement agreement providing for the creation of a settlement fund and injunctive and equitable relief.the court observed that t he portion of the agreement may prove more valuable to the models than the monetary settlement and should not be overlooked in any analysis of the success of this lawsuit.id.at.in approving the settlement as reasonable,the court found as follows 
this case involves an alleged scheme in the modeling industry by some of the industr y most powerful agencies.the issues were thoroughly investigated and aggressively litigated.plaintiffs success was never assured and,if the case had continued,plaintiffs would have had to prove a complex conspiracy to artificially fix the commission structure in the modeling industry.see,in re visa antitrust,d,the complexity of federal antitrust law is well known.settlement negotiations were conducted over months,at arm length,and between experienced and skilled attorneys with frequent pretrial conferences and motion practice.
based on all these findings,the agreement is reasonable.
included in the settlement approval were incentive awards in the sum of for each of the two named plaintiffs who were deposed and for each of the two trial witnesses and eight class representatives.id.the court noted that incentive awards were related to the individual personal risk and additional efforts to benefit the lawsuit.id.the district court conditioned its overall settlement approval upon the maintenance of a database by the claims administrator.id.at.the court noted that the claims administrator had incurred in expenses to the date of the opinion and order and had estimated an additional to in reimbursable fees and expenses related to the distribution of funds,tracking the issuance and deposits of checks to class members,and preparation of interim and final reports.id.at.
in its decision,the district court noted that defendant elite had filed a chapter petition in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york on february,that pursuant to the bankruptcy organization plan,the model representative would be deemed to have an unsecured claim of and that,based upon an estimated distribution,it was anticipated that the model representative would receive a cash distribution on the allowed model claims of between and.id.at.the total settlement fund of would be increased by the bankruptcy settlement,which provided that the settlement proceeds be held in escrow pending the entry of an allocation order by the district court.id.the bankruptcy court order approved the proposed settlement with elite as fair,reasonable and in the best interest of the debtor estate and creditors.id.that order included the following provision 
to the extent the allocation order directs that all or a portion of the model distribution be distributed a to charity or b to holders of any class claim other than claim filed on behalf of the class of plaintiffs in the fears action the individual model claims,that portion of the model distribution the excess distribution shall be redistributed to the plan administrator for a pro rata distribution to the holders of individual model claims to the extent they are allowed class claims in the bankruptcy case upon payment in full of all allowed individual model claims,any remaining excess distribution shall be distributed on a pro rata basis to certain other creditors and in accordance with the distribution priorities set forth in the plan approved by the bankruptcy court.
accordingly,the district court concluded that while it was required to allocate the proceeds of the elite settlement among the plaintiffs in this action,review of the substantive fairness of the settlement between plaintiffs and elite is unnecessary in view of the bankruptcy court settlement order.fears,wl,at.the district court observed that it was empowered by the elite reorganization plan to approve and direct the allocation of the proceeds of that settlement in this action,designated the fears action.id.
turning to the question of attorneys fees,the district court recognized the claim of plaintiffs counsel to a fee award of of the fund of plus unreimbursed expenses for a total of.id.at.the district court also recognized that the lodestar calculation number of hours reasonably expended times reasonable hourly rate,involving approximately professional hours,plus the expenses claimed,totaled.id.at.the court observed that the percentage fee award plus expenses requested was of the total fund and that the lodestar amount alone was substantially more than the amount of the claims filed to the date of the district court opinion.id.at.evaluating the factors to be considered in fixing a reasonable fee,the district court first addressed the time and labor expended by counsel.
in determining a reasonable attorneys fee,the district court considered several factors,including the time and labor expended by counsel the magnitude of the litigation the risk of litigation and the quality of representation.in examining the time and labor factor,the district court reviewed the hours spent and rates charged by each of the law firms representing the plaintiffs in computing their lodestar claims.because,as will be seen,the district court ultimately resolved the fee issue by awarding fees on the basis of a percentage of claims made,the district court determined that the lodestar calculation is primarily for crosscheck purposes.id.at.
as to the magnitude of the litigation,the district court took note of plaintiffs allegations that they were confronted with the need to establish a conspiracy that existed over a period of thirty years and involved as defendants some of the most venerable names in the modeling industry.id.at.as to the risk of litigation factor,the district court referred to the numerous motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,the extensive discovery conducted,the contingent nature of the litigation,and the advancement of tens of thousands of dollars in disbursements by class counsel.see id.the district court thereupon concluded that the manner in which this case unfolded demonstrates the significant possibility that class counsel could have failed to achieve any recovery at all and,consequently,no compensation.id.at.
finally,the district court found that the quality of representation by class counsel in this case appears to be satisfactory.id.the court further remarked that in having brought this lawsuit,the plaintiffs lawyers performed a valuable public service for which they are to be commended.id.the court,however,tempered this praise by referring to the conduct of the plaintiffs counsel during the discovery process and by imposing sanctions as a result of that conduct.id.the court opined that attorneys conduct throughout the litigation must be factored into the quality of representation analysis and,accordingly,reduced the award to include and emphasize its concern on this score.id.at.
the district court ultimately conclude d that a fair and appropriate fee is of the claims made against the settlement fund,including a separate mediated settlement in another action against img models,among other defendants.id.at.if translated into a percentage of the entire fund this would equal,or.id.the court determined that all claimed expenses would be allowed,bringing the fees and expenses total to.id.it also found that the estimated cost of fund administration within acceptable limits and noted that the fund might be increased by any contribution to be made by elite.id.at.
in deciding to award fees on the basis of funds claimed rather than on the basis of the settlement fund created,the district court recognized a split in authority,with the supreme court yet to weigh in on the issue.in declining to award fees on the basis of the total fund available,the court noted that court authorization of what can be analogized as a windfall to the attorneys would violate the second circuit clear intention to avoid such awards.id.at.the district court also found support for its position in the private securities litigation reform act of,stat,pslra and in the class action fairness act of,stat,cafa.see id.examining congressional intent.
turning to the question of distribution of the residual or unclaimed funds,the district court noted that the settlement agreement conferred discretion upon the court with regard to the disposition of such funds after hearing the views of the parties hereto as to such disposition.id.at.according to the court,
m ost defendants voiced concerns about the models being awarded any more than the amount of money arrived at by the agreed upon formula for their claim and some sought to have money returned to their clients,they then went on to suggest preferred charitable contributions.
the court determined to distribute the excess funds under the cy pres doctrine.id.at.the court met with representatives of various organizations designated by the parties and others to identify charities that would directly or indirectly benefit members of the class with the least administrative costs.the district court chose the following organizations to receive the residual funds and provided a brief description of their purposes and goals and the manner of allocation of the funds to be distributed beth israel medical center continuum women cardiac care network columbia presbyterian medical center eating disorders program columbia presbyterian medical center division on substance abuse columbia presbyterian medical center ovarian cancer repository new york university medical center civil division of the legal aid society and the heart truth.see id.at.
proceedings following the opinion and order 
on may,plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the opinion and order approving the settlement and directing distribution.overlooking the motion procedural deficiencies in the interest of deciding matters on the merits,fears wilhelmina model agency,civ,wl,at,the court rejected the contentions of error in the court decision to award single,rather than treble,damages and in its failure to award prejudgment interest.see id.at.the court reasoned that the unambiguous terms of the settlement agreement made no provision for the distributions sought and that it was bound under the circumstances to approve or disapprove the settlement negotiated by the parties.see id.reviewing its decision to award counsel fees equivalent to of the entire fund,the court determined that it had overlooked no decisions that might have directed a different outcome.see id.
in reaffirming the decision to distribute excess funds under the cy pres doctrine,the court noted that the settlement agreement included a specific provision allowing for the court to distribute such funds in the exercise of its discretion.the district court also noted that p laintiffs counsel gave at least tacit approval to the distribution scheme by proposing charitable organizations of his own.id.at.the court denied the motion for reconsideration in all respects,except that it granted the motion to the extent of clarifying the incentive awards to class representatives.see id.at.
final judgment orders were entered on may,as to defendants click model management,boss models,dna model management,ford models,gerard ford,images management,and img models and on may,as to next management,zoli management and wilhelmina international.on july,a settlement allocation order was entered as to defendant elite management.it noted that residual funds were to be distributed to a variety of charitable organizations and provided that the settlement escrow account elite contribution to the fears settlement shall be released to the elite plan administrator and the elite new york settlement proceeds shall be available for distribution according to the bankruptcy court order.
subsequent court orders authorized the claims administrator to begin mailing distributions to class members in accordance with their claims.the various charities designated as recipients of the excess funds have been advised that distribution to them must await this appeal.we have been advised of a motion pending in the district court to allow the filing of claims received from december,the outside date for filing fixed by the district court through june.before this court are pending motions by plaintiffs to supplement the record with five letters sent to the district court from counsel for plaintiffs,a renewed motion for the same relief,and a motion by defendant next to strike a portion of the appellants reply brief.
of the notice of appeal and the issues presented.
the notice of appeal filed in the district court on october,refers to an earlier notice of appeal filed on june,and addressed to the may,order approving the settlement.it recites that the briefing schedule relating to the earlier appeal was stayed to ensure the finality of district court proceedings.it further states the district court entered final judgment orders dismissing plaintiffs claims against the two remaining defendants elite model management,and model management corporation on september.therefore,final judgments have been entered on all claims against all defendants in the underlying action.included in the notice of appeal is a reservation of the right to move for supplemental attorneys fees and expenses.it appears that the notice of appeal of october,was timely filed,and no challenge has been raised as to its timeliness.
in the notice of appeal,plaintiffs and their counsel challenge 
the district court opinion and order dated may,insofar as that order a denied plaintiffs request for payment of up to treble damages and prejudgment interest to class members,b denied in part plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees,c prematurely determined that there were unclaimed funds and allocated those funds to charities 
the district court opinion and order dated june,denying plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the may order and 
the district court elite model management settlement allocation order dated july,denying plaintiffs request for entry of an allocation order regarding funds to be received from the bankrupt estate of emmc,formerly known as and sued here as elite model management.
ii.of the distribution of remaining funds.
the settlement agreement approved by the district court clearly contemplated the need to provide for the distribution of any excess funds that might remain after all class members were fully compensated for their actual losses.if those losses,designated as total recognized losses,were less than the amount of the net settlement fund,the agreement provided for the court to determine the disposition of the amount representing the differences between the two figures,after hearing the views of the parties hereto as to such disposition.of course,it was not certain at the time the agreement was entered into whether there would be excess funds,and the agreement accordingly provided that if total recognized losses exceeded the net settlement fund,the class members would receive distribution on a pro rata basis.
in support of their contention that the excess funds should be applied toward treble damages rather than allocated to charities under the cy pres doctrine,plaintiffs bring to our attention the supreme court observation that the antitrust private action was created primarily as a remedy for the victims of antitrust violations.treble damages make the remedy meaningful by the difficulty of maintaining a private suit under the antitrust laws.am.soc y of mech.eng rs,hydrolevel,d quoting brunswick pueblo,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we have noted that f ull restitution of plaintiffs losses is a no less central objective of the treble damage provision than the encouragement of private antitrust enforcement.hydrolevel am.soc y of mech.eng rs,cir.
the defendants contend that the letter agreements that preceded the settlement agreement established the district court as the final authority for the resolution of any disagreement as to the distribution of the excess funds,since they provide that a ny future disagreements as to the form or content of the formal settlement agreement will be resolved by the district court without right of appeal.assuming that the letter agreements are binding at this point,the defendants contention is based on a misreading of the agreements.the parties that signed the letter agreements and not all of them did do not disagree as to the form or content,both of which are plain.the district court,after hearing the views of the parties,is vested with discretion as to the disposition of the excess funds.defendants argue that the district court acted reasonably in applying the cy pres doctrine and that plaintiffs were among those who recommended specific charitable organizations.they find support for their position in the fact that the settlement agreement makes no provision for treble damages and that one of the counsel for plaintiffs said that t reble damages are only achieved if you go through,you win your trial,you win your appeal everything becomes final and you actually collect the money.they contend that the settlement agreement refers only to actual losses.
while it is true that the settlement agreement reposes discretion in the district judge as to the disposition of excess funds,that discretion is not absolute.where we find an abuse of discretion in our review of the allocation of funds derived from class settlements,the scheme adopted by the district court will not be upheld.in re agent orange prod.liab.litig.vi,cir.we have concluded that a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principles or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon new york,cir.in its original opinion approving settlement,the district court considered only the following dispositions i the return of excess settlement funds to the defendants on a pro rata basis or ii in the exercise of its equitable powers,distribution of the funds to charitable organizations.the court stated having adopted the charitable route for these funds,it is my view that wherever possible,the cy pres doctrine should be invoked.fears,wl,at.the court then went on,in accordance with the cy pres doctrine,to allocate the funds to those charities thought to benefit the class,either directly or indirectly.id.at.
we are not yet prepared to say that the district court abused its discretion in allocating the excess funds under the cy pres doctrine.it does appear,however,that the district court was not aware of the extent of its discretion,failing to recognize that it was empowered to allocate funds to the members of the class as treble damages.the district court ultimately held that the terms of the settlement agreement barred it from even considering such an alternative.
