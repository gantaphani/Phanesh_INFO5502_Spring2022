opinion of the court 
in this appeal from the grant of summary judgment we must decide whether defendants at t,ncr,lucent technologies,and texas pacific group agreement to restrict the hiring of certain employees upon lucent sale of paradyne was a violation of of the sherman antitrust act.we also must decide whether this agreement which effectively cancelled the plaintiff employees at t pension bridging rights violated of the employee retirement income security act.we hold the agreement was a valid covenant not to compete that was reasonable in scope and therefor e not a violation of of the sherman act.but also we hold plaintiffs have presented sufficient prima facie evidence of at t and lucent specific intent to interfere with an erisa funded employee pension fund to survive summary judgment on the erisa claim.
in july,at t,a long distance telephone and wireless services provider,decided to sell one of its affiliates,paradyne,a manufacturer of network access products for the telecommunications industry.contemplating the sale,at t wanted to ensure that paradyne remained a viable entity because a t t and its other affiliates,including lucent technologies,purchased many of the network access products paradyne manufactured.to make paradyne more attractive to buyers as an ongoing business,at t adopted a human resource plan that placed restrictions on paradyne employees ability to transfer to other divisions of at t the preliminary net.specifically,the preliminary net precluded an employee who voluntarily left paradyne from being hired by any other division of at t.the premise for the hiring bar was at t belief that one of paradyne most marketable assets was its skilled employees.the retention of paradyne employees,therefore,was considered essential for the sale of paradyne.
shortly after adopting the preliminary net,a t t consummated a business reorganization plan resulting in three independent companies at t,lucent technologies,and ncr the trivestiture.as part of the trivestiture,at t transferred ownership of paradyne to lucent.consistent with the preliminary net,the paradyne employees,now employed by lucent,were precluded from seeking at any other at t division or affiliate after the trivestiture.
on july,lucent sold paradyne to texas pacific group.before closing,lucent agreed,on behalf of itself and the other former at t affiliates,that it would not hire,rehire,retain,or solicit the services of any paradyne employee or consultant whose annual income exceeded.this pre closing net was consistent with the understanding that texas pacific group interest in purchasing paradyne was based on its desire to acquire the technical skills of paradyne employees for a sufficient period of time to ensure a successful transition of ownership.
once the deal was closed,lucent and texas pacific group entered a agreement post closing net in which lucent warranted on behalf of itself and the other at t affiliates that for days months following the sale and the expiration of the pre closing net,it would not seek to hire,solicit or rehire any paradyne employee or consultant whose compensation exceeded.the eight month agreement had the practical effect of cancelling the paradyne employees accrued pension benefits under their former at t pension plans.under the at t pension plan,employees were entitled to bridging rights which allowed them to retain their level of accrued pension benefits if they left at t and returned within six months.after six months,the bridging rights expired.employees rehired after the six month period would need five years of employment to regain their previous pension levels.because the post closing net barred paradyne employees from returning to an a t t affiliate for eight months,these employees automatically lost the bridging rights they had acquired under their at t pensions.
before the sale was consummated,texas pacific group hired an outside consultant to determine the benefit package it could offer the paradyne employees.paradyne vice president of human resources,sherril claus melio,who had previously held the same position when paradyne was owned by at t and lucent,assisted the consultant in drafting various benefit plan proposals.the consultant concluded that in order to make paradyne financially competitive,texas pacific group could not offer the same pension package at t had previously offered its employees.although melio exact role in texas pacific group decision is disputed,texas pacific group ultimately decided not to offer a defined pension benefits program to its new employees.
the plaintiffs are former paradyne employees who allege the preliminary net,as well as the pre and post closing nets,collectively represent an unlawful group boycott in violation of of the sherman act.additionally,they contend the defendants conspired to eliminate their pension benefits thereby engaging in an illegal price fixing scheme in violation of of the sherman act.furthermore,they allege the agreement,which effectively cancelled paradyne employees bridging rights under their at t pensions,violated of the employee retirement income security act.
in addressing these claims,the district court held that plaintiffs failed to prove a violation of of the sherman act and failed to produce sufficient prima facie evidence of at t and lucent specific intent to interfere with an erisa funded pension plan to support their claim.the court,therefore,granted defendants motion for summary judgment.after the grant of summary judgment,plaintiffs filed a discovery motion in connection with an anticipated motion for class certification which the district court denied.this appeal followed.

section of the sherman act provides

we hold the at t preliminary net was not a violation of of the sherman act.the district court found that as of the date that the preliminary net was put into effect,lucent was a subsidiary of a t t,and accordingly,the two companies were a singular entity that could not conspire to violate the antitrust laws.eichorn v.at t,ca,slip op.at september.in copperweld independence tube,d,the supreme court held the coordinated acts of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary can not themselves give rise to antitrust violations.the court reasoned,a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a complete unity of interest.their objectives are common,not disparate their general corporate actions are guided or determined not by two separate corporate consciousnesses,but one.id.at.because the preliminary net was an internal restriction between a single corporation,at t,and its wholly owned subsidiaries,lucent and ncr,and not an agreement between separate corporate identities,it was not a violation of of the sherman act.id.at.an internal agreement to implement a single unitary firm policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that was designed to police.although plaintiffs assert a t t and lucent were not motivated by a single corporate consciousness because they were in the process of becoming separate entities,we believe that during the effective time period of the at t preliminary net,at t and lucent retained a unified corporate interest for the purpose of antitrust analysis.it was not until at t divested all of its stock in lucent and after the lapse of the preliminary net that the two companies became completely separate entities.

we next turn to plaintiffs claim that the pre and post closing nets,collectively referred to as the agreement,represent an illegal group boycott and a horizontal price fixing conspiracy under of the sherman act.plaintiffs allege lucent,at t and texas pacific group horizontally competed for the plaintiff employees technical skills and services.as competitors,they argue,the defendants conspired to suspend competition for plaintiffs technical services with the purpose and the effect of locking them out of the labor market.see anderson shipowners ass of the pac.coast.agreement between most shipowners on pacific coast to deny employment to any seaman who did not register with association was violation of of sherman act law collegiate athletic,cir.ncaa rule limiting salary of basketball coaches was per se violation of of sherman act,cert.denied,d.by locking them out and effectively cancelling their entitlement to at t pension rights,plaintiffs argue the defendants conspired to fix the cost of labor in the market.in support,plaintiffs cite several supreme court cases that hold horizontal group boycotts and price fixing conspiracies are per se violations of the sherman antitrust act.see ftc super.trial lawyers,d arizona maricopa county med.soc y,d broad.music,columbia broad,d.
but the facts here are substantially different from the classic per se horizontal price fixing and group boycott conspiracies the court has generally found to be per se antitrust violations.broad.music,at.easy labels like price fixing do not always supply ready answers.because of the fact specific inquiry required to assess antitrust liability under the sherman act,we will address each prong of the analysis.
private plaintiffs pursuing claims under of the sherman act have standing when they suffer an antitrust injury that is causally related to the defendants allegedly illegal activity.brunswick,at.the supreme court has described antitrust injury as injury of 
the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.the injury should reflect the effect either of the violation or of acts made possible by the violation.it should,in short,be the type of loss that the claimed violations would be likely to cause.

it is well established that an antitrust injury reflects an activity effect on the competitive market.atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d the antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a aspect or effect of the defendant behavior.emphasis in original.w e have consistently held an individual plaintiff personally aggrieved by an alleged agreement has not suffered an antitrust injury unless the activity has a wider impact on the competitive market.see,city of pittsburgh west penn power,cir holding action that did not lessen competition in a marketplace was not antitrust injury barton pittinos,smithkline beecham,cir the determination of whether a party has suffered an antitrust injury depends on how the market is defined brader allegheny,cir.while a plaintiff may have individually suffered an injury as a result of defendants actions,the antitrust laws were designed to protect anticompetitive activities.atlantic richfield,at.quoting brown shoe united states,d the antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition,not competitors.emphasis in original see also les shockley racing,hot rod ass,cir holding plaintiffs must plead and prove a reduction of competition in the market in general and not mere injury to their own positions as competitors.
in dismissing plaintiffs antitrust claims the district court stated,
plaintiffs apparently argue that the injury to competition is that they are prevented from providing their services to at t,lucent or its affiliates.put simply,the antitrust laws are not concerned with injury to competitors here the plaintiffs,but with injury to competition.that these plaintiffs are prevented from working at at t,lucent or their affiliates for the limited time period during which the and nets were in effect is not an injury to competition.in our view,plaintiffs allegations of economic injury to themselves misperceive the nature of the injury which is required to be established in order to sustain a claim under section of the sherman act.

while employees who are precluded from selling their labor have not necessarily suffered an antitrust injury,employees may challenge antitrust violations that are premised on restraining the employment market.phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law ed footnotes omitted see also brian henry,sorry,we ca hire you we promised not to the antitrust implications of entering into agreements,fall antitrust most courts considering the issue have held that employees suffer injury recognized by the antitrust laws when their employment opportunities are restricted by a agreement between potential employers,and thus have standing to sue the entity imposing such a provision.as a leading treatise on antitrust states 
antitrust law addresses employer conspiracies controlling employment terms precisely because they tamper with the employment market and thereby impair the opportunities of those who sell their services there.just as antitrust law seeks to preserve the free market opportunities of buyers and sellers of goods,so also it seeks to do the same for buyers and sellers of employment services.it would be perverse indeed to hold that the very object of the law solicitude and the persons most directly the only persons not challenge the restraint.
an employee overcomes the primary hurdle to standing when he shows that the alleged violation restrains competition in the labor market.of course,he must still show that was proximately caused by the violation and,in damage cases,that can be quantified without undue speculation.

in anderson,the supreme court held that a seaman,on behalf of himself and other members of the seamen union,could sue an association of most of the shipowners in the region when the shipowners association adopted unduly strict regulations governing employment.at.the court found the shipowners agreement violated the antitrust laws because the regulations prevented the free exercise of the rights of the seamen to engage in trade and commerce.id.at.quoting united states colgate.because unregistered seamen were precluded from working on any association ship,which constituted the majority of the ships in the region,they suffered an injury protected under the antitrust laws.
while anderson was decided many years before the supreme court detailed the antitrust injury requirement in brunswick several courts since brunswick have found that agreements which preclude employees from seeking employment from a third party employer can give rise to antitrust injury.in cesnick chrysler,plaintiffs who were precluded from seeking at chrysler when their division was sold to a third party suffered an antitrust injury.the court reasoned that it must conclude that the market for employee skills is a market subject to the provisions of the sherman act.id.at.
more recently in roman cessna aircraft,cir,the court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that a plaintiff precluded from seeking employment as an airplane engineer with the cessna aircraft company because of an agreement between cessna and the boeing company not to hire each other engineers suffered an antitrust injury.the court reasoned that plaintiff 
alleged that competition in the market for his services as an employee had been directly impeded by defendants agreement not to compete for each other employees.he further alleges that he was injured by that agreement because it prevented him from selling his services to the highest bidder we believe this is sufficient to allege antitrust standing.

in a similar manner,plaintiffs her e allege they have been precluded from selling their services to three companies within the industry,ncr,at t and lucent,and that the agreement interfered with their ability to attain pension benefits.because the agreement directly impeded plaintiffs ability to sell their labor to at least three companies within the competitive market and effectively cancelled their at t pension benefits,we believe they have standing to litigate their claims.roman,at.to the extent the district court held that plaintiffs did not suffer an antitrust injury and lacked standing to litigate their claims,it was in error.
plaintiffs contend on appeal that the agreement was a group boycott and a horizontal price fixing conspiracy.see klor stores,d.as direct competitors for their labor,plaintiffs argue,the defendants entered the agreement as part of a concerted effort to lock them out of employment and decrease labor costs by eliminating pension benefits.see soc y of eng rs,at.quoting united states container of,d a n agreement that interfere s with the setting of price by free market forces is illegal on its face.plaintiffs maintain that group boycotts and horizontal price fixing schemes between competitors are per se violations of the antitrust laws because these agreements are manifestly uncompetitive and are naked restraints of trade that have no purpose except stifling of competition.white motor united states,d see also pac.ry.united states,d.in support,they cite ncaa bd.of regents of the of,d,where the supreme court stated,
horizontal price fixing is ordinarily condemned as a matter of law under an illegal per se approach because the probability that these practices are is so high in such circumstances a restraint is presumed unreasonable without inquiry into the particular market context in which it is found.
while plaintiffs contend the agreement was per se illegal because it was a horizontal group boycott and a price fixing conspiracy,we can find no support within the relevant case law for this label.broad.music,at.easy labels do not always supply ready answers.the per se illegality rule applies only in those cases where the business practice in question is one,which on its face,has no purpose except stifling of competition.white motor,at.see also northwest wholesale stationers,pac.stationery printing,d per se rule confined to limited types of practices larry muko,southwestern.and const.trades council.cir.generally the application of the per se rule has been limited to those classic boycotts in which a group of business competitors seek to benefit economically by excluding other competitors from the marketplace,cert.denied,d.the supreme court has been cautious in extending the per se approach to claims that fall outside certain previously enumerated categories of liability.see,bd.of regents of the of,at.judicial inexperience with a particular arrangement counsels against extending the reach of the per se rules.broad.music,at.the per se rule is not employed until after considerable experience with the type of challenged restraint.maricopa county med.soc y,at.experience with a particular kind of restraint enables the court to predict with confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it.because of the fact specific inquiry involved in antitrust analysis,the supreme court has recognized that claims not within established categories of antitrust liability are more appropriately analyzed under the rule of reason where courts can balance the effect of the alleged activity against its competitive purposes within the relevant product and geographic markets.
acknowledging this judicial hesitance to extend the per se rule to new categories of antitrust claims,we note there are no supreme court cases nor any federal cases that have applied the per se rule in similar factual circumstances.the only two federal cases that have analyzed similar group boycott and price fixing claims have held that agreements executed upon the sale of a corporation are analyzed under the rule of reason.coleman,aff,cir cesnick.at.in coleman,the corporation sold its ceramics division to general electric.at.after closing,and general electric entered an agreement in which warranted that it would not rehire any employee who voluntarily accepted a job with general electric.several ceramic division employees brought suit alleging a group boycott that was per se invalid under of the sherman act.disagreeing,the court reasoned that courts have refused to apply the group boycott designation where the effect is not to drive out competition but to achieve some other goal,whether or not the goal withstands the rule of reason analysis.id.citing smith pro football.because the agreement only precluded the plaintiffs from selling their services to one corporation,the court held it only had a de minimus impact on the employment market in general,and the per se rule was wholly inapplicable.id.
similarly in cesnick,former employees of chrysler non automotive air conditioning division sued under when chrysler sold the division to the fedders corporation and agreed not to rehire its employees.at.although plaintiffs characterized the agreement as a group boycott and a per se violation of,the court stated,i n the absence of any supreme court cases based on facts similar to those of this case,this court will not accept the proposition that any conduct that can be characterized as a group boycott is a per se violation.id.the court reasoned the 
agreement was designed to increase the likelihood that fedders would enjoy the services of the experienced airtemp employees,an obviously sound business purpose.to the extent that the agreement effectively restrained competition between chrysler and fedders for employee services,a competition whose existence is entirely conjectural,that effect was incidental as well as de minimus.
cognizant that there are no supreme court cases holding agreements entered upon the legitimate sale of a business to a third party are per se antitrust violations and recognizing that the only two federal courts that have addressed the issue have declined to apply the per se rule,we hold the agreement here is more appropriately analyzed under the rule of reason.as several courts have recognized,the per se rules of illegality are the exception to antitrust analysis and are only employed in certain recognized categories.delong equip.washington mills abrasive,cir,cert.denied,d.
the district court properly characterized the agreement as a common law covenant not to compete.as we discuss,courts have uniformly found that covenants not to compete should be examined under the rule of reason.see,mcdonald johnson johnson,cir,cert.denied,d consultants designers,butler serv.group,cir aydin loral,cir vendo,cir,cert.denied,d.therefore,we will analyze plaintiffs claims under the rule of reason so we can examine the effect of the defendants agreement within the wider context of its competitive purposes and its impact on the relevant product and geographic markets.
under the rule of reason,we look at the totality of the circumstances surrounding an alleged activity,including facts peculiar to the relevant business,to determine the nature or purpose of the allegedly illegal restraint.topco,at.the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition,taking into account a variety of factors,including specific information about the relevant business,its condition before and after the restraint was imposed and the restraint history,nature and effect.state oil khan,d citing maricopa,at.in applying this test,we examine the competitive significance of the alleged restraint to determine whether it has an effect on the market and is an unreasonable restraint on trade.tunis.ford motor,cir,cert.denied,d.in this regard,covenants not to compete executed upon the sale of a business to a third party are generally not recognized as antitrust violations.see bus.elecs,at.the classic ancillary restraint is an agreement by the seller of a business not to compete within the market.soc y of prof l eng rs,at,at the recognized benefits of reasonably enforced noncompetition covenants are now beyond question.as early as,courts have recognized that covenants not to compete are not violations of of the sherman act because,
it i s of importance,as an incentive to industry and honest dealing in trade,that,after a man ha s built up a business with extensive good will,he should be able to sell his business and good will to the best advantage,and he could not do so unless he could bind himself by an enforceable contract not to engage in the same business in such a way as to prevent injury to that which he was about to sell.

the district court found,
in our view,the and nets at issue here are a subset of common law covenants not to compete.moreover,it is clear that the agreements imposed restrictions which were ancillary to legitimate transactions,and thus properly considered an ancillary restraint.

we agree that the agreement was not an unreasonable restraint of trade under of the sherman act.frackowiak farmers ins,numerous courts have recognized the general rule that agreements not to compete,entered into in conjunction with the termination of employment or sale of a business,do no offend the federal antitrust provisions if they are reasonable in duration and geographical limitation.the primary purpose of the agreement was to ensure that texas pacific group,as the purchaser of paradyne,could retain the skilled services of paradyne employees.although the agreement precluded the employees from seeking employment at an at t affiliate for days,the primary purpose of the agreement was not.contrary to plaintiffs assertions,we can find no evidence to support their claim that the agreement was executed for the improper purpose of restraining trade and the cost of labor in the telecommunications industry.the primary purpose of the agreement was to ensure the successful sale of paradyne to texas pacific group which required workforce continuity any restraint on plaintiffs ability to seek employment at at t and any effect on their pension bridging rights was incidental to the effective sale of paradyne.
because the agreement was a legitimate ancillary restraint on trade,we must determine whether the eight month restriction from employment at an a t t affiliate was reasonable or whether it went further than necessary to ensure the successful transition of ownership.cesnick.at quoting syntex.at the question in every case involving a covenant not to compete ancillary to the sale of a business is whether the restraint is reasonably calculated to protect the legitimate interests of the purchaser in what he has purchased,or whether it goes so far beyond what is necessary as to provide a basis for the inference that its real purpose is the fostering of monopoly.
we do not think the eight month restriction on at an at t affiliate was unreasonably broad.it is reasonable to believe texas pacific group would require the technical skills of these employees for at least this eight month period,if not longer,to ensure a successful transition of ownership from lucent.furthermore,the agreement only precluded the plaintiffs from working at lucent or an a t t affiliate.the employees were free to leave texas pacific group and seek employment elsewhere within the telecommunications industry.significantly,there is no evidence in the record to support plaintiffs claim that at t was the only employer in the market to whom they could sell their services.as the district court found,there are over twenty other telecommunications firms that compete for plaintiffs technical services.furthermore,the market for plaintiffs with more generalized educational and work backgrounds includes a vast number of jobs nationwide.eichorn,ca,slip op.at.
therefore,we hold the agreement was not an unreasonable restraint on trade.as an ancillary covenant not to compete,the agreement was reasonable in its restrictions on the plaintiffs ability to seek employment elsewhere.soc y of prof l eng rs,at.while the agreement essentially barred the plaintiffs ability to retain their desirable at t pension benefits,of the sherman antitrust act is not the appropriate vehicle here for redress.in formulating their claim in antitrust parlance,plaintiffs have argued their inability to work at their former jobs was a manifestly uncompetitive restraint on trade within the relevant market.we disagree.in order to advance their antitrust claim,plaintiffs are forced to define narrowly the relevant market affected by the defendants activity as,
potential employers within a mile radius of with the capacity and capability of employing or utilizing large numbers of persons with specialized experience in high speed data communications equipment of the sort paradyne develops and makes who can provide continuity of the pension benefits which have accrued to plaintiffs under the at t lucent pension plans.
