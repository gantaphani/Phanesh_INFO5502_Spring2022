plaintiffs michael shames and gary gramkow plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their claims against the california travel and tourism commission cttc alleging the cttc engaged in antitrust in violation of the sherman act,and improper meeting practices in violation of california open meeting act,cal.gov t code.the district court held the cttc was shielded from antitrust liability under the state action immunity doctrine,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claim.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
the cttc is a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation created by state legislation in order to expand and develop california tourism industry.cal.gov t code a.the cttc is governed by commissioners,who simultaneously serve as directors.a b the secretary of the business,transportation and housing agency secretary chairs the cttc.k,b.twelve commissioners are appointed by the governor,while the remaining are elected by the tourism industry itself b.
in,the passenger rental car industry proposed changes to state bill which were subsequently enacted.see cal.civil code.under the bill,the passenger rental car industry became the fifth tourism industry category under the cttc scheme and agreed to pay a high assessment fee,greatly increasing the cttc budget.in exchange for this increased funding,the passenger rental car industry was allowed to unbundle fees charged to customers and itemize such fees separately from the base rental rate.significantly,the adopted changes allowed the companies to pass on some or all of the assessment to customers.f.
plaintiffs allege this led to the imposition of two specific fees on rental car customers.first,pursuant to an agreement between the passenger rental car industry and the cttc,a tourism assessment fee was added to the cost of a car rental which,in turn,helped fund the cttc.plaintiffs allege that the cttc then colluded with the passenger rental car industry,fixing rental car prices by passing on the tourism assessment fee to customers.second,the passenger rental car industry unbundled the airport concession fee charged to customers to pay airports for the right to conduct business on airport premises this fee has traditionally amounted to of the rental price.the bill permitted the passenger rental car industry to charge this concession fee separately from the base rental rate.according to plaintiffs,the cttc also colluded with the passenger rental car industry in passing the concession fee on to customers as an uniform charge.plaintiffs allege that these agreements between the rental car companies and the cttc constituted of rental car rates in violation of the sherman act.plaintiffs also claim the cttc committed a host of open meeting act violations,specifically,failing to adhere to detailed notice requirements and impermissibly holding closed session meetings.
granting the cttc rule b motion to dismiss,the district court dismissed all claims against the cttc,finding it was entitled to state action immunity from antitrust liability and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining act state law claim.the district court also held that the dismissed claims against the cttc were adequately severable from the pending claims against the passenger rental car companies and entered final judgment for the cttc.

discussion 
state action immunity from antitrust liability 
we assume without deciding that the plaintiffs allegations that the cttc conspired with the passenger rental car companies to pass on cttc tourism assessments,enforcing the agreement against rental car companies,and turning the airport concession fee into a rate hike,sufficiently allege an antitrust violation under the sherman act.we need not consider the legality of the alleged conduct we are instead called to determine whether the district court nonetheless properly dismissed the plaintiffs claim against the cttc because the agency alleged conduct qualifies for state action immunity.
the supreme court introduced the doctrine of state action immunity in parker brown,when it held that the sherman act did not apply to state anticompetitive conduct.the court reasoned that the sherman act was primarily concerned with individual anticompetitive action,not states acting in their sovereign capacity.id.
the court revisited the doctrine in california retail liquor dealers association midcal aluminum,midcal,when a wholesale wine distributor challenged california wine resale statutes.the statutes required wine producers to file price schedules with the state however,the wine dealers themselves set the prices without any state oversight or control.id.at.the court established a test to determine when state involvement in anticompetitive conduct can render a party eligible for immunity the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy and the policy must be actively supervised by the state itself.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that although california legislative policy clearly stated and allowed resale price maintenance,satisfying the first prong of the test,the price maintenance system failed the second prong because the state did not actively supervise the conduct of the wine dealers.id.at.with these principles in mind,we turn to their application in this case.
midcal first prong clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy 
specific authorization reasonably foreseeable 
as a preliminary matter,we must first resolve a dispute among the parties over the proper standard in evaluating midcal first prong.plaintiffs argue that the district court wrongly applied a lesser foreseeability standard in place of midcal clear articulation requirement,which,they argue,requires a more specific or express authorization of any conduct.
the cttc,however,correctly points out that the supreme court has not required express authorization of particular anticompetitive acts and has applied state action immunity when the actions were a foreseeable result of a broader statutory authorization.for example,in city of columbia omni outdoor advertising,omni,a billboard company sued the city for passing an ordinance effectively preventing the company from entering the billboard market.id.at.the city allegedly passed the ordinance to favor the existing billboard company,a local company with deep roots in the community.id.at.the court held that the city actions were nonetheless entitled to parker state action immunity because they were an authorized implementation of state policy.id.at.the court reasoned that the city acted within its authority to pass a zoning ordinance,and that suppression of competition was a foreseeable consequence of passing such an ordinance.id.at.the court rejected the contention that this requirement can be met only if the delegating statute explicitly permits the displacement of competition,and held that i t is enough if suppression of competition is the foreseeable result of what the statute authorizes.id.at.
similarly,in town of hallie city of eau claire,neighboring towns filed suit against the city of eau claire,arguing that the city held an unlawful monopoly over sewage treatment services.the court held that the city actions were immunized because they were a foreseeable result of the state legislature statutory authorization to municipalities to provide or refuse to provide sewage services to unincorporated areas.id.at.the court again noted that a legislature need not expressly state in the statute or legislative history that it intends for the action to have anticompetitive effects,so long as the legislature had contemplated the action that was taken.id.we think it is clear that effect
