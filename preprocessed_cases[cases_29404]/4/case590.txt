background 
sl technology and the parties 
the district court described the background of the case extensively in its summary judgment order.see dsm desotech,cv,wl,at,final decision.we briefly recite the pertinent facts.
this case involves what is known as technology.there are two general forms of this technology additive and subtractive.additive technology creates parts by building layer upon layer with materials such as plastics,metals,or ceramics.subtractive technology works by starting with a block of material and then cutting away layers.examples of additive technology include sl,fused deposition modeling,laser sintering,printing,direct metal laser sintering,and digital light processing.computer numerically controlled machining is an example of subtractive technology.
manufactures sl machines and is the sole supplier of those machines in the united states.sl machines use an ultraviolet laser to trace a cross section of the object being made on a vat of liquid polymer resin.the laser solidifies the resin it touches,while the remaining,untouched,areas remain in liquid form.after one has solidified,a vertical elevator lowers the newly formed layer below the surface of the resin.the process is repeated until the object is completed.
users of sl machines include original equipment manufacturers,service bureaus,the government,the military,and academic researchers.service bureaus build parts or prototypes for other companies and often own multiple types of machines.one reason that service bureaus use multiple types of rapidprototyping machines is that,although all such machines perform the same essential function,they have varying characteristics,such as size,speed,and accuracy.those varying characteristics might make one type of machine more preferable than another for a given project.for example,users might employ an sl machine for a model.by contrast,users might employ laser sintering a robust manufacturing process for parts that serve a more functional purpose.

around,began equipping some of its machines with radio frequency identification rfid capability.rfid is a wireless technology that allows a receiver placed on the sl machine to communicate with a transmitter on the cap of a resin bottle.to ensure that customers use only resins,a lockout feature shuts the machine off if the rfid detects a resin that has not approved.has approved two of desotech resins for use in its sl machines.desotech and entered into negotiations for the approval of additional desotech resins.after those negotiations broke down,desotech filed suit.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
in its suit,desotech alleged multiple antitrust violations by,including tying under of the sherman act count i tying under of the clayton act count ii unreasonable restraint of trade under of the sherman act count iii attempted monopolization under of the sherman act count iv and antitrust violations under the illinois antitrust act count v.additionally,desotech alleged a state law claim for violation of the illinois uniform deceptive trade practices act count vi.it also alleged state law claims for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage count vii and for tortious interference with contractual relations count viii.finally,desotech asserted a claim of patent infringement count ix.
desotech based its tying claims on alternative theories,invoking both the per se rule and the rule of reason.pertinent to this case,to establish a per se illegal tying violation,desotech was required to show that tying arrangement was between two distinct products or services,that had sufficient economic power in the tying market the market for sl machines to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product the market for sl resin,and that a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce was affected.reifert cent.mls,cir quoting carl sandburg vill.condo.ass first condo.dev,cir.if desotech failed to prove a per se tying violation,it could still show an illegal tie under the rule of reason.see carl sandburg vill.condo.ass,at.under the rule of reason,the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.leegin,at.as with a tying suit based on the per se rule,a tying suit based on the rule of reason requires a showing of market power.menasha news am.marketing in store,cir citations omitted.

the district court also granted summary judgment on two of desotech state law claims.regarding the alleged violation of the illinois uniform deceptive trade practices act,the court found that desotech could not prove that statements were false,ongoing,or otherwise more than just general statements about a licensing policy final decision at.regarding desotech claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,the court found that desotech claim failed because it could not show that actions about which it complained were motivated solely by spite or ill will.final decision at.the court,however,denied summary on desotech state law claim of tortious interference with contractual relations.dsm desotech,cv,wl n.in addition,it denied summary judgment on desotech patent infringement claim.dsm desotech,wl.

ii.relevant product market sl machines 
as noted,in the district court,desotech alleged five antitrust claims.desotech primary contention on appeal is that tied sales of resin tied product to sales of sl machines tying product.according to desotech,not only tied resin sales to machine sales via contracts invoking per se antitrust liability,but also worked a technological tie via use of its rfid technology invoking a rule of reason analysis.desotech also contends that this alleged conduct by constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade and an illegal attempt at monopolization.desotech acknowledges that,t o prevail on its antitrust claims,it must prove that either sl machines or sl resins constitute an independent product market for antitrust purposes.appellant br.the failure to define the relevant market as sl machines or resins would thus be dispositive of counts i with this in mind,we address first whether sl machines constitute a relevant,independent market.
when reviewing a district court conclusion as to the relevant product market under antitrust law,we apply the law of the regional circuit.see nobelpharma ab implant innovations,f d.the relevant product market consists of all products that are reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes.united states du pont de nemours.the seventh circuit has characterized products and services that are in the same market as those that are good substitutes for one another.reifert,at.the outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.id.quoting brown shoe united states.the seventh circuit has explicitly rejected the proposition that a firm can be said to have monopoly power in its own product,absent proof that the product itself has no economic substitutes.elliott united center,cir.determination of the relevant product market is a question of fact.blue cross blue shield united of marshfield clinic.
for products to be substitutes for one another,they need not be identical or fungible.united states cont l can.when products are not identical or fungible,they still may be in the same market as differentiated products 
products are differentiated when many buyers regard them as different though the products still perform the same essential function many machines performing the same function such as copiers,computers,or automobiles differ not only in brand name but also in performance,physical appearance,size,capacity,cost,price,reliability,ease of use,service,customer support,and other features.nevertheless,they generally compete with one another sufficiently that the price of one brand is greatly constrained by the price of others.

in determining whether products are good substitutes and therefore in the same market,the seventh circuit requires economic evidence.reifert,at see also menasha,at requiring economic evidence to prove the existence of a distinct market.actual data and analysis are necessary.reifert,at.
within a given relevant market,courts have also recognized submarkets in certain instances.these submarkets may on their own form the basis for antitrust liability.igt,at.under brown shoe,in determining whether a valid submarket exists,courts consider practical indicia such as the industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity,the product peculiar characteristics and uses,unique production facilities,distinct customers,distinct prices,sensitivity to price changes,and specialized vendors.beatrice foods ftc,cir citing brown shoe,at.
in granting summary judgment in favor of on desotech antitrust claims,the district court held that desotech failed to show that sl machines constitute a distinct market,finding it undisputed that alternatives for sl exist.in reaching its decision,the court found first that desotech internal documents showed that sl competes with other technologies.second,the court found that a doj report deemed sl to be in the same market as other technologies third,the court found that,while five customers testified that certain technologies were not substitutes for sl,another five testified that some technologies are indeed substitutes for sl for certain purposes.the court dismissed the testimony,however,because none of the customers were asked about reasonable substitutes.fourth,the court found that desotech expert conceded that other technologies are alternatives to sl for some uses.
regarding customers who testified they would pay a price increase in sl machines,the court concluded that the testimony of three or four customers out of total customers was insufficient for desotech to meet its burden of showing that a significant number of users would not switch to alternatives.
against this background and legal backdrop,we turn to the contentions of the parties.
desotech contends that genuine issues of material fact should have precluded summary judgment.urging that sl machines constitute a distinct product market,it argues first that,although other types of printing technologies exist,none are reasonable substitutes for sl technology because none can produce objects of the same size,and with the same precision,as an sl machine.
second,desotech urges,there are substantial price differences between sl machines and other technologies.machines range in price from to million,whereas other printing technologies range in price from to.machines with such differentiated prices,desotech concludes,are not reasonable substitutes.
third,desotech contends,the customers deposed in this case testified they do not consider other technologies to be substitutes for sl machines.for example,desotech explains,laser sintering and fused deposition modeling each have their own characteristics.they could be substituted for sl for some projects but not for others.it was error,desotech continues,for the district court to reject this evidence simply because the witnesses were asked about substitutes and not reasonable substitutes.on summary judgment,desotech concludes,the district court should have viewed this testimony in desotech favor not.
fourth,desotech argues,there is direct evidence that sl customers would not switch to an alternative technology in the face of a price increase.under the doj guidelines,desotech urges,this indicates that sl machines are a separate market.indeed,desotech concludes,four separate customers testified to this effect.in addition,those four were among very largest customers,comprising more than of the annual sl resin consumption among all customers,and of those whose resin consumption has been limited by rfid technology.
regarding the documents and testimony upon which the district court relied,desotech argues that the court erred by viewing the evidence all in favor.in particular,desotech maintains,the court weighed the evidence and improperly relied on certain desotech internal marketing documents written by lay businesspeople not economists.a jury might agree with the district court interpretation of those documents which refer to substitutes for sl,desotech concludes,but it also might,just as plausibly,disagree.
responds that the undisputed facts show there are substitutes for sl.for example,points out that desotech internal strategy documents describe other technologies as substitutes.and,according to,this is confirmed by doj competitive impact statement.also points to the deposition testimony of desotech expert,who stated,i do think there is actually really any material dispute that there are some technologies,which for certain uses,are an alternative to stereolithography.final decision at.regarding the customer testimony,explains that five of the thirteen customer witnesses testified that other technologies are indeed substitutes for sl.
according to,the key question in defining the relevant market is whether,if a manufacturer raises the price of technology a,enough customers would switch from technology a to technology b,thus making the price increase unprofitable.rather than conduct an economic analysis on this point,contends,desotech instead chose to rely on the testimony of a small number of customers.this small amount of testimony,concludes,is insufficient as a matter of law to answer the key economic question of whether sl machines constitute a market.
with the relevant legal principles in mind,we consider whether desotech has put forth sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find a distinct product market based on sl machines.as noted,the seventh circuit requires a plaintiff to set forth economic evidence showing whether products are good substitutes for one another.reifert,at.in that regard,one approach would be to analyze sales data and determine whether the prices of differentiated products move together.menasha,at describing various forms of econometric analyses.more generally,an economist might analyze price relationships,buying and selling patterns,or the existence of price discrimination.areeda hovenkamp,at.such data and analyses might reveal whether customers switch between sl machines and other technologies,and would thus indicate whether the products are in the same market.
rather than analyze economic data,desotech and its expert relied on four of the brown shoe practical indicia distinct prices the product peculiar characteristics and uses industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity and sensitivity to price changes.although such practical indicia are generally discussed in the context of submarkets,see brown shoe,at,identifying a submarket is in principle no different than identifying a market.areeda hovenkamp,at.some circuits might accept the use of such practical indicia to prove a market in the absence of economic evidence.but the seventh circuit does not.championsworld,llc soccer fed n,d.as the seventh circuit has explained,w hile the practical indicia named in brown shoe and beatrice foods are important considerations in defining a market,they were never intended to exclude economic analysis altogether.reifert,at.for this reason alone,we believe the district court properly granted summary judgment on desotech antitrust claims.we nevertheless consider the evidence desotech proffers.for the reasons explained below,we find that evidence an insufficient basis for a reasonable jury to reach a verdict in desotech favor.
first,desotech contends that a significant price difference between sl machines and other products shows distinct prices,brown shoe,at,thus suggesting that sl machines constitute a separate market from other kinds of technology.specifically,desotech argues that sl machines range in price from to million,whereas printing machines range in price from to.in making its argument,however,desotech compares sl machines to some of the cheapest possible substitutes printing machines.it thus ignores the evidence showing that offers a range of sl machines with a broad range of prices comparable to those of other technologies.for example,selective laser sintering and fused deposition modeling machines have prices commensurate with those of sl machines.contrary to desotech argument,therefore,the record demonstrates that sl machines do not have distinct prices in relation to all other technologies.
second,desotech urges that sl has peculiar characteristics and uses,brown shoe,at,making it superior to other fabrication techniques.specifically,desotech argues that sl machines are more accurate and can produce larger parts than other technologies.regarding the alleged size advantage of sl machines,desotech focuses on one model at the top end of product line.desotech,though,provides no evidence of how many machines of that model actually sold.additionally,desotech ignores the fact that sells many other models that are comparable in size to laser sintering and fused deposition modeling machines.regarding the accuracy of sl machines,desotech again compares them to one of the cheapest possible substitutes printing machines which its expert ranked as among the least accurate.the peculiar characteristics and uses desotech alleges,therefore,are tenuous at best.nevertheless,because this appeal comes from the grant of summary judgment,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to desotech.accordingly,we consider this factor as evidence of a potential distinct market for sl machines.
third,desotech maintains that there is industry or public recognition of the sl machine submarket as a separate economic entity,brown shoe,at,based on testimony that some customers do not consider other products to be substitutes for sl machines.five customers testified that other technologies are not substitutes for sl,whereas another five testified that some technologies are substitutes for certain uses.the district court dismissed the testimony favorable to desotech because,although customers were asked about substitutes,none was asked about reasonable substitutes.final decision at.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to desotech,however,the district court should have credited this testimony.nevertheless,the testimony is insufficient to establish that sl machines constitute a separate market.rather,along with characteristics of size and accuracy,it establishes that sl machines and other technologies are differentiated products.in considering whether these differentiated products are in separate markets,we turn to the final brown shoe factor upon which desotech relies.
desotech argues that customers are insensitive to price changes in sl machines,brown shoe,at sensitivity to price changes,thus indicating a separate market.although labeled in brown shoe as one of the practical indicia of a submarket,the sensitivity of customers to price reflects the basic economic test of cross elasticity of demand.in measuring cross elasticity of demand,we typically consider whether a sufficient number of customers would switch to other technologies in response to a price increase in sl machines so as to make the increase unprofitable.if enough customers switch,then sl machines do not constitute an independent market.
in making this argument,desotech relies on the testimony of four customers who indicated they would still buy an sl machine if faced with a price increase.the district court considered the testimony,but found that four customers out of for sl machines was not a significant enough proportion for desotech to meet its burden.the district court did not provide a reason behind this conclusion,but a close look at the evidence shows why the court was correct.
in arguing that the four customers are representative,desotech acknowledges they are a small portion of the total customers for sl machines.it contends,however,that they nonetheless make up of the market as measured by resin consumption.although the amount of resin these four customers consume is tangentially relevant,it does not address the more pertinent question,which is the percentage of the sl market they comprise.the record indicates that has produced a number of sl machine models over the past years,with approximately to machines remaining in operation.desotech provides little to no information about which machines the four customers purchased,how many they purchased,or when they purchased them.further,the record shows that the four customers are service bureaus,whereas the overall customer base includes not only service bureaus,but also original equipment manufacturers,the government,the military,and academic researchers.desotech provides no explanation for why the four customers would be representative of the other classes of customers.
further,the record indicates that the sl machine models that sells differ in price by more than a dollars.desotech,though,provides no justification for the conclusion that a purchaser of a machine is representative of a purchaser of a machine,or vice versa.for the testimony of the four customers to have been useful,desotech would have at least needed to ask them about the full range of prices of various machine models.see,united states country lake foods,finding evidence insufficient to identify the market where it addressed only one price point out of a range of prices.but desotech did not do that.that desotech asked about a to price increase in the abstract without reference to an actual or hypothetical price makes the testimony even more questionable.id.at.adding to that questionability,one of the four customers testified that actually gave him a discount to make him buy the machine.
finally,as points out,the evidence and testimony desotech relies on fails to answer the pertinent economic question of whether a sufficient number of customers would switch to a competing technology if faced with a small but significant price increase.desotech offered no evidence or argument for what would constitute a sufficient number.instead,based on the testimony of four customers,desotech would have one believe that no customers would switch technologies in the face of a price increase.but with such a small sampling four from only a single category of customer service bureaus,and without regard to the broad range of price points of the various sl models,we believe the evidence is insufficient for a reasonable jury to draw that conclusion.
in sum,when considering the proffered evidence in total and viewing it in the light most favorable to desotech,we conclude that only two of the brown shoe factors weigh in desotech favor.some courts have found the existence of a submarket based on three or four of the indicia.see von kalinowski,antitrust laws and trade regulation a matthew bender ed.collecting cases.although two indicia standing alone might be satisfactory in certain cases,this is not such a case.given the limited and tenuous nature of the evidence,we conclude that a reasonable jury could not find an independent market for sl machines.we also conclude that desotech failed to satisfy the stringent demand for economic data and analysis required by the seventh circuit.see reifert,at.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment that desotech failed to prove an independent market for sl machines.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,approving of summary judgment in antitrust cases where the plaintiff fails to raise a genuine issue for trial see also collins associated pathologists,cir t he use of summary judgment is not only permitted but encouraged in certain circumstances,including antitrust cases.citations omitted.
iii.relevant product market sl resin 
as an alternative theory,desotech argues that a distinct product market exists for sl resin.even if a manufacturer does not have power in a primary market,it still may have power in an aftermarket and be liable under the antitrust laws for conduct in that market.see eastman kodak image tech.however,a court may conclude that the aftermarket is the relevant market for antitrust analysis only if the evidence supports an inference of monopoly power in the aftermarket that competition in the primary market appears unable to check.sms.maint,digital equip.corp,cir.for example,if the high cost of a machine locks in customers to using the manufacturer parts and service,the manufacturer could still exercise monopolistic power in the aftermarket,even though it competes in the primary market.kodak,at.even so,i t is an article of faith,for antitrust purposes,that unless a substantial number of preexisting customers are locked in,defections from the manufacturer installed base,coupled with losses in the foremarket,in all probability will sabotage any effort to exploit the aftermarket.sms.maint,at.
the district court considered desotech argument that resin constituted a separate market,but ultimately ruled against desotech,concluding that it had put forth no evidence that was limiting resin variety or charging supracompetitive prices for sl resin.final decision at.
desotech bases its contention regarding an alternative sl resin market on a theory.according to desotech,materials other than sl resin can not function in an sl machine.and,so the argument goes,because customers who have sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars into an sl machine are effectively unable to switch to alternative technologies,they are locked in to using that machine and the accompanying resins.the district court erred,desotech concludes,by dismissing this argument out of hand.
responds that desotech theory that customers are locked in to using machines can only prevail where a substantial number of customers were locked in to their machine purchases before they learned of a restriction on aftermarket resins.here,no could have occurred for any viper pro or ipro purchases after august,and only seven customers purchased their machines before that time seven customers out of,concludes,is not a substantial number.further,six of those seven bought machines before licensing discussions with desotech broke down.according to,it could not have violated the antitrust laws by failing to accurately predict the outcome of those discussions.
as noted,to show that sl resin constitutes an independent market in which anticompetitive conduct can not be regulated by competition in the primary market,desotech relies on a theory.we conclude that desotech can not succeed on this theory,however,because it has not presented evidence showing that a substantial number of customers are,in fact,locked in.
if the high cost of switching equipment locks customers in to using specific aftermarket parts or service,then the aftermarket might form the basis for antitrust liability.kodak,at.crucial to the kodak decision,however,was the fact that customers had already purchased their equipment before learning about kodak policies on aftermarket parts and services.id.at digital equip.uniq digital,cir the court did not doubt in kodak that if spare parts had been bundled with kodak copiers from the outset,or kodak had informed customers about its policies before they bought its machines,purchasers could have shopped around for competitive prices.see also psi repair,honeywell,cir we likewise agree that the change in policy in kodak was the crucial factor in the court decision.by changing its policy after its customers were locked in,kodak took advantage of the fact that its customers lacked the information to an
