this appeal arises from an antitrust action against two public utility companies,consumers energy company and its holding company,cms energy corporation.consumers energy provides energy for a substantial portion of lower michigan.the plaintiffs,indeck energy services and collectively,indeck,operate systems,which provide energy for large commercial and industrial energy customers.they appeal from the district court dismissal of cms energy for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.they also appeal the dismissal of their antitrust and state law claims,alleging that the court erroneously applied the state action doctrine exemption from antitrust liability and mistakenly held that indeck failed to prove an antitrust injury.because we conclude that the district court ruled correctly on the standing issue,we find it unnecessary to address the question of whether the court properly applied the state action doctrine in this case.furthermore,we find no error in the dismissal of cms energy as a party defendant.
factual and procedural background 
according to its complaint,indeck had agreed with general motors in to develop a facility at general motors saginaw steering division plant.as a result,indeck undertook extensive preparations for work on the project.simultaneously,general motors also selected indeck as its preferred developer of another facility at its plant in flint,michigan,leading indeck to begin substantial development efforts on that project as well.
indeck alleges that the success of its saginaw and flint projects was undermined by consumers energy reluctance to share the public utility facilities and transmission services.additionally,indeck contends that consumers energy sabotaged the plaintiff attempts to service general motors with power by insisting on increases in rates for the provision of electric power to the plants.finally,indeck alleges,consumers energy negotiated its own supply agreement with general motors,under which the utility contracted to be the exclusive supplier of power for five to ten years to general motors facilities,including the flint plant,with an option to add the saginaw facility.in order to entice general motors to include the saginaw plant in the power agreement,consumers energy offered general motors a dollar discount on power costs for all other covered facilities,contingent upon inclusion of the saginaw plant in the contract.not surprisingly,general motors agreed to the discounted power costs in exchange for the limited exclusivity deal.
because of the tremendous increase in the power demand due to its exclusive agreements with the general motors facilities and with other large customers,consumers energy was forced to seek additional power from other suppliers.the plaintiff contends that,rather than contract with indeck or other independent generators,however,consumers energy purchased the necessary power only from its own affiliated producer,midland venture limited partnership.consequently,indeck asserts,consumers energy succeeded in excluding competition from over percent of the relevant at risk market while at the same time keeping potential supplemental and alternative sources of electrical power out of the market.
aggrieved by the actions of the defendants,indeck filed suit in federal district court against consumers energy and against cms energy,alleging violations of and of the sherman antitrust act,and,of the clayton act,and the michigan law of tortious interference with a prospective economic advantage.the defendants responded by filing motions to dismiss and for summary disposition to dismiss.the district court granted the motion to dismiss defendant cms energy because the complaint failed to state a claim against that defendant upon which relief could be granted.later,the court also granted judgment to consumers energy on the federal causes of action,determining that the utility was exempt from federal antitrust legislation under the state action doctrine and that indeck had failed to show the requisite antitrust injury.the court dismissed without prejudice indeck michigan state law claim.from these and other related rulings,indeck now appeals.
discussion 
in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants,the district court concluded that indeck complaint failed to allege the requisite antitrust injury and that the plaintiff therefore lacked standing to prosecute this cause of action.the court determined that no antitrust injury was occasioned when consumers energy contracted with customers other than general motors,when consumers energy allegedly showed favoritism to midland venture,or when consumers energy refused to enter into agreements with the plaintiff to purchase excess energy generated by indeck.
under sixth circuit case law,it is not enough for the plaintiff to claim economic injury plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury,which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants acts unlawful.valley prods,landmark,a div.of hospitality franchise,cir quoting brunswick pueblo,d.such a heightened standard is required because the relevant antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition not competitors.brunswick,at.quoting brown shoe united states,d.
by emphasizing the importance of establishing antitrust injury,courts ensure that antitrust litigants use the laws to prevent action and make certain that they will not be able to recover under the antitrust laws when the action challenged would tend to promote competition in the economic sense.hypoint technology,cir.otherwise,routine disputes between business competitors would be elevated to the status of an antitrust action,thereby trivializing the act because of its too ready availability.capital imaging,mohawk valley med,cir.
to assist courts in fulfilling their responsibilities of ensuring that antitrust laws are not trivialized,the supreme court has articulated certain factors to be analyzed in determining whether a plaintiff has established antitrust standing.see associated contractors of,california state council of carpenters,d.those factors include 
the causal connection between the antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiff and whether that harm was intended to be caused the nature of the plaintiff alleged injury including the status of the plaintiff as consumer or competitor in the relevant market the directness or indirectness of the injury,and the related inquiry of whether the damages are speculative the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages and the existence of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust violation.
southaven land,malone hyde,cir.all five factors must be balanced,however,with no one factor being determinative.see peck general motors,cir.furthermore,as noted by this court in valley products,t he sixth circuit,it is fair to say,has been reasonably aggressive in using the antitrust injury doctrine to bar recovery where the asserted injury,although linked to an alleged violation of antitrust laws,flows directly from conduct that is not itself an antitrust violation.id.at.
in this case,an examination of the antitrust standing factors leads to the inescapable conclusion that the district court appropriately dismissed indeck cause of action against the defendants significantly,the only harm allegedly suffered by indeck was in the company capacity as a competitor in the marketplace,not as a defender of marketplace competition.although antitrust actions may,of course,be initiated by marketplace competitors,those actors in the economic forum must at least allege that exclusion of the competitor from the marketplace results in the elimination of a superior product or a alternative.the record in this appeal presents no indication that competition itself was harmed by any act of the defendants.consequently,the antitrust damages alleged by indeck are too indirect and speculative to justify assertion of federal antitrust jurisdiction over this matter.
