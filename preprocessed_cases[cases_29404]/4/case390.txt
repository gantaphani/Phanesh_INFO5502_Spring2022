this appeal,which centers on tin mill products used to make the tin cans commonly used to package food,teaches that there no substitute for concrete evidence.stanislaus food products company claims that it pays artificially high prices as the result of an illegal market allocation agreement among the nation leading tin manufacturers who agreed to cede the tin mill products market in the western united states to a single company,uss posco industries upi.
although echoes of permeate the appeal,only a market allocation theory is at issue.but the claim relies on a shaky economic theory,as the purported arrangement would not be rational in light of the circumstances.even after extensive discovery,the evidence does not tend to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators were acting independently.we conclude that stanislaus has failed to establish specific facts supporting a market allocation conspiracy and affirm summary judgment for the tin manufacturers.
background 
stanislaus,a tomato cannery located in modesto,california,purchases its tin cans exclusively from silgan,one of three major american tin can manufacturers.these purchases occur under contract.
silgan,in turn,purchases tin mill products from multiple suppliers,including united states steel corporation and upi.steel manufactures and sells tin mill products as well as hot band steel,which is a component of tin mill products.steel has nationwide supply contracts with silgan and the other major tin can manufacturers.upi is a joint venture equally owned by steel and posco america steel corporation posco america as part of the joint venture,steel and posco america supply upi with hot band steel.upi tin mill product prices are set by a management team that includes three appointees each from steel and posco america.
stanislaus initiated suit in california state court,where it first alleged price fixing claims against upi,silgan,and other unnamed conspirators in violation of state and federal antitrust law.the case features a complicated procedural history that we need not recount in full here.stanislaus third amended federal complaint,which excludes silgan as a defendant asserts that u.steel agreed to exit the market and eliminate certain discounts to silgan to allow upi to charge monopolistic prices for tin mill products.stanislaus described three upi management committee meetings as the setting for the agreement.the district court granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint.dismissing a separate conspiracy to monopolize claim,the court left only the market allocation conspiracy claim to go forward.the linchpin of the market allocation agreement,according to the district court,would be proof of steel exit of the market.
after extensive discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the briefing prompted the district court to observe that the parties ha d sharply different views on what this case is about.stanislaus pursued two distinct antitrust theories.the first was an exit theory of the conspiracy,which turned on steel exit from the market for tin mill products in the western united states an approach that mapped to the surviving complaint allegations.stanislaus second theory was a new partial allocation theory,not raised in the complaint,under which stanislaus claimed that steel did not aggressively compete on price.under this theory,b ecause upi was left unchallenged,steel effectively allocated to upi a dominant,but not complete,position in the market.
evaluating both theories,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.the court began by considering whether there was a plausible economic motive for either alleged agreement.the court concluded that either type of conspiracy would be rational for upi and posco,which both stood to gain from any pricing charged by upi,but irrational for steel,which competes with upi by selling tin mill products through national supply contracts under which its customers elect the delivery destination.steel thus lacks the ability to unilaterally price discriminate against the western united states market this market structure did not make the prospect of forfeiting competitiveness on a national level rational for steel,even taking into account that steel ownership in upi meant that it would benefit to some extent from upi profits.against this backdrop,and proceed ing with caution,the court concluded that stanislaus circumstantial evidence was insufficient to support an inference of conspiracy.
section of the sherman antitrust act renders illegal e very contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce.this case involves an alleged illegal agreement to allocate territory to upi in order to reduce competition in the market for tin mill products.see palmer brg of,per curiam citing united states topco.
before considering the evidence,we review the basic principles of summary judgment that guide this appeal.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we view the facts and draw factual inferences in favor of stanislaus,the party,pac.contractors ass n,cir.still,to survive summary judgment,stanislaus must establish a genuine factual dispute,which involves more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.matsushita indus.zenith radio.a.
an agreement to restrain trade may be established by direct or by circumstantial evidence.see up bottling archer daniels midland,in re citric acid litig,cir.stanislaus relies upon circumstantial evidence to establish such an agreement here.
in matsushita,the seminal case applying these principles to antitrust claims,the supreme court explained that to survive summary judgment on the basis of circumstantial evidence,a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of must present evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently.at quoting monsanto spray rite serv.in other words,to establish the requisite factual dispute,stanislaus must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action or collusive action that could not have harmed stanislaus.id.
matsushita underscores that in making this determination,context is key.as the supreme court put it,if the factual context renders stanislaus claim implausible if the claim is one that simply makes no economic sense stanislaus must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support its claim than would otherwise be necessary.id.at.
as we proceed,we are mindful that courts should not permit factfinders to infer conspiracies when such inferences are implausible.id.at citing monsanto,at.the supreme court has observed that mistaken inferences are especially costly in cases that bear the risk of chill ing the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.id.at citing monsanto,at.
because this case hinges on circumstantial evidence,our inquiry into whether stanislaus showing is sufficient to establish an agreement proceeds in two steps 
first,the defendant can rebut an allegation of conspiracy by showing a plausible and justifiable reason for its conduct that is consistent with proper business practice.the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to provide specific evidence tending to show that the defendant was not engaging in permissible competitive behavior.

we begin by assessing the plausibility of stanislaus claims in light of their factual context.see matsushita,at considering the nature of the alleged conspiracy and the practical obstacles to its implementation.in doing so,we can not ignore the supreme court prohibition on permit ting factfinders to infer conspiracies when such inferences are implausible,id.at,lest we risk the pernicious danger of deter ring conduct,in re citric acid,at.implausible claims require a more persuasive showing that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action.matsushita,at.with these principles in mind,we turn to whether stanislaus can establish its claim.
rationality and justifications for the challenged actions 
in light of the shifting allegations,our first step is to identify the alleged conspirators and the exact subject matter of the alleged conspiracy.stanislaus alleges that in,upi,posco,and steel agreed to allocate the western united states market for tin mill products to upi,enabling upi to dominate the market and raise its prices.
as the district court noted,stanislaus exact theory of the alleged agreement has been in flux.the operative complaint alleges that a fter,pursuant to the market allocation agreement,steel exited the relevant market,and upi faced no meaningful competition whatsoever.it also posits that steel fully exited the market for the western united states and refused to enter into new contracts with its largest customers in the region.by the time the parties briefed summary judgment,stanislaus had shifted its theory to focus on steel failure to price competitively against upi.this reframing came about because the evidence showed that steel had never exited the market.in fact,steel continued selling to silgan including for west coast delivery.absent evidence of steel exit from the market,we focus our analysis on whether stanislaus can show this second type of agreement.
we first analyze whether the alleged conspirators would have had a rational motivation to conspire for upi,the alleged agreement would certainly have made sense it stood to gain by being able to charge higher prices in the absence of meaningful competition in the region.posco,a joint owner of upi that does not sell tin mill products in the united states,similarly stood to gain by reaping the benefit of those increased prices.so far,so good for stanislaus.but these incentives represent only one side of the alleged conspiracy.
the key to the alleged agreement and to stanislaus case is steel agreement to stop competing in that region.steel occupies quite a different position than do the other alleged conspirators because it also manufactures and sells tin mill products throughout the united states.critical to the context of this case,steel has nationwide supply contracts with all of the major tin can manufacturers.these contracts and their timing are independent of any of the conspiracy claims.under these contracts,steel sells tin mill products steel mill,which means that the customer selects where steel is to ship the products and pays for shipping costs to the chosen destination.
the structure of steel contracts means that the price and other terms are negotiated without steel knowing whether a customer will request items be sent,say,to california or to new york.the geographic neutrality is a significant practical obstacle to the viability of the alleged allocation agreement in order not to compete on price in the western united states,steel would need to stop competing on price nationwide or refuse customers.both options risk losses to steel bottom line and make little economic sense.
a scheme like stanislaus alleges would not be rational unless steel had little competition outside of the western united states or the potential payoff through ownership of upi was likely to be significant.but other manufacturers compete in this market,including arcelor mittal dofasco,tata steel formerly,corus,rasselstein,dongbu,bao,jfe,and steel formerly,severstal.in fact,most of these manufacturers have at some time after shipped products to silgan facilities in the western united states.
stanislaus argues that it is that an alleged conspiracy was in steel economic interest because steel did not in fact take market share from upi,despite steel prices being lower.even assuming stanislaus market analysis is correct,this theory boils down to retrospective guesswork it says nothing of the economic rationality of the agreement in the first place.additionally,the fact that steel undercut upi on price is consistent with competitive behavior.see matsushita,at c utting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition.
silgan position is a key aspect of stanislaus claim.upi offers testimony that it was able to secure silgan agreement in to a contract that raised silgan price for tin mill products because silgan,a knowledgeable player in the market,wanted to lock in lower prices.the price agreed to,while higher than previous prices,was still lower than those of other suppliers,with the exception only of steel.silgan wanted to avoid what its executives termed the hockey stick of a dramatic price increase that it expected would ensue if silgan waited to renegotiate in,when the prior contract expired.
as for steel,the prices it charged silgan were lower than the prices silgan agreed to pay upi.and the terms of the steel silgan agreement were set before the alleged conspiracy began.a plausible justification for steel pricing strategy to silgan is obvious steel was competing on price.the price increase by steel to one of silgan competitors that stanislaus relies on here not only did not involve stanislaus supplier,it also still left steel prices to that competitor lower than upi.the same competitive justification for pricing thus applies,with the increase in price explained by upi price leadership.see areeda hovencamp discussing how oligopolistic rationality can provide for price increases through price leadership.
stanislaus argues that the fact that posco did not enter the western market is evidence of a conspiracy to allocate that market to upi.but the fact that posco did not enter a new market just to compete with its own joint venture is perfectly justifiable,as f irms do not expand without limit and none of them enters every market that an outside observer might regard as profitable,or even a small portion of such markets.bell atl.twombly,alteration in original quoting areeda hovenkamp,at supp.
the potential benefit of this scheme for steel is just not apparent.to come out ahead,steel would have had to gain more than it would lose from abandoning a competitive position in the western market for tin mill products.this prospect is speculative at best.even factoring in the potential of charging upi a higher price for hot band steel and the potential profits to be derived from steel ownership in upi,we note that steel supplies just half of upi hot band steel.these factual circumstances do not alter our conclusion that steel participation in the alleged conspiracy is economically implausible.
the burden shifts to stanislaus to establish its claim through specific evidence tending to show that the coconspirators were not engaging in permissible competitive behavior.in re citric acid,at.
ii.evidence of conspiracy 
stanislaus identifies several categories of evidence that it argues tend to show the market allocation agreement.while some of the evidence may have a negative tinge,we conclude that the evidence does not,taken together,tend to exclude the possibility of permissible independent behavior.matsushita,at.the notion,for example,that steel did not compete hard enough or aggressively enough for stanislaus taste is difficult to assess or quantify.in any event,that characterization proffered by stanislaus is not the applicable standard.the question we should instead ask is whether there is sufficient specific evidence of a market allocation agreement the crux of stanislaus remaining antitrust claim.considered against the backdrop of the market for tin mill products during this period,stanislaus has failed to provide sufficient specific evidence to support a finding of conspiracy in light of the lack of economic rationality of the purported agreement.in re citric acid,at.
parallel pricing and pricing patterns 
when upi raised its prices,steel also raised its prices to some customers.stanislaus asserts that this allowed upi to maintain artificially high prices in an absence of competition.of course,p arallel pricing is a relevant factor to be considered along with the evidence as a whole if there are sufficient other plus factors,an inference of conspiracy can be reasonable.id.at citation omitted.
key to stanislaus theory is that this pricing behavior was contrary to steel.specifically,stanislaus argues that stee
