since the entry of a consent decree,the district court has overseen the enforcement of a settlement in an antitrust class action brought by the class members against the national football league and its member clubs nfl or league.throughout that time,the district court has resolved numerous disputes over the terms of the stipulation and settlement agreement settlement agreement and parallel collective bargaining agreement cba that govern player employment in the nfl.
in august,michael vick,then quarterback for the atlanta falcons,pled guilty to federal dog fighting charges.the nfl commissioner thereafter suspended vick indefinitely without pay,and the league initiated a grievance procedure seeking a declaration that the falcons could recover certain bonus money that had been paid to vick with the expectation that he would play football through.class counsel and the national football league players association association challenged the recovery as violative of provisions contained in the settlement agreement and cba.special master stephen burbank issued an opinion that the falcons were entitled to recover the amounts sought.the decision was appealed to the district court,which entered an order vick order stating that the bonus payments were already earned and thus not subject to forfeiture.the league then filed a rule b motion to vacate the district court judgment,arguing that the district court oversight of the consent decree should be terminated because of intervening changes in the law and factual circumstances and the district judge should remove himself from the case because of the reasonable perception that he was biased.the district court denied the motion.the league now appeals from the vick order and the denial of its rule b motion to vacate the judgment.we affirm.
factual background 
a.the white settlement agreement 
the settlement represented the resolution to a dispute between football players and team owners.although professional football generates significant revenue,players and owners often have differing ideas about how the money should be spent.owners desire mechanisms such as salary caps and player drafts players want free agency and competition among clubs for the best talent.for many years,team owners worked together to minimize labor costs,instituting,for example,the rozelle measure that virtually eliminated free agency by requiring any team acquiring a free agent to compensate the player original team.this court decision in mackey national football league,cir,ended that practice,holding that the rozelle rule violated antitrust law as an impermissible restraint on competition for player services.the fact that the rozelle rule was unilaterally implemented by team owners was critical to our holding,because we recognized that a similar collectively bargained provision would have been shielded from antitrust liability by the nonstatutory labor exemption to the antitrust laws.see id.at.
the players initial antitrust victory was short lived,for following the ruling in mackey the owners used their leverage in collective bargaining to reestablish the status quo,exchanging the rozelle rule for similar collectively bargained provisions that were impervious to antitrust attack.see powell national football league,cir holding that the collectively bargained right of first system was not subject to antitrust liability.the association organized strikes in and,but those efforts failed to win free agency or other desired changes in league rules.consequently,in the association chose to decertify as a union and abandon collective bargaining in favor of renewed antitrust litigation.
after several successful antitrust lawsuits brought by individual players,reggie white and four other named plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of minnesota on behalf of 
i all players who have been,are now,or will be under contract to play professional football for an nfl club at any time from august,to the date of final judgment and ii all college and other football players who,as of august,to the date of final judgment have been,are now,or will be eligible to play football as a rookie for an nfl team.
the complaint sought antitrust injunctive relief and damages stemming from various league rules,including the mandatory right of first refusal system,the standard nfl contract,and the college draft.on april,the district court approved a consent decree that provided the players with monetary relief and made a variety of significant changes to league rules.the agreement also allowed for the recertification of the association and the resumption of the collective bargaining relationship between the players and the owners.additionally,the settlement stated that the district court would retain jurisdiction over the enforcement of the agreement through appointment of a special master,who would hear disputes subject to review by the district court.
since the original approval of the settlement agreement,it has been amended five times,most recently in.each time,the enforcement jurisdiction of the district court has been retained as part of the agreement.a new cba was also formed in,with terms mirroring those in the settlement agreement.thereafter,whenever the parties have agreed to change a provision in the cba,a conforming change has also been made to the settlement agreement.in the event of a conflict,the provisions in the settlement agreement trump the cba.
michael vick contract 
one of the changes to the settlement agreement in was the addition of an provision,the effect of which was to limit the instances in which players would have to return money to their teams.guaranteed income is coveted by football players,due to the high risk of injury and the fact that the standard nfl contract allows a team to cut a player who does not meet expectations.as a result,players commonly negotiate bonus payments in addition to their yearly salary.the bonuses may be guaranteed for skill or allowing a player to keep the money in certain instances in which the remainder of his contract,yearly salary is terminated although some of the terms of individual player contracts may vary,a contract can not provide for forfeiture that is prohibited under the terms of the settlement agreement and cba.
in,vick negotiated a contract with the atlanta falcons to play football for the team through.in addition to a yearly salary,the contract included two roster for million and one for million the contract stated that the bonus amounts would be additional consideration for the execution of the player contract,provided that vick adhered to all contract provisions and vick was on the falcons roster on the fifth day of the and league years.the contract also gave the falcons the discretion to guarantee the bonuses for skill and stated that,if so guaranteed,vick had an obligation to execute a new contract setting forth the terms of the skill guarantee.the falcons subsequently exercised their right to guarantee the bonuses for skill.vick met the roster provisions in the contract and was accordingly paid million.
as set forth above,after playing just two seasons under his contract,vick pled guilty to federal dog fighting charges and was suspended by the league commissioner.the falcons sought to recover million from vick,a prorated portion of the bonuses based on the remaining years in his contract that he was unable to perform.on behalf of the falcons,the league filed a grievance with the special master seeking a declaration that recovering the bonus money would not violate the provisions in the cba and settlement agreement.the special master determined that the falcons could recover bonus payments properly allocable to years vick had not performed.on appeal,the district court disagreed,concluding instead that vick failure to perform was irrelevant because vick had fully earned the bonus payments when he met the roster provisions in his contract.
c.the league rule b motion 
following the district court ruling on the forfeiture issue,the league filed a rule b motion to vacate the judgment on the ground that the supreme court decision in brown pro football,d,as well as changes in factual circumstances,warranted a modification of the consent decree to eliminate the district court oversight and the district judge statements in two news articles and his practice of having ex parte meetings with counsel for the association created a perception that he was biased against the league.
on the issue of bias,the district judge stated that his comments in the sports articles did not relate to the merits of the vick proceeding and would not lead a reasonable person to question his impartiality.the district judge acknowledged having had ex parte meetings with counsel for the association,but stated that a reasonably informed person would know that the merits of a proceeding were never discussed,that such meetings often preceded decisions in the league favor,and that the practice is the result of a long back to the which both parties were invited to meet in the judge chambers for coffee and the exchange of social pleasantries.concluding that the league had not established a reasonable perception of bias,nor any changed circumstances warranting modification of the consent decree,the district court denied the rule b motion.
ii.discussion 
because the league rule b motion implicates the broader issues of the district court continuing supervision of the settlement agreement and the propriety of the district judge participation in the case,we address those arguments before turning to the narrower forfeiture issue.
modification of the consent decree 
we review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of a rule b motion to amend the judgment.keith mullins,cir.federal rule of civil procedure b provides that o n motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment if applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.a district court thus retains authority to modify an injunction entered pursuant to a consent decree when changed circumstances have caused it to be unjust.keith,at.a consent decree must also be modified if one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become impermissible under federal law.rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d see also gavin branstad,cir observing that a court that takes rufo seriously must consider altering a consent decree if changed circumstances have made compliance substantially more onerous,changed laws have made legal what the decree was designed to prevent,or if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding of governing law.ordinarily,however,modification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were anticipated at the time it entered into a decree.rufo,at.
the league argues that,the district court oversight of the settlement agreement is no longer permissible because it amounts to unlawful meddling in the collective bargaining process.we disagree.the issue in brown was whether the players could bring an antitrust lawsuit against nfl owners after labor negotiations had reached an impasse and the owners unilaterally implemented the terms of their last best offer.at.the court held that the owners could not be sued because the nonstatutory labor exemption to the antitrust laws protected their conduct.id.at.brown addressed antitrust liability,whereas the question presented here is whether a district court may maintain oversight pursuant to the terms of an antitrust settlement.
the rationale in brown does not apply in the present context.in brown,the court gave two primary reasons for shielding owners from antitrust liability a concern that such liability would stifle behavior integral to the bargaining process,and a desire to defer to the congressionally sanctioned balance of power between labor unions,owners,and the national labor relations board.see id.at.with regard to the first reason,the court recognized that the nonstatutory labor exemption was necessary to avoid placing the owners in an untenable position,observing that permitting antitrust liability in such situations would introduce instability and uncertainty into the process,for antitrust law often forbids or discourages the kinds of joint discussions and behavior that the process invites or requires.id.at.in this case,however,there is no concern that the collective behavior necessary for effective bargaining will become fodder for an antitrust lawsuit.for the last sixteen years,the league has had an active collective bargaining relationship with the association,and there is no indication that the owners have been restrained by any fear of antitrust liability.the second reason is similarly inapplicable because the parties agreement to the district court involvement mitigates concerns about unsettling the power structure under the labor laws.
moreover,the law in this circuit at the time the parties entered the settlement agreement was fully consistent with brown.in,we considered the scope of the nonstatutory labor exemption and reached a nearly identical conclusion.see powell,at.the basic dichotomy between labor law and antitrust,as well as its application in professional sports,was recognized decades ago.see,michael jacobs ralph winter,antitrust principles and collective bargaining by athletes of superstars in peonage,yale.when the settlement was approved,both the league and the association were well aware that the existence of a collective bargaining relationship would preclude the players antitrust lawsuits.the applicability of the nonstatutory labor exemption was what caused the association to decertify after its second failed strike,and it is presumably what led the league to insist on recertification and resumption of collective bargaining as part of the settlement.brown therefore does not constitute a change in the law requiring modification of the settlement agreement.
the league argues that the recertification of the players union,the resumption of collective bargaining,and the diminishing number of original class members who continue to play football constitute circumstances that warrant modification of the settlement agreement.we do not agree,for the first two can not be considered changed circumstances because they occurred contemporaneously with the execution of the original agreement.at the time the consent decree was entered,the league sought the ability to terminate the settlement if the players failed to ratify a new cba.see white nfl,finding that the proposed amendment would have no impact on the class members because a new collective bargaining agreement had already been reached.a basic goal of the settlement was the resumption of the parties working relationship collective bargaining and union recertification were both essential means to that end.similarly,the gradual retirement of class members was anticipated in,as it has been each time the settlement agreement has been amended.when,as here,changed conditions have been anticipated from the inception of a consent decree,they will not provide a basis for modification unless the party seeking relief has satisfied a heavy burden of showing that it agreed to the decree in good faith,made a reasonable effort to comply with the decree,and should be relieved of the undertaking under rule b.rufo,at.the league has made no such showing in this case,and thus the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the league rule b motion to end the court oversight.
the league also contends that the district judge erred in refusing to recuse himself because of his comments in the press and ex parte meetings with association representatives.we review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of a motion to recuse.am.prairie constr.hoich,cir.under a,a judge is required to recuse himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.in analyzing whether recusal is required,we ask whether the judge impartiality might reasonably be questioned by the average person on the street who knows all the relevant facts of a case.moran clarke,cir quotation omitted.section a establishes an objective standard,and the existence of actual bias is irrelevant.id.
a motion to recuse,however,is not intended to give litigants a veto power over sitting judges,or a vehicle for obtaining a judge of their choice.united states cooley,cir.we assume the impartiality of a sitting judge and the party seeking disqualification bears the substantial burden of proving otherwise.united states denton,cir.we have also held that a motion to recuse will be denied if it is not timely made.see holloway united states,cir.timeliness requires a party to raise a claim at the earliest possible moment after obtaining knowledge of facts demonstrating the basis for such a claim.fletcher conoco pipe line,cir quotation omitted.
the league first takes issue with two newspaper articles,both of which focused on the district judge role in prompting the antitrust settlement and contributing to a period of peace and prosperity in professional football.the first article was published on july,in the colorado springs gazette,and entitled the peacemaker sports most stable league was forged in judge david doty courtroom.along with the text,the article featured two large pictures of the district judge in a black robe,holding a football.the story was largely historical,explaining how the antitrust lawsuit developed,came before the district judge,and was settled after the judge convinced league officials to compromise.the article included statements from top nfl and association officials,including harold henderson,the nfl executive vice president for labor relations.the district judge shared a brief anecdote about cajoling the league into a settlement,and he is quoted as saying that the relationship between the top nfl and association labor officials should be a model for other sports leagues.near the end of the article,the district judge is quoted again in the following passage 
doty said during one good stretch of negotiations,he said jokingly to the attorneys for each side they did not need him any longer.
it was just an comment,doty said.but a few days later i received a letter from the owners group requesting,based on what i said,that i remove myself from matters involving the nfl and the players union.i laughed at the letter and wrote them a letter kindly denying their request.they would have loved for me to be out of the way.but the letters were fun.
the second article was published on january,in the street smith sports business journal,and entitled nfl toughest official wields a gavel,not a whistle.it was written to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the district judge first major ruling in professional football antitrust litigation.the article recounted much of the same history that appeared in the gazette story and included the district judge observation that commissioner paul tagliabue was a damn good lawyer.the district judge is also quoted in two other passages 
nfl owners pretend they getting beaten around.well,they did,initially,but they had a position that was not legally sound.through a league spokesman,tagliabue declined comment.said doty,though,i think if you ask tagliabue,he would say,the whole thing has come out our way.because,even though they complain about it all they done is make tons of money.
the district judge admits there a pinch of ego involved in his retention of the nfl matters.i could walk away from this case,he said.but there one problem i know that i know too much.they know,including the nfl guys,that they do have to me every time they show up here.
in assessing the impact of these comments,we believe the average person would be aware of the fact that the district judge comments referred to rulings that he made many years earlier and related to matters long since resolved.in these circumstances,we do not believe that the average person would interpret the comments as reflecting bias.the comments focused almost exclusively on the history of the antitrust settlement and did not address the merits of the vick proceeding.viewed in historical context,then,the district judge comments about the league desire to shed itself of the district court oversight and his observations regarding the owners fiscal success were largely statements of the obvious.the tone of the comments,though perhaps unduly casual,was not derogatory or,the district judge praised the nfl leadership and cited the labor leaders on both sides as examples for other leagues.the fact that he has sometimes sided with the league is part of the district judge course and pattern of conduct that warrants consideration in the determination of whether his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.see moran,at.
the league expresses particular concern with the district judge statement that he laughed at the nfl request that the court end its oversight,arguing that the comment suggests he did not take the request seriously.but an informed observer would know that the district court responded to the request with an order that addressed the legal issues that the league raised.to the extent that the district judge statements were jocular and informal,we believe the average observer would see that as reflective of his approach to resolving the disputes brought to him by the parties.
we recognize that,aside from creating a perception of bias,there is a danger that may flow from even seemingly innocuous statements to the press.judges should not create the impression that they covet publicity.i n order to be and remain impartial,and to be perceived as impartial,the judge must be above the fray,not become an advocate in it.mark harrison keith swisher,when judges should be seen,not heard extrajudicial comments concerning pending cases and the controversial exception in the new code of judicial conduct,ann.surv.am.when judges make gratuitous public comments on issues closely related to judicial duties,they risk giving the impression that they have an uncommon interest and degree of personal involvement in the subject matter.cooley,at.behavior in submitting to press interviews may also lead to accusations that a judge will be motivated to decide issues in a way that prompts favorable media attention.harrison swisher,supra,at see also united states microsoft,members of the public may reasonably question whether a judge might consciously or subconsciously seek the outcome.
certain public comments are also specifically proscribed by canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges,which at all times relevant to this case read as follows 
a judge should avoid public comment on the merits of a pending or impending action,requiring similar restraint by court personnel subject to the judge direction and control.this proscription does not extend to public statements made in the course of the judge official duties,to the explanation of court procedures,or to a scholarly presentation made for purposes of legal education 
the code of conduct,which establishes aspirational rules and relies upon,does not overlap perfectly with a and it is possible to violate the code without creating an appearance of partiality.in re boston children first,cir.the district judge concluded that his remarks to the press did not violate canon a,because he did not mention michael vick or the atlanta falcons,the two parties in the underlying dispute.true enough,perhaps,but a broader view of the canon prohibition on public comment strikes us as preferable to a narrow,technical reading of the matters included within the canon scope.thus,although we do not believe that the articles created a reasonable perception of bias,within the meaning of a or canon a,the district judge would have been well advised not to opine publicly about his role in enforcing an ongoing consent decree.
with regard to the ex parte meetings with association counsel,there is no evidence that any of them involved discussion of the merits of a proceeding.to the contrary,it appears that,as described earlier,the meetings consisted solely of a brief exchange of pleasantries in chambers when counsel arrived from out of town.apparently,and for no explained reason,only representatives of the association have attended these meetings.if there were a policy of greeting only representatives of the association,such differential treatment could give rise to a perception of bias.on this record,however,we do not believe that any such inference is strong e
