affirming the district court partial denial of defendant airlines motions for summary judgment,the panel held that the filed rate doctrine did not preclude a suit for antitrust damages challenging defendants unfiled fares,fuel surcharges,or special discount fares.
the plaintiffs alleged that the airlines colluded to fix the prices of certain passenger tickets and fuel surcharges on flights between the united states and asia,in violation of section of the sherman antitrust act.
the filed rate doctrine prohibits individuals from asserting civil antitrust challenges to an entity rates.the panel held that the doctrine did not preclude plaintiffs antitrust claims premised on unfiled fares because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the department of transportation effectively abdicated its authority over the unfiled air fares.the panel held that there were also genuine issues of material fact regarding the dot exercise of regulatory authority over fuel surcharges.addressing one airline discount fares,which differed in both price and terms from the airline filed tariffs,the panel held that the district court did not err in declining to apply the filed rate doctrine given questions of fact regarding whether the discount fares constituted the same product as the fares actually filed.
concurring in part and dissenting in part,judge wallace concurred in the bulk of the majority opinion.he dissented from the majority conclusion,in section iii,subsection b of its opinion,that genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether the dot effectively abdicated its authority over fuel surcharges that the defendants actually filed with the dot.judge wallace wrote that the filed rate doctrine should not be expanded by the rule the courts must determine when an agency has effectively abdicated its authority,notwithstanding the actual filing of rates.
smith,circuit judge 
all nippon airways ana,china airlines,and eva airways collectively,defendants challenge the district court holding that the filed rate doctrine does not preclude putative class action suit for antitrust damages based on allegations of collusion and price fixing.we have not previously addressed the application of the filed rate doctrine to airline fares and fees.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we hold that,based on the record in this case,the filed rate doctrine does not preclude plaintiffs suit for antitrust damages challenging defendants unfiled fares,fuel surcharges,or discount fares.we therefore affirm the district court partial denial of defendants motions for summary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs claim antitrust violations by defendants in connection with three categories of defendants charged rates unfiled fares,fuel surcharges,and special discount fares.
the dot present regulations require airlines to file their rates to differing extents,depending upon whether a particular airline is included within country category a,b,or airlines headquartered in or traveling between the united states and a category a country need not file any fares.airlines headquartered in or traveling between the united states and a category c country must file all fares.finally,airlines headquartered in or traveling between the united states and a category b country must file certain,but not all,of their fares.those fares not required to be filed are the unfiled fares at issue in this appeal.
in addition to charging rates,some airlines impose fuel surcharges,which are additional fees based on the carrier fuel costs.prior to,the dot did not permit separate fuel surcharges.rather,airlines were required to incorporate the cost of fuel into the base ticket price.however,in october,the dot lifted its prohibition on separate fuel surcharges.the parties dispute whether the dot required filing of these newly allowed surcharges.defendants argue that it did,citing a dot statement that all surcharges are to be filed,while plaintiffs argue that the dot statement has no relevance to fuel surcharges given that the dot did not permit fuel surcharges at the time the statement was made.in any event,the record reflects that regardless of whether the dot required airlines to file fuel surcharges,in many cases airlines did file them.
finally,defendant ana offers a number of special discount fares.these include the satogaeri fares and the business discount,biziwari,or fares,all of which operate in the same manner specifically,ana files the respective fares with the dot,then authorizes certain travel agents to sell tickets with more restrictive terms to consumers for some amount less than the filed rate.this lesser amount constitutes the net fare,which travel agents remit to ana as payment for the ticket.the travel agent retains as a commission any difference between the net fare and the amount charged to the consumer.
the terms governing the fares actually filed by ana differed substantially from the terms governing the discount fares.for instance,while one of ana fares could be used for circle trips and double open jaw trips,the discounted version of that fare could not.the same public fare had a minimum stay of three days and allowed for a stopover in japan and up to six transfers,while the discounted fare had no minimum stay,and did not allow stopovers or transfers.some other of ana filed fares similarly differed from their discounted versions in regard to the types of trips permitted,maximum stay required,the amount of time in advance the ticket needed to be purchased,restrictions on stopovers,and applicable cancellation fees.
plaintiff donald wortman filed a putative class action against defendants on november,alleging that defendants as well as other airlines no longer in the suit colluded to fix the prices of certain passenger tickets and fuel surcharges on flights between the united states and asia,in violation of section of the sherman antitrust act.on november,defendants filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs complaint,in part on the ground that the filed rate doctrine barred plaintiffs claims.the district court granted defendants motions in part on may,but denied their motions in regard to their assertion of the filed rate doctrine as a defense against claims for antitrust damages.
on september,following over two years of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,again on the basis of the filed rate doctrine.on september,the district court granted in part and denied in part defendants respective motions for summary judgment.the district court held that while the filed rate doctrine applied to bar plaintiffs antitrust damages claims based on fares,the doctrine did not preclude plaintiffs claims regarding unfiled fares,fuel surcharges,or ana discount fares the district court then granted defendants respective motions to certify its order partially denying summary judgment for interlocutory appeal.we similarly granted defendants petitions for permission to appeal.see b.
i.the history and application of the filed rate doctrine 
the filed rate doctrine is a judicially created rule that prohibits individuals from asserting civil antitrust challenges to an entity rates.the doctrine originated in keogh chicago northwest railway.the plaintiffs in that case sought damages under the sherman act,alleging that the rates charged by common carriers exceeded those that would be charged in a competitive market.id.at.the rates in question,however,had been filed with,and approved by,the interstate commerce commission icc.id.at.the supreme court held that the plaintiffs suit was precluded,explaining that that 
i njury implies violation of a legal right.the legal rights of shipper as against carrier in respect to a rate are measured by the published tariff.unless and until suspended or set aside,this rate is made,for all purposes,the legal rate the rights as defined by the tariff can not be varied or enlarged by either contract or tort of the carrier.
id.at.the supreme court stated that the paramount purpose of this rule was to prevent unjust discrimination between consumers.id.
the supreme court reaffirmed its keogh holding six decades later,in square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,once again applying the filed rate doctrine to bar shippers challenges to carriers filed rates.the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that congress stated intention to promote competition in the shipping industry,as set forth in the motor carrier act of,implied a private right to seek antitrust damages.id.at.rather,the court held that absent a specific statutory provision or legislative history indicating a specific congressional intention to overturn the keogh construction,a private antitrust suit harmony with the general legislative purpose is inadequate to justify deviation from the rule.see also maislin,primary steel,generalized congressional exhortations to increase competition can not provide the icc authority to alter the statutory filed rate requirements.the court also noted that the filed rate doctrine is not properly characterized as antitrust immunity,because other sanctions or equitable relief remain available.square d,at.rather,the doctrine simply precludes treble damages based on a hypothetically lower rate.id.
while the filed rate doctrine initially grew out of circumstances in which common carriers filed rates that a federal agency then directly approved,we have applied the doctrine in contexts beyond this paradigmatic scheme,and most frequently in the realm of energy rates.in gallo winery encana,cir,we considered a suit by customers against a natural gas supplier.the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had jurisdiction over the relevant transactions.gallo,at.the defendants had not filed the challenged rates with ferc.see id.rather,ferc had adopted a approach to rate setting.id.at.we held that to the extent congress has given ferc authority to set rates under the natural gas act and ferc has exercised that authority,such rates are just and reasonable as a matter of law and can not be collaterally challenged under federal antitrust law or state law.id.at emphasis added.the question in that case was whether ferc had actually authorized the rates in question,the lack of a filing requirement notwithstanding.id.at citing pub.util.of snohomish cty.dynegy power,cir,for the proposition that t he fundamental question is whether,under the system setting wholesale electricity rates,ferc is doing enough regulation to justify federal preemption of state laws.in gallo,we found that it had.at.
specifically,we found that while congress actively removed ferc authority to set prices for first sales,and thereby left the determination of natural gas prices at the wellhead to market forces,id.at,ferc continued to regulate rates by determining ex ante that no seller of natural gas could obtain market power and that rates would be just and reasonable,issuing blanket certificates for sales of natural gas,which only then suspended ferc requirements for those sales,and monitoring the operation of the market through the complaint process,id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also public util.of grays harbor idacorp,cir.identifying ways in which ferc maintained regulation of rates.we also found in a prior case that ferc imposed various reporting requirements on sellers,and that the agency had clearly stated its belief that these procedures satisf ied the filed rate doctrine.id.at quoting grays harbor,at.ferc therefore had not abdicated its responsibilities but ha d acted,albeit with a light hand,to authorize just and reasonable rates such that the filed rate doctrine applied.id.at.we cautioned,however,that a failure by ferc to exercise its statutory authority to approve rates would cast doubt on the underlying premise of the filed rate doctrine.id.at emphasis added.
we considered the filed rate doctrine in a wholly different context in carlin dairyamerica,cir.that appeal arose from a putative class action brought by dairy farmers seeking monetary and injunctive relief due to the misreporting of pricing data to the united states department of agriculture usda,which affected the rates for raw milk set under federal milk marketing orders fmmos pursuant to the agricultural marketing agreement act,et.carlin,at.we conceded that fmmo prices were not the paradigmatic filed rates contemplated in keogh because they consisted only of minimum prices,they were not nationally uniform,and fmmos did not exist at all in some locations.id.at.nevertheless,we found sufficient attributes which justify the application of the doctrine.id.in particular,we reiterated our holding from gallo that meaningful review by an agency is not a prerequisite to the application of the filed rate doctrine.id.at.rather,the essential question is whether the market rates were authorized by the agency.id.emphasis in original.in other words,we must ask whether the agency was doing enough regulation to justify federal preemption of state laws.id.at citing gallo,at.t he usda did possess the authority and did exercise it to address problems as to the minimum prices for raw milk.id.at.thus,the filed rate doctrine applied.
nevertheless,despite the general applicability of the filed rate doctrine,we held in carlin that the farmers suit was not barred because the federal agency in question had effectively if retroactively rejected the fmmo prices as incorrect,and the policy considerations behind the doctrine d id not justify applying the doctrine as a bar in that case.id.at.in particular,calculating damages would not involve the kind of hypothetical speculation about agency decisions that keogh forbids.id.at.
we have also addressed a scenario in which the filed rate doctrine did not apply at all,in ting,cir.there,we held that the filed rate doctrine did not bar a putative class action in which customers alleged that a telecommunication provider new contract rates violated state contract and consumer protection laws,despite the fact that the federal communications act fca required telecommunication carriers to file tariffs with the fcc.id.at.we explained that the telecommunications act of fundamentally altered the fca regulatory scheme by directing the fcc to forbear from applying any regulation or any provision where enforcement of such regulation or provision wa s not necessary to ensure that rates are just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory,and where enforcement was neither necessary for consumer protection nor in the public interest.id.at quoting a.
the fcc promptly acted on its authority to forbear,explicitly stating that tariffs were no longer necessary due to market competition and that the filed rate doctrine would no longer apply.id.at.this new forbearance from requiring rate filings did not leave the market without some safeguards the fcc retained a consumer complaint process as a means for consumers to seek a remedy for anticompetitive rates,and the fcc would not defer to the market where it determined the market to be seriously flawed or not competitive.id.at.
as these cases illustrate,the focus of the filed rate doctrine has somewhat expanded beyond its original application,in which an agency express approval of a rate precluded civil antitrust challenges to that rate.nevertheless,our decisions make equally clear that this expansion is not without bounds.see,carlin.
ii.regulation of the international airline industry 
the federal aviation act of faa,pub,stat,established a regulatory structure for airline rates.the faa gave the civil aeronautics board which has since been replaced by the dot authority to approve or disapprove international airline rates in service to its responsibility for preventing unfair,deceptive,predatory,or anticompetitive practices in air transportation.the faa required airlines to file all tariffs with the dot,and authorized the dot to hold hearings,either on its own initiative or upon consumer complaint,to determine the lawfulness of those rates.a b,a.the dot implemented its authority through detailed regulations.see part.
in the late,congress passed legislation intended to increase competition and reduce governmental regulation in the airline industry.the airline deregulation act of ada wholly deregulated the domestic airline market,leading the dot to cease accepting tariff filings for domestic air carriers.see tariffs for domestic travel april,fr.in the international airline market,however,congress stopped short of full deregulation.under the international air transportation competition act of iatca,the dot retained jurisdiction over international airline rates,but had increased discretion over filing requirements.c.iatca correspondingly decreased dot ability to grant antitrust immunity to fare agreements among carriers as part of congress determination that airline service levels and fares should be controlled by competition,not by government regulation.int l air transport tariff conf.proceeding july,at see also b.dot continued to be responsible for providing a complaint process for consumers to challenge international air transport rates as anticompetitive.
in,years after the passage of iatca,the dot announced that,in keeping with the continuing evolution of a policy where we rely on market forces rather than continual government oversight to set prices for air transportation,rate filing no longer served a purpose in competitive foreign markets.fed.reg.accordingly,in,dot issued a final rule creating its three country categories a,b,and c,each with different filing requirements.fed.reg.as noted,supra,the rule required airlines flying between category c countries and the united states,or that were nationals of a category c country those airlines headquartered in category c countries,to file all tariffs with the dot.a iii.airlines headquartered in or flying to and from category b countries had to file only their standard economy fares with the dot.a ii.airlines headquartered in or flying to and from category a countries were not subject to any filing requirements,except to the extent that they operated flights to or from category b or c countries.a i.the country categories corresponded roughly to the strength of bilateral agreements between the united states and a particular country.fed.reg.at.the dot stated that it has always had the statutory authority to take action directly against unfiled passenger fares,and reserve s the option of reinstating the obligation where consistent with the public interest.fed.reg.at.
airlines submit tariffs by filing them with the airline tariff publishing company atpco,which acts as a private clearinghouse to distribute fares to various entities,including the government filing system gfs through which the dot reviews filed fares.atpco filters submitted fares based on the dot country categories,and flags certain fares to be presented to the dot for review.the dot does not consider a fare as filed until it has been so presented,and the dot does not appear to have access to unpresented fares.
in,the dot required that all surcharges be filed.dot notice of exemption from the department requirements,dkt.however,the dot prohibited airlines from charging separate fuel surcharges prior to.in,the dot explained that the prohibition on fuel surcharges was established at a time when the department was regulating fares much more actively than is the case today,and it was concerned that tariff surcharges could undermine its regulatory supervision of fare levels.however,it stated that increasingly competitive market conditions rendered this prohibition no longer necessary to support the limited degree of pricing supervision that continues.
as of october,the dot directed that carriers we re free to file surcharges in general rules tariffs.the following month the dot announced that carriers could no longer advertise surcharges as being,stating that it could not effectively monitor fuel charges filed separately from base fares,and that listing separate surcharges as approved would constitute an unfair and deceptive trade practice.fed.reg.
iii.application of the filed rate doctrine to international airline fares and fees 
application of the filed rate doctrine to unfiled fares 
we have previously applied the filed rate doctrine to circumstances in which the relevant rates were not literally filed.see gallo,at grays harbor,at wah chung duke energy trading,cir.in so doing,we have found that even though the regulating agency did not oversee rates via a filing system,the agency engaged in sufficient regulation through other means to satisfy the purposes of the doctrine.see,gallo,at.in the present instance,by contrast,we agree with the district court determination that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the dot effectively abdicated its authority over the unfiled air fares.accordingly,we hold that the filed rate doctrine does not preclude plaintiffs antitrust claims premised on the unfiled fares.
the parties do not dispute that the dot had the authority to regulate unfiled rates,only whether it actually did so.as in the energy rate context,the dot maintains a consumer complaint process through which consumers may challenge a rate as unreasonable or anticompetitive.the maintenance of a consumer complaint process is not,however,dispositive.see,ting,at.
we acknowledge that,unlike the fcc affirmative disavowal of telecommunications regulation,the dot has at least paid to the notion that it continues to exercise some oversight of unfiled rates.in particular,when the dot first set forth its filing scheme,it stated that the new system would not materially lessen the department ability to intervene in passenger pricing matters because 
first,the review of international air transport association passenger fare agreements will continue.second,the department has always had the statutory authority to take action directly against unfiled passenger fares and rules under a variety of circumstances.and third,the department will reserve the option under the proposed rule of revoking the exemption,and thus of reinstating the obligation,with regard to a particular carrier or carriers,or for specific markets,where consistent with the public interest.
fed.reg.at.nevertheless,the evidence shows that the dot actual actions regarding unfiled fares have been minimal at best.appellants point only to the reassignment of argentina to a stricter country category as evidence of any ongoing regulation.additionally,there remains some question regarding whether despite the dot representation that it would maintain authority over unfiled fares the dot has the ability to actually access or review those fares.the dot only means of considering unfiled rates appears to be through assessment of the strength of bilateral pricing agreements between the united states and a given country,and consumer complaints.see.
in short,there are genuine issues of fact as to whether the dot has effectively abdicated the exercise of its authority to regulate unfiled fares.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying summary judgment to defendants as to those fares based on the filed rate doctrine.see gallo,at a failure by ferc to exercise its statutory authority to approve rates would cast doubt on the underlying premise of the filed rate doctrine.
application of the filed rate doctrine to fuel surcharges 
as with unfiled fares,the parties do not contest that the dot had authority to regulate fuel surcharges,but only whether it actually did so.the district court did not err by finding that genuine issues of material fact regarding the dot exercise of regulatory authority over fuel surcharges precluded entry of summary judgment for defendants.
the dot did not permit airlines to impose fuel charges separately from base airfares prior to,at which time the dot appears to have permitted,but not required,airlines to file any such surcharges in their general rules tariffs.admittedly,affording airlines the freedom to file surcharges,but not requiring them to do so,makes little sense businesses are unlikely to expend time and money complying with optional regulations.thus defendants argue that the dot did actually require airlines to file fuel surcharges,and that the language permitt ing airlines to file surcharges in their general rules tariffs indicates discretion on the part of airlines regarding the procedural manner in which they file their fuel charges,not whether they file at all.defendants further argue that the dot required filing of fuel surcharges pursuant to its rule notice statin
