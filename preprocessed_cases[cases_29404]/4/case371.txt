background 
conseco is a delaware financial services company with its principal place of business in minnesota.conseco mortgage service division originates residential loans for individuals in the subprime lending market,individuals with low credit scores.north american competes for individuals in the same market.the facts and issues in this case arise from actions taken by north american to acquire information about individuals that is contained in conseco confidential files.north american sought this information in an attempt to pursue conseco loan customers and business leads.
conseco generates potential customer leads through a computerized database,which conseco developed,that analyzes financial information from over forty million individuals conseco computer program identifies individuals who might benefit from its services and compiles a list of the potential customers,which is sent to conseco branch offices throughout the country in the form of customer lead sheets.
conseco organizes these lead sheets according to most promising are colored red,leads that are considered good are colored white,and merely decent leads are colored blue.once a lead sheet is received in a branch office,the office manager then forwards it to a loan originator,who calls these potential customers to offer conseco financial services.to insure the confidentiality of these lead sheets,conseco requires all employees to sign a form that acknowledges their receipt and understanding of the contents of conseco employee handbook.this handbook states that information about customers,dealers,and others is strictly confidential.
in,over the course of several months,a substantial number of conseco office managers and loan originators resigned,and many of conseco former employees took jobs working for north american.several of these former conseco employees resigned after receiving solicitations from north american.in some instances,the former conseco office managers also took their staffs of loan originators with them to north american.
during this same period,conseco mortgage service division downsized.most notably,conseco management decided to discontinue loan services in the subprime lending market.a number of these now former employees testified at the preliminary injunction hearing that because conseco was leaving the subprime lending market,they worried about their future,especially considering the fact that they worked on commission.some of these former employees also expressed concern about conseco overall future financial performance.indeed,conseco had closed thirty of its branch offices within the previous year.also,some employees noted that conseco had recently placed significant restraints on its area managers loan authority.
shortly after this employee exodus began,conseco received a letter from one of its louis branch customers,michael mambretti,complaining that his confidential loan information had been taken by a conseco loan originator,from conseco to north american.mambretti learned this fact through a phone call from a north american loan originator.the caller informed mambretti that all of his personal financial he had entrusted to moved with the loan originator to north american louis office.
in response,conseco sent a copy of mambretti letter to north american with a request that north american cease and desist from taking and using information contained in conseco loan files.conseco also asked that north american return all of the information that it had acquired from conseco former employees.however,north american neither returned the stolen information nor discouraged its employees use of conseco loan files and lead sheets.quite the contrary,north american encouraged others in its offices to replicate the louis scheme,and designated its louis office as a model to expand into other cities.
conseco filed a complaint alleging misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,and tortious interference with business relations.conseco also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order prohibiting certain north american employees from taking,using,or disclosing documents from conseco loan files,and to return any information taken from conseco files.the district court granted a temporary restraining order tro prohibiting these named north american employees from taking,using,or disclosing documents from conseco loan files,and requiring the return of any information taken from conseco files.
conseco also filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction to prevent the raiding of its employees.in support of this motion,conseco identified three former employees that it alleged had misappropriated its trade secrets.the first,kevin kattleman,a former area manager in its,illinois,office,testified that fourteen customer loan files from conseco were in his possession after he began to work for north american.these loan files included personal financial statements of conseco customers,loan applications,appraisals,income calculation worksheets,forms,payroll information of conseco customers,income calculation worksheets,tax returns,and bank statements of conseco customers.these files were located in kattleman office at north american until he returned them to conseco,as ordered by the district court in its tro.kattleman testified that he was uncertain as to exactly how the customer loan files came to be located in his office at north american.
the second,kevin podner,a former area manager from conseco office in springfield,illinois,testified that shortly before his resignation from conseco,he made a copy of a substantial number of loan applications on which he had worked during his time with conseco.podner did not specify the exact number of loan applications copied.podner said he copied the files in order to aid an employee who wished to make the transition to loan originator.podner further testified that in his line of work,it was very common to help new loan originators in this manner,as it is much easier to generate new business with customers who have previously conducted business with conseco.
finally,scott bristol,a former area manager at conseco charles,missouri,office,testified that although he did not have personal knowledge that any loan originators working under him in charles made copies of customer loan applications,it was possible that such copying did occur.bristol also stated that he encouraged three of the loan originators working under him at conseco to resign and come to work with him at north american.bristol also testified that before leaving conseco,he compiled a list of to customers who had previously engaged in business with conseco.this list included the names and phone numbers of these customers.upon arriving at north american,bristol gave these names and numbers to loan originators as leads,who contacted these former conseco customers.bristol testified that he believed between one to six of these leads resulted in new business for north american.however,he speculated that as many as ten of these former conseco customers could have switched their business to north american.
bristol also returned a number of documents at his deposition,in accordance with the district court tro.these documents contained information concerning conseco internal operations,including monthly retail point income reports generated by each conseco office,reports ranking the retail volume by branch,reports of retail loans funded by region,financial summaries of each branch,expense ratio reports,expense analysis reports,expense analysis retail volume variance reports,and reports on credit insurance protection.
bristol also testified that he began his employment with north american on june,but did not resign his position with conseco until july.consequently,he was employed by both companies during this two week period.at the preliminary hearing,bristol testified that he and the other conseco employees were put on the payroll of north american on june,for benefits purposes,and that they did not work for both companies at the same time.later,at trial,he admitted they were working for both companies at the same time.
after the preliminary hearing,the district court entered a injunction.it determined that conseco lead sheets and documents in its loan files are trade secrets,but also determined that conseco customer lists and certain financial information are not trade secrets.it further found that conseco was likely to succeed on its claims of misappropriation of trade secrets against north american relating to the actions of podner and kattleman,but not bristol.it then entered an injunction against north american,podner,and kattleman from soliciting customers who had documents taken from their loan files.
the district court,however,denied conseco remaining request for injunctive relief relating to north american solicitation of its employees.conseco appealed the district court denial of injunctive relief as to its raiding claim.we,however,affirmed the decision of the district court to deny the injunction.conseco fin.servicing north american mortgage.cir.
conseco,in its first amended complaint,added two additional in breach of fiduciary duty,and a separate count for injunctive relief.north american moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted north american motion as to misappropriation of customer lists and certain financial information.it also granted summary judgment in north american favor as to solicitation of employees and participation in breach of fiduciary duty.however,the district court denied north american summary judgment motion relating to misappropriation of lead sheets,documents in conseco loan files,unfair competition,and tortious interference with business relations.the parties proceeded to a trial on the merits for these issues.
at trial,conseco evidence established that thousands of conseco lead sheets were in north american possession,that employees worked simultaneously for both companies,that conseco loan documents were faxed to senior management at north american,and that employees from several of conseco offices had taken conseco loan documents to north american conseco offered expert testimony that approximately five percent of conseco lead sheets result in funded loans,each with an profit per loan of.conseco financial analysts estimated that conseco suffered compensatory damages of between million and million.north american senior manager,ken keeler,provided rebuttal expert testimony,stating that the profit on a loan was carrie hiatt,a north american witness,further testified that approximately ten percent of certain conseco leads resulted in funded loans.another of north american witnesses,perry schatz,testified only five percent of conseco leads result in a funded loan.
at both the close of conseco case and the close of all of the evidence,north american filed motions for directed verdict,which were argued before the court.both motions were denied by the district court,and the case was submitted to the jury on conseco claims of unfair competition and tortious interference.after the jury returned a verdict against north american on each of the claims,north american filed several motions,primarily relating to the damage awards.the district court upheld each of the awards,noting that north american conduct was widespread and systematic and reprehensible,and that the award was not an injustice,but rather appropriate in light of the evidence.the instant appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
unfair competition 
for its first assignment of error,north american directs our attention to conseco unfair competition claim that is founded on north american alleged misuse of conseco trade secrets north american argues that the district court erred in its initial decision to submit this claim to the jury and then in its subsequent declination to grant a judgment as a matter of law.we review the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.emmenegger bull moose tube,cir.we will consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,giving the prevailing party the benefit of all reasonable inferences,id.at,and we will not judge the credibility of the witnesses or weigh the evidence.id.we will not set aside the jury verdict unless there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the verdict.walsh national computer systems,cir.
in order to recover damages for unfair competition,conseco was required to prove the existence of a trade secret,the communication of the trade secret to another,while that former employee was in a position of trust and confidence with conseco,and the use of the trade secret that damaged conseco.pony,equus comp.of,cir.according to missouri law,a trade secret is but not limited or nontechnical data,a formula,pattern,compilation,program,device,method,technique,or process that derives independent economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known to,and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.west,dieckhaus.also,in order to be considered a trade secret,the information must be the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.id.
initially,we must determine whether conseco lead sheets and the information contained in its customer files constitute trade secrets under the missouri uniform trade secrets act.see.ann.stat.although it is undisputed that the lead sheets themselves are not generally accessible to the public,north american asserts that much of the information contained within these lead sheets can either be purchased from various credit agencies or found in mortgage records,all of which are accessible to the public.conseco counters that while some of the information within these lead sheets can be harvested from these two sources,its proprietary computer program provides a unique depth of information that can not be obtained from alternative sources and its loan files contain confidential customer information.
we agree that both the lead sheets and the information contained in these customer files constitute trade secrets under the act.the lead sheets are a product of a apparently quite program that was uniquely conseco.the ultimate product of the lead loan financial statements,loan applications,appraisals,income calculation worksheets,forms,payroll information of conseco customers,tax returns,and bank statements of conseco customers.it is clear to us that conseco derives economic benefit from this information.indeed,through possession of these loan files,conseco is in a unique position of being able to analyze its customers specific financial needs and identify those current customers who may need additional conseco financial services.
furthermore,conseco takes reasonable steps to ensure the secrecy of these files.witnesses for both parties testified that the information contained in these files was recognized by all conseco employees as confidential,and therefore not to be disclosed.conseco employee handbook specifically states that information about customers,dealers,and others is strictly confidential.consequently,we agree with the district court that the lead sheets and the information contained in conseco customer loan files constitute trade secrets within the meaning of the missouri uniform trade secrets act 
having concluded that these lead sheets and loan files constitute trade secrets,we must next consider whether conseco produced evidence of actual or threatened misappropriation of these trade secrets.conseco asserts that kevin kattleman,kevin podner,and scott bristol all removed customer loan copies of the conseco offices.it is undisputed that fourteen conseco customer loan files were in kattleman possession after he resigned from conseco.furthermore,these customer loan files eventually made their way to his office at north american.conseco produced evidence that would allow a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that there was at least a threat of misappropriation of the trade secrets contained in these fourteen files.therefore,conseco established a proper misappropriation claim with regards to these fourteen loan files.
additionally,conseco produced evidence that podner made copies of an unspecified number of customer loan files shortly before his resignation.podner testified that the number was substantial.although podner claims he made these copies in order to help a fellow employee make the transition to loan originator,conseco provided evidence that would allow a reasonable finder of fact to determine that a threat of misappropriation existed with regard to these specific files.podner wholesale copying of customer loan files,which coincided with his resignation from conseco and hiring by north american,creates at least the threat of misappropriation.therefore,conseco established a second misappropriation claim in regard to those specific loan files copied by podner just prior to his resignation from conseco.
conseco also presented evidence that in its davenport,iowa,the filing of the area manager,rick lasek,worked for both companies,copied thousands of conseco lead sheets,sent them to north american,copied all of the hud settlement statements from his office,and stated that his goal was to put the mother ers conseco out of business.north american management consented to the document duplication by its employees.two of the loan originators that lasek recruited to leave conseco with him eventually returned to work at a change of testified about lasek actions.
in viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,we hold there is ample evidence supporting each element of an unfair competition claim.because the evidence is susceptible to a reasonable inference supporting the verdict,we affirm the district court decision to submit this claim to the jury and its subsequent denial of judgment as a matter of law.
tortious interference 
next,north american claims that because the missouri uniform trade secrets act has replaced all remedies,no tort claim is maintainable unless the information qualifies as a trade secret under the statute.because we have found adequate evidence of the existence of a trade secret,we need not address north american argument.we will leave the question of whether tortious interference remains an independent claim to another court and another day.we do,however,make this procedural american failed to raise the issue of submissibility of the tortious interference claim in its directed verdict motion either at the close of conseco case or at the close of all evidence.see.a stating that litigants must specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.
compensatory damage award 
north american next argues that,even if the loan files and lead sheets are considered trade secrets,conseco still did not make a submissible case of either the fact of damages or the amount of damages.most persuasively,north american contends that the exacting nature and quality of proof needed for recovery of lost profits in missouri required conseco to prove net profits by introducing evidence of the cost and expense of operating the business during these periods.meridian enters.kcbs.accordingly,north american concludes that there was insufficient evidence,absent proof of net profit,for any submissible cause of action to survive and requests that we overturn the jury verdict as a matter of law and enter judgment in north american favor.
in response,conseco contends that north american failed to comply with the requirements of.in its request for judgment as a matter of law and thus has not preserved this argument for appeal.we agree.rule a requires that challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must be raised initially at the close of the evidence.such challenges must be sufficiently specific so as to apprise the district court of the grounds relied on in support of the motion.a.the purpose of requiring the moving party to articulate the ground on which the rule judgment is sought is to give the other party an opportunity to cure the defects in proof that might otherwise preclude him from taking the case to the jury.realty dev,cir.if specificity is lacking,judgment as a matter of law may neither be granted by the district court nor upheld on appeal unless such a result is required to prevent manifest injustice.walsh,at quoting cruz local union of the int l of workers,cir.
however,the rules are such that technical precision is not necessary in stating grounds for the motion so long as the trial court is aware of the movant position.rockport,digital simplistics,cir quoting cortez life ins.of,cir.if colloquy between counsel and the trial court fleshes out the motion,it may provide the opposing party with the requisite notice,at.however,a motion for judgment may not advance additional grounds that were not raised in the motion.walsh,at quoting rockport,digital simplistics,cir.accordingly,a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence preserves for review only those grounds specified at the time,and no others.zachar lee.cir quoting sanchez puerto rico oil,cir.
if the rule a motion is denied and the case is submitted to a jury,the movant must renew the motion once again in order to preserve the issue for appeal.see.b martin redish,moore federal practice ed.adherence to the rule is mandatory.walsh,at.the grounds for the renewed motion under rule b are limited to those asserted in the earlier rule a motion.sanchez,at.in other words,the movant can not use a rule b motion as a vehicle to introduce a legal theory not distinctly articulated in its motion for a directed verdict.zachar,at quoting correa hosp.san francisco,cir.
north american argued in its rule a motion styled motion for directed verdict that conseco failed to offer sufficient proof that it sustained damages that were proximately caused by north american use or misappropriation of trade secret documents.following the jury verdict,north american renewed its motion under rule b.and,consistent with rule,north american similar but not precise previously articulated proximate cause damage theory,conseco failed to prove a causal connection between any conduct properly actionable and any loss to conseco.however,north american also introduced several new legal to distinctly articulated in its directed verdict motion.on appeal,north american questions not whether conseco proved sufficient connection of its damages to north american alleged wrongful conduct but whether conseco proved it had incurred damages at all.at the close of the evidence,north american sought judgment as a matter of law arguing that the there was no causal connection between the alleged wrongdoing and the damages.such an objection is simply not sufficient to preserve,and certainly can not be read to encompass,the legal theories underlying north american rule b motion and this appeal submissibility of the claim.kientzy mcdonnell douglas,cir.
on appeal,north american offers an eloquent and persuasive argument regarding the stringent requirements relating to the calculation of lost profits,particularly in relation to net profits.however,these were not the specific grounds on which north american argued below.given north american failure to comply with rule,our review is limited to whether the record reflects an absolute dearth of evidentiary support for the jury verdict.zachar,at quoting davignon clemmey,cir.under this standard,the district court will only be reversed when its ruling is obviously insupportable.id.a review of the record leaves us with no doubt that the jury had sufficient evidence before it albeit conflicting evidence to conclude that north american had engaged in unfair c
