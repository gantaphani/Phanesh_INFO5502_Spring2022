petitioners seek review of a federal trade commission letter regarding the ftc funeral rule.under the federal trade commission statute under which petitioners seek review of the only have jurisdiction over challenges to ftc trade regulation rules or substantive amendments to such rules.we hold that the letter is not a substantive amendment to the funeral rule,and therefore we lack jurisdiction over this petition for review.
in the,the ftc conducted a lengthy investigation of the funeral industry.the commission determined that purchasers of funeral services are often unable to make careful,informed decisions regarding funeral transactions.funerals are extremely expensive,and decisions about funeral planning must be made under tight time pressure during very stressful times.see funeral industry practices,fed.reg.the ftc investigation revealed that funeral consumers are highly vulnerable to unfair and deceptive trade practices,and that many funeral providers were unlawfully taking advantage of their customers.to prevent such practices,the ftc promulgated the funeral rule in september.id.at.among other provisions,the rule prohibits funeral providers from making misrepresentations about legal requirements,and it requires that providers make certain disclosures and give customers an itemized price list.see.
this case concerns the provisions of the funeral rule that regulate cash advance items.the rule defines cash advance item as 
any item of service or merchandise described to a purchaser as a cash advance,accommodation,cash disbursement,or similar term.a cash advance item is also any item obtained from a third party and paid for by the funeral provider on the purchaser behalf.cash advance items may include,but are not limited to cemetery or crematory services pallbearers public transportation clergy honoraria flowers musicians or singers nurses obituary notices gratuities and death certificates.
b.this definition identifies two different types of cash advance items items that are expressly described by the funeral provider as cash advances,accommodations,or cash disbursements and items obtained by the funeral provider from a third party on the purchaser behalf.with respect to items that fall into one of these categories,the rule prohibits funeral providers from either 
i represent ing that the price charged for a cash advance item is the same as the cost to the funeral provider for the item when such is not the case or 
ii fail ing to disclose to persons arranging funerals that the price being charged for a cash advance item is not the same as the cost to the funeral provider for the item when such is the case.
id.f.the rule also requires that if a funeral provider charges extra for cash advance receives a rebate,commission,or discount from the provider must state on the itemized bill that we charge you for our services in obtaining specify cash advance items.id.f.
at issue in the instant case is the commission subsequent interpretation of cash advance item.in april,a member of the texas legislature wrote to the commission seeking clarification of the definition of that term.the ftc responded on july,in a letter from the full commission,the ftc stated that the term cash advance item only applies to 
those items that the funeral provider represents expressly to be cash advance items or represents by implication to be procured on behalf of a particular customer and provided to that customer at the same price the funeral provider paid for them.
the commission noted that reasonable consumers generally understand that the price charged by a retail seller includes profit.accordingly,the corrective disclosure about cash advance items is unnecessary when the funeral provider does not mislead the customer through either express representations that the item is a cash advance item or alternative formulations,or implied representations that the customer is paying no more for an item than the amount the funeral provider paid for it.in other words,the ftc concluded that the provisions of the funeral rule regulating cash advance items do not apply unless consumers expect to receive the items in question at cost.
petitioners in the instant case are the funeral consumers group dedicated to helping its members obtain meaningful,dignified,and affordable funerals and three individuals.two of the individual petitioners allege that they recently paid for funerals,and that the cash advance items they purchased were marked up without the proper disclosures.petitioners seek direct review in this court of the letter under the judicial review provisions of the federal trade commission act.they argue that the letter should be set aside as unlawful because it narrowed the scope of the funeral rule definition of cash advance item without following the proper rulemaking procedures for amending a trade regulation rule.
before reaching the merits,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over this petition for review.see steel citizens for a better env t,d the requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter springs from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the united states and is inflexible and without exception.citations and internal punctuation omitted.more specifically,we must determine whether jurisdiction is proper in this court under the judicial review provisions of the federal trade commission act ftca.we hold that it is not,and we therefore dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
petitioners seek direct review in this court of the letter under the judicial review provisions of the federal trade commission act.the ftca grants the commission authority to promulgate trade regulation rules such as the funeral define with specificity acts or practices which are unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.a b.the act provides for judicial review of trade regulation rules as follows 
not later than days after a rule is promulgated under subsection a b of this section by the commission,any interested person including a consumer or consumer organization may file a petition,in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit or for the circuit in which such person resides or has his principal place of business,for judicial review of such rule.
id.e a.the ftca provides for judicial review of substantive amendments to trade regulation rules in a similar manner 
a substantive amendment to,or repeal of,a rule promulgated under subsection a b of this section shall be prescribed,and subject to judicial review,in the same manner as a rule prescribed under such subsection.
id.d b.thus,direct review in the courts of appeals is only available for challenges to trade regulation rules or substantive amendments of such rules.parties seeking review of other ftc actions must proceed in accordance with the administrative procedure act,under which review must be sought in district court in the first instance.see public citizen ftc,holding that in the absence of a statutory grant of jurisdiction in the courts of appeals,regulations may be reviewed,in the manner prescribed by the apa,in a district court.therefore,as a threshold matter,we must determine whether the letter is a substantive amendment of the funeral rule that may be reviewed in this court under the ftca.we hold that the letter interpretation of the funeral rule rather than a substantive amendment,and we thus lack jurisdiction over the petition for review.
our precedents are instructive as to the distinction between interpretation and amendment.for example,we have held that an agency action is an amendment of a rule if it repudiates or is irreconcilable with a prior legislative rule.family planning and reproductive health ass sullivan,citation omitted.similarly,if an agency attempts to supplement a statute,not simply to construe it,then the agency action is likely to be deemed a substantive amendment rather than an interpretation.id.quoting chamber of commerce osha.we have also noted that an agency action does not become an amendment merely because it supplies crisper and more detailed lines than the authority being interpreted.if that were so,no
