on february,heinz company heinz and milnot holding corporation entered into a merger agreement.the federal trade commission commission or ftc sought a preliminary injunction pursuant to section b of the federal trade commission act ftca,b,to enjoin the consummation of the merger.the injunction was sought in aid of an ftc administrative proceeding which was subsequently instituted by complaint to challenge the merger as violative of,inter alia,section of the clayton act.the district court denied the preliminary injunction and the ftc appealed to this court.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court and remand for entry of a preliminary injunction against heinz and.
background 
four million infants in the united states consume million cases of jarred baby food annually,representing a domestic market of million to billion ftc heinz,d.the baby food market is dominated by three firms,gerber products company gerber,heinz and.gerber,the industry leader,enjoys a per cent market share while heinz and come in second and third,with a per cent and a per cent share respectively.id.the district court found that gerber enjoys unparalleled brand recognition with a brand loyalty greater than any other product sold in the united states.id.at.gerber products are found in over per cent of all american supermarkets 
by contrast,heinz is sold in approximately per cent of all supermarkets.its sales are nationwide but concentrated in northern new england,the southeast and deep south and the midwest.id.at.despite its domestic market share,heinz is the largest producer of baby food in the world with billion in sales worldwide.its domestic baby food products with annual net sales of million are manufactured at its pittsburgh,pennsylvania plant,which was updated in at a cost of million.id.at.the plant operates at per cent of its production capacity and produces million cases of baby food annually.its baby food line includes about skus stock keeping units,that is,product varieties,strained carrots,apple sauce.heinz lacks gerber brand recognition it markets itself as a value brand with a shelf price several cents below gerber.id.at.
has a market share comparable to that of heinz,with million in annual sales of baby food,of which per cent is jarred baby food.its jarred baby food line consists of skus.manufactures all of its baby food in canajoharie,new york at a manufacturing plant that was built in and began manufacturing baby food in.maintains price parity with gerber,selling at about one penny less.it markets its product as a premium brand.id.consumers generally view its product as comparable in quality to gerber.id.is carried in approximately per cent of all grocery stores.although its sales are nationwide,they are concentrated in new york,new jersey,california and florida id.at.
at the wholesale level heinz and both make payments called fixed trade spending also known as slotting fees or arrangements to grocery stores to obtain shelf placement.id.at.gerber,with its strong name recognition and brand loyalty,does not make such payments.the other type of wholesale trade spending is variable trade spending,which typically consists of manufacturers discounts and allowances to supermarkets to create retail price differentials that entice the consumer to purchase their product instead of a competitor.id.
under the terms of their merger agreement,heinz would acquire per cent of voting securities for million.accordingly,they filed a premerger notification and report form with the ftc and the united states department of justice pursuant to the antitrust improvement act of,on july,the ftc authorized this action for a preliminary injunction under section b of the ftca and,on july,it filed a complaint and motion for preliminary injunction.the district court conducted a hearing in late august and early september and heard final arguments on september.the record before the district court consisted of exhibits,including demonstrative exhibits,depositions and affidavits.in addition,eleven witnesses testified.on october,the district court denied preliminary injunctive relief.the court concluded that it was more probable than not that consummation of the merger will actually increase competition in jarred baby food in the united states.heinz,d at.the ftc appealed and sought injunctive relief pending appeal,which this court granted on november.on november,the ftc filed an administrative complaint against heinz and,charging that the proposed merger violates section of the ftca and,if consummated,would violate section of the clayton act.in the matter of heinz,docket filed.

section of the clayton act 
section of the clayton act prohibits acquisitions,including mergers,where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country,the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition,or to tend to create a monopoly.see united states philadelphia bank,d the statutory test is whether the effect of the merger may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of commerce in any section of the country.the congress used the words may be substantially to lessen competition emphasis supplied,to indicate that its concern was with probabilities,not certainties.brown shoe united states,d emphasis original see,at,cong.admin.news at,the use of these words may be means that the bill,if enacted,would not apply to the mere possibility but only to the reasonable probability of the pr o scribed effect.merger enforcement,like other areas of antitrust,is directed at market power.it shares with the law of monopolization a degree of schizophrenia an aversion to potent power that heightens risk of abuse and tolerance of that degree of power required to attain economic benefits.lawrence sullivan warren grimes,the law of antitrust,at.the congress has empowered the ftc,inter alia,to weed out those mergers whose effect may be substantially to lessen competition from those that enhance competition.see,at.in section b of the ftca,the congress provided a mechanism whereby the ftc may seek preliminary injunctive relief preventing the merging parties from consummating the merger until the commission has had an opportunity to investigate and,if necessary,adjudicate the matter.
section b of the federal trade commission act 
whenever the commission has reason to believe that a corporation is violating,or is about to violate,section of the clayton act,the ftc may seek a preliminary injunction to prevent a merger pending the commission administrative adjudication of the merger legality.ftc staples,see b.section b provides for the grant of a preliminary injunction where such action would be in the public determined by a weighing of the equities and a consideration of the commission likelihood of success on the merits.b the congress intended this standard to depart from what it regarded as the equity standard,which it characterized as requiring the plaintiff to show irreparable damage,probability of success on the merits and a balance of equities favoring the plaintiff,at.the congress determined that the traditional standard was not appropriate for the implementation of a federal statute by an independent regulatory agency where the standards of the public interest measure the propriety and the need for injunctive relief.id.the courts had evolved an approach to cases in which government agencies,acting to enforce a federal statute,sought interim relief.the agency,in such cases,was not held to the high thresholds applicable where private parties seek interim restraining orders.ftc weyerhaeuser,see ftc exxon,in enacting section b,congress further demonstrated its concern that injunctive relief be broadly available to the ftc by incorporating a unique public interest standard in b,rather than the more stringent,traditional equity standard for injunctive relief.the ftc is not required to establish that the proposed merger would in fact violate section of the clayton act.staples.at see ftc food town stores,cir the district court is not authorized to determine whether the antitrust laws have been or are about to be violated.that adjudicatory function is vested in the ftc in the first instance.we now consider the ftc likelihood of success and weigh the equities.accord ftc freeman,cir ftc university health,cir warner communications,at.
likelihood of success 
to determine likelihood of success on the merits we measure the probability that,after an administrative hearing on the merits,the commission will succeed in proving that the effect of the merger may be substantially to lessen competition,or to tend to create a monopoly in violation of section of the clayton act.this court and others have suggested that the standard for likelihood of success on the merits is met if the ftc has raised questions going to the merits so serious,substantial,difficult and doubtful as to make them fair ground for thorough investigation,study,deliberation and determination by the ftc in the first instance and ultimately by the court of appeals.ftc beatrice foods,appendix to statement of mackinnon robb,jj.staples.at warner communications,at quoting national tea,at see university health,at.this specific standard was articulated by the court below,see heinz,d at,and it is a standard to which the appellees have not objected.
in united states baker hughes,we explained the analytical approach by which the government establishes a section violation.first the government must show that the merger would produce a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market,and would result in a significant increase in the concentration of firms in that market.philadelphia bank,at.such a showing establishes a presumption that the merger will substantially lessen competition.see baker hughes,at.to rebut the presumption,the defendants must produce evidence that show s that the statistics give an inaccurate account of the merger probable effects on competition in the relevant market.united states citizens bank,d if the defendant successfully rebuts the presumption of illegality,the burden of producing additional evidence of anticompetitive effect shifts to the government,and merges with the ultimate burden of persuasion,which remains with the government at all times.baker hughes,at see also kaiser aluminum,at.although baker hughes was decided at the merits stage as opposed to the preliminary injunctive relief stage,we can nonetheless use its analytical approach in evaluating the commission showing of likelihood of success.accordingly,we look at the ftc prima facie case and the defendants rebuttal evidence.
prima facie case 
merger law rests upon the theory that,where rivals are few,firms will be able to coordinate their behavior,either by overt collusion or implicit understanding,in order to restrict output and achieve profits above competitive levels.ftc ppg,increases in concentration above certain levels are thought to raise a likelihood of interdependent anticompetitive conduct.id.quoting general dynamics,at.see ftc elders grain,cir.market concentration,or the lack thereof,is often measured by the index hhi.see staples.at 
sufficiently large hhi figures establish the ftc prima facie case that a merger is.see baker hughes,at ppg,at.the district court found that the hhi score for the baby food industry is indicative of a highly concentrated industry heinz,d at see ppg,at horizontal merger guidelines,supra.the merger of heinz and will increase the hhi by points.this creates,by a wide margin,a presumption that the merger will lessen competition in the domestic jarred baby food market.see horizontal merger guidelines,supra,stating that hhi increase of more than points,where hhi exceeds,is presumed likely to create or enhance market power or facilitate its exercise see also baker hughes,at ppg,at here,the ftc market concentration are bolstered by the indisputable fact that the merger will eliminate competition between the two merging parties at the wholesale level,where they are currently the only competitors for what the district court described as the second position on the supermarket shelves.heinz,d at.heinz own documents recognize the wholesale competition and anticipate that the merger will end it.ja see also ja.indeed,those documents disclose that heinz considered three options to end the vigorous wholesale competition with two involved innovative measures while the third entailed the acquisition of.ja.heinz chose the third,and least,of the options.
finally,the anticompetitive effect of the merger is further enhanced by high barriers to market entry the district court found that there had been no significant entries in the baby food market in decades and that new entry was difficult and improbable.heinz,d at.this finding largely eliminates the possibility that the reduced competition caused by the merger will be ameliorated by new competition from outsiders and further strengthens the ftc case.see university health,at.
as far as we can determine,no court has ever approved a merger to duopoly under similar circumstances.
rebuttal arguments 
in response to the ftc prima facie showing,the appellees make three rebuttal arguments,which the district court accepted in reaching its conclusion that the merger was not likely to lessen competition substantially.for the reasons discussed below,these arguments fail and thus were not a proper basis for denying the ftc injunctive relief.
extent of competition 
the appellees first contend,and the district court agreed,that heinz and do not really compete against each other at the retail level.consumers do not regard the products of the two companies as substitutes,the appellees claim,and generally only one of the two brands is available on any given store shelves.hence,they argue,there is little competitive loss from the merger.
this argument has a number of flaws which render clearly erroneous the court finding that heinz and have not engaged in significant competition.first,in accepting the appellees argument that heinz and do not compete,the district court failed to address the record evidence that the two do in fact price against each other,see,tr,and that,where both are present in the same areas they depress each other prices as well as those of gerber even though they are virtually never all found in the same store.see,tr,px at px at px at px at dx at.this evidence undermines the district court factual finding.
second,the district court finding is inconsistent with its conclusion that there is a single,national market for jarred baby food in the united states.the supreme court has explained that t he outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use by consumers or the of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.brown shoe,at.see also united states du pont de nemours.the definition of product market thus focuses solely on demand substitution factors,that consumers regard the products as substitutes.horizontal merger guidelines,supra,sullivan grimes,supra,at.by defining the relevant product market generically as jarred baby food,the district court concluded that in areas where heinz and products are both sold,consumers will switch between them in response to a small but significant and nontransitory increase in price ssnip.horizontal merger guidelines,supra,heinz,d at.the district court never explained this inherent inconsistency in its logic nor could counsel for the appellees explain it at oral argument.
third,and perhaps most important,the court conclusion concerning competition does not take into account the indisputable fact that the merger will eliminate competition at the wholesale level between the only two competitors for the second shelf position.competition between heinz and to gain accounts at the wholesale level is fierce with each contest concluding in a result.ja.the district court regarded this loss of competition as irrelevant because the ftc did not establish to its satisfaction that wholesale competition ultimately benefitted consumers through lower retail prices.the district court concluded that fixed trade spending did not affect consumer prices and that the ftc assertion that the proposed merger will affect variable trade spending levels and consumer prices is at best,inconclusive.heinz,d at.although the court noted the ftc examples of consumer benefit through couponing initiatives,the court held that it was impossible to conclude with any certainty that the consumer benefit from such couponing initiatives would be lost in the merger.id.
in rejecting the ftc argument regarding the loss of wholesale competition,the court committed two legal errors.first,as the appellees conceded at oral argument,no court has ever held that a reduction in competition for wholesale purchasers is not relevant unless the plaintiff can prove impact at the consumer level.oral arg.tr.at,see hospital of am.ftc,cir section does not require proof that a merger or other acquisition has caused higher prices in the affected market.all that is necessary is that the merger create an appreciable danger of collusive practices in the future.a predictive judgment,necessarily probabilistic and judgmental rather than demonstrable,is called for.citation omitted.second,it is,in any event,not the ftc burden to prove such an impact with certainty.to the contrary,the antitrust laws assume that a retailer faced with an increase in the cost of one of its inventory items will try so far as competition allows to pass that cost on to its customers in the form of a higher price for its product.in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust,cir,reh g and suggestion for reh g en banc denied.section is,after all,concerned with probabilities,not certainties.united states el paso natural gas,d brown shoe,at.baker hughes,at 
efficiencies 
the appellees second attempt to rebut the ftc prima facie showing is their contention that the anticompetitive effects of the merger will be offset by efficiencies resulting from the union of the two companies,efficiencies which they assert will be used to compete more effectively against gerber.it is true that a merger primary benefit to the economy is its potential to generate efficiencies.see generally phillip areeda,herbert hovenkamp john solow,antitrust law at.as the merger guidelines now recognize,efficiencies can enhance the merged firm ability and incentive to compete,which may result in lower prices,improved quality,or new products.horizontal merger guidelines,supra.
although the supreme court has not sanctioned the use of the efficiencies defense in a section case,see procter gamble,at.the trend among lower courts is to recognize the defense.see,ftc tenet health care,cir,reh g and reh g en banc denied university health,at ftc cardinal health,d,staples.at see also aba antitrust section,mergers and acquisitions understanding the antitrust issues the majority of courts have considered efficiencies as a means to rebut the government prima facie case that a merger will lead to restricted output or increased prices.these courts,however,generally have found inadequate proof of efficiencies to sustain a rebuttal of the government case.in the department of justice and the ftc revised their horizontal merger guidelines to recognize that mergers have the potential to generate significant efficiencies by permitting a better utilization of existing assets,enabling the combined firm to achieve lower costs in producing a given quantity and quality than either firm could have achieved without the proposed transaction.horizontal merger guidelines,supra.
nevertheless,the high market concentration levels present in this case require,in rebuttal,proof of extraordinary efficiencies,which the appellees failed to supply.see university health,at a defendant who seeks to overcome a presumption that a proposed acquisition would substantially lessen competition must demonstrate that the intended acquisition would result in significant economies and that these economies ultimately would benefit competition and,hence,consumers.horizontal merger guidelines,supra,stating that e fficiencies almost never justify a merger to monopoly or areeda,et,antitrust law,at requiring extraordinary efficiencies where the hhi is well above and the hhi increase is well above.moreover,given the high concentration levels,the court must undertake a rigorous analysis of the kinds of efficiencies being urged by the parties in order to ensure that those efficiencies represent more than mere speculation and promises about behavior.the district court did not undertake that analysis here.
in support of its conclusion that efficiencies will outweigh the merger anticompetitive effects,the district court found that the consolidation of baby food production in heinz pittsburgh plant will achieve substantial cost savings in salaries and operating costs.heinz,d at.the court also credited the appellees promise of improved product quality as a result of recipe consolidation the only cost reduction the court quantified as a percentage of costs,however,was the so called variable conversion cost the cost of processing the volume of baby food now processed by.the court accepted the appellees claim that this cost would be reduced by if the production were shifted to heinz plant,see ja,a reduction the appellees expert characterized as extraordinary.
the district court analysis falls short of the findings necessary for a successful efficiencies defense in the circumstances of this case.we mention only three of the most important deficiencies here.first,variable conversion cost is only a percentage of the total variable manufacturing cost.a large percentage reduction in only a small portion of the company overall variable manufacturing cost does not necessarily translate into a significant cost advantage to the merger.thus,for cost reduction to be relevant,we must at least consider the percentage of total variable manufacturing cost that would be reduced as a consequence of the merger.at oral argument,the appellees counsel agreed.oral arg.tr.at.this correction immediately cuts the asserted efficiency gain in half since,according to the appellees evidence,using total variable manufacturing cost as the measure cuts the cost savings from to.see ja.
second,the percentage reduction in cost is still not the relevant figure.after the merger,the two entities will be combined,and to determine whether the merged entity will be a significantly more efficient competitor,cost reductions must be measured across the new entity combined just across the output of.see areeda,et,supra,at.the district court,however,did not consider the cost reduction over the merged firm combined output.at oral argument the appellees counsel was unable to suggest a formula that could be used for determining that cost reduction.see oral arg.tr.at.
finally,and as the district court recognized,the asserted efficiencies must be to be cognizable as a defense heinz,d at see horizontal merger guidelines,supra,areeda,et,supra,at.that is,they must be efficiencies that can not be achieved by either company alone because,if they can,the merger asserted benefits can be achieved without the concomitant loss of a competitor.see generally areeda,et,supra.yet the district court never explained why heinz could not achieve the kind of efficiencies urged without merger.as noted,the principal merger benefit asserted for heinz is the acquisition of better recipes,which will allegedly make its product more attractive and permit expanded sales at prices lower than those charged by,which produces at an inefficient plant.yet,neither the district court nor the appellees addressed the question whether heinz could obtain the benefit of better recipes by investing more money in product development and,by an amount less than the amount heinz would spend to acquire.at oral argument,heinz counsel agreed that the taste of heinz products was not so bad that no amount of money could improve the brand consumer appeal.oral arg.tr.at.that being the case,the question is how much heinz would have to spend to make its product equivalent to the product and hence whether heinz could achieve the efficiencies of merger without eliminating as a competitor.the district court,however,undertook no inquiry in this regard.in short,the district court failed to make the kind of factual determinations necessary to render the appellees efficiency defense sufficiently concrete to offset the ftc prima facie showing.
innovation 
the appellees claim next that the merger is required to enable heinz to innovate,and thus to improve its competitive position against gerber.heinz and asserted,and the district court found,that without the merger the two firms are unable to launch new products to compete with gerber because they lack a sufficient shelf presence or acv.see heinz,d at.this kind of defense is often a speculative proposition.see areeda,et,supra,noting truly formidable proof problems in determining innovation economies.in this case,given the nature of the industry as well as heinz position as the world largest baby food manufacturer,it is a particularly difficult defense to prove.the court below accepted the appellees argument principally on the basis of their expert testimony that new product launches are only when a firm acv is or greater heinz is presently is.that testimony,in turn,was based on a graph that plotted revenue against acv.according to the expert,the graph showed that only four out of new products launched in had been for companies with an acv of or greater.
the chart,however,does not establish this proposition and the court consequent finding that the merger is necessary for innovation is thus unsupported and clearly erroneous.all the chart plotted was revenue against acv and hence all it showed was the unsurprising fact that the greater a company acv,the greater the revenue it received.because the graph did not plot the profitability or any measure of,there is no way to know whether the expert a acv is required for a launch to be successful in an economic true moreover,the number of data points on the chart were few they were limited to launches in a single year and they involved launches of all new grocery products rather than of baby food alone.assessing such data statistical significance in establishing the proposition at issue,the necessity of acv penetration,is thus highly speculative.the district court did not even address the question of the data statistical significance and the appellees counsel could offer no help at oral argument.see oral arg.tr.at i not aware of the statistical significance of the underlying study.in the absence of reliable and significant evidence that the merger will permit innovation that otherwise could not be accomplished,the district court had no basis to conclude that the ftc showing was rebutted by an innovation defense.
moreover,heinz insistence on a acv before it brings a new product to market may be largely to persuade the court to recognize promotional economies as a defense.heinz argues that to profitably launch a new product,it must have nationwide market penetration to recoup the money spent on advertising and promotion.it wants to spread advertising costs out among as many product units as possible,thereby lowering the advertising cost per unit.it does not want to waste promotional expenditures in markets where its products are not on the shelf or where they are on only a few shelves.for example,in a metropolitan area in which heinz has a per cent acv,every dollar spent on advertising is two or three times more effective than in a market in which it has only a per cent acv.as one authority notes,however,t he case for recognizing a defense based on promotional economies is relatively weak.areeda,et,supra,at.the district court accepted heinz claim that it could not introduce new products without at least a per cent acv because it would be unable to adequately diffuse its advertising and promotional expenditures.but the court failed to determine whether substantial promotional scale economies exist now and,if they do,whether heinz and for that reason operate at a substantial competitive disadvantage in the market or markets in which they sell or whether there are effective alternatives to merger by which the disadvantage can be overcome.id.at,at.
structural barriers to collusion 
in a footnote the district court dismissed the likelihood of collusion derived from the ftc market concentration data.s tructural market barriers to collusion in the retail market for jarred baby food,the court said,rebut the normal presumption that increases in concentration will increase the likelihood of tacit collusion.heinz,d at.the court sole citation,however,was to testimony by the appellees expert,jonathan baker,a former director of the bureau of economics at the ftc,who testified that in order to coordinate successfully,firms must solve cartel problems such as reaching a consensus on price and market share and deterring each other from deviating from that consensus by either lowering price or increasing production.he opined that after the merger the merged entity would want to expand its market share at gerber expense,thereby decreasing the likelihood of consensus on price and market share.tr.in his report,baker elaborated on his theory,explaining that the efficiencies created by the merger will give the merged firm the ability and incentive to take on gerber in price and product improvements.dx.he also predicted that policing and monitoring of any agreement would be more difficult than it is now,due in part to a time lag in the ability of one firm to detect price cuts by another.but the district court made no finding that any of these cartel problems are so much greater in the baby food industry than in other industries that they rebut the normal presumption.in fact,baker testimony about time lag is refuted by the record which reflects that supermarket prices are available from scanner data within weeks.see dx at report of appellees expert jonathan baker see also oral arg.tr.at statement by appellees counsel that nothing in record reflects time lag is greater in baby food industry than in other industries.his testimony is further undermined by the record evidence of past price leadership in the baby food industry 
the combination of a concentrated market and barriers to entry is a recipe for price coordination.see university health,at significant market concentration makes it easier for firms in the market to collude,expressly or tacitly,and thereby force price above or farther above the competitive level.citation omitted.w here rivals are few,firms will be able to coordinate their behavior,either by overt collusion or implicit understanding,in order to restrict output and achieve profits above competitive levels.ppg,at.the creation of a durable duopoly affords both the opportunity and incentive for both firms to coordinate to increase prices.the district court recognized this when it questioned baker on whether the merged entity will,up to a point,expand its market share but then with gerber will find a nice equilibrium and they all get along together.tr.tacit coordination 
is feared by antitrust policy even more than express collusion,for tacit coordination,even when observed,can not easily be controlled directly by the antitrust laws.it is a central object of merger policy to obstruct the creation or reinforcement by merger of such oligopolistic market structures in which tacit coordination can occur.
phillip areeda,herbert hovenkamp john solow,antitrust law,at ed.because the district court failed to specify any structural market barriers to collusion that are unique to the baby food industry,its conclusion that the ordinary presumption of collusion in a merger to duopoly was rebutted is clearly erroneous 
although we recognize that,the ftc may accept the rebuttal arguments proffered by the appellees,including their efficiencies defense,and permit the merger to proceed,we conclude that the ftc succeeded in rais ing questions going to the merits so serious,substantial,difficult and doubtful as to make them fair ground for thorough investigation,study,deliberation and determination by the ftc.warner communications,at.the ftc demonstrated that the merger to duopoly will increase the concentration in an already highly concentrated market that entry barriers in the market make it unlikely that any anticompetitive effects will be avoided that competition is vigorous at the wholesale level nationwide and present at the retail level in some metropolitan areas and that competition may be lessened substantially.these substantial questions have not been sufficiently answered by the appellees.as we said in baker hughes,t he more compelling the prima facie case,the more evidence the defendant must present to rebut it successfully.at.in concluding that the ftc failed to make the requisite showing,the district court erred in a number of respects.regarding the contention of lack of competition,it made a clearly erroneous factual finding and misunderstood the law with respect to the import of competition at the wholesale level.regarding the proffered efficiencies defense,the court failed to make the kind of factual findings required to render that defense sufficiently concrete to rebut the government prima facie showing.finally,as to the contention that the merger is necessary for innovation,the court clearly erred in relying on evidence that does not support its conclusion.because the district court incorrectly assessed the merits of the appellees rebuttal arguments,it improperly discounted the ftc showing of likelihood of success.
weighing of the equities 
although the ftc showing of likelihood of success creates a presumption in favor of preliminary injunctive relief,we must still weigh the equities in order to decide whether enjoining the merger would be in the public interest.b see ppg,at weyerhaeuser,at.the principal public equity weighing in favor of issuance of preliminary injunctive relief is the public interest in effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.university health,at.the congress specifically had this public equity consideration in mind when it enacted section b.see food town stores,at congress enacted section b to preserve status quo until ftc can perform its function.the district court found,and there is no dispute,that if the merger were allowed to proceed,subsequent administrative and judicial proceedings on the merits will not matter because manufacturing facility will be closed,the distribution channels will be closed,the new label and recipes will be in place,and it will be impossible as a practical matter to undo the transaction.heinz,d at.hence,if the merger were ultimately found to violate the clayton act,it would be impossible to recreate competition.see warner communications,at a denial of a preliminary injunction would preclude effective relief if the commission ultimately prevails and divestiture is ordered.section b itself embodies congressional recognition of the fact that divestiture is an inadequate and unsatisfactory remedy in a merger case,cong.rec,a point that has been emphasized by the united states supreme court.see,ftc dean foods,d administrative experience shows that the commission inability to unscramble merged assets frequently prevents entry of an effective order of divestiture.
on the other side of the ledger,the appellees claim that the injunction would deny consumers the procompetitive advantages of the merger.see ftc pharmtech research,explaining that public equities include beneficial economic effects and procompetitive advantages for consumers.the district court found that if the merger were preliminarily enjoined,the injury to competition would also be irreversible,that is,the merger would be abandoned and could not be consummated if ultimately found lawful.by contrast to its first finding,however,for the latter conclusion the court relied not on the facts of this case but on our statement in exxon a general blocking a tender offer is likely to end an attempted acquisition,as a result of the short of most tender offers.id.quoting exxon,at.in their brief in this court,the appellees offer nothing more to support the finding that the merger would never be consummated were an injunction to issue.indeed,they devote only a single sentence,without any citation,to the point.the district court finding that an injunction would kill this merger is thus not a factual finding supported by record evidence.this case does not involve a tender offer as did the case cited by the court for its kill the merger conclusion.the appellees acknowledge that there is no alternative buyer for and the court found that it is not a failing company but rather a profitable and ongoing enterprise.heinz,d at.if the merger makes economic sense now,the appellees have offered no reason why it would not do so later.moreover,principal assets of value to heinz are,assertedly,its recipes and brand name.nothing in the record leads us to believe that both will not still exist when the ftc completes its work.it may be that will have to sell its recipes to heinz at a lower price than the price of today merger.but that is at best a private equity which does not affect our analysis of the impact on the market of the two options now before us and which has not in any event been urged by the appellees see id.
in sum,weighing of the equities favors the ftc.if the merger is ultimately found to violate section of the clayton act,it will be too late to preserve competition if no preliminary injunction has issued.on the other hand,if the merger is found not to lessen competition substantially,the efficiencies that the appellees urge can be reclaimed by a renewed transaction.our conclusion with respect to the equities necessarily lightens the burden on the ftc to show likelihood of success on the merits,a burden which the ftc has met here.
iii.conclusion 
it is important to emphasize the posture of this case.we do not decide whether the ftc will ultimately prove its case or whether the defendants claimed efficiencies will carry the day our task is to review the district court order to determine whether,under section b,preliminary injunctive relief would be in the public interest.we have considered the ftc likelihood of success on the merits.we have weighed the equities.we conclude that the ftc has raised serious and substantial questions.we also conclude that the public equities weigh in favor of preliminary injunctive relief and therefore that a preliminary injunction would be in the public interest.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of preliminary injunctive relief and remand the case for entry of a preliminary injunction pursuant to section b of the federal trade commission act.
so ordered.
the facts as set forth herein are based on the district court factual findings and the record material submitted by the parties.
product volume in retail stores throughout the country is measured by the product all commodity volume acv.gerber near per cent acv is impressive because virtually all supermarkets stock at most two brands of baby food.in at least one area of the country as many as per cent of supermarket retailers stock only gerber.
although heinz and introduced evidence showing that in areas that account for of sales,heinz has a market share of about and in areas that account for about of heinz sales,share is about,the ftc introduced evidence that heinz and are locked in an intense battle at the wholesale level to gain and maintain position as the second brand on retail shelves.
section requires notification for a merger in which either the acquiring or the acquired firm has total net sales or assets of at least million and the other firm has annual sales or total assets of a
