background 
background 
the factual background is fairly extensive,and we presented it at length in our first opinion in this case.craftsmen i,at.we will not reiterate it in full here,but we discuss those facts necessary to understand the nature of the claim at issue.because the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment in this case,we present the facts in the light most favorable to craftsmen.bathke casey stores,cir.
craftsmen is a missouri corporation engaged in the business of stretching standard base vehicles into limousines and buses.this process involves cutting the base vehicle in two,inserting structural pieces between the two halves of the base vehicle,and welding the parts back together to create a stretched limousine.in general,longer structural inserts and,accordingly,longer stretched limousines add weight and create greater stress upon the vehicle frame.craftsmen,however,asserts that its specialized rebuilding process allows for the conversion of base vehicles,including the lincoln town car,into very long limousines without sacrificing safety.
the national highway traffic safety administration requires coachbuilders to that their limousines meet federal safety standards and to provide some objective basis for that belief.federal authorities began investigating the safety of limousines following a crash and other incidents in the late.ford sought to protect its image and,at the same time,to increase its share of the market for base vehicles.in,while craftsmen was actively engaged in the business of building stretched limousines,ford formed a vehicle certification program that provided guidelines for the conversion of its vehicles into limousines that met national safety standards.ford would certify a participant in the program as a quality vehicle modifier qvm if it abided by ford guidelines for converting limousines and purchased insurance naming ford as the insured.the guidelines limited the conversion options of coachbuilders.among ford products,coachbuilders could only convert lincoln town cars,and there were limits upon the total weight of the resulting limousines and the length to which they could be stretched no more than additional inches.coachbuilders that followed the guidelines gained some assurance that their vehicles met federal standard standards,and they received cash incentives from ford for their participation in the qvm program.gm adopted a similar but separate program in,the cadillac master coachbuilders cmc program.coachbuilders who wished to stretch a vehicle in a manner that did not conform to qvm guidelines could retain qvm membership only if they submitted independent test data regarding vehicle safety to ford.most coachbuilders,including all of the original defendants in this case,participated in one or both of the qvm and cmc programs.
craftsmen was one of a minority of american coachbuilding companies that chose not to participate in either program.many of craftsmen conversions at the time resulted in vehicles longer than the limits imposed by the qvm and cmc programs hereinafter specialty limousines,and joining the qvm program would have required craftsmen to abandon its practice of building specialty limousines or to seek costly independent safety analysis.in addition,craftsmen was already using techniques described in the qvm guidelines,and craftsmen owners had no reason to believe that the company converted vehicles were unsafe.a federal inspection of its converted vehicles in the early resulted only in some minor,safety modifications.
ford was also a nonvoting member of limo,an industry group of coachbuilders that formed in to pool resources for product testing and to promote consumer confidence in limousines.american coach was a voting member.among coachbuilders,limo membership was open only to those businesses who participated in the qvm cmc programs eventually,limo amended its bylaws to allow coachbuilders to join if they submitted independent data.craftsmen did not join either program or perform independent crash tests,and therefore it was ineligible to become a member of limo.
ford,american coach,and other limo members soon began to act through the organization to exert influence over marketing outlets in the limousine industry.in,limo received a commitment from one trade publication to remove all and advertisers and to deny and coachbuilders access to its trade show.in a limo teleconference,its members unanimously agreed that they would not endorse or participate in any publication which continues to promote limousine manufacturers or any limousine trade show which promotes the interests of products.by,both of the major trade publications in the limousine industry had adopted restrictive policies that barred coachbuilders that did not participate in the qvm or cmc programs from placing advertisements unless they submitted independent data to prove that their vehicles complied with federal safety standards.coachbuilders also faced restrictions upon their participation in the publications annual trade shows.in the face of these limitations,craftsmen business suffered.it found creative ways to market its company name,such as promoting its ability to customize buses and stretch vehicles neither of these services were subject to advertising restrictions.craftsmen also maintained a company web site for marketing purposes,and craftsmen was able to remain profitable in and.in first year since at least in which craftsmen did not turn a began to advertise in a new trade publication that did not require proof of certification or participation.craftsmen expert concedes that,by some point in,any adverse impact of the advertising ban upon craftsmen business had evaporated.the same year,craftsmen filed suit against ford,american coach,and several other defendants in the united states district court for the western district of missouri.craftsmen alleged,inter alia,that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of federal antitrust law,and that this conspiracy harmed craftsmen business from to.
trial,first appeal,and craftsmen i 
craftsmen claims against ford and american coach proceeded to a jury trial in.the jury returned a verdict of favor of craftsmen for more than million in damages,which the district court tripled pursuant to a.ford and american coach appealed to this court,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to establish a conspiracy among them,craftsmen i,at,and that the district court erred in finding that the alleged restraint of trade constituted a per se antitrust violation.id.at.we disagreed with the first contention and held that craftsmen submitted evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that ford and american coach acted through limo to exclude craftsmen and other specialty coachbuilders from advertising in trade publications and participating in trade shows.id.
we agreed with ford and american coach,however,that these actions did not amount to a per se violation of antitrust law.id.at.we came to this conclusion because restrictions upon coachbuilders that had not submitted particular evidence that their products met certain safety standards are not necessarily t he creation and enforcement of standards,including safety standards,often has effects.for example,having unsafe limousines in the market could tend to undercut consumer confidence in all limousines,and thereby decrease overall limousine sales.id.at.in short,we found that the economic impact of safety standards is not immediately discernable.id.therefore,the case demanded a more thorough analysis than the abbreviated one employed by the district court to determine whether the restraint was unreasonable.id.
we held that the district court should have instead applied the rule of reason to determine whether the actions of ford and american coach unreasonably restrained trade in the industry.id.at.under the rule of reason,the factfinder probes more deeply into the relevant circumstances to determine whether the actions at issue created an unreasonable restraint on competition.id.at.because this question was never posed to the jury,we remanded the case to the district court.id.at.we also ruled that the testimony of craftsmen expert,david cole,was inadmissible insofar as it purported to prove an antitrust violation or measure damages arising out of assumed conduct.id.while cole was qualified and provided expert testimony with regard to craftsmen damages,his testimony was not helpful to a jury in a case because he assumed that craftsmen alleged lost growth from through was caused by the defendants alleged conspiracy.he did not determine whether other factors may have affected craftsmen growth rate.under the rule of reason analysis,which should have been applied in this case,such an analysis was required.id.
proceedings 
upon its return to the district court,craftsmen retained economist john scoggins to perform expert analysis consistent with our opinion in craftsmen to carry out this task,scoggins used statistical models to show what the demand for craftsmen limousines should have been during the years at issue and noted that the actual demand was significantly smaller.he identified several variables that could have caused the reduced demand,such as the national economy or competition from other coachbuilders.after running regressions to determine the impact of these variables,he found that none could account for craftsmen disappointing sales figures from to.therefore,by process of elimination,he concluded that the advertising and restrictions must have been the primary cause of the dampened demand for craftsmen services during that period.through the use of a dummy variable to gauge this impact,he was able to estimate the total amount of sales that craftsmen lost as a result of the restrictions.
craftsmen merely asked scoggins to analyze the impact of the behavior of ford and american coach upon craftsmen net income from to,and to specifically look into alternative causes for disappointing sales for craftsmen during the years in question.he performed that task,and went no further.he did not explore whether the restraints had or could have an impact upon the limousine industry as a whole.he did,however,undertake some research into the limousine industry as a whole insofar as it related to craftsmen damages,and he found that the number of competitors in the industry had not changed significantly over a period.he also acquired limited,anecdotal evidence of the adverse impact of the advertising and restrictions upon the sales figures of one other specialty limousine manufacturer during the same time period.
ford moved to exclude scoggins testimony under federal rule of evidence,and both ford and american coach moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motions.it concluded that scoggins opinion would not assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,because scoggins did not analyze whether the restraints at issue were under the rule of reason he merely analyzed their effect upon craftsmen.further,the district court took issue with scoggins definition of the relevant market.scoggins claimed that he analyzed the effects of the allegedly behavior upon the specialty limousine market that is,a market for limousines stretched beyond qvm and cmc limits.he acknowledged that limousines and specialty limousines are substitute products and manufacturers of each type do compete at some level,but he asserted that they are not close substitutes.scoggins offered no empirical support for this market definition.therefore,the district court found his testimony inadmissible under rule.
the district court also noted that craftsmen opposition to summary judgment depended upon the admissibility of scoggins testimony.it therefore granted the motions of ford and american coach for summary judgment in the case.
ii.discussion 
craftsmen appeals,arguing that the district court erred in excluding scoggins opinion under rule and in granting summary judgment in favor of ford and american coach.the issues are closely related,and we need not address them both.the reasons for the district court determination that scoggins opinion would not assist the trier of fact,if valid,would be the same reasons that his opinion can not save craftsmen from an adverse summary judgment ruling in this case.therefore,we review the question of whether summary judgment was appropriate in light of the record as a whole,including scoggins opinion.
general principles of law 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the.bathke,at.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.to avoid summary judgment,a party must allege specific facts supported by evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor a mere scintilla of evidence will not suffice.rolscreen pella prods.of louis,cir.
the sherman act prohibits e very contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce.the supreme court has long accepted that congress did not intend a literal interpretation of that language,and it has read the law as prohibiting only those practices that impose an unreasonable restraint on competition.arizona maricopa county med.soc y,d.the burden of proving the unreasonableness of a restraint lies with the plaintiff.united states arnold,schwinn,d,overruled on other grounds by continental,gte sylvania,d paschall kansas city star,cir united states empire gas,cir.
some antitrust plaintiffs face a lighter burden than others,depending upon the nature of the restraint at issue.plaintiffs challenging restraints subject to the per se rule enjoy the lightest burden of proving unreasonableness.judicial experience has proven certain types of restraints to be so strongly linked with activity,and their economic impact so immediately obvious,that we presume unreasonableness and deem them unlawful restraints of trade per se.state oil khan,d collegiate athletic ass bd.of regents,d.when challenging such naked restraints,the plaintiff meets its burden of proving the unreasonableness of the restraint merely by proving the existence and substance of the restraint itself.see soc.of eng rs united states,d in the first category are agreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their are illegal per se.the district court applied this approach to the advertising restrictions at issue here prior to our opinion in craftsmen 
in a limited number of other cases,the restraint appears pernicious enough on its face to fall within the category of restraints that are unlawful per se,but judicial inexperience with the particular type of restraint warrants a quick look at the relevant market and the defendant alleged justifications for imposing the restraint.craftsmen i,at see also.dental ass ftc,d acknowledging the existence of the quick look mode of analysis.this amounts to an abbreviated analysis of whether the restraint was unreasonable though not as abbreviated as an outright condemnation of the restraint as unlawful per se.
these two standards are exceptional,however,and their application is reserved for the most patently anticompetitive restraints.given the danger of applying those truncated modes of analysis too freely,state oil,at,most antitrust claims are analyzed under a rule of reason,according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition,taking into account a variety of factors,including specific information about the relevant business,its condition before and after the restraint was imposed,and the restraint history,nature,and effect.id.at.
due to the number of variables involved,including the type of restraint,the nature of the market at issue,and the level of judicial experience with a particular type of restraint in any given case,determining which mode of analysis is appropriate rarely allows for the mechanical application of precedent 
t here is generally no categorical line to be drawn between restraints that give rise to an intuitively obvious inference of anticompetitive effect and those that call for more detailed treatment.what is required,rather,is an appropriate inquiry given the facts of the case,looking to the circumstances,details,and logic of a restraint.the object is to see whether the experience of the market has been so clear,or necessarily will be,that a confident conclusion about the principal tendency of a restriction will follow from a quick or at least quicker look,in place of a more sedulous one.
dental ass n,at.
b.the scope of craftsmen i 
in craftsmen i,we held that the district court erred in applying a per se mode of analysis to the restraint at issue in this case.we noted that the restraint appeared to be an attempt to alter the competitive field in the limousine industry i n essence,defendants alleged restraint was an attempt to force craftsmen to either comply with qvm guidelines or stop selling limousines.craftsmen i,at.we also found,however,that the defendants plausible safety justifications for pursuing the restrictive advertising standards could have procompetitive effects and therefore an abbreviated analysis of its anticompetitive impact was inappropriate.id.at.this decision followed a line of recent supreme court precedent holding either the per se or quick look modes of analysis improper when the alleged substance of the restraint and any purported justifications for it did not create the obvious impression that the restraint would be unreasonably anticompetitive.see.dental ass n,at.state oil,at.under that reasoning,we held in craftsmen i that the experience of the market and the type of restraint at issue in this case were not so clearly anticompetitive that the district court could properly substitute an abbreviated analysis in place of a more sedulous one.dental ass n,at.
therefore,on remand,craftsmen had the burden of proving the unreasonableness of the restraint given a variety of factors under the rule of reason,state oil,at.it would not enjoy a presumption of unreasonableness based solely upon the existence of the restraint itself.this burden begins with the task of properly defining the relevant market.double d spotting,supervalu,cir.the plaintiff must define both the relevant product market,which includes all reasonably interchangeable products,and the relevant geographic market,which consists of the area in which consumers can practically seek alternative sources of the product.id.after properly defining the market,the rule of reason also requires the plaintiff to show that the restraint has detrimental effects upon the competitiveness of the market.ftc.fed of dentists,d quotation omitted.
a plaintiff may satisfy the detrimental effects element of its burden in one of two ways.first,a plaintiff may put forth evidence of actual,sustained adverse effects on competition in the relevant market.id.at.if the plaintiff can not submit such evidence,it is relegated to the more challenging course of proving detrimental effects on competition by making an inquiry into market power and market structure designed to assess the restraint actual effect.copperweld independence tube,d.a defendant or cartel of defendants has market power if it has the ability to raise price above the competitive level without losing so many sales so rapidly that the price increase is unprofitable and must be rescinded.midwestern mach.airlines,cir quoting william landes richard posner,market power in antitrust cases,harv.
only after satisfying the above requirements does the burden shift to the defendant to justify its conduct by reference to rational,procompetitive economic principles.flegel christian,cir quotation omitted.if the defendant can do so,the burden returns to the plaintiff to show that the defendant can achieve the same rational,procompetitive ends through means less likely to harm overall competition in the market.id.at.if so,the court will ultimately balance the harms and benefits to determine if the behavior is reasonable on the whole.id.quoting bhan nme,cir.
contrary to craftsmen assertions on the present appeal,none of the elements of this burden were addressed or decided in craftsmen indeed,we could not have decided them,because craftsmen case had never gone before a factfinder charged with deciding the dispute under the rule of reason approach.craftsmen i did discuss the procompetitive justifications of ford and american coach,but only insofar as they related to the question of which analysis to apply to the case per se,quick look,or rule of reason.we did not purport to actually apply the proper approach the rule of reason,and we did not address the procompetitive justifications in that context.
c.the propriety of summary judgment on remand 
for the following reasons,we hold that craftsmen failed to produce evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that it satisfied its burden of proof as defined above.therefore,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to ford and american coach.
market definition 
the parties do not appear to dispute the relevant geographic market in this case,but they contest the relevant product market.ford and american coach claim that the relevant product market consists of the market for limousines generally,while craftsmen argues for the existence and relevance of a smaller for longer specialty limousines.the district court found craftsmen definition unavailing,and so do we.craftsmen attempt to define the relevant product market as the specialty limousine market lacks any evidentiary support aside from scoggins bald assertions and is inconsistent with craftsmen overall claim.as such,no reasonable juror could find that the specialty limousine market is the relevant product market for this antitrust claim.
craftsmen defines the specialty limousine market as the market for limousines stretched longer than qvm standards inches or cmc standards inches during the time frame at issue.under that definition,a lincoln town car stretched by inches competes in the same product market as one stretched by inches,while a town car stretched by inches competes in a separate market from one stretched by inches.further,a town car stretched by inches would compete in the same market as a cadillac deville stretched by inches,while a town car stretched by inches would compete in a separate market than a deville stretched by the exact same length.any reasonable juror would find it implausible that consumers would make such arbitrary and illogical distinctions when buying limousines,and craftsmen presented no evidence that consumers act in such a manner.put simply,no reasonable juror could find that town cars stretched by and inches,respectively,were not reasonably interchangeable products,double d spotting,at,particularly given that craftsmen maintai
