this is a patent infringement and antitrust case dealing with a unique ice cream product.plaintiffs dippin dots,and curt jones collectively ddi appeal from the district court claim construction and summary judgment of noninfringement of patent the patent and from the judgment following jury trial that all claims of that patent are obvious,that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct during prosecution,and that ddi violated the antitrust laws by asserting a patent that had been procured through fraud on the patent office.we affirm the judgments of noninfringement,obviousness,and unenforceability,but reverse as to the antitrust counterclaim.
background 
a.the technology and patent 
the patent,covering subject matter invented by plaintiff jones and exclusively licensed to plaintiff dippin dots,is directed to a process for making a form of cryogenically prepared novelty ice cream product.claim,the only independent claim,reads 
a method of preparing and storing a,frozen alimentary dairy product,comprising the steps of 
preparing an alimentary composition for freezing 
dripping said alimentary composition into a freezing chamber 
freezing said dripping alimentary composition into beads 
storing said beads at a temperature at least as low as so as to maintain said beads for an extended period of time 
bringing said beads to a temperature between substantially and prior to serving and 
serving said beads for consumption at a temperature between substantially and so that said beads are free flowing when served.
patent numbering added for reference.ddi has commercialized this process.the ice cream it produces,sold under the dippin dots brand,is known to patrons of amusement parks,stadiums,shopping malls,and the like.
the initial application that eventually issued as the patent,filed on march,omitted the final serving step from claim.the examiner rejected all of the claims as obvious in light of canadian patent,of aref et.ddi appealed the rejections to the board of patent appeals and interferences board,which affirmed the rejection.ddi then filed a continuation application,amending claim by adding the serving step.the examiner again rejected over the aref reference,noting that dependent on the food product being served,it would be obvious to serve the product in a cold,state.ddi then submitted a declaration pursuant to in which it submitted evidence of the significant commercial success of its method.it argued that its commercial success should weigh against a finding of obviousness.see graham john deere,d noting that commercial success is one of the secondary considerations that may serve as indicia of nonobviousness.the examiner agreed and the patent issued in june.
b.the festival market sales 
much of the debate in this case centers on the import of sales made at the festival market mall in lexington,kentucky,more than a year before ddi filed its patent application.sales made more than one year before the patent priority date implicate the bar of b.for the patent,this critical date is march.starting on july,jones sold,largely beaded ice cream at the festival market.during jones time at festival market,which lasted at least until july,over customers purchased his beaded ice cream and others received free samples.the customers were permitted to leave with the product and were not restricted by any kind of confidentiality agreement.jones later testified that his main goal at the festival market was to get information and not to further develop technical aspects of his product such as particular temperature ranges for storage and service.
it is undisputed that the festival market sales were never disclosed to the patent and trademark office pto during prosecution of the patent.the declaration of commercial success which ultimately persuaded the examiner to grant the patent contained a sworn statement by jones that t he initial sales were in march of,which was on or after the critical date.
jones testified that at festival market he only practiced the first three steps of the claimed method,not the storing,bringing,or serving steps.he testified that he considered the evidence of what had happened at festival market to be irrelevant to patentability.the attorney who prosecuted the patent,warren schickli,testified that he considered the sales to have been experimental since the process as practiced at festival market could not be feasibly commercially exploited.he also testified that the festival market ice cream was not sold for direct consumption under the meaning of claim,because the ice cream was too cold to eat comfortably when initially given to the consumer.
prior litigation 
the controversy in this case began when several of ddi distributors severed their relationship,found alternative manufacturing sources,and entered into competition against ddi.ddi initiated a series of patent infringement lawsuits against its new competitors in various judicial districts.in this appeal,the defendants fall into two primary categories the manufacturing parties who make the competing ice cream product and the distributing parties who sell it to consumers the defendants counterclaimed for violation of of the sherman act due to ddi allegation of patent infringement based on a fraudulently acquired patent.this type of antitrust claim has become known as a walker process claim,named for the supreme court decision in walker process equipment,food machinery chemical,d.the various suits were consolidated by the judicial panel on litigation for pretrial proceedings before the united states district court for the northern district of georgia,with judge thomas thrash presiding.that court adopted in large part an claim construction by a special master.in re dippin dots patent,d.it issued summary judgment of noninfringement both literally,id.at,and via the doctrine of equivalents,id.at.it refused to grant summary judgment to any party on invalidity,id.at,or on inequitable conduct,id.at 
after the pretrial proceedings in the northern district of georgia were completed,the case was remanded to the united states district court for the northern district of texas.judge thrash,sitting by designation,continued to preside over the northern district of texas proceedings.that court conducted a jury trial on the issues of invalidity,unenforceability,and antitrust violations by ddi.by special verdict,the jury found that the sales by jones prior to march could be asserted against the patent as prior art and that all claims of the patent were invalid as obvious.the jury also found that both jones and schickli had,with intent to deceive,made material misrepresentations or omissions in violation of the duty of candor to the pto.it also determined that defendants mini melts,and frosty bites distribution had proven all required elements of their antitrust counterclaim,including the requisite fraud on the pto.however,it found no antitrust damages,granting the counterclaim plaintiffs zero dollars in damages on their sherman act counterclaim.the district court denied ddi motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jmol,finding that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find all claims obvious and that ddi had withheld a material reference with the deceptive intent required for walker process liability.the district court then weighed that same evidence of intent and materiality itself and found the patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct before the pto.in its final judgment dated february,it awarded attorney fees under the clayton act to defendant frosty bites distribution fbd in the amount of.
the defendants appealed to this court on march.after the notice of appeal was filed,the district court made two additional rulings.on august,it granted defendant mosey motion for attorney fees under the clayton act,which had been outstanding at the time of the final judgment.on august,fbd moved for an amendment of the attorney fee order to add fees under,the patent statute provision.we deactivated the appeal while that motion was pending.on october,the district court granted fbd motion and awarded it an additional in fees under.on november,this court reactivated the appeal and set a briefing schedule.ddi opening brief included challenges to the august and october fee awards.a motions panel of this court ruled that,since ddi had failed to amend its march notice of appeal to include references to the later district court orders,we lacked jurisdiction to hear ddi challenge to those later orders.dippin dots mosey,slip op.at.may.ddi was directed to file a replacement brief omitting the arguments held to be jurisdictionally barred,slip op.at.
in its amended brief,ddi appeals the claim construction and summary judgment of noninfringement,the refusal to overturn the jury verdict of obviousness and liability under the antitrust laws,the finding of inequitable conduct,and the award of attorneys fees under the clayton act granted to fbd.we have jurisdiction under a.
ii.discussion 
claim construction and infringement 
ddi challenges the summary judgment of noninfringement on the grounds that the district court construed the claims of the patent erroneously.its primary arguments relate to the appropriate reach of the term beads in claim,which the district court construed to mean small frozen droplets which have a smooth,spherical round or ball shaped appearance.the district court construction also excluded processes which produce any irregular or odd shaped particles such as popcorn.the district court correctly found that the claim steps mentioning beads were limited to covering processes that produce beads and only beads.the accused process produces both spheres and irregular particles,so under this construction,the defendants do not infringe.ddi objects both to the definition of beads and to the district court refusal to use the word comprising to extend the coverage of the claim beyond a process.as to the definition of beads,the district court correctly noted that the written description specifically describes beads as having a smooth,spherical appearance.patent.indeed,ddi argued to the special master before whom the construction issue was originally presented that a bead was a small round ball or round drop.there is no error in the district court definition of this term.
as to ddi second argument,we acknowledge that the term comprising raises a presumption that the list of elements is nonexclusive.see genentech,chiron.however,c omprising is not a weasel word with which to abrogate claim limitations.spectrum int l,sterilite.comprising appears at the beginning of the claim comprising the steps of and indicates here that an infringing process could practice other steps in addition to the ones mentioned.those six enumerated steps must,however,all be practiced as recited in the claim for a process to infringe.the presumption raised by the term comprising does not reach into each of the six steps to render every word and phrase therein where,as here,the patentee has narrowly defined the claim term it now seeks to have broadened.the district court limitation of the claim scope to exclude processes that produce some irregularly shaped particles is correct.
ddi also objects to the district court definition of free flowing,but the court did not rely on that definition to support its summary judgment ruling.dippin dots,d at since defendants process produces beads and irregularly shaped particles of ice cream,defendants method does not literally infringe the patent.since that basis of the district court decision was based on a properly construed claim term,we affirm the summary judgment of no literal infringement.ddi does not appeal the summary judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents,so the court need not consider the doctrine of equivalents.
obviousness 
the case was transferred to the northern district of texas and tried to a jury,which found all claims of the patent to be obvious.when reviewing a district court jmol determination as to obviousness,t his court reviews a jury conclusions on obviousness,a question of law,without deference,and the underlying findings of fact,whether explicit or implicit within the verdict,for substantial evidence.lnp eng g plastics,miller waste mills.those factual underpinnings include the scope and content of the prior art,differences between the prior art and the claims at issue,and the level of ordinary skill in the art.graham,at.our precedent requires that the party urging obviousness demonstrate a teaching,suggestion,or motivation to combine references.bard.this test is a flexible one which may find motivation to combine in the knowledge of one skilled in the art or in the nature of the problem to be solved.alza mylan.secondary indicia of nonobviousness,such as commercial success,need,or failure of others are also relevant.graham,at.
to find obviousness in light of the festival market sales requires two conclusions first,those sales must have been in the prior art second,the process practiced at festival market combined with any other relevant prior art must render the claims of the patent obvious.substantial evidence existed for the jury to find the facts necessary to support both conclusions.
the first question is whether the sales at festival market constitute prior art that can be asserted against the patent claims in an obviousness analysis.it is undisputed that those sales occurred before the patent critical date of march.sales made before the critical date would render invalid any claims that they anticipate,but the defendants do not allege here that the festival market sales embodied every element of any claim of the patent.instead,they argue that the claims are obvious in view of the festival market sales combined with the prior art cited by the examiner during prosecution.those sales may indeed be considered when determining whether the claims are invalid for obviousness.the public sale of goods produced by a process more than one year before a patent is filed places that process in the b prior art.see invitrogen biocrest,citing metallizing eng g kenyon bearing auto parts,cir learned hand.prior art under the b bar is also prior art for the purposes of obviousness under.see labounty int l trade comm n,section b may create a bar to patentability in conjunction with,if the claimed invention would have been obvious from the device in conjunction with the prior art.ddi argues that the sales at festival market were experimental in nature and therefore avoid the bar.in light of jones testimony that his purpose was to determine the marketability of his ice cream product and not to improve it technically,the jury could have found facts supporting a conclusion that the sales were not experimental.see in re smith,the experimental use exception does not include market testing where the inventor is attempting to gauge consumer demand for his claimed invention.see also paragon podiatry,klm labs.the festival market sales are therefore prior art citable against the patent claims for obviousness purposes.
the second question is whether the festival market sales,considered as prior art to the patent,render its claims invalid for obviousness.we conclude that they do.the first three steps of the patented process preparing,dripping,and freezing were concededly practiced at festival market.the last to a higher temperature and then serving at that temperature for direct at least very closely approximated.no evidence of the exact temperature of any product served at festival market has been presented,but it would have been obvious in light of the activity there to measure that temperature and serve the product within an easily determined range of palatability.the fourth step,storing at a very cold temperature for an extended period of time,may not have been present,but extended cold storage was an obvious elaboration on the festival market sales in order to distribute and retail the product.the motivation for ddi to make these trivial modifications is readily apparent from the problem to be solved.someone of ordinary skill in the art of ice cream retailing,seeking to commercially develop the inventive kernel found at festival market,would immediately seek the appropriate temperature ranges within which to store and serve the product.see alza,at noting that teaching,motivatio
