after our decision in this case was issued on august,covad communications bellsouth,cir,the supreme court vacated our judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of its recent decision in verizon communications law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d.having carefully reviewed this opinion,we find that trinko interpretation of aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d,the leading case finding liability under of the sherman act for refusal to cooperate with a rival,now forecloses several but not all of covad claims.other claims are now barred by our recent en banc decision in bellsouth telecommunications,mcimetro access transmission services,cir mcimetro ii.
this suit was brought by covad,a dsl internet service provider,against bellsouth,a regional telephone service provider that also sells dsl service.covad and bellsouth entered into an interconnection agreement pursuant to the federal telecommunications act ftca to allow covad to provide dsl service over bellsouth existing telephone lines.covad alleged that bellsouth had engaged in exclusionary conduct that violated the sherman antitrust act,the ftca,and various state statutes.covad also made various state breach of contract and tortious interference with business relations claims 
on bellsouth b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,the trial judge threw out all of the counts relating to the sherman act except for two,allowing covad to proceed with its allegations of predatory advertising and monopoly leveraging.the district court also allowed covad counts under state antitrust law and state law for tortious interference with business relations all other causes of action,the district court found,addressed conduct implicated by the ftca,and as such failed to state claims under the sherman act.
on appeal,we held first that the ftca savings clause as well as evidence of congressional and executive intent,unambiguously showed that there was no plain repugnancy between the ftca and the sherman act,and thus that there could be no implied repeal of or immunity from the antitrust laws.
second,in reviewing the district court ruling that covad had failed to state an antitrust claim,we found that covad causes of action under the sherman act fell into three kinds of alleged anticompetitive conduct denial of the use of essential facilities the network of phone lines a refusal to deal and price squeezing the first two categories of conduct essential facilities and refusal to deal relied on the same set of alleged facts sometimes an outright denial of access to bellsouth network and facilities,sometimes a denial of access on reasonable terms,with monopolistic intent.we concluded that,on a motion to dismiss,covad had pleaded facts sufficient to meet the exceedingly low threshold for stating an antitrust claim with respect to all three categories of conduct.quality foods de centro,latin am.agribusiness dev,cir.we also reversed the district court dismissal of covad breach of contract,ftca,and tortious interference with business relations claims we now revisit covad claims in light of trinko.
we begin by noting that the court in trinko approved our view that the ftca savings clause barred a finding of implied antitrust immunity.trinko.at.thus,it is now clear that the ftca and the sherman act were expressly intended to coexist.emphasizing that the ftca also does not create new claims that go beyond existing antitrust standards,the court then proceeded to consider whether the conduct of which trinko complained violated the sherman act.
trinko originated in a complaint brought by and other competitive local exchange carriers clecs before the new york public service commission psc and the federal communications commission fcc.the complaint alleged that verizon,the incumbent lec in new york state,had failed to fulfill its obligations under c to provide access to verizon operations support systems oss,one of several unbundled network elements.oss access allows a clec to relay orders for service through an electronic interface with verizon ordering system,thus enabling a clec to fill its customers orders.trinko alleged that verizon had delayed the filling of,or neglected to fill at all,clec customer orders.the fcc and the new york psc opened parallel investigations of verizon that led to a series of psc orders and an fcc consent decree.the day after verizon entered its consent decree with the fcc,one of customers,the trinko law firm,brought a claim under of the sherman act.trinko argued that verizon failure to fulfill its c obligations was part of an scheme to discourage customers from becoming or remaining clients of clecs.such conduct,trinko alleged,constituted a refusal to deal with rival firms under of the sherman act.as the supreme court describes it,trinko complaint set forth only a single example of the alleged failure to provide adequate access the discriminatory handling of clec customer orders that led to the psc and fcc investigations.
the court held,first,that trinko failed to state a recognized sherman act claim under existing precedents.trinko.at.the court found that verizon failure to provide oss assistance to did not amount to an effort at monopolization.rejecting trinko reliance on aspen,the court noted that aspen was at or near the outer boundary of liability.id.at.the case before the court involved none of the aspen indicators of anticompetitive conduct and so did not fit within aspen limited exception.id.at.
in particular,the court observed that aspen involved a unilateral termination of a voluntary and thus presumably profitable course of dealing.id.emphasis in original.but trinko complaint,the court noted,does not allege that verizon voluntarily engaged in a course of dealing with its rivals,or would ever have done so absent statutory compulsion.thus,verizon prior conduct sheds no light upon the motivation of its refusal to deal.id.furthermore,the two cases differed in terms of pricing behavior.in aspen the defendant rejection of an offer to sell its services to a competitor even if compensated at retail price,id.emphasis in original,could support the requisite inference of monopolistic intent.by contrast,verizon reluctance to interconnect at the rate of compensation under c is a neutral fact that does not support an inference of monopolistic intent.id.
more fundamentally,the court found that aspen involved a defendant whose failure to sell even at retail cost to a competitor was a failure to sell otherwise publicly marketed services.in the case before it,the trinko court noted,the services allegedly withheld are not otherwise marketed or available to the public.id.at.the ftca had created a brand new sharing obligation the wholesale market for leasing network elements.id.quoting verizon communications fcc,d.
in support of its claims,trinko also argued that bell atlantic failed to provide with access to its essential facilities.the trinko court rejected this argument to the extent that it was distinct from trinko general argument.trinko.at.despite having been invoked by some lower courts,observed justice scalia,this doctrine has never been recognized by the supreme court as established law,and in any case was not in fact deprived of such access.id.at relying on areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law supp,for the proposition that essential facilities claims should be denied where a state or federal agency has the power to compel and regulate sharing.
in the final part of its opinion,the court observed that the ftca created a broad and detailed regulatory environment that effectively abrogated the need for antitrust scrutiny in the case before it.the psc and fcc investigations,orders,and consent decree in trinko showed that the ftca distinctive regulatory regime was working just as congress intended it to.the court stated that federal courts are to handle cases alleging violations of c duties to provide access because such allegations involve complex and constantly changing interactions between competitive and incumbent lecs.antitrust courts should not be in the business of supervising highly detailed decrees on an ongoing basis.the court noted that the ftca does not authorize judges to
