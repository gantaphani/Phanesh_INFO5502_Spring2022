aqua tri and pool water products plaintiffs allege that olin and superior pool products defendants have engaged in a whole host of anticompetitive activities,including the illegal acquisition of a fellow dry chemical manufacturer,fmc.that acquisition was deemed illegal by the federal trade commission in a separate proceeding.in a series of pretrial motions,plaintiffs asked the district court to give the ftc decision prima facie weight in this proceeding under section of the clayton act,a.defendants moved to exclude plaintiffs expert from testifying and to dismiss the case because plaintiffs lacked antitrust standing.the district court denied plaintiffs motion and granted the defendants motions.we affirm and hold that plaintiffs failed to meet section requirements for giving the ftc decision prima facie weight and failed to establish that they suffered any antitrust injury.
factual and procedural background 
this dispute arises among four companies engaged in the manufacturing,repackaging and distributing of two dry swimming pool sanitizers,calcium hypochlorite and isocyanurates isos.
defendants olin and superior pool products 
defendant,olin corporation,is a long time manufacturer of and isos.olin sells and isos through several distribution paths.it sells and isos in bulk to repackagers who repackage these chemicals into small containers or into tablets and attach their own brand name to the products.these repackagers then sell their branded products to distributers who in turn sell the chemicals to retail stores,pool contractors and pool maintenance businesses.olin also repackages these chemicals itself and sells them directly to distributers or,costco under three brand,pace and sun.
in,olin purchased the assets of fmc,which included a chemical production facility for isos,a repackaging plant and the brand name sun.in,olin entered the wholesale pool products distribution business by purchasing kern products,an existing west coast olin distributer.prior to olin purchase,kern was a failing business.kern was renamed superior pool products spp and became a wholly owned subsidiary of olin.through spp,olin distributed isos and directly to retail stores,pool contractors and pool maintenance businesses.
in summary,olin,combined with spp,is an integrated manufacturer,repackager and distributer of pool sanitizers that sells its products in various forms to various entities along the distribution chain.
b.the ftc proceedings 
the ftc challenged olin acquisition of fmc in.after a hearing in,an administrative law judge alj made findings of fact and six conclusions of law and ultimately held that the acquisition violated section of the clayton act and section of the ftc act and ordered divestiture of the fmc assets.see in re matter of olin.the ftc substantially affirmed the alj order on june.we denied olin petition for review in a published decision,olin ftc,cir,and the supreme court denied olin petition for certiorari,d.at that point olin began divesting itself of the fmc assets.
plaintiffs pool water products and aqua tri 
the plaintiffs,pool water products pwp and aqua tri,are related by common ownership.aqua tri is a repackager of and isos.its primary customer is pwp,a distributer of and isos in california,arizona,florida and texas.it sells and isos under its own clear,fresh and guardex.pwp is a direct competitor of spp.pwp claims that its profits have been drastically reduced as a result of olin and spp anticompetitive activities.specifically,plaintiffs argue that pwp profits were reduced by million as a result of lost market share and price reductions in isos and.
d.the proceedings in the district court 
plaintiffs filed suit against olin and spp in alleging that olin and spp attempted to dominate the dry chemical pool sanitizer industry and destroy competition.in their third amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged olin and spp had engaged in the following anticompetitive activities the acquisition of fmc assets,price squeezing of repackagers,predatory pricing by spp,price discrimination against repackagers and distributors,refusal to deal with aqua tri and pwp,vertical integration,exclusive distributorships of olin products,collusion between olin and other manufacturers and collusion between olin and other distributors.plaintiffs claim these anticompetitive acts violated sections and of the sherman act,section of the clayton act and california law.they claim that olin and spp monopolized or restrained trade in four different product markets the sale of by manufacturers to wholesalers across the entire united states the sale of isos by manufacturers to wholesalers across the entire united states the sale of branded to retailers in california,arizona and nevada and the sale of branded isos to retailers in california,arizona and nevada.
in preparation for trial,both plaintiffs and defendants filed motions in limine to exclude various items of evidence.plaintiffs also moved to give prima facie weight to the ftc judgment and defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of antitrust injury.on october,the district court denied plaintiffs motion to give the ftc ruling prima facie weight and granted defendants motions to exclude plaintiffs sanitizer pricing study,evidence of pricing and the liability and damage testimony of plaintiffs expert,kent anderson.after it made these preliminary rulings,the district court held that plaintiffs had failed to put forward any evidence that they had suffered antitrust injury.it denied the remaining motions as moot and entered judgment in favor of defendants.
discussion 
prima facie weight of prior ftc proceeding 
plaintiffs moved in the district court to give the findings of fact and conclusions of law adopted by the ftc in its judgment against olin prima facie evidentiary weight pursuant to section of the clayton act,a the district court held that the judgment and findings could not be given such evidentiary weight because the issues and facts in the two proceedings are different.the court did allow the adjudicative facts of the prior proceedings to be,documents showing there was an alj hearing,the order entered by the ftc requiring divestiture and the decision of this circuit affirming the ftc.plaintiffs appeal the district court decision regarding the prima facie weight of the findings and conclusions.we review the district court decision de novo.emich motors general motors.
congress intent in enacting the original version of section was to minimize the burdens of litigation for injured private suitors by making available to them all matters previously established by the government in antitrust actions.id.at.this benefit is not without limits,however.first,it grants only prima facie weight,not collateral estoppel effect to findings.although section generally does not bar the application of collateral estoppel,it does so when the ftc itself makes the findings.see a.second,section grants prima facie weight only to matters as to which collateral estoppel would apply had the government itself brought the suit.see id.this section makes available to a private litigant as prima facie evidence all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel between the defendant and the united states.a emich motors,at.accordingly,the evidentiary use of the prior judgment is determined by reference to the general doctrine of estoppel.id.for that,we look to ninth circuit law.
collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,bars the relitigation of issues actually adjudicated in previous litigation between the same parties.kamilche united states,cir,as amended,cir internal quotation omitted.it precludes relitigation of both issues of law and issues of fact.steen john hancock mut.life ins,cir.the party asserting collateral estoppel must show that the estopped issue is identical to an issue actually litigated and decided in the previous action.kamilche,at.preclusive force attaches only to issues that were necessary to support the judgment in the prior action.resolution trust,keating,cir.litigants are not precluded from relitigating an issue if its determination was merely incidental to the judgment in the prior action.id.
even then,not everything capable of collateral estoppel effect is entitled to prima facie weight under section.only those issues in the first proceeding that are relevant in the second proceeding are admissible.see twentieth century fox film goldwyn,cir.the district court has the duty,as it does with the admission of all evidence,to determine what is probative to the proceeding at hand and can exclude matters that are irrelevant.see id.
here,plaintiffs asked the district court to give prima facie weight to the ftc findings of fact and conclusions of law from its proceedings against olin.the ftc itself acted on an appeal from the alj decision.see in re matter of olin.the alj held a trial and made findings of fact and six conclusions of law leading up to his ultimate conclusion that olin violated section of the clayton act and section of the federal trade commission act because the effect of the fmc acquisition has been or may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in the aforesaid product and geographic markets.the ftc affirmed the alj,concluding that olin acquisition of fmc assets may substantially lessen competition in two national markets a the manufacture and sale of chlorinated isocyanurate and calcium hypochlorite dry swimming pool sanitizers and b the manufacture and sale of chlorinated isocyanurate dry swimming pool sanitizers.emphasis added.the ftc did not,however,conclude that the fmc acquisition may tend to create a monopoly,as the alj had expressly found.importantly,the ftc judgment stated that it adopted the findings of fact and initial decision of the alj that were not inconsistent with the findings of fact and conclusions of law in its own opinion.it did not identify which of the findings and conclusions were consistent and which were not.
plaintiffs moved the district court to give prima facie weight to all of the alj findings of fact and six conclusions of law.they did not identify for the district court which findings and conclusions were consistent with the ftc decision,which were necessary to support the judgment or which were identical and relevant to the issues that needed to be resolved by the district court in this case.plaintiffs simply argued that they were entitled to the wholesale admission of all of the alj findings and conclusions.
although the prior proceeding and this proceeding are similar in that they both contend that olin acquisition of fmc is illegal under the antitrust laws,the issues resolved in the two proceedings are quite different.see brunswick pueblo,d describing the differences between actions under section and section of the clayton act in their treatment of illegal acquisitions.the ftc was attempting to predict the effects of the fmc acquisition,not decide whether the acquisition actually resulted in lessened competition,one of the ultimate issues in this proceeding.see united states dynamics,d brunswick,at.in making its determination,the ftc relied upon the evidentiary findings of an alj who heard testimony in and,who,as is advised,see general dynamics,at,considered only pre acquisition evidence.ultimately,the ftc concluded that olin acquisition of fmc assets is likely substantially to lessen competition in the markets for dry pool sanitizers and isocyanurates in violation of section of the clayton act and section of the ftc act.
in this proceeding,plaintiffs alleged and tried to prove that olin acquisition of fmc and its vertical integration with distributors including superior have substantially lessened competition tended to create a monopoly in some or all of the markets.emphasis added.unlike in the ftc action,plaintiffs here must show they were actually injured by a lessening of competition.see associated contractors california state council of carpenters,d brunswick,at.further,the markets,as defined by plaintiffs,are different from the markets in the ftc proceeding.here,they allege four markets the sale of by manufacturers to wholesalers across the entire united states the sale of isos by manufacturers to wholesalers across the entire united states the sale of branded to retailers in california,arizona and nevada and the sale of branded isos to retailers in california,arizona and nevada.the ftc found there to be only two markets,only one of which matches any of the relevant markets alleged in this proceeding.moreover,the time period at issue here is different from the period at issue in the ftc proceeding.here,the time period is the period after,as it must be because plaintiffs must prove an actual lessening of competition.in short,not all of the issues raised in the first proceedings are identical or relevant to the issues raised in the second proceeding.
in addition,the great majority of the alj findings of fact were not necessary to the ftc ultimate judgment that the fmc acquisition was likely to substantially lessen competition.most of the findings dealt with mundane issues such as the employment positions held by various witnesses and summaries of documents.these findings can not be deemed necessary to whether olin violated section of the clayton act.see keating,at.lastly,not all of the alj findings and conclusions were adopted by the ftc.some of the alj findings were likely directed to his conclusion that the fmc acquisition might tend to create a monopoly,a conclusion the ftc did not make.for all of these reasons,the district court did not err in refusing to grant prima facie weight to all of the findings of fact and conclusions of law.
it is probable that some of the alj findings of fact the ftc adopted were necessary to the ftc judgment and would have been identical and relevant to issues raised in the proceedings here plaintiffs argue that the district court should have admitted all of the findings and conclusions and that defendants should have filed motions in limine to exclude the impermissible findings.this misstates the parties respective burdens.it is up to the party seeking prima facie weight to establish that it has met the requirements of section for each issue as to which it seeks prima facie weight.see kamilche,at stating burden is on party seeking collateral estoppel to establish that requirements of collateral estoppel are met.neither the district court nor the defendant is required to engage in a hunt and peck exercise to ferret out potentially relevant and necessary findings.accordingly,the district court did not err in refusing to give prima facie weight to the ftc findings and conclusions,because plaintiffs failed to establish that the section requirements were met for any of the findings and conclusions.regardless,even if these findings and conclusions were given prima facie weight,plaintiffs would have failed to establish antitrust injury,as we discuss below.
antitrust injury 
plaintiffs allege that defendants have engaged in multiple acts in violation of the antitrust laws and that these acts have caused them injury.assuming defendants had engaged in these acts and that they are all illegal,plaintiffs have failed to prove antitrust injury.all that plaintiffs have claimed is that their alleged injuries are causally linked to defendants illegal activities.that is not enough to maintain a private antitrust action.see cargill,monfort of colorado,d brunswick,at.
procedural posture of the motion and standard of review 
procedurally,there is an issue as to how the antitrust injury issue was raised before the district court and how we should review the district court decision.prior to trial,defendants moved to dismiss the action for lack of antitrust injury.both plaintiffs and defendants submitted numerous trial exhibits and other evidence in connection with the motion.in deciding the motion,the district court considered materials outside the pleadings,effectively treating the motion as one for summary judgment.see.b am.ad.of california,cir reviewing district court dismissal of antitrust claim on summary judgment dick geothermal thermogenics,cir en banc holding antitrust standing may be considered at any stage of the litigation.therefore,plaintiffs burden to defeat the motion was to set forth specific facts showing there was a genu
