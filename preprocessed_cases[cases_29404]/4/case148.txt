opinion of the court 
appellants challenge to the delaware title insurance program trenches on the challenge raised by other parties to the new jersey title insurance program,a challenge that we rejected today in our opinion in in re new jersey title insurance litigation.the same result follows here to the extent the analysis set forth here unavoidably duplicates that in in re new jersey title insurance litigation.
background 
dawn mccray,william williamson and daralice grayo appellants,on behalf of themselves and similarly situated consumers,appeal the district court orders dismissing their federal antitrust claims against numerous delaware title insurance companies appellees.appellants assert that appellees fixed the prices of title insurance in delaware in violation of the sherman act and seek treble damages and injunctive relief.the district court held that appellants claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine and the mccarran ferguson act.we will affirm the district court judgment with respect to the filed rate doctrine and hold that appellants lack standing to seek injunctive relief.
title insurers in delaware are required to file their insurance rates with the state department of insurance doi.see ann.tit,a.insurers may comply with the state rate filing requirements through a licensed rating organization.id.appellee title insurers are members of and file their rates through the appellee delaware title insurance rating bureau dtirb or the bureau,which is licensed by the doi.dtirb claims to obtain,compile,and analyze statistical data from its members relating to their title insurance premiums,losses and expenses.at.
delaware insurers must propose their own effective date for new insurance rates.tit,a.however,they must file those rates with the doi commissioner not less than days prior to the proposed effective date.id.c.the delaware code requires the commissioner to review filings as soon as reasonably possible.id.a.the commissioner must consider various factors to determine whether the rates comport with the law and ensure that the rates are not excessive,inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.id.a.filings shall be deemed to meet the statutory requirements unless disapproved by the commissioner within days.id.c.if the commissioner determines that additional time is needed to review a rate filing,shall notify the filer that the review shall be extended and can extend the review up to ninety days,unless the insurer agree s to a longer term.id.
in addition to rates,the doi typically requires insurers to develop and file advisory prospective loss costs and supporting actuarial and statistical data.at.prospective loss costs are the portion of a rate that does not include provisions for expenses other than loss adjustment expenses or profit,and are based on historical aggregate losses and loss adjustment expenses.id.at dtirb request,the doi temporarily exempted dtirb members from its prospective loss costs and supporting data requirement in particular,the doi recognized that there is no credible historic data,particularly with regard to expenses,that the rating bureau could use in preparing the initial rates.at.it therefore granted the bureau an exception to the requirements of using the rating format loss cost prescribed in bulletin.id.nevertheless,the commissioner required dtirb to have an approved statistical plan in place,that would enable the doi to monitor rate adequacy,which the bureau did until at least.
on october,appellants filed a class action complaint,alleging that appellees engaged in collective in violation of section of the sherman act appellants claim that appellees used dtirb as a vehicle for setting uniform rates,which consist of costs unrelated to the issuance of title insurance,including kickbacks and other financial inducements title insurers provide to title agents and other parties.at.appellants allege that as a result,the title insurance market is and dominated by a relatively small number of insurers furthermore,appellants assert that despite growing profits and efficiencies,appellees rates have not changed since.
the district court dismissed appellants complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b but granted appellants leave to amend their request for injunctive relief.specifically,the court concluded that appellants sherman act claim is barred by the filed rate doctrine,which precludes antitrust suits challenging rates currently filed with federal or state agencies.mccray,d at citations omitted.because the doctrine does not bar certain injunctive relief claims,the court granted appellants leave to amend their complaint,as they d id not describe in much detail the type of injunctive relief they sought.id.at.
appellants filed a nearly identical amended complaint,which the district court also dismissed under rule b.the court held that appellants injunctive relief claim is barred by section b of the mccarran ferguson act,which exempts conduct from antitrust liability if it constitutes the business of insurance and is regulated by state law.see mccray fidelity title ins,wl.july.the court determined that appellees conduct met both those requirements.appellants appeal.
discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction under and.this court has appellate jurisdiction under and reviews de novo the district court dismissal of appellants initial and amended complaints,ppl energy plus,llc,cir.
a.the filed rate doctrine 
appellants argue that the district court erred by applying the filed rate doctrine to dismiss their damages claims the district court invoked the doctrine to dismiss appellants demand for treble damages as provided by section of the clayton act,and the return of overpayments made by plaintiffs and the class for defendants title insurance policies.at.
courts often trace the filed rate doctrine to keogh chicago northwestern railway.in that case,a shipper alleged that certain railroad carriers conspired to fix freight transportation rates in violation of the sherman act.id.at.the shipper sought damages based on the unusually high rates.id.the supreme court,however,denied the shipper claim because the carriers had filed the challenged rates with the interstate commerce commission icc,which authorized them.id.at.the court reasoned that it would be improper to hold carriers civilly liable for enforcing rates that the icc had already approved as legal.id.at.in addition,the court expressed a concern about rate discrimination,stating that the shipper potential damages might,like a rebate,operate to give him a preference over his trade competitors.id.at.finally,the court considered the impracticability of awarding damages based on a lower hypothetical rate,which would require reconstituting the whole rate structure a task that the court viewed the icc as more competent to handle.id.at i t is the commission which must determine whether a rate is discriminatory at least,in the first instance.
the court the filed rate doctrine in square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,d.in that case,various corporations alleged that the respondents conspired with their rate making bureau to fix freight transportation rates in violation of the sherman act.id.at.the petitioners sought treble damages based on the fixed rates.id.at.they argued that unlike keogh,respondents rates were not challenged in a formal icc hearing,thereby claiming that the agency approval was insufficient to trigger the filed rate doctrine.id.at see also id.at.rejecting that argument,the court reasoned that respondents rates were duly submitted,lawful rates under the interstate commerce act in the same sense that the rates filed in keogh were lawful.id.at.therefore,the court concluded that petitioners may not bring a antitrust action.id.
this court has recognized that the filed rate doctrine bars antitrust suits based on rates that have been filed and approved by federal agencies,at cir.other courts of appeals have also extended the doctrine to rates filed with state agencies.see,wegoland nynex,cir c ourts have uniformly held,and we agree,that the rationales underlying the filed rate doctrine apply equally strongly to regulation by state agencies.nw.bell,cir w e see no reason to distinguish between rates promulgated by state and federal agencies.moreover,although the doctrine has its origins in cases interpreting the interstate commerce act,it has been extended across the spectrum of regulated utilities.gas hall,d.
appellants argue that the filed rate doctrine does not apply to delaware title insurance rates because the doctrine is limited to comprehensive regulatory regimes,such as the interstate commerce act ica.additionally,appellants emphasize that the interstate commerce industry,among others,no longer requires rate filing and argue that such deregulation weighs heavily against the district court first time extension of the doctrine to delaware title insurance regime.appellants br.at.however,the fact that one industry has been partially deregulated does not mean that the filed rate doctrine is no longer valid in other areas.because appellants offer no authority to the contrary,their argument necessarily fails.
appellants further contend that the filed rate doctrine should not apply because there is no clear repugnancy between the antitrust laws and delaware title insurance regulations.appellants br.at.that argument,however,is also meritless and requires little attention from this court.as the district court observed,appellants repugnancy argument relies on characterizing the filed rate doctrine as a complete bar against antitrust liability.see mccray,d at see also carnation pac.westbound conference,d recognizing that collective ratemaking activities should not be immunized from antitrust scrutiny unless there is plain repugnancy between the antitrust and regulatory provisions internal quotation marks and citation omitted.but the doctrine itself does not eliminate scrutiny under the antitrust laws by the government and possible criminal sanctions or equitable relief.square d,at.furthermore,the supreme court has stated that it disagree s with the view that the issue in keogh is properly categorized as an immunity question,thus making appellants repugnancy argument inapplicable.see also essential commc ns,am,cir t he filed tariff doctrine does not confer immunity from antitrust liability generally.
alternatively,appellants argue that the filed rate doctrine does not apply because delaware title insurance laws do not require the doi to meaningfully regulate title insurance rate filings.appellants br.at.appellees,on the other hand,argue that the filed rate doctrine is not limited to situations where the agency has meaningfully regulated or reviewed the challenged rates.moreover,even if there is such a requirement,appellees argue that delaware title insurance laws are comprehensive enough to warrant the doctrine application.
to support their meaningful regulation argument,appellants rely on two ninth circuit cases wileman elliott,giannini,cir,and brown ticor title insurance,cir.in wileman,the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant competing fruit producers had issued unfair marketing standards without authorization from the secretary of agriculture.at.seeking to invoke the filed rate doctrine,the defendants argued that the secretary tacitly approved the challenged standards because he never disapproved them and had the right to do so at any time.id.at.however,the court reasoned that in square d,governmental approval was required before there could be any effect from the collective activity and it was such approval that legitimized the allotments and the rates.id.the court also reasoned that the secretary did not guarantee any level of review and was equally consistent with lack of knowledge or neglect.id.at.it therefore refused to apply the filed rate doctrine and held that t he mere fact of failure to disapprove does not legitimize otherwise anticompetitive conduct.id.at.
the ninth circuit went a step further in brown.there,the defendant title insurance companies actually filed their rates with regulatory agencies,but the law required only of the rates before they became effective and d id not require compliance with strict guidelines.at.relying on its holding in wileman,the court refused to apply the filed rate doctrine.the court reasoned that t he absence of meaningful state review allows the defendants to file any rates they want.id.in addition,the court explained that if the challenged rates were the product of unlawful activity prior to their being filed and were not subjected to meaningful review by the state,then the fact that they were filed does not render them immune from challenge.id.it therefore concluded that the act of filing does not legitimize a rate arrived at by improper action.id.
appellants argue that brown and wileman,along with other district court cases,represent the correct approach to the filed rate doctrine applying the doctrine only where agencies had to engage in meaningful review of the challenged rates.although appellants do not indicate what level of review is necessary,they suggest that the doctrine,at a minimum,does not apply if r ates are collectively set by the insurers themselves and automatically become effective unless disapproved by the agency.appellants br.at.
despite brown and wileman,the supreme court has never indicated that the filed rate doctrine requires a certain type of agency approval or level of regulatory review.instead,the doctrine applies as long as the agency has in fact authorized the challenged rate as the district court observed,the relevant statute in keogh only required common carriers to provide ten days public notice before charging new rates,and did not require the icc to expressly approve such rates before they went into effect.see stat.cong.similarly,the statute in square d did not require the icc to affirmatively approve freight transportation rates.see square niagara frontier tariff bureau,cir characterizing the central issue as whether keogh has been overruled so far as its language extends to rates filed with but not investigated and approved by the icc.square d also endorsed the appellate court statement that the doctrine applies whenever tariffs have been filed.square d,at citation omitted see also montana dakota utils.nw.pub.serv.holding that the petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate,whether fixed or merely accepted by the agency commission.finally,the first circuit has held that the filed rate doctrine only requires rates to be filed,not affirmatively approved or scrutinized.see town of norwood new eng.power,st cir it is the filing of the tariffs,and not any affirmative approval or scrutiny by the agency,that triggers the filed rate doctrine.
indeed,neither this court nor the supreme court has suggested that a distinction should exist between agency authorization through approval or of filed rates.moreover,in this case such a distinction would be meaningless because the doi was required to review the challenged rates.delaware law states that t he commissioner shall review filings as soon as reasonably possible after they have been made in order to determine whether they meet the statutory requirements.ann.tit,a.further,the commissioner must consider various factors to make sure rate filings are not excessive,inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.id.a.therefore,even though rate filings are deemed to meet the statutory requirements unless disapproved by the commissioner within days,the commissioner is required to review the rates during that period and may extend the review if additional time is needed.id.c.
appellants next argue that the filed rate doctrine should not apply because appellants can not obtain retroactive relief directly from the doi.to support this argument,appellants rely on a series of price squeeze cases,which hold that the filed rate doctrine is inapplicable if a single regulator does not have authority over the challenged rates and thus can not grant full relief.see,city of kirkwood,at borough of lansdale pp l,d.yet,as the district court held,those cases are irrelevant because the doi is fully empowered to regulate the one rate at issue.mccray,d at.moreover,appellants fail to present any authority showing that plaintiffs must have access to an alternative regulatory rem
