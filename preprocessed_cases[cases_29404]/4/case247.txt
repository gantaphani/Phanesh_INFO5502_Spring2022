appellants cherry graziosi and tunica web advertising,twa appeal the district court december,decision granting summary judgment in favor of appellees,a number of casinos located in tunica county,mississippi on appellants federal and state antitrust claims.appellants claim generally that the casinos and others engaged in a concerted refusal to deal with twa,and that their conduct is a per se violation of section of the sherman act.for the reasons stated below,we reverse and remand.
in november,graziosi purchased the domain names and for roughly from the domain name registrar network solutions.shortly thereafter,graziosi leased those domain names to circus circus mississippi,gold strike casino resort gold strike for one year,at a rate of per month.no website was established at either of the domain names rather,a user who entered either of the domain names into his or her internet browser was,under the terms of the lease,automatically redirected to gold strike website.when the lease expired,gold strike continued to lease the domain names from graziosi on an exclusive,basis for per month.
in,graziosi formed appellant twa.graziosi is the ceo and sole shareholder of twa.twa acquired the domain name from another company for approximately,and in november,twa leased to gold strike for days for per month.gold strike continued to lease from twa through april.
the tunica county tourism commission the tctc,filed a lawsuit against graziosi.in its suit,the tctc claimed that graziosi was a cybersquatter,one who purchases a domain name with the hope of profiting from another person that she had no right to own or.the tctc and graziosi eventually settled the suit.as part of the settlement,graziosi transferred her rights in and to the tctc,and the tctc relinquished all claims to the domain name.
in may,twa appeared before the tctc and proposed to lease collectively to all of the casinos in tunica county,mississippi.under the terms of twa proposal,each casino in tunica county would pay twa per month,and,in return,all visitors to would be redirected to the tctc website,which already featured information about all of the casinos.the casinos would also collectively have the right of first refusal to purchase.karen sock,a tctc member and the general manager of the grand casino tunica,referred the matter to the tunica casino operators association the tcoa,a trade association formed by the tunica casinos.on may,the tcoa held a meeting at which the members discussed and twa proposal.none of the casinos agreed to twa proposal,and the casinos apparently reached a consensus to not jointly utilize the domain name.
appellants contend that the may,meeting also gave rise to an agreement among the casinos to refuse to deal with twa on any terms.shortly after the tcoa meeting,clyde callicott,the marketing director for gold strike,allegedly told graziosi that the casinos had entered into a gentlemen agreement to not do business with twa,either individually or as a group on june,graziosi received an email from callicott,stating that he had been instructed to terminate gold strike existing relationship with twa i was informed by my based on that discussion held at the tcoa meeting to terminate the business relationship we have created with the site.i wish i could do more but my hands have been officially tied by the tcoa on this issue.
appellants suggest that the motivation for the casinos refusal to deal with twa was to cause the value of to decline.graziosi asserts that callicott told her that,at the may,meeting,robert mcqueen,general manager of the horseshoe casino,stated that the domain name would be worthless if none of the casinos dealt with twa.this understanding was also apparently confirmed by a conversation between graziosi and ellen duffin,a marketing executive at the grand casino tunica,sometime after the may,meeting.
after the may,meeting,twa changed its business model.it created a website at and hoped to generate revenue through casino advertising commissions from online hotel bookings.with this new business model in place,approached a number of the casinos individually with proposals to advertise on,but none of the casinos chose to advertise on the site appellants contend that the casinos continued refusal to advertise on was on account of their earlier agreement to boycott.appellants also argue that the casinos reaffirmed their boycott of at a november tcoa meeting.on november,callicott,then the marketing director for the sheraton casino and bally,emailed graziosi and told her that he understood that the tcoa had recently held a meeting at which the casinos voted to stay away from so it could evently sic be sold and bought at a later date by them.
graziosi and twa filed this action in,asserting state and federal antitrust claims against the casinos,the tctc,and the tcoa,as well as several state causes of action not relevant here on november,the district court dismissed the antitrust claims against the tctc,holding that the tctc was immune from antitrust liability under the local government antitrust act,a the lgaa,and the parker immunity doctrine the court rejected the other defendants claims that they were entitled to immunity from plaintiffs antitrust claims under the lgaa,the parker doctrine,and the doctrine the tcoa and gold strike were later dismissed from the suit by agreement of the parties.
on december,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants appellees here on twa antitrust claims the district court found that the casinos alleged conduct could not amount to a per se violation of section of the sherman act any concerted refusal to deal with twa arising from the may,tcoa meeting was not an unreasonable agreement in restraint of trade because it was a joint response to a joint proposal and because twa did not produce sufficient evidence to show any anticompetitive effect and twa did not show that the casinos,refusals to deal with twa and were the result of concerted action,in part because twa did not provide the details of any of its,proposals to the casinos.
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.stewart glass mirror,auto glass discount,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.on a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all inferences in its favor.see stewart glass mirror,at.
section of the sherman act,provides every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal.in order to state a claim under section of the sherman act,a plaintiff must show that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy that restrained trade in a particular market.spectators commc network colonial country club,cir a necessary ingredient of any section conspiracy is a showing of concerted action on the part of the defendants.see monsanto serv,d.to establish concerted action,the plaintiff must present evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the defendants had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.id.at.in other words,t here must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action.bell atl.twombly,d a t the summary judgment stage a plaintiff offer of conspiracy evidence must tend to rule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently.concerted action may be shown by either direct or circumstantial evidence.monsanto,at.viazis am.ass of orthodontists,cir.direct evidence of concerted action is that which explicitly refer s to an understanding between the alleged conspirators,while circumstantial evidence requires additional inferences in order to support a claim of conspiracy.viazis,at quoting southway theatres.theatre,cir alteration in original.
circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy in restraint of trade must be strong in order to survive summary judgment,because antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a case.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.courts considering section cases will not draw inferences to support a claim that makes no economic sense such a claim will require unusually persuasive evidence to withstand summary judgment.spectators commc network,at matsushita,at.i f the factual context renders respondents claim the claim is one that simply makes no economic must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than would otherwise be necessary.in addition,conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not,standing alone,support an inference of antitrust conspiracy.matsushita,at.in sum,a plaintiff can survive summary judgment only if it show s that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action or collusive action that could not have harmed the plaintiff.id.
we first consider whether twa has presented sufficient evidence of a conspiracy or concerted action on the part of the casinos to survive summary judgment.see associated press,cir only after an agreement is established will a court consider whether the agreement constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade.
the district court held that,viewing all of the summary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to twa,the evidence was insufficient to establish concerted action by the casinos.the court found that the casinos decision at the may,tcoa meeting to reject twa proposal that each casino pay twa per month to have visitors to redirected to the tcoa website could not be an unlawful agreement in restraint of trade because it was merely a joint response to a joint offer.the district court also held that twa could not establish that the casinos refusals to deal with twa and after may,were the result of concerted action,because the record did not contain any evidence of the details of the proposals that twa made to the casinos after may.
we agree with the district court that the casinos initial decision to reject twa proposal was not an unreasonable agreement in restraint of trade.given the joint nature of twa initial proposal,which invited the casinos to respond together as a single entity,the casinos decision to reject that proposal is not concerted action subject to section.copperweld independence tube,d holding that joint actions of parent company and subsidiary are not subject to section liability because the parent and subsidiary have a complete unity of interest vii phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed noting that actions of trade associations can,in some situations,be treated as actions of a single entity.
our analysis does not end there,however.twa submitted evidence that would tend to prove that the casinos did more than simply reject twa joint offer.twa as callicott statements and emails to graziosi indicating that the casinos had entered into a gentlemen agreement to not deal with and that gold strike had to terminate its relationship with as a result of the casinos agreement at the may,if credited,direct evidence that the casinos agreed not only to reject twa initial proposal,but also to refuse to do business with twa and individually.although the district court purported to analyze twa claims on the assumption that all of the evidence proffered by twa was true,it did not give meaningful consideration to callicott statements allegedly later confirmed by duffin that the casinos had a gentlemen agreement to not deal with twa,and it failed to explain why that evidence,if credited,does not create a fact issue about whether the casinos engaged in concerted action.we believe that it does.
moreover,if twa evidence of the casinos actions after the may,tcoa meeting is credited,that evidence likewise creates an issue of fact as to whether the casinos engaged in concerted action.according to another email from callicott to graziosi,the casinos met in november and again decided to refuse to advertise on,in the hopes that the value of the domain name would decrease and the casinos could buy it at a later date.if twa can establish concerted action by the casinos through this sort of direct evidence,then it is not required to provide circumstantial evidence,such as the details surrounding its later proposals to the casinos,from which a concerted refusal to deal can be inferred 
the casinos assert that much or all of twa direct evidence that they engaged in concerted action,including the statements and emails attributed to callicott,is inadmissible hearsay.twa counters that the challenged statements are admissible,evidence because they are admissions of a party opponent statements of a.see.d.although the district court expressed some skepticism about the admissibility of much of twa evidence,it assumed for purposes of its summary judgment order that all of twa evidence was admissible,and it did not make any specific determinations about whether or not any particular piece of evidence was admissible.
determining whether the statements that twa attempts to attribute to the casinos via their employees are admissible as party admissions statements will require a number of preliminary fact determinations,such as whether the speaker was authorized to speak on behalf of any of the casinos and,if so,whether the statement was made within the scope of the speaker employment.the district court is better suited to rule on the admissibility of that evidence in the first instance,and,because the district court assumed that the evidence was admissible,we do the same for purposes of this ruling.spectators commc network,at because the district court did not rule on the admissibility of the evidence,we will not do so in the first instance,but will consider it part of the record for the sake of argument.
accordingly,we hold that the district court erred when it found that twa proffered evidence did not create any issue of fact on the element of concerted action.on remand,the district court should consider the casinos admissibility objections and determine whether the admissible evidence is sufficient to establish concerted action.
we next consider twa argument that the casinos refusal to do business with it amounts to a horizontal boycott that is per se unlawful under section.
to determine whether an agreement is an unlawful restraint on trade,we generally apply the rule of reason,which requires us to consider whether the particular agreement at issue in fact operates as an unreasonable restraint on competition.see bus.elecs.sharp elecs,d spectators commc network,at.under the rule of reason,an agreement will be found unlawful only if the plaintiff shows that it actually had an adverse effect on competition.see consol.metal prods.am.petroleum,cir.some types of agreements have,however,been found to be almost inherently anticompetitive.such agreements can be considered per se violations of section,meaning that the law does not require a plaintiff to provide the usual proof that the agreement at issue is actually anticompetitive in the particular case.see nynex discon,d c ertain kinds of agreements will so often prove so harmful to competition and so rarely prove justified that the antitrust laws do not require proof that an agreement of that kind is,in fact,anticompetitive in the particular circumstances.on a general level,t he decision to apply the per se rule turns on whether the practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output or instead one designed to increase economic efficiency and render markets more,rather than less,competitive.northwest wholesale stationers,pac.stationery printing,d internal quotation marks omitted ellipses in original.
it is clear that certain group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal can be per se violations of section.precisely which group boycotts are subject to the per se rule is,however,not always clear.id.at.spectators commc network,at.in nynex,the supreme court clarified that a necessary precondition for a p
