in,koch pipeline company,raised shipping rates on its anhydrous ammonia pipeline.pipeline customers cf industries,and farmland industries,challenged the rate increase before the surface transportation board stb.the board found the new rates unreasonable.in these consolidated petitions for review,koch disputes the stb decision to lower the rates,while cf and farmland attack the board decision not to lower them still further.we affirm both decisions and deny the petitions for review.
anhydrous ammonia is a hazardous compound of nitrogen and hydrogen that is used both to manufacture fertilizers and as a direct fertilizer application.a significant amount of the compound is produced in louisiana,oklahoma,and texas,and shipped to users in the midwest.demand is seasonal,increasing sharply during the spring planting season and to a lesser extent in the fall.during the year,shippers fill large storage terminals throughout the midwest to ensure availability when needed.when the spring comes,the terminals are rapidly emptied through deliveries to local retailers,who in turn distribute the anhydrous ammonia to farmers for immediate application.cf,at may,final order.

koch owns one of two pipelines that transport anhydrous ammonia to the midwest in pressurized,liquid form.koch pipeline originates in louisiana and connects that state producers to numerous midwestern terminals.the other pipeline,owned by the pipeline company mapco,originates in texas and oklahoma.koch purchased its pipeline from gulf central pipeline company in as part of a million package that also included the gulf central storage and terminal company and a natural gas company.koch continued to charge gulf central shipping rates until,when koch raised its rates.for the locations relevant here,the increases averaged almost.
cf industries and farmland industries are cooperatives that produce anhydrous ammonia in louisiana and ship it to the midwest via koch pipeline.both producers also occasionally ship by rail,and cf ships a significant amount of ammonia by barge.farmland production facilities are not located near a river and thus have no barge access.on march,cf industries filed a complaint with the board,alleging that koch rate increases were unreasonable four months later,the stb granted farmland petition to intervene as a complainant.
in may,the stb issued an initial order to govern the proceedings.see cf,may,initial order.two parts of that order are important here.first,the board decided that it would only prescribe rates at locations where it determined koch to be market dominant,finding no justification for the agency to inject itself into the pricing of services where competitive alternatives act as an effective constraint on a pipeline rates.id.at.in assessing the existence of effective competitive alternatives,the board said it would be guided by the railroad market dominance guidelines issued by its predecessor agency,the icc,and by the precedent developed under those guidelines.id.at citing market dominance determinations consideration of prod.competition,aff sub nom.western coal traffic league united states,cir en banc,modified,product geographic competition,
second,the board stated that for locations where it found koch to be market dominant,it would evaluate koch rates using the constrained market pricing cmp principles articulated in the icc coal rate guidelines.id.at citing coal rate guidelines,nationwide,aff sub nom.consolidated rail united states,cir under cmp,the board said,a complainant may choose among several rate constraints,including the cost and revenue adequacy constraints.id.at.
in january,cf moved to amend its complaint to add a challenge to the rates koch had charged prior to its increase.cf argued that its amendment merely clarified the relief requested in its initial complaint,where it had asked for refunds of the rate increases as well as such other relief as the board deems just and proper.compl.koch opposed the amendment.
on may,the stb issued its final decision.at the outset,the stb denied cf motion to amend its complaint as untimely having been filed almost years after the initial complaint and months after the close of discovery.final order at.it also held that cf was estopped from challenging rates based on a settlement agreement cf had signed with koch predecessor,gulf central.id.
the board then turned to koch rate increases,addressing first the question of koch market dominance.in analyzing this issue,the stb considered several possible competitive alternatives to koch pipeline,only one of which is at issue here intermodal competition from river barges the stb koch does not dispute in this barge shipping does not compete with the pipeline for farmland business because farmland lacks access to barge transportation.id.at.however,the board also this koch does barges do not effectively compete with the pipeline for cf transportation to numerous pipeline destination points.id.at 
having found koch to be market dominant at a number of terminals,the board went on to ask whether koch rate increases for service to those terminals were reasonable.to make that determination,the board applied the revenue adequacy test of cmp,which asks whether rates generate revenues sufficient to cover all costs and provide a rate of return on investment equal to the current cost of capital.id.at citing coal rate guidelines,at.it found that,even without the rate increases,koch would more than recover its total investment in the pipeline by the end of,and that,with the exception of its first year of ownership,koch roi has exceeded its cost of capital in all years and by increasingly larger margins so that by its roi was almost twice the cost of capital.id.at.the board concluded that,based on all reliable measures,it is clear that the pipeline is earning adequate revenues and that koch rate increases are not warranted.id.
koch challenges the stb determinations regarding both market dominance and rate reasonableness.we consider those challenges in parts ii and iii below.in a separate petition for review,which we briefly address in part iv,cf and farmland challenge the board denial of cf motion to amend its complaint to include an attack on koch rates.
the stb market dominance guidelines define market dominance as an absence of effective competition,from other carriers or modes of transportation,for the traffic or movement to which a rate applies.see market dominance,at applying the statutory standard for the regulation of railroad rates,a see also b requiring stb,when prescribing pipeline rates,to consider,inter alia,the availability of other economic transportation alternatives.e ffective competition means that,if a carrier raises the rate for such traffic,then some or all of that traffic will be lost to other carriers or modes.market dominance,at.such competition,the guidelines state,serves as a constraint on the ability of the carrier to raise rates.id.to evaluate market dominance,the guidelines employ a flexible approach that rests on analysis of competitive alternatives to a carrier facility.id.at.
in evaluating the effectiveness of barge transport as a competitive alternative,the board first reviewed cf claim that barge transport has qualitative disadvantages compared to pipeline transport.the board noted that barge companies lack sufficient hauling and storage capacity to handle a significant shift of anhydrous ammonia traffic from pipeline to barge that barge transport involves higher costs than pipeline transport,which could make a shift prohibitively expensive that barges,unlike pipelines,are hindered by floods,low water,and icing and that barge trips take from days to weeks,while pipeline injection and withdrawal is essentially instantaneous.see final order at.the board also noted cf evidence that pipelines are a safer mode for transporting a hazardous product like anhydrous ammonia.id.at.
next,the board considered an alternative inbound study developed by cf,which indicated that,because of insufficient storage capacity at cf barge destination points,it would have to make prohibitively large expenditures or investments to shift from pipeline to barge although koch criticized cf claim of inadequate storage capacity,the board accepted koch criticism only in part,finding that koch own restatement of cf study ignored storage costs.the board also considered a matching study prepared by koch to demonstrate the effectiveness of barge competition,but found koch study unreliable.id.at.the board then consolidated data from both parties and recalculated where necessary to account for the problems it had identified.id.at.
finally,a s a measure of the effectiveness of barge competition,the board compared koch revenues under the old rate structure to its revenues under the new rate structure,assuming all traffic would be diverted.id.at.that comparison showed that koch revenues for the cf traffic that it would on its increased exceed revenues at a number of terminal points.id.as a result,the board concluded that koch does not face effective barge competition at those locations.id.at citing market dominance,at,aluminum ass,aff sub nom.aluminum of am.icc,salt river project agric.improvement,aff,salt river project agric.improvement power dist.united states,
koch attacks the stb market dominance determination on two grounds.first,it contends that the board comparison of its revenues was an inappropriate test for market dominance.second,it contends that the board disregarded record evidence of effective competition,particularly koch own matching study.
we consider these two challenges below.we do so with the understanding that since decisions concerning market dominance are peculiarly within the expertise of the board,our review of such decisions must be particularly deferential.aluminum,at scalia.we may vacate the board market dominance determination only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,or if it is unsupported by substantial evidence.arizona pub.serv.united states,quoting a,e.
koch contends that the board resolved the issue of market dominance based on a single,unprecedented,and irrational standard whether koch could raise its rates and still increase its net revenues.we conclude that none of those three adjectives appropriately characterizes the standard employed by the board.
first,although the stb comparison of revenues before and after the rate increase was important to its analysis,it was not the only factor the stb examined.rather,that comparison came last in the stb analysis.it was employed only after the board had reviewed a host of qualitative considerations that it found to limit the effectiveness of barge capacity,reliability,speed,and after it had reviewed the studies proffered by both koch and the complainants while the board market dominance guidelines contemplate the use of such qualitative considerations,they do not exclude the application of quantitative analysis as well.see market dominance,at 
second,the revenue comparison methodology is hardly unprecedented.to the contrary,it is well in accord with both the market dominance guidelines and the agency precedent cited by the board.see at if the loss in future revenues exceeds the gains from exercising market power in the short term,then a rail carrier will be deterred from charging excessive rates.id.at stating that effective competition means that,if a carrier raises the rate for such traffic,then some or all of that traffic will be lost to other carriers or modes aluminum ass,at a potential loss in future revenues which merely exceeds any gain from exercising market power in the short term will deter a rail carrier from charging excessive rates.salt river,at t he potential loss of future revenues,provided that the loss exceeds any gains from the exercise of market power,will deter rail carriers from charging excessive rates,aff,salt river,at see also burlington,finance docket,wl,at,noting that market power is defined as the ability profitably to sustain higher prices or lower service quality internal quotation omitted.it is also in accord with judicial precedent.see burlington stb,upholding stb market dominance determination where carrier could recoup profits on lost incremental coal traffic by charging higher rates on shipments that complainant could not avoid arizona pub.serv,at noting that effectiveness of competition would depend at least on the extent of the monopolist profit that the railroads could reap by raising their prices,and the amount of traffic they would lose by raising prices 
finally,koch contends that the board whether a firm is market dominant by asking whether it can increase its net revenues by raising its irrational.given that this methodology is consistent with the market dominance guidelines,which are not themselves questioned by koch,a challenge to its rationality is misplaced in any event,we do not find the methodology irrational.to the contrary,it represents an accepted method of measuring market power,based on the recognition that although a firm in a competitive market can not raise its prices without a net loss of revenue,a firm with market power can see iia phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law an analysis of antitrust principles and their application,at a defendant firm has market power if it can raise price without a total loss of sales.market power is large when a firm can profit by raising prices substantially without losing too many sales.id,at see also landes posner,harv.at richard posner frank easterbrook,antitrust cases,economic notes other materials ed of course,precisely how high a firm can raise its prices without reducing net revenues is an important consideration.but the amount by which koch increased its rates average of is well above the standard usually employed to signal a substantial degree of market power.see iia areeda,at suggesting use of or differential merger guidelines utilizing test.
koch correctly points out that the ability to increase revenues by raising prices is not always indicative of market power.as koch notes,a firm in a fully competitive market that is pricing below market levels would expect to earn greater revenues by raising its prices to meet its competitors.br.for pet r koch koch br.at.but the normal assumption in examining assertions of market power is that the current price is at least the competitive price.see iia areeda,at.koch questions the validity of that assumption in this case,pointing to the fact that it had not raised its prices in eight years prior to.but koch is a institution,not an eleemosynary one,and it has provided no reason to believe that it priced below market for eight years,rather than calculated that those prices were the most the market would bear.see iia areeda,at noting that rational firm has no reason to sell for less than market price 
koch also contends that the stb,in making its market dominance finding,improperly rejected certain studies koch submitted.koch first takes issue with the board rejection of its matching study.in that study,koch identified retailers that had received anhydrous ammonia shipped by both barge and pipeline during the same year.koch argued that those retailers could meet all of their ammonia needs from barges,and thus that the tonnage needed to serve those retailers would be diverted from pipeline to barge.such a diversion,koch argued,would constrain the pipeline rates.the board rejected koch matching study as unreliable because koch included retailers whose costs for shipping by barge were greater than for pipeline when the total costs of barge the cost of trucking the anhydrous ammonia from the barge river terminals to the areas served by inland pipeline included in the calculation.final order at.the cost differential indicated to the board that barges were not serving as a competitive alternative to pipeline transport for those retailers,but instead were meeting different as providing additional anhydrous ammonia when sufficient supplies were unavailable by pipeline.see iia areeda at the absence of close price relationships among products presumptively indicates that they are in separate markets.
koch claims that the stb improperly rejected its matching study because the board arbitrarily viewed as noncompetitive any barge shipping that was more costly than koch pipeline.it is,of course,that a significant cost differential may render one product an ineffective restraint on the pricing of another,even if the two could otherwise serve as substitutes for one another.market dominance,at stating that evidence of product competition should show that shipper can obtain feasible substitutes without substantially greater cost,transportation or otherwise as koch itself notes,the board market dominance analysis ask s whether complaining shippers ha ve feasible competitive alternatives such that they could switch a sufficient amount of traffic to protect themselves from an unreasonable price increase if they wished.koch br.at emphasis added.if barge costs were significantly above those of pipeline,switching to barge would not protect the shippers from koch unreasonable price increase.accordingly,koch concedes that at some point an alternative will be so costly or impracticable that it is simply not feasible.id.at.
the trouble with the stb analysis,koch contends,is that the board regarded barge shipping as noncompetitive if it cost even one cent more than pipeline.id.at.koch bases this contention on a single sentence in the stb opinion,in which the board stated that koch matching study had improperly indicated matches where total barge costs were higher than total pipeline costs.final order at.by higher,koch contends,the board must have meant higher by as little as one cent.
but the footnote to the cited sentence makes clear that koch has misread the stb test.see final order at.in that footnote,the board provides an example to explain what it regarded as the flaw in koch study a case in which koch claimed a match notwithstanding that the total costs were per ton,while costs were only difference of approximately.although a small difference in the price charged by an alternative carrier would not prevent it from constraining koch prices,a difference of is as having that effect.iia areeda,at,at suggesting or difference as significant.
koch also attacks the stb for rejecting its restatement of cf alternative inbound study.in that restatement,koch identified tons of anhydrous ammonia that it said could be diverted from pipeline to barge.see final order at.the board rejected koch figures,in part because they failed to account for storage costs cf would have to pay at terminals it did not own.id.at.koch argues that in so doing,the board ignored unrefuted evidence that shifting the anhydrous ammonia to the cf storage terminals would still be less costly than pipeline.koch br.at.but koch evidence was not unrefuted rather,it was vigorously disputed by cf witnesses.compare verified reply and rebuttal statements of phillip baumel on behalf of koch pipeline,at,with verified opening and rebuttal statements of fred mugica on behalf of cf industries,at.although koch may regard cf responses as constituting ineffective refutation,the board acts within its authority when it chooses between contending accounts of the evidence,see burlington,at,and this court has no power to substitute its judgment for that of the agency,id.at quoting citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.
we next turn to the stb conclusion that koch rate increases were unreasonable.although the board announced in its initial order that it would apply constrained market pricing cmp principles,koch contends that it failed to do so.while the components of koch argument are interrelated,it is most convenient to consider them in three parts that the board should have determined rate reasonableness using a standard consistent with the cost sac constraint of cmp that instead,the board used original cost ratemaking ocr,a discredited methodology and that in so doing,the board failed to account for the expenditures koch would eventually have to make to replace the pipeline.
in reviewing the stb determination of rate reasonableness issues,we again apply the deferential standards of the administrative procedure act,a,e,and uphold board decisions as long as they are supported by substantial evidence and are not arbitrary or capricious.see mccarty farms,stb.because congress has expressly delegated to the board responsibility for determining whether a carrier rate is reasonable,the board is at the zenith of its powers when it exercises that authority,and is therefore entitled to particular deference.burlington,at internal quotations omitted.moreover,as with the market dominance guidelines,we note koch declaration that it does not challenge the rate guidelines themselves,but only their asserted misapplication in this case.
the purpose of cmp is to ensure that a carrier does not use its market dominance to charge its captive shippers more than they should have to pay for efficient service.coal rate guidelines,at see consolidated rail,at affirming coal rate guidelines.to accomplish this,cmp imposes four separate constraints on rates,two of which are relevant here revenue adequacy and sac.coal rate guidelines,at the first constraint,revenue adequacy,examines the existing carrier on a basis to determine the revenues it needs to provide a rate of return on net investment equal to the current cost of capital,the level of return available on alternative investments.id.at.the sac constraint,by contrast,limits a carrier rates to those necessary to generate the revenue that a hypothetical new,optimally efficient carrier would need to meet in order to serve the complaining shippers alone.final order at see coal rate guidelines,at mccarty farms,at.sac is intended to ensure that a shipper not bear the costs of any facilities or services from which it derives no benefit.coal rate guidelines,at 
in this case,cf and farmland elected to rely on the revenue adequacy constraint.holding that revenue adequacy and sac provide alternative methodologies for examining the reasonableness of a carrier rates,and that complainants may use any methodology that is consistent with cmp,final order at,the board employed the revenue adequacy approach and found koch rate increases unnecessary to ensure adequate revenues,id.at.in so doing,the stb rejected the relevance of koch sac evidence,which purportedly would have justified the company rate increases.id.at.
koch contends that the stb should have accepted its sac model,or at least refused to employ a revenue adequacy methodology that yielded different results.the board conclusion to the contrary,however,is consistent with the agency rate guidelines.those guidelines state that sac and revenue adequacy are separate constraining factors on the maximum rates a carrier may charge,coal rate guidelines,at,and that c arriers do not need and are not entitled to any higher revenues than the revenue adequacy standard permits,id.at.moreover,the guidelines expressly contemplate that the rate to an individual shipper may vary depending upon which of the two cmp approaches is used,and that it is the complaining shipper who may decid e which approach to pursue.id.at.see consolidated rail,at noting that the guidelines provide that the constraints may be used individually or in combination to analyze whether the rate increase is unreasonably high quoting coal rate guidelines,at 
in sum,the board determination that koch could not charge rates higher than those permitted by the revenue adequacy constraint,and therefore that koch sac evidence was not relevant even if it would have yielded a different result,was a reasonable reading of the agency rate guidelines and is not subject to reversal by this court.see auer robbins,d.
koch also attacks the board analysis on the ground that it assertedly employed ocr principles,which limit the carrier to a return based on the depreciated cost paid by the original owner of the capital assets.see generally ashley creek phosphate,wl,at,ocr uses original cost as of the actual installation date of the assets as the basis for computing the capital costs.koch devotes a considerable part of its argument to pointing out the flaws in the ocr approach,but we need not consider those flaws because the stb did not use original cost in the analysis it undertook in this case.the board relied,instead,on a amount koch paid in an arm length transaction to acquire the pipeline.final order at.
although it may appear that koch and the stb are talking past one another,a footnote to koch brief discloses the source of the disconnect.koch br.at.there,koch asserts that the million figure the stb used as koch initial investment in the pipeline was not koch true acquisition cost,but rather the previous owner depreciated original cost as of the date koch bought the pipeline.koch argues that by using that figure to determine revenue adequacy,the stb effectively employed an ocr analysis.id.at.
this argument can not prevail.as the stb explains,the million figure was the figure koch itself assigned to its pipeline assets on a form koch filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc shortly after the acquisition.see final order at ferc form reproduced in br.for cf before stb,ex.at.the form instructions required the use of acquisition cost moreover,koch submitted no other figure for its investment base to the stb,notwithstanding the board direction in its initial order that the parties evidence should include pipeline investment.initial order at nor has koch suggested an alternative figure on this appeal.accordingly,the stb reasonably concluded that it could properly use koch own million valuation as a reliable estimate of its cost of the value of its initial investment pipeline.final order at.
finally,koch argues that the board should have used replacement cost,rather than either acquisition or original cost,as the baseline for its revenue adequacy constraint.koch defines replacement cost as the current cost of replacing assets or constructing them anew.koch br.at.
much of koch argument in favor of replacement cost relies on the fact that a variant of replacement cost is utilized in sac analysis.sac uses replacement cost,however,because the theory of sac assumes that a new entrant can potentially enter the market today thus,asset value must be based on the cost of acquiring assets today at their current value.coal rate guidelines,at emphasis added.revenue adequacy analysis,by contrast,is intended to determine whether the revenues of an existing company are sufficient to provide a rate of return on that company net investment equal to the current cost of capital.id.at.hence,the considerations that compel the use of replacement cost in the sac constraint do not apply to the independent constraint of revenue adequacy.
koch also contends that the stb should have used replacement cost because it best simulates competitive pricing.if rates of return are not calculated based on the cost of replacing the pipeline,koch asserts,it will not be able to compete equally with other firms for available financing in order to replace its current facilities.the board,however,believes that as long as a carrier is permitted revenues adequate to cover all costs and provide a rate of return on investment equal to the current cost of capital,it will be able to compete equally with other firms for available financing in order to maintain,replace and,if necessary,expand its facilities and services.final order at.in the board view,the use of acquisition cost as the investment base ensures such revenue,and it is therefore unnecessary also to requir e captive pipeline shippers to provide in advance a revenue stream to pay for investments not yet made and assets that are not in place.id.at 
our role is not to choose the optimal method of pipeline ratemaking,but only to ensure that the stb choice is a rational one.we can not say that the board has acted irrationally here moreover,koch attack on the economic implications of eschewing reliance on replacement cost methodology is largely beside the point.as koch has stressed,it does not challenge the regulations that govern the board approach to ratemaking,but instead contends that they were not followed.this circumscribes our role even further,as we must uphold the board interpretation of its regulations as long as that interpretation is reasonable.see auer,at.thomas jefferson shalala,d.
koch correctly notes that during the,the icc actively consider ed using a replacement cost methodology in valuing assets in future revenue adequacy determinations.standards for railroad revenue adequacy.but while the commission regarded replacement cost as conceptually the best method available,id.at,in the end it concluded that replacement cost methodology can not be practically implemented in a manner that we can be confident would produce accurate and reliable results.standards for railroad revenue adequacy.
in promulgating the guidelines cited by the stb in this case,the icc again considered the appropriate investment base for analysis of revenue adequacy.see railroad revenue adequacy,at.after notice and comment,the commission rejected the railroads argument that the soundest valuation of assets from an economic perspective is current replacement cost,id.at,and their further argument that original predecessor costs are closer to that measure than are acquisition costs,id.responding to the same concerns koch raises here,the icc concluded that railroad assets would be replaced as long as competitive returns are allowed on new and existing investments,and that if investors can reasonably expect competitive returns,capital can be attracted when it is needed,making advance funds accumulation unnecessary.id.at adopting view of railroad accounting principles board.accordingly,the commission announced that it would use acquisition costs in valuing railroad investment bases in this and subsequent revenue adequacy determinations.id.at this court affirmed that decision in association of american railroads icc.it is therefore clear that the board reasonably interpreted its rate guidelines as using acquisition rather than replacement cost as the investment base upon which to determine revenue adequacy.see final order at citing railroad revenue adequacy,at.
we conclude that,in assessing the legality of koch rate increase,the stb employed a reasonable ratemaking methodology consistent with the board guidelines and precedents.that being the case,koch challenge to the reversal of its rate increase must fail.
we now briefly address cf and farmland charge that the stb improperly denied cf motion to amend its complaint to include a challenge to koch rates.leave to amend any document is a matter of the board discretion,and we find no abuse of that discretion here.
the stb denied cf motion on the ground that it was been filed almost years after the initial complaint and months after the close of discovery.final order at the board had warned in its initial order that,b ecause c requires that this investigation be concluded within three years after its initiation,it was critical that th e investigation be conducted in an orderly and timely fashion.initial order at.under those circumstances,it was reasonable for the board to reject an amendment that would have substantially expanded the scope of the proceedings.
cf contends that no such expansion was required,that no amendment was formally its original complaint encompassed a request for relief from rates.that complaint,however,stated that cf had filed in order to seek a directive from the board requiring koch pipeline to maintain its rates at current levels and to recover damages in an amount equal to any rate increase.compl.although cf notes that the complaint also requested all just an
