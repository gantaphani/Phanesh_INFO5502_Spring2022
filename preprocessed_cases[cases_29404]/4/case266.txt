apani southwest,apani,appeals from the district court dismissal of its antitrust claims against enterprises,cce arising out of a contract between cce and the city of lubbock,texas the city,which granted cce the exclusive right to sell bottled water on property owned by the city.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
apani is a manufacturer of purified bottled water operating in and around the lubbock,texas area.prior to the events in question,apani had developed a business relationship with the city,which permitted apani to sell its product in facilities owned and operated by the city.on august,however,the city entered into an exclusive contractual agreement with cce allowing cce to supply beverages to all facilities owned and operated by the city and precluding the city from purchasing beverages from other parties the agreement,therefore,effectively eliminated the city business relationship with apani the contract between the city and cce arose from a proposal by the city that cce donate approximately one million dollars for the construction of two new scoreboards at the lubbock municipal coliseum.cce agreed to provide the funds for the scoreboards as long as it would be permitted to recoup some of its investment.accordingly,a contract was drafted giving cce the exclusive right to advertise and promote exclusive beverages in and with respect to the territory s,the locations and sites,and with respect to the city of lubbock,events at the locations the agreement,however,provided for several exceptions,including the following 
the right of the city to make available juice,tea,coffee products,water drawn from the public water supply,and milk products as long as cce does not distribute a similar product 
permit trade show exhibitors who have an exclusive agreement for competitive products to advertise,display,serve,or sample products during trade show events 
allow customers with a single beverage serving for immediate consumption to drink but not refill them 
permit local water bottling apani company,that is the official sponsor of the cotton kings,to sell bottled water at professional hockey games.this water will not be chilled or iced down and 
allow amateur sports leagues in city parks the option to sell concessions using competing products.
apani filed suit against cce seeking damages for violations of of the clayton act,and the texas free enterprise and antitrust act tfeaa.bus.com.code ann.et.it also alleged claims of tortious interference with existing and prospective business relations.cce filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted cce motion as to the state and federal antitrust claims,but denied the motion with regard to the tortious interference claims.subsequent to the partial dismissal,the court allowed apani to file a second amended complaint adding causes of action under the sherman act,and,and a civil conspiracy claim.the district court again dismissed all of the antitrust claims pursuant to rule b.cce then filed a motion for summary judgment as to the tortious interference and civil conspiracy claims.the district court granted the motion as to both claims.thereafter,apani filed a motion to alter or amend summary judgment,which the district court denied.

discussion 
apani asserts antitrust violations against cce under the clayton act,the sherman act,and the tfeaa.specifically,in its second amended complaint,apani asserted that t he agreement,having a duration of ten years,represents a contractual agreement resulting from an illegal combination or conspiracy by the city of lubbock and,and which constitutes a restraint of trade in violation of the sherman antitrust act,the clayton antitrust act,and the texas free enterprise and antitrust act of.
clayton act 
section of the clayton act makes it unlawful to sell goods on the condition,agreement,or understanding that the purchaser refrain from dealing with competitors of the seller if the effect may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.two types of restrictions on competition may be challenged under tying restraints and arrangements.gulf oil copp paving,d.tying restraints occur when a seller agrees to sell one product on the condition that the buyer also agree to purchases a different,or tied product,or the buyer agrees that he will not purchase the same product from another supplier.kaiser aluminum chem.sales,avondale shipyards,cir.exclusive dealing,in contrast,occurs when a seller agrees to sell its output of a commodity to a particular buyer,or when a buyer agrees to purchase its requirements of a commodity exclusively from a particular seller.william holmes,antitrust law handbook.here,apani claim under arises from the exclusive arrangement between the city and cce in which the city agreed to permit cce to sell its products exclusively on property owned and operated by the city.this court has recognized that an arrangement does not violate of the clayton act unless the probable effect of the agreement will foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected.bob maxfield,am.motors,cir citing tampa nashville coal,d.
when assessing whether an arrangement has the probable effect of substantially lessening competition,the supreme court has identified a inquiry.tampa,at.first,the relevant product market must be identified by considering interchangeability and of demand.second,the relevant geographic market must be identified,by careful selection of the market area in which the seller operates and to which the purchaser can practicably turn for supplies.id.finally,a plaintiff must show that the competition foreclosed by the arrangement constitutes a substantial share of the relevant market.id.that is,the opportunities for other traders to enter into or remain in that market must be significantly limited.id.
in applying this analysis,it is clear that in order to determine whether a substantial portion of the competition has been foreclosed,apani must first identify the relevant product and geographic markets.
product market 
in ascertaining the relevant product market,courts consider the extent to which the seller product is interchangeable in use and the degree of of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it,control data,cir citing brown shoe united states,d.within the product market,there may exist submarkets which,in themselves,represent product markets for antitrust purposes.heatransfer volkswagenwerk,cir citing united states dupont de nemours,d.the boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity,the product peculiar characteristics and uses,unique production facilities,distinct customers,distinct prices,sensitivity to price changes,and specialized vendors.heatransfer,at quoting brown shoe,at.the district court properly determined,and neither of the parties contest,that the relevant product market is bottled water.
geographic market 
we focus on the area of effective competition in determining the relevant geographic market.jim walter,cir.the area of effective competition in the known line of commerce must be charted by careful selection of the market area in which the seller operates and to which buyers can practicably turn for supplies.tampa,at.the geographic market must correspond to the commercial realities of the industry and be economically significant.brown shoe,at.thus,although the geographic market in some instances may encompass the entire nation,under other circumstances it may be as small as a single metropolitan area.id.citation omitted 
when determining whether a geographic market corresponds to commercial realities,courts have taken into account practical considerations such as the size,cumbersomeness,and other characteristics of the relevant product.in addition,determinants that affect the behavior of market participants may also be considered such as regulatory constraints impeding the free flow of competing goods into the area,perishability of products,and transportation barriers.earl kintner,federal antitrust law volume iv the clayton act section section mergers and markets united states.bank,d united states dynamics.
on the other hand,the economic significance of a geographic area does not depend upon singular elements such as population,income,political boundaries,or geographic extent,but rather upon the relationship between these elements and the characteristics of competition in the relevant product market within a particular area.earl kintner,federal antitrust law volume iv the clayton act section section mergers and markets.put differently,in order for an area to qualify as being economically significant,it must contain an appreciable segment of the product market.id.whether a segment is appreciable depends upon whether it includes either an appreciable proportion of the product market as a whole,or a proportion of the product market which is largely segregated from,independent of,or not affected by competition elsewhere.id.therefore,it is not required that an area encompass a large percentage of all business activity in the relevant product market to be considered economically significant.an area containing only a small percentage of business activity may qualify as being economically significant if the relevant competition in that specific area is insulated from equivalent competition elsewhere.
foreclosure of competition 
after the relevant market has been identified,it must then be determined whether the arrangement foreclosed competition in a substantial share of the established market.tampa,at.
ii.sherman act 
section of the sherman act provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is hereby declared to be illegal.in order to demonstrate a claim of unreasonable restraint of trade under section,apani must establish that the city and cce engaged in a conspiracy,the conspiracy had the effect of restraining trade,and trade was restrained in the relevant market.spectators comm.network colonial country club,cir johnson hosp.of,cir.apani,as the plaintiff,has the burden of proving all the elements of a section violation.id.citing jefferson parish hosp.dist,hyde,d.
as an initial matter,apani does not contend on appeal that cce actions were per se illegal.thus,the rule of reason analysis is applicable to apani claim.doctor hosp.of jefferson,southeast med.alliance,cir.under this rule,apani must demonstrate that the actions unreasonably restrained trade.id.the court must then balance the anticompetitive evils of a restrictive practice against any procompetitive benefits or justifications within the confines of the relevant market.proof that the defendant activities,on balance,adversely affected competition in the appropriate product and geographic markets is essential to recovery under the rule of reason.id.citing hornsby oil champion spark plug,cir emphasis added.thus,as under the clayton act,the first step in analyzing a section claim is defining the relevant product and geographic markets.the same test applied for determining the relevant product and geographic markets for clayton act claims is also used for alleged violations of the sherman act.bob maxfield,at.
iii.texas free enterprise and antitrust act 
the tfeaa was enacted to establish antitrust laws for the state of texas.bus.comm.code et.vernon.each provision of the act is modeled after a corresponding provision of federal antitrust law.roy taylor sales,hollymatic,cir pub,triad communications.as such,texas courts are statutorily instructed to interpret the tfeaa in harmony with federal judicial interpretations of equivalent federal laws.bus.comm.code pub,at.accordingly,texas courts have adopted federal standards for determining violations of the tfeaa,including the use of a relevant market to determine whether substantial reductions in competition have occurred.roy taylor sales,at pub,at.
iv.dismissal of antitrust claims 
the district court dismissed all of apani antitrust claims,finding apani geographic market definition legally insufficient as a matter of law.whether a relevant market has been identified is usually a question of fact however,in some circumstances,the issue may be determined as a matter of law.seidenstein med,cir.where the plaintiff fails to define its proposed relevant market with reference to the rule of reasonable interchangeability and of demand,or alleges a proposed relevant market that clearly does not encompass all interchangeable substitute products even when all factual inferences are granted in plaintiff favor,the relevant market is legally insufficient,and a motion to dismiss may be granted.see,queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir affirming the district court dismissal of an antitrust claim for failure to plead a relevant market because the definition of the proposed market was too narrow tv comms.network,turner network television,cir upholding the district court dismissal of a claim for failure to plead a relevant market where the alleged market consisted of only one specific television channel.because a relevant geographic market must be identified for apani claims under the clayton act,the sherman act,and the tfeaa,this court analysis of the relevant market shall be equally applicable to all of apani antitrust claims.
as stated previously,the alleged geographic market must correspond to the commercial realities of the industry and be economically significant.brown shoe,at.after giving careful consideration to each of the factors identified for determining whether a geographic area corresponds to the commercial realities of the industry,the district court concluded that the relevant geographic market could not consist of only the facilities owned by the city as apani suggests.the court pointed out that apani had done business in and throughout lubbock,texas with customers other than the city,such as texas tech university.thus,it concluded that there were no limitations on apani geographic sales market by the size,cumbersomeness,or perishability of its bottled water that would warrant restricting the geographic market to the city facilities covered by the exclusive agreement.the court further noted that there were no regulatory requirements,or inherent shipping limitations affecting apani product distribution that would support confining the geographic market of competition to the facilities.thus,the court found that apani relevant geographic market definition did not comport with the commercial realities of the industry.it stated that,at the very least,the commercial realities of the industry suggest that the relevant geographic market must include the entire city of lubbock.
the district court next considered whether the restraint on the alleged geographic market was economically significant.when assessing economic significance,a court must determine whether the geographic area contains an appreciable segment of the product market.earl kintner,federal antitrust law volume iv the clayton act section section mergers and markets.as discussed supra,whether a segment is appreciable depends on whether the segment includes either an appreciable proportion of the product market as a whole,or a proportion of the product market largely segregated from,independent of,or not affected by,competition elsewhere.id.the district court found that n o unique limitation on competition would suggest that competition for the city of lubbock bottled water business is separate from competition for bottled water business elsewhere in the lubbock,texas bottled water market.because apani failed to allege that an appreciable proportion of the sale of bottled water in the lubbock area was affected by the agreement,the court determined that apani geographic market definition also failed to meet the economic significance test.thus,the court concluded that t here is no set of facts under which apani can recover either the relevant geographic market is too small to meet the requirements set forth by the supreme court,or the injury to competition is not sufficiently significant to be a violation of the act.
in the alternative,the court determined that apani geographic market definition was inadequate because the city is a single purchaser,and one purchaser in a market of competing purchasers can not constitute a relevant geographic market,absent exceptional market conditions.see jayco,savin bus.mach,cir.in jayco,the plaintiff,a distributor for a major copier manufacturer,alleged that the defendant attempted to monopolize the copier business of one customer,the state of texas.the plaintiff defined the relevant market as low and medium volume copiers for the state of texas copier business.id.at.we explained that as a matter of common sense a single purchaser of a product can not generally be considered a relevant market,lest we wish to clothe each and every sale with an antitrust suit.id.at.however,this court noted that w e hazard the suggestion that a single purchaser could not be considered a relevant market unless plaintiff made some showing of the purchaser monopsony power.id.at.the district court reasoned that apani asserted geographic market alleges a single purchaser within the meaning of jayco and therefore,as a matter of law,it failed to properly define a relevant geographic market upon which relief may be granted.
in addition,the district court found that apani argument was deficient because it,in effect,suggested that a seller or owner of property to which potential buyers come,may not decide what products it will sell or permit to be sold on the property.in support of this proposition,the court relied on the seventh circuit opinion in elliott united,cir.in elliott,a licensed peanut vendor,who formerly sold peanuts outside the united center,an entertainment complex,sued the united center on the grounds that its policy of prohibiting patrons from bringing food into the complex violated the sherman act.the vendor alleged that the market for food concessions within and around the united center itself constituted a relevant market for antitrust purposes.id.at.the district court dismissed the claim finding that the vendor failed to adequately identify a relevant geographic market.in affirming the district court ruling,the seventh circuit stated that 
the logic of elliott argument would mean that exclusive restaurants could no longer require customers to purchase their wines only at the establishment,because the restaurant would be monopolizing the sale of wine within its interior.movie theaters,which traditionally and notoriously earn a substantial portion of their revenue from the sales of candies,popcorn,and soda,would be required by the antitrust laws to allow patrons to bring their own food.
in the instant case,the district court stated that apani argument,like the one presented in elliott,would deny property owners the right to determine for themselves what products they will sell on their property.it reasoned that the antitrust laws are not designed to preclude businesses from selling what they choose on their property,rather the laws are intended to prevent persons from manipulating the marketplace in restraint of trade.the court concluded that apani claims fell outside the realm of injuries for which the antitrust laws were enacted to protect,and therefore apani failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
apani asserts several points of error in connection with the district court conclusion that it failed to sufficiently allege a relevant geographic market.first,apani challenges the district court determination that the territory s and locations owned by the city within the meaning of the exclusive dealing agreement are too narrow from a geographic standpoint to constitute a relevant market.it argues that the district court erroneously designated the relevant property as that owned by the city,which consists of locations,rather than that owned or operated by the city,as alleged in apani complaint,or owned and operated by the city,as provided in the exclusive agreement.apani explains that,had the district court considered all the property owned operated by the city,the effect would have been an expansion of the alleged geographic area.
next,apani concedes that identifying a relevant market requires more than a determination of metes and bounds,however,it argues that there is no existing case law that places such a restrictive view in a rule b context.it suggests that in construing the pleading requirement for a relevant geographic market,we look to the seventh circuit decision in mcm partners,associates,cir.in mcm partners,mcm,a rental equipment company,brought an antitrust suit against exhibition contractors alleging that the contractors violated section of the sherman act and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,when they refused to rent forklifts and other material handling and personnel moving equipment from mcm.the district court dismissed mcm antitrust claim with prejudice,finding that it failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted under section because it had not sufficiently alleged a contract,combination,or conspiracy in restraint of trade.in the alternative,the court determined that mcm failed to plead facts supporting its definition of the relevant geographic market.
in its complaint,mcm defined the relevant market as the rental of forklifts,material handling and personal moving equipment to the convention and trade show industry in chicago,illinois.id.at.it alleged that the vast majority of chicago convention and trade show activities take place at chicago mccormick place complex and that the consumers in that market consisted of exhibition contractors who set up,install,and disassemble the booths and other physical items used in the industry.id.the district court stated that these allegations defined the relevant market too narrowly because mcm failed to include in its complaint facts demonstrating that the market for mcm equipment was limited to exhibition contractors.in overturning the district court ruling the seventh circuit held that 
the district court willingness to look behind mcm allegations because it believed mcm had not alleged facts to support the complaint market definition is in considerable tension with our recent decision in hammes aamco transmissions,cir.there,we explained that judicial attempts to apply a heightened pleading standard in antitrust cases had been scotched by the supreme court decision in leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence and coordination unit,d,and that after leatherman,an antitrust plaintiff need not include the particulars of his claim to survive a motion to dismiss.at.it is instead sufficient for the plaintiff to include in its complaint only a short and plain statement of the claim showing an entitlement to relief.civ.a see leatherman,at.at hammes,at i t is not inconceivable to us that mcm could prove a set of facts supporting the relevant market definition alleged in its complaint.see conley gibson,d.it was therefore erroneous for the district court to dismiss mcm section claim on this ground.
id.at emphasis added.
apani asserts that an application of the standard set out in mcm partners,to the present case would compel a reversal of the district court ruling.it directs our attention to the fact that the seventh circuit specifically determined that it is not inconceivable that mcm could prove a set of facts supporting the relevant market definition alleged in its complaint.apani argues that its complaint indicated a more defined geographic area than that in mcm partners,and involved absolute preclusion of competition as opposed to mere restraint.thus,apani submits that its allegations of a relevant market fully comply with federal rule of civil procedure a short and plain statement requirement.however,apani claims that in dismissing its complaint,the district court erroneously applied a heightened pleading standard to its antitrust claims,rather than that set forth in rule a.it argues that such an application is inconsistent with the supreme court admonishment in leatherman.
lastly,apani argues that the district court erroneously applied this court reasoning in jayco to the instant case.specifically,apani maintains that with regard to the relevant geographic market,the pertinent inquiry is not whether there is a single purchaser,rather the court should consider the geographic area,and degree of market activity controlled by the city,which has been foreclosed by the agreement.it claims that by foreclosing competition in all public facilities owned,or controlled by the city,the agreement had the effect of totally eliminating competition in those venues in which there are mass gatherings of people,including conventions,trade shows,entertainment events,sports events,and other activities.apani concludes that any reference to the city as a single purchaser mischaracterizes the offensive nature of the subject agreement,as the city may or may not be a purchaser of the product,but the city granted the exclusive dealing arrangement,which dictates the beverage product offered to the captive persons in attendance at the defined properties,and forecloses any other competition at the public venues.
with respect to the district court reliance on elliott,apani argues that elliott can be distinguished from the present case.first,it points out that elliott presented claims of only antitrust violations under the sherman act.second,apani asserts that the alleged antitrust violation in elliott was not based on an agreement entered into between the owner of the facility and a beverage or food supplier,but rather involved a complaint that the arena policy prohibited sale of peanuts outside of the arena to its patrons,which could not then be brought into the arena.it claims that such a factual situation is distinguishable from the instant case in that the agreement between cce and the city represents a definite written agreement to foreclose competition through an exclusive dealing arrangement,relating to all beverages sold or distributed by cce within a defined geographic market.
in addition,apani argues that the district court has failed to take into consideration that a patron attending an event at a facility will not likely cross the street to purchase a beverage at a convenience store where competing products may be displayed.it states that the patron is compelled by physical time limitations to purchase the products of the entity that has obtained the exclusive right to sell the product within the specific building or area.apani further argues that,as a practical matter,the elements of interchangeability and of demand are of little significance because any analysis that determines the relevant geographic market only on the basis of square footage or acreage,ignores the intended prohibitions of the antitrust statutes.
after reviewing the record on appeal,and considering apani arguments in light of the applicable law and standards,we conclude the district court correctly decided to dismiss the antitrust claims.with regard to apani criticism of the district court for purportedly misstating the scope of the alleged geographic market,we find that no error was committed.in its second amended complaint,apani alleged as the relevant market all city of lubbock owned or operated facilities,numbering approximately separate properties.apani now argues that the district court erroneously referred to the locations owned by the city as the claimed relevant market.specifically,it maintains that the district court only considered property owned by the city,rather than owned or operated by the city.this argument is without merit.whether the property at issue is referred to as the property owned by the city,or the property owned or operated by the city,according to the facts stated in apani complaint,the subject property consists only of locations.thus,the owned or operated issue raised by apani is no more than an exercise in semantics and does not alter the correctness of the district court decision to dismiss the antitrust claims.
we reject apani claim that the language of the exclusive agreement itself expands the relevant market beyond the geographic area identified by the district court.the operative language of the agreement defines the relevant property as that owned and operated by city of lubbock,except city hall and lubbock international airport.apani claims that the number of properties covered by the agreement would have been expanded had the district court considered properties both owned and operated by the city.this argument makes little logical sense.given the use of the conjunction and,there can be no subset of properties that might fit within the owned and operated category but not within the owned category since every facility owned and operated by the city must also be owned by the city.
having concluded that the district court properly identified the facilities as the alleged relevant geographic market,we must now consider whether the defined market is insufficient as a matter of law.as an initial matter,apani is correct in its assertion that a heightened pleading standard may not be applied to antitrust claims,however,a less stringent standard of pleading does not relieve apani from its obligation to allege facts sufficient to support an antitrust violation.see endsley city of chicago,cir it is true that leatherman tarrant county,d,bars the district court from applying a heightened pleading standard in antitrust cases however,to survive a motion to dismiss,plaintiffs still must set forth facts sufficient to create an inference that defendant had enough market power to create a monopoly.citation omitted.
in insisting that the relevant geographic market requirement has been met,apani relies heavily on mcm partners.that reliance is sorely misplaced.in mcm partners,the alleged geographical market,the convention and trade show industry,is obviously broader than the geographic market alleged by apani,even though most of the convention and trade show activity took place at chicago mccormick place.here,apani has simply attempted to artificially narrow a broader economic market,the city of lubbock,to specific venues.such pleading maneuvers may not be used for the purpose of creating a fictitious market.thus,we find apani geographic market definition insufficient as a matter of law.
because we find that the district court initial reason for dismissing apani claim,the alleged geographic market did not correspond to the commercial realities of the industry and was not economically significant,was proper,we do not reach the issue of whether the city is a single purchaser under the jayco analysis.
tortious interference 
next,apani argues that the district court erred in granting cce summary judgment on its claims of tortious interference with both existing and prospective business relations.
tortious interference with existing business relations 
the essential elements of a tortious interference with an existing business relationship cause of action are unlawful actions undertaken without justification or excuse with intent to harm and actual damages.morris jordan fin.in proving this claim,the plaintiff does not need to prove the existen
