stop shop supermarket company stop shop and walgreen eastern,walgreen brought an antitrust suit against a number of defendants primarily based on section of the sherman act,lost certain of their claims on summary judgment,and then suffered a directed verdict at the jury trial held on the balance of their claims.they now appeal on several grounds as to certain defendants the other defendants settled.we begin with a description of background events and proceedings in the district court.
blue cross and blue shield of rhode island blue cross is the major health insurer in that state,offering various plans that cover,among other medical expenses,the cost of prescription drugs.until,blue cross managed drug benefits itself and provided a substantially open pharmacy is to say,most subscribers could buy drugs at any pharmacy.blue cross determined what drugs it would reimburse,set by negotiation what would be paid to the pharmacies,and processed subscriber claims.
beginning in,blue cross decided to use a pharmacy benefits manager to administer its prescription drug benefits.such managers often set up a closed network of pharmacies,providing greater insurance coverage to those subscribers who use network pharmacies.in exchange for inclusion in the network,and therefore increased volume of drug sales,the network pharmacies typically agree to provide drugs at lower prices,resulting in lower costs to the insurer.
in this case,blue cross invited bids from managers and received three,one of which blue cross disqualified.the second manager was pharmacare,a subsidiary of cvs,a well known major drug store chain pharmacies in rhode island.the third manager,wellpoint,proposed a closed network limited to pharmacies operated by stop shop pharmacies and walgreen pharmacies.after obtaining further bids from wellpoint and pharmacare,in december blue cross selected pharmacare to manage a closed network that initially included the cvs pharmacies and most independent pharmacies in rhode island.
during this period,pharmacare was itself negotiating with yet another benefit health services,provider.provider managed a closed network,comprised mainly of brooks pharmacies pharmacies in the state,serving another healthcare of new england,united doing business in rhode island.in february,provider agreed to allow cvs stores to join the network and in may,pharmacare allowed brooks and other provider pharmacies to join the blue closed network.
ancillary to these arrangements,brooks and provider other pharmacies for pharmacare to join other networks competing for blue cross business.pharmacare in turn agreed not to admit into the blue network new drug stores beyond cvs,the independents,and the pharmacies in the network.blue cross consented to the enlargement of its closed network and in november signed a formal contract with pharmacare.
not all blue cross customers are covered by plans that effectively restrict them to closed network pharmacies.blue cross offers multiple plans,and one set allows customers to fill prescriptions at any pharmacy without economic penalty.blue cross counsel estimated in oral argument that perhaps of blue cross customers are restricted to its closed network our own review of the record suggests that the obviously varies over be closer to.
unhappy with losing the opportunity to serve many blue cross customers on competitive terms,stop shop brought the present action on june,against blue cross,pharmacare and cvs,charging violations of federal and state antitrust laws in march,walgreen joined as and an amended complaint was filed on may.united health,provider,and brooks were also initially defendants but they were dropped after agreeing to admit plaintiffs to the network.
on motions for summary judgment,the district court wrote a detailed opinion rejecting plaintiffs claims that any per se violation of the antitrust laws had been plausibly shown.stop shop supermarket blue cross blue shield of,d.it rejected claims that any of the arrangements comprised naked horizontal restraints such as a group boycott.id.at.however,the court ruled that factual issues precluding summary judgment were raised as to whether any of defendants conduct was actionable under the rule of reason.id.at.
at this time,the district court said that blue cross represented about percent of the customers in rhode island whose retail drug purchases were reimbursed and united provided such benefits to about percent.stop shop,d at.these figures were the lynchpin of the pretrial report by plaintiffs expert witness,bruce stangle,who stressed the percent figure in concluding that an entrant would be precluded from competing in a substantial portion of the relevant market.
thereafter the district court considered in limine motions filed by blue cross.subject to reconsideration at trial,the court granted a motion to exclude certain evidence as to the bidding process leading to pharmacare selection and the related decisions of pharmacare and provider to expand their respective closed networks to include each other present pharmacy members.the court denied,again subject to reconsideration at trial,a motion to exclude key testimony from plaintiffs expert witness,stangle.
trial began in june.on the sixth day of trial,the district court upheld a defense objection to stangle proposed testimony concerning the proper definition of the relevant market.plaintiffs tendered a summary of the proposed testimony as an offer of proof and rested.the district court then granted a defense motion for judgment as a matter of law,holding in an oral ruling from the bench that absent an adequate market definition,the plaintiffs could not make out a rule of reason claim under the antitrust laws.
the plaintiffs now appeal,arguing that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment on the per se claims,in excluding several items of evidence including stangle testimony on market definition,and in directing a verdict.rulings on summary judgment and directed verdicts are reviewed de novo,wolinetz berkshire life ins,cir summary judgment ahern scholz,cir directed verdict the standard for review of rulings excluding evidence depends on the nature of the underlying issue fact,law,judgment call,see blake pellegrino,cir.
per se claims.plaintiffs begin their brief by contesting the district court summary judgment ruling that no legitimate per se claims were presented.as our prior decisions have explained,antitrust claims under section of the sherman act ordinarily require a burdensome showing that the alleged agreement involved the exercise of power in a relevant economic market,that this exercise had consequences,and that those detriments outweighed efficiencies or other economic benefits.this is the rule of reason calculus.see,eastern food servs.pontifical catholic.servs.ass n,cir fraser major league soccer,cir,cert.denied,d.
this calculus is bypassed if the collusive arrangement falls instead within one of several categories,naked horizontal price fixing in which liability attaches without need for proof of power,intent or impact.eastern food,at.for that reason plaintiffs typically try to bring their claims within per se rubrics.whether a plaintiff alleged facts comprise a per se claim is normally a question of legal characterization that can often be resolved by the judge on a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.see,addamax open software,cir.
the most important per se categories are naked horizontal,market allocation,and output restrictions.sometimes group boycotts are called per se violations,but the label here is only minimally useful since many arrangements that are literally concerted refusals to deal have potential efficiencies and are judged under the rule of reason.see healthcare,healthsource,cir.minimum retail price fixing is a rare vertical arrangement still comprising a per se is why car makers only suggest a retail price to this offense is not charged by plaintiffs in this case 
because the defendants moved for summary judgment,the complaint allegations did not have to be taken as true,see intern.welch food,cir,but the plaintiffs were entitled to the benefit of the doubt specifically,reasonable inferences were to be drawn in their favor and genuine factual disputes were properly reserved for trial so far as plaintiffs sworn version of the facts conflicted with the defendants sworn version.see.c douglas york county,cir.however,broadly speaking what happened in this case is largely undisputed,although some of the details are obscure.
in a nutshell,the arrangements that concern plaintiffs were two.first,blue cross contracted for a closed network for its subscribers that excluded the plaintiffs after a bidding contest that plaintiffs say was flawed and that they should have won.second,blue cross and its pharmacy benefits manager agreed with united and its manager that their respective network pharmacies would be admitted to each other closed networks these arrangements included exclusionary restrictions and plaintiffs suggest other more sinister collaboration as to price.
we start with the creation of blue cross closed network.the alleged unfair bidding aside,this is nothing other than an exclusive dealing arrangement,slightly complicated by the involvement of three or four sets of parties rather than the usual two.blue cross,either directly or indirectly,is buying prescription drugs for its subscribers.see kartell blue shield of,cir,cert.denied,d.blue cross closed network effectively gives certain drug stores the exclusive right to supply such drugs to most of its customers.
this certainly inconveniences blue cross subscribers for whom more outlets are a benefit.but,if blue cross is a competent negotiator,the closed network should lower the cost to blue cross of supplying drugs to customers because most suppliers will cut prices in exchange for increased volume,healthcare,at.blue cross might pass the savings on to customers lower premiums,smaller,broader coverage or keep the savings itself and pay its executives more if competition among health insurers is inadequate and state regulation absent.
either way,the closed network is simply an exclusive dealing arrangement which is not a per se violation of the antitrust laws.see tampa nashville coal,d eastern food,at.the arrangement might still be unlawful under the rule of reason depending upon the particular is,depending upon the balance between efficiencies gained and any harm to competition that could be shown,id.at,but we are concerned for the moment only with whether per se treatment was warranted.it was not.
nothing is changed by plaintiffs claim that the bidding was unfair.bid rigging of a certain kind is a per se violation of the antitrust laws,jtc petroleum piasa motor fuels,cir posner,but this refers to horizontal price fixing whereby two or more suppliers or occasionally purchasers secretly fix the price at which they will bid.see id.when blue cross,through its benefits manager,gave exclusive rights to cvs and certain other pharmacies,it was not bidding at all it was inviting bids and making its own decision as to which bid to accept.
ordinarily,it would be in blue cross interest to accept the lowest cost bid,assuming services were equivalent.plaintiffs say that blue cross manipulated the bidding,by giving cvs information about wellpoint bid,which conceivably could happen if blue cross were corrupt or incompetent an alternative,benign reason would be to press pharmacare to improve its offer.but the antitrust laws are not meant to police bad management the market or the insurance regulator is expected to do that.
this brings us to the first part of the second transaction,namely,the agreements that let the blue cross and united pharmacies serve in each other closed networks.these are undoubtedly horizontal agreements,blue cross and united being competitors as are pharmacare and provider,and so draw closer scrutiny.but on their face,they are not exclusionary or otherwise they allow more pharmacies to compete for the same consumer business,brooks can supply blue cross customers and give customers more options.
the main threat,to the extent it exists,lies not in admission of new pharmacies but in ancillary provisions that might exclude others by agreement.it appears that the network remained free to admit other pharmacies it did in fact admit the plaintiffs as part of an agreement to settle this lawsuit.but the district court says that the contracts precluded the blue network from admitting any other new pharmacies beyond the pharmacies,stop shop,d at,so the contracts did for some period restrict blue from admitting plaintiffs.
like the original exclusive dealing contract,this is a possible antitrust violation,but it is not a per se violation.the reason is that the closed pharmacy arrangement is valuable to participating pharmacies in part because it directs volume to them thus,the pharmacies had a direct interest,in exchange for allowing cvs to compete for their captive subscribers,in not only being allowed to compete for blue cross customers but in making sure that yet additional new member pharmacies did not unreasonably dilute this benefit.
this does not mean that the ancillary restriction is lawful but only that per se condemnation is not appropriate.joint ventures involving direct competitors not infrequently exclude other competitors.wholesale stationers,pac.stationery printing,d.imagine a research and development consortium between a dozen small manufacturers that by agreement excluded any new entrants the arrangement might enhance competition with larger manufacturers,and yet the original members might be unwilling to commit resources to the venture if other small able to enter at will and share in the inventions.see xiii hovenkamp,antitrust law.
a further explicit provision of the reciprocal expansions barred the pharmacies from participating in other networks competing for blue cross business.stop shop,d at.this,too,is not a per se violation.by admitting the brooks pharmacies into its own closed network,blue cross and pharmacare were in effect including them in a joint venture.there are sometimes legitimate reasons why one party to a joint venture can insist as the price of entry that a new member limit its existing competitive freedom.xiii hovenkamp.
here,pharmacare was creating and administering a network for blue cross and,in the course of doing so,it would be providing favored access to network pharmacies,bolstering their connection with subscribers,and conceivably giving them information valuable in their servicing of the customers.pharmacare might legitimately be unwilling to expand the network to include pharmacies who were at the same time preparing to join a new consortium to replace pharmacare as blue cross manager.
despite plaintiffs looser description,the restraint does not prevent brooks pharmacies from joining other networks but only from involving themselves in attempts to supplant pharmacare with blue cross.the restraint might still be efficiency gains outweighed by competitive so perish after a rule of reason analysis.but restraints that are truly ancillary to a larger,the expanded closed not normally condemned per se without looking at likely consequences.addamax,at see xiii hovenkamp.
if the rhetoric of older group boycott cases were taken at face value,such agreements might appear to fall within a per se ban.associated press united states.after all,in two different aspects,the ancillary agreements are promises by one competitor or group of competitors to another not to deal with a third competitor cvs,through pharmacare,not to include stop shop and walgreen in the pharmacare network brooks not to consort with stop shop and walgreen to compete for the blue cross contract.but the rhetoric can not be taken literally.
after all,every joint venture among competitors that limits membership fits the lay definition of an agreement not to deal,and at least in recent years the supreme court has flatly rejected the per se label for those that have some efficiency achieving benefits.wholesale stationers,at.to the extent the group boycott label is useful at all to describe a per se violation,it is principally a warning against anticompetitive secondary,manufacturers who agree not to supply a store that buys from a discounting manufacturer.fashion originators guild of,ftc.healthcare,at.
this brings us finally to the intimations in plaintiffs brief of more sinister collaboration.in attacking the dismissal of per se claims,the plaintiffs accuse the district court of ignor ing compelling evidence of per se illegal,horizontal agreements and their anticompetitive motives and effects,a statement followed by bullet points that back to the briefs statement of facts.putting aside the bid rigging and charges already dealt with above,the pertinent factual charge is as follows 
after blue cross selection of pharmacare bid in late,representatives of cvs and representatives of pharmacare,engaged in a series of meetings,discussions,and written correspondence with representatives of competing pharmacies brooks and the independent pharmacy members of provider,stmt.as a result,these competitors agreed to set identical prescription reimbursement rates,both directly and by an equalizing mechanism that entailed payments by cvs to brooks and provider independent pharmacies for each united prescription that cvs filled,stmt.the parties likewise discussed identical levels.
this description insinuates wrongdoing but without the precision needed to advance the argument.obviously any arrangement that reciprocally admitted united pharmacies into the blue cross network and blue cross into united would involve some arrangements as to various payment matters.this would not permit cvs and brooks to agree in general on prices at which prescription drugs could be sold to the public.but the respective insurers and their benefit managers would be entitled to discuss with newly entering pharmacies reimbursement and rates and there would be nothing startling about expecting the same reimbursement as earlier network members 
partial integration of the two operating at three levels,insurer,benefit manager,and settling on component payments least within each well involve identical payments to all participating pharmacies.it was plaintiffs job to explain in detail to us just what the arrangements were and why they plausibly constituted antitrust violations.in the context of partial integration,simply to refer to identical principal reimbursement rates,an equalization mechanism,and identical levels is to substitute innuendo for analysis.
this fatal obscurity has one exception.immediately after the paragraph quoted above,there is a further paragraph describing a february meeting between pharmacare and two stop shop representatives.pharmacare had recently won the blue cross contract,and it was then negotiating with united pharmacies for reciprocal inclusion.stop shop was asking to be included as well.according to a memorandum describing the meeting prepared by a stop shop representative,the pharmacare president said no.
the memorandum says that the reasons pharmacare gave for this refusal were that the negotiations to set up the new pharmacare network had been difficult,that it had required horse trading apparently a reference to the negotiations,and that adding a third chain apparently referring to stop shop on top of cvs and brooks would make the situation even more complex.the memorandum concluded its recitation by saying 
the pharmacare president also lectured john and i about our industry not being farsighted sic to stick together on pricing issues and that we had only ourselves to blame for the extremely low reimbursement rates in the market.
in their opening brief,plaintiffs describe this last statement as another reason for plaintiffs exclusion from the expanded blue cross network.the intimation by a benefits manager owned by cvs that the retail pharmacies in general ought to stick together to raise reimbursement rates paid to them by insurers might well interest the antitrust division,but plaintiffs have a grievance only if their refusal to adhere was another reason for their exclusion.this claim is unsupported by the language of the memorandum or the depositions of the participants which we have ourselves read.
the trial.the absence of plausible per se claims in no way dooms the plaintiffs case.the initial core creation of a closed network by blue cross and pharmacare comprising cvs and various independent a classic exclusive dealing arrangement.to simplify slightly and without repeating details blue cross,in exchange for better prices,gave its business exclusively to one group of pharmacies,agreeing for three years not to deal with others including walgreen and stop shop.
such agreements are not universally forbidden by the sherman,they are quite may,depending on the circumstances,unreasonably restrain trade.xi hovenkamp,antitrust law.because such agreements can achieve legitimate economic benefits reduced cost,stable supply,predictable prices,no presumption against such agreements exists today.compare standard oil of cal.united states,with tampa,at.
indeed,courts tend to be skeptical of such claims because it is not in the interest of the company that grants the exclusive deal to drive out of business competitors of the grantee.here,blue cross would be disserved by making cvs a monopolist,which could then exploit blue cross by demanding higher reimbursement.still,an excluded supplier remains free to offer evidence that,in the individual instance,the consequences of an exclusive contract outweigh the benefits.
this almost always requires a showing of injury to competition some savings are likely or else the buyer would ordinarily not agree to forego dealing with other suppliers,and in any event an agreement that caused no harm would not be worth condemning.but harm does not mean a simple loss of business or even the demise of a competitor but an impairment of the competitive structure of the market.see brown shoe united states,d.
if an exclusive dealing contract cuts off stores like walgreen from an unduly large portion of the available market for its goods,it and others like it might cease to provide prescription drugs.and if this led or was likely to lead to a shortage of competing drug stores and new entry was difficult,the few remaining existing competitors might then be able to conspire or otherwise misbehave without being disciplined by competition.where such foreclosure and negative effects are the result of an agreement,the sherman act may condemn the agreement as unreasonable.eastern food,at see xi hovenkamp.
accordingly,at trial,it was critical to any attack on the exclusive dealing almost any other claim one could plaintiffs establish a relevant market and harm within it.for the exclusive dealing contract,the first step would be to show the extent of foreclosure resulting from the blue cross contract with cvs and others in the pharmacare network,taking account of other existing foreclosures,by until its settlement with plaintiffs.tampa,at.eastern food,at.
plaintiffs sought to offer their market definition evidence primarily,as is typical,through an economist,stangle.stangle position in his pretrial report was that the relevant market was the retail sale of health care financed or insurance reimbursed pharmaceutical products the product dimension of the market in rhode island the geographic dimension.obviously,excluding retail sales that are not financed or reimbursed increases the percentage size of the foreclosed market.
in explaining why he distinguished between reimbursed purchases and all others,stangle pointed to the much smaller direct cost to the blue cross customer who purchased the same drug from a closed network pharmacy,cvs as opposed to a pharmacy,walgreen.the defendants protested that this ignored the customer true cost of the cvs drugs which included a share of the insurance premium that the subscriber or his employer paid to blue cross and also ignored other elements affecting the comparison,such as partial reimbursement for purchases.
pointing to these supposed flaws in stangle market definition,the district court refused to allow the jury to consider it.then,as already recounted,the plaintiffs made a proffer of the testimony for the record and rested,the defense moved for a directed verdict,and the judge granted the motion and entered judgment for the defendants.the judge said that any remaining evi
