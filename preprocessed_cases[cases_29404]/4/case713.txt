the central issue on this timely and authorized appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction code civ,subd.a is whether the enactment by congress of an obscure law concerning the federal aviation administration in preempted local authority over garbage,specifically the power to grant an exclusive franchise for the collection and disposal of refuse.we conclude that congress had no intent to occupy this field to the complete exclusion of local regulation.finding no defect with the order,we shall affirm it.
background 
the injunction restrains defendants recycling,and its president bruce mcchesney hereafter collectively referred to as,from soliciting entering into contracts with individuals or entities for the collection disposal of any solid waste within the boundaries of the city of antioch and the central contra costa solid waste authority cccswa.was also restrained from collecting disposing of any solid waste anywhere within the boundaries of the cccswa,but was not prohibited from collecting recyclable materials within the cccswa which have been separated from garbage and refuse by the waste generator at the point of collection.within the cccswa,recyclable construction and demolition debris shall be considered to have been separated from garbage and refuse by the waste generator at the point of collection where the average percent of residual placed for collection is no more than,and or more of material placed for collection is actually recycled and beneficially reused.the injunction defines solid waste by adopting the definition of the california integrated waste management act of all putrescible and nonputrescible solid,semisolid,and liquid wastes,including garbage,trash,refuse,paper,rubbish,ashes,industrial wastes,demolition and construction wastes,abandoned vehicles and parts thereof,discarded home and industrial appliances,dewatered,treated,or chemically fixed sewage sludge which is not hazardous waste,manure,vegetable or animal solid and semisolid wastes,and other discarded solid and semisolid wastes.pub.resources code,subd.a.
the salient circumstances are easily set forth.plaintiff pleasant hill bayshore disposal,hereinafter pleasant hill,has an exclusive franchise for the collection,removal,transfer,transportation,and disposal of solid waste within cccswa.pleasant hill also has an exclusive franchise for the collection,removal and disposal of all garbage,rubbish and materials within the city of antioch.describes its business as the collection and removal of recyclable construction and demolition debris materials such as wood,metal,sheet rock,stucco,concrete,and cardboard from construction sites and other commercial sites where this material is generated.hauls both segregated by the customer and mixed loads of recyclable materials from its customer s,who pay a fee for to collect and transport the materials in debris boxes.charges a hauling fee for these services.the size of the fee depends on the type and quantity of the recyclable material.transports the materials to recycle processors.through these processors,the recyclable wood is made into fuel,pallets,and particle board the concrete and stucco become class ii road base or are used in levee repair the metal is baled and sold for commercial reuse sheet rock is remanufactured into new sheet rock and the cardboard is processed for commercial reuse.after sorting and processing,only a small amount well below twenty percent by weight of material remains for disposal in landfill.
claiming that conduct violated its exclusive franchises,pleasant hill filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief.one week later pleasant hill applied for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.the parties submitted more than a dozen declarations,deposition excerpts,and a wealth of supporting documentation.argued that its recycling activity squarely falls within the preemptive scope of a federal law which displaced state and local regulation of transportation of recyclable material and thus trumped pleasant hill exclusive franchises.further argued that pleasant hill had not established that what was doing violated either of the franchises.finally,argued that injunctive relief should be denied because pleasant hill could be compensated with monetary damages and the balance of equities between pleasant hill which has an army of employees and equipment and is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of an even larger corporation and a small business with nine employees and four trucks favored and its customers.
with the assistance of an attorney knowledgeable about the subject who acted as a special master,the trial court entered the injunction quoted above.
the major contention presents against the injunction is that it contravenes a federal law that claims preempts state authority,the basis for the exclusive franchises held by pleasant hill.the statute in question is the federal aviation administration authorization act of hereafter cited as the faa authorization act,stat.sees preemption in section,the sole measure in title vi intrastate transportation of property of this enactment.although the section is too lengthy to quote in full,its structure suggests its limited scope.
subdivision a of section of the faa authorization act is congress finding that the regulation of intrastate transportation of property by the states has a imposed an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce b impeded the free flow of trade,traffic,and transportation of interstate commerce and c placed an unreasonable cost on the american consumers and certain aspects of the state regulatory process should be preempted.subdivision b concerns preemption of state regulatory authority of transportation by air carrier or carrier affiliated with a direct air carrier.the subject of subdivision c the specific focus of preemption of state economic regulation of motor carriers.it provides that with certain exceptions not relevant here a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of or more states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier other than a carrier affiliated with a direct air carrier or any motor private carrier with respect to the transportation of property.faa authorization act,c,codified at,subd.c hereafter section c.
as views the matter,because congressional intent to preempt local regulation of intrastate transportation of property is clear and unequivocal from the language of section,if transportation of recyclable materials is the transportation of property under federal law,then any state or local regulation of activities is impermissible.italics added,fn.omitted.
the idea that the faa authorization act preempts state and local regulatory power in the area of appears to be several years old see et,the golden dustman in the golden state exclusive contracts for solid waste collection and disposal in california urb.law,but there is a dearth of useful precedent.in a federal district court in oregon enjoined enforcement of a county waste disposal ordinance on the ground of preemption by the faa authorization act.two years later the ninth circuit reversed on the ground that the district court should have abstained from acting while state court proceedings were pending.woodfeathers,washington county,or.cir.last year another district court in oregon held the same county ordinance preempted.an appeal from this unpublished decision is currently pending in the ninth circuit.enterprises,washington county,or,april,no.civ.wl hereafter.even though the decision involves a federal court construing a federal statute,it is not binding here,people avena cal th,d,and decisions cited.nevertheless,because it is pretty much the sole authority on this issue is extensively discussed in the briefs,and is factually similar to the case at bar,the opinion warrants examination in detail.
the plaintiff in,like,hauled and sorted loads of debris from construction sites for recycling.like,it was paid to remove the material.the plaintiff applied for a license to operate in washington county no action on the application was taken due to the local practice of granting what in practical effect was an exclusive franchise within a geographical area,supra,wl at pp.the district court agreed with the plaintiff that the faa authorization act preempted the licensing requirements and issued a permanent injunction.analyzing decisions from the interstate commerce commission icc,the court concluded that mixed solid waste hauled by the plaintiff constituted property because it possessed economic value inherent in the material even though it had been discarded.the court also concluded that the waste was property according to a more recent decision by the interstate commerce commission which adopted a broader definition property connotes ownership as well as value.something that is owned can be property notwithstanding its lack of economic value.id.at pp,quoting nuclear diagnostic laboratories.
while the pending appeal of the federal district court decision makes it impossible to predict whether its reasoning will be adopted by other courts,it will not be adopted by this one we are unable to agree with the conclusion that section c preempts state and local regulatory authority over waste collection,recycling,and disposal.the framework for preemption is well established the doctrine,which has its roots in the supremacy clause,art.vi,cl,requires us to examine congressional intent.may be either express or implied,and is compelled whether congress command is explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.citation.absent explicit language,congress intent to supersede state law altogether may be inferred because t he scheme of federal regulation may be so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,because the act of congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject,or because the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose.citation.fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d.analysis is also made of contextual factors such as history,entrenched practice,congressional purpose,and the entirety of the regulatory scheme.medtronic,lohr,d.the analysis commences with the presumption that preemption was not intended,particularly with respect to traditional areas of state and local competence.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.
section c is obviously and expressly intended as a preemption measure,but the scope of congress goal is not entirely clear from the statutory language alone.the ninth circuit has stated the only legislative history addressing the meaning of property states that section c does not preempt state regulation of garbage and refuse collectors because under icc case law,garbage and refuse are not considered property.see conf.at,reprinted in.woodfeathers,washington county,supra.the court there concluded only that federal preemption of local garbage and ordinances is not so readily apparent.ibid.we believe a more definitive answer may be hazarded after a consideration of other factors.
the first place to look is at other provisions of the faa authorization act.the other titles of the act are airport and airway improvement,other aviation programs,research,engineering,and development of projects,extension of airport and airway trust fund expenditure authority,and miscellaneous provisions relating to various aviation subjects.stat.the clear impression is that this is,as its name states,a congressional measure devoted to aviation.this is hardly a subject with a natural connection to trash collection.this impression is confirmed by consulting what the ninth circuit termed t he only legislative history.woodfeathers,washington county,supra.with respect to section of the bill,which was codified as section c,the house conference report has some highly pertinent remarks concerning what became section c,the report states the provision preempts state regulation of prices,routes and services by air carriers and carriers affiliated with a direct air carrier through common controlling ownership the purpose of this demarkation sic is to as completely as possible level the playing field between air carriers on the one hand and motor carriers on the other with respect to intrastate economic trucking regulation,and to recognize that air carrier express package delivery companies may differ in corporate form,but operate in the same manner,sess.reprinted in cong.admin.news,hereafter the conference report.
the central purpose of this legislation is to extend to all affected carriers,air carriers and carriers affiliated with direct air carriers through common controlling ownership on the one hand and motor carriers on the other,the identical intrastate preemption of prices,routes and services as that originally contained in the federal aviation act.conf,supra,cong.admin.news.
the conferees further clarify that the motor carrier preemption provision does not preempt state regulation of garbage and refuse collectors.the managers have been informed by the department of transportation that under icc case law,garbage and refuse are not considered property.thus garbage collectors are not considered motor carriers of property and are thus unaffected by this provision.conf,supra,cong.admin.news.
in light of this background as to congress legislative intent,interpretation of the preemptive effect of section c is untenable.there is an undeniable measure of preemption intended by congress,but there is no indication that it was meant to extend to immunize from local regulation.no such immunity is discernible from the statute language or its structure and purpose.fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,supra,d.as fairly indicated by its title,congress intended the faa authorization act to govern aviation carriers and certain types of motor vehicle carriers that are affiliated with aviation carriers.on its face,the faa authorization act is not,as pleasant hill points out,an environmental statute.garbage collection,as recognized by the legislative history quoted,was clearly deemed to be an unrelated concern.there is no mention of local recycling programs in the legislative history,still less any indication that congress intended to displace them.see conf,supra,cong.admin.news.the faa authorization act does not establish or contribute to a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.id.to the contrary,other parts of the same statute explicitly preserve local regulatory authority over specified areas with respect to motor vehicles,subds.c.
finally,the subject of garbage and trash collection is not a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,supra,d.several years ago this court undertook an exhaustive examination of the california integrated waste management act of.noting that the subjects of refuse and exclusive refuse franchises have long been treated as traditional subjects within local police powers,and that the waste management act looks to a partnership between the state and local governments,with the latter retaining a substantial measure of regulatory independence and authority,we held that this comprehensive scheme did not preempt the power of local governments to grant an exclusive franchise for the collection of refuse.waste resource technologies department of public health th,d and authorities cited.we explained how this comprehensive scheme did not impose a regulatory straightjacket it is that the way in which los angeles deals with refuse may be entirely different from the approach of a small rural town.provisions of the waste management act demonstrate that the legislature took account of this reality.it knew that factors such as geography and population density might require a different approach citations.local conditions transcending city or county boundaries might require collection and disposal to be handled on a regional basis,and the legislature encouraged such efforts citations.waste resource technologies department of public health,supra,th,d.after quoting public resources code section we stated that a number of conclusions can be extracted from this statute.first,the legislature recognized that not every aspect of the solid waste problem could be handled in the waste management act the infinite details of actual operations could not be resolved in sacramento.second,the legislature further recognized that those details should more appropriately be specified by local authorities with greater knowledge of local conditions.third,the legislature made express provision for this element of local regulation the gist of these conclusions is the legislature considered opinion that there was no need for statewide uniformity which outweighed the advantages of local governments retaining the power to handle problems peculiar to their communities.we do not believe that the waste management act represents a fundamental change in the legislature traditional outlook towards the subject of waste handling.public resources code section well as the entire scope of the the legislature awareness that substantial geographic,economic,ecological or other distinctions are persuasive of the need for local control and thus precludes the subject from being comprehensively dealt with at the state level.citation.beyond question,the act not only anticipates and tolerates,but as a practical matter demands,supplementary local regulation to spell out the details of solid waste collection and disposal.this is convincing evidence that the state legislative scheme was not intended to occupy the field.citation.these factors demonstrate that there is no exclusive or even paramount state concern which requires disabling traditional local power in this area.waste resource technologies,supra,at,d.
this analysis is even more forceful when considered against the consequence of abrogation by section c of every vestige of local governmental power over refuse collection.authority over refuse has been treated as part of the police power that covers the plenum of authority to legislate for the general welfare of society.the police power is so important that it is deemed an inherent attribute of political sovereignty,munn illinois.in re rameriz cal,people sakai d.mcquillin,municipal corporations ed,see also mcquillan,municipal corporations,supra,matula superior court d,it is a duty of government to either collect the garbage or cause it to be collected.local authority over refuse is sufficiently entrenched that there can be no presumption that congress intended to disturb the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety.medtronic,lohr,supra,d accord,buckman plaintiffs legal committee,d hillsborough county automated medical,d jones rath packing,d.the logic of argument is that congress would have the sole and exclusive power to legislate on every aspect of the collection and disposal of refuse from pawtucket to pelican bay if it can be seen as property transported by a motor carrier.it would be striking for such a massive shift of power and authority to be accomplished by a fragment of a subdivision in an act devoted to a subject that has no obvious relation to that of refuse and does not even employ that term.it verges on the inconceivable that congress had such an intent there is nothing in the language or legislative history of section c giving the least credence to chip it claim that congress intended to make itself the sole authority in a field where local authority has been traditionally accepted as preeminent.
citing b,a provision of the environmental protection act,points to the federal government and unequivocal support for the development and maximization of recycling activities.that recycling is indeed a goal the national government has chosen to promote is not in doubt,but more useful analogues are the solid waste disposal act,as amended by the resource recovery act of,stat.as amended by,stat,codified at et.finding that the collection and disposal of solid wastes should continue to be primarily the function of state,regional,and local agencies a,congress established a collaborative effort between local and federal governments to handle the growing problem of solid waste collection and disposal.see id.a goals to be achieved by federal government providing technical and financial assistance to state and local governments for the development of solid waste management plans,a federal guidelines to be issued in cooperation with appropriate local governments,a epa administrator shall establish a program to assist small communities in planning and financing environmental facilities,epa administrator directed to furnish teams of personnel providing technical assistance on solid waste management to local governments,financial grants to states.this collaborative approach is similar to the structure of california waste management act discussed above.it is particularly germane to note that in the formulation of state or regional solid waste plans,congress acted to remove obstacles to contracts for processing solid waste,a,d.congress also provided for guidelines that would be mandatory for federal agencies but only recommended for the states.see d,b.it is scarcely creditable that by enacting the faa authorization act congress would overturn all of this carefully crafted handiwork without a mention.
the crucial point of argument is the premise that the materials it transports constitute property,a term that is not defined by the faa authorization act.is therefore forced to resort to decisions from the interstate commission icc case law,however,is equivocal.compare joray trucking,holding that debris from excavation and demolition sites is not property under the interstate commerce act,with transportation of waste prods.for reuse and recycling,distinguishing joray because recyclables,in contrast to the demolition debris,have been purchased and will not merely be discarded but,rather,will become vital elements in the manufacturing process in which they are to be utilized woodfeathers,washington county,supra.based on these decisions,as well as nuclear diagnostic laboratories,finding radioactive waste constituted property expends much effort in demonstrating that the materials it transports qualify as property and thus come within the preemptive ambit of section c according to the reasoning of is in effect arguing that considerable material that was formerly deemed refuse has value in this age of recycling and is therefore elevated to the status of property within the meaning of section c.there are a number of reasons this approach is unpersuasive.
first,among the icc decisions joray is most persuasive because it dealt with debris generated from excavations and demolition of buildings.the reasoning was that the debris,although it may ultimately serve a purpose in helping to fill wasteland,is not purchased from the contractors who desire its removal and to them it has a negative value as a commodity the contractors are not concerned with any beneficial ownership of the debris,they do not select the destination to which it is to be taken they may not even know where it will be taken,and it would appear that they relinquish any nominal ownership of the commodity at the time it is loaded and removed from the demolition or excavation site.thus,we are inclined to conclude that the commodity does not have the attributes commonly associated with the word property.joray trucking,supra.joray is directly relevant to business of collecting construction and demolition debris.
joray is clearly more useful as a precedent than nuclear diagnostic laboratories,where the icc concluded that radioactive waste material transported not for recycling but disposal constituted property.radioactive material is a unique substance,sui generis,generating safety issues found nowhere else.it is not surprising that it receives specialized treatment accorded to no other type of waste.for example,the interstate movements of radioactive waste were described as extremely few in number,whereas the intrastate transportation of construction debris is undoubtedly more common and frequent.we are therefore especially cautious in analogizing from the icc reasoning that the economic value of hazardous materials should not be the sole criterion for determining whether these commodities are property property connotes ownership as well as value.something that is owned can be property notwithstanding its lack of economic value.nuclear diagnostic,supra.if,as maintains,matter does not have to have value in order to constitute property within the meaning and scope of the faa authorization act,it would follow that virtually any tangible matter is property the transportation of which by a motor carrier is thus immune from regulation by any unit of government except congress.
transportation of waste products for reuse found the icc considering a new approach to streamlining our present motor carrier licensing procedures insofar as they relate to the transportation of waste materials for recycling or reuse the relevant portion of the decision reads the essential question is whether the commodities here to be transported are in fact property for purposes of our jurisdiction.the transportation of trash and garbage,which has no property value,solely for the purpose of disposal is not subject to economic regulation by this commission.joray trucking.on this premise,dissenting commissioners contend that the nature of the involved commodities has not been altered merely because they will be used in recycling and that the transportation of these commodities therefore should be exempt from economic regulation.the property value of the commodities is certainly altered,however,depending upon whether they are to be disposed of or recycled.in the first instance commodities possess only what might be termed a negative property value,while in the recycling process they have been purchased and will not merely be discarded but,rather,will become vital elements in the manufacturing process in which they are to be utilized.it is therefore plain,we think,that waste materials purchased for use in recycling programs,such as those conducted by manufacturers of glass containers and cans,assume all of the characteristics of property transportation of waste products for reuse,supra.the icc paid special attention to its definition of waste we are authorizing the transportation of waste products for recycling or reuse in furtherance of recognized pollution control programs.waste products shall include any product which has been or would ordinarily be discarded as worthless,defective,or of no use.citation.the key word in this definition is discarded.for if the product has not been or would not ordinarily be discarded,then it will not meet the criteria of being a waste product id.at.in a subsequent proceeding the icc stated that to the extent that these commodities can be recycled,they have taken on the characteristics of property,although their economic value is still relatively low.transportation of waste products for reuse.transportation of waste products does not assist.it repeatedly emphasized that recyclable material has value because it was purchased,while waste is implicitly discarded as worthless.the crucial definition of discarded material as waste having only negative property value accords with the definition of waste subsequently adopted by california and the understanding of president 
there is no need to undertake a definitive parsing of these icc decisions.it is immaterial whether congress was mistaken or erroneously advised that under icc case law,garbage and refuse are not considered property.conf,supra,cong.admin.news.the issue of whether what formerly collected qualifies as property becomes relevant only if the faa authorization act is applicable because it preempts local regulatory authority.what is material,and what is clear beyond any doubt,is congress intent that the faa authorization act would have no impact on garbage and refuse collectors.ibid.it is that intent which is the ultimate authority in matters of preemption.see medtronic,lohr,supra,d and authorities cited.because that intent is so unambiguously expressed,it trumps elaborate efforts to rework the concept of property,even as aided by the trial court decision.
if preemption argument were to prevail,this court would validate a tectonic shift in power from local government to congress.congress,and only congress,would have any legislative power over a subject historically left to the states and smaller units of government there is nothing in the plain language and legislative history giving any hint that congress had such an intent when it enacted the faa authorization act.the presumption against preemption of this area of traditional and preeminent local power has not been overcome,new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,supra,d medtronic,lohr,supra,d.we therefore hold that the faa authorization act,and specifically section c,has not displaced california firmly established regulatory authority over garbage,refuse,or solid waste 
the decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is committed to the discretion of the trial court after the court determines the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial,and the relative harms suffered by the parties,people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d,it county of imperial cal d.makes a number of claims as to why we should find that the court abused its discretion in making these determinations.the defeat of these claims will not require prolonged discussion.
the parties expend much attention to which of them is a better recycler and thus better situated to promote california recycling policy.we decline to enter into this dispute.the dispositive issue is not factual but legal.it is undisputed that the generators of the construction and demolition debris paid to remove that material from jobsites.under the waste management act that makes the materials discarded waste and therefore subject to pleasant hill exclusive franchises.pub.resources code,waste management of the desert,palm springs recycling center,supra,cal th,d.insofar as public policy is involved,the definitive answer has been provided by the legislature and our supreme court.it is particularly worthy of note that california definition of waste includes demolition and construction wastes.pub.resources code,subd.a.
to the extent emphasizes its modest size and staff as compared to pleasant hill and its corporate parent,this is not properly a part of the relative harms factor.with the validity of pleasant hill exclusive franchises established,the difficulties that might result to from continuing to violate those franchises is irrelevant.in any event,the situation establishes the other complete likelihood that pleasant hill will ultimately prevail on the merits of its claim.i f the party seeking the injunction can make a sufficiently strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits,the trial court has discretion to issue the injunction notwithstanding that party inability to show that the balance of harm tips in his favor.common cause board of supervisors cal d.
contends that the trial court order improperly redirects recyclable materials into landfill,thus violating public policy and exposing the city of antioch to substantial fines.the premise for this contention is a considerable misreading of the trial court injunction.nothing in the we quoted at length at the outset of this opinion directs recyclable materials into landfill all it does is prohibit from violating pleasant hill exclusive franchise.if the city of antioch does in the future face fines for any failure to implement the myriad provisions of the waste management act,that is the business of the city and state officials see pub.resources code,but it should play no part in this dispute between private parties.moreover,as shown above,there is considerable public policy supporting enforcement of pleasant hill franchises.
finally,there is claim that pleasant hill did not prove that it had enforc
