background 
factual background and prior proceedings 
when american military personnel serving abroad are relocated to the united states,the government makes arrangements for the shipping of their belongings.the government contracts for through transportation,which means that the belongings are transported under a single bill of lading from their point of origin to their final destination,although transportation along different segments of the route is often provided by different carriers using different modes of carriage.
appellants are engaged in the business of motor transportation within the philippines.as part of the through transportation of the belongings of american military personnel returning from the philippines,appellants trucked the belongings from subic bay naval base and clark air force base to a philippine seaport,where the belongings were loaded onto vessels bound for the united states.appellants were indicted on september,for violating section of the sherman act,by conspiring to fix prices.
appellant tucor industries,is a philippine corporation.pursuant to a plea agreement,tucor pleaded guilty to the sherman act charge and was fined.judgment was entered on june.in,tucor filed a petition for a writ of error coram nobis,seeking to have the judgment vacated.
appellants luzon moving and storage and moving and storage pamsc are philippine corporations.appellants george schulze,and george schulze,are officers and shareholders of luzon and pamsc.these appellants never appeared before the district court for arraignment,but in they made a special appearance in order to move to dismiss the indictment.
the district court granted the petition for writ of error coram nobis,vacated the judgment against tucor,and granted the motion to dismiss the indictment of luzon,pamsc,and the schulzes.united states tucor int l,d,tucor i,aff,cir.the court held that because appellants provided ground transportation solely within the philippines,those activities were immunized against antitrust liability by section a of the shipping act of.a providing that t he antitrust laws do not apply to any agreement or activity concerning the foreign inland segment of through transportation that is part of transportation provided in a united states import or export trade.id.at.we affirmed.united states tucor int l,cir tucor ii.
both in the district court and on appeal,the government argued unsuccessfully that the shipping act antitrust immunities did not apply to appellants because the immunities should be limited to entities that are ocean common carriers,as that term is defined in section of the shipping act,app.appellants are concededly not ocean common carriers,but both tucor i and tucor ii held that the relevant exemption is not limited to ocean common carriers.
appellants next brought a motion in the district court for attorney fees and costs under the hyde amendment,which provides that a court may award fees and costs to a prevailing criminal defendant if the court finds that the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,unless the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust.historical and statutory notes.the district court denied the motion,finding both that the government had a but erroneous belief in the correctness of its interpretation of the shipping act and that the government interpretation was not so clearly contrary to the statutory language as to render the prosecution vexatious or frivolous.this timely appeal followed.
b.the greek case 
some of appellants arguments are based on what they refer to as the greek case,a separate antitrust investigation that was taking place at the same time that appellants were being prosecuted.when hellenikon air force base in greece was closed in,the government arranged for through transportation of the belongings of returning hellenikon personnel,just as it did for personnel returning from the philippines.the department of justice conducted an investigation of potential antitrust violations in greece that paralleled those alleged in appellants among carriers handling the foreign inland segment of through transportation.on february,warren dean,an attorney for one of the greek inland carriers under investigation,met with counsel for the government and argued that section immunized his client activities against antitrust liability.dean provided the government with a written analysis to the same effect on february.
the department of justice was thus made aware of the relevance of the shipping act antitrust exemptions four months before tucor plea hearing,but it did not disclose the potential applicability of those provisions to the district court or to tucor.on december,the government decided not to prosecute the greek carriers.appellants infer from this that the government agreed with dean interpretation of the shipping act,recognized that the greek carriers were immune,and thus also recognized that appellants were immune.in tucor i,the district court largely rejected these arguments,finding that the government had not concluded at the time of tucor plea that section a immunized tucor from prosecution,that tucor had failed to prove selective prosecution,but that the government had probably violated its duty of candor to the court by failing to bring the immunity provisions to the court attention.tucor i,d at.
ii.standard of review 
a district court denial of a motion for attorney fees under the hyde amendment is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states lindberg,cir.under that standard,this court can not reverse unless it has a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.id.the district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,koon united states,d,or bases its conclusion on a clearly erroneous finding of fact,paradis arave,cir.
iii.discussion 
to a large extent,appellants arguments hinge on the reasonableness of the government theory that the shipping act antitrust immunity provisions do not apply to appellants.appellants also contend that that theory contradicts the position successfully advocated by the government in an earlier case,transpacific westbound rate agreement federal maritime commission,cir,thus conflicting with both binding precedent and the government prior interpretation of the act.we analyze these broad issues first,before turning to appellants other,narrower arguments.
a.the shipping act and appellee interpretation of the antitrust immunities 
section of the shipping act defines common carrier as follows 
c ommon carrier means a person holding itself out to the general public to provide transportation by water of passengers or cargo between the united states and a foreign country for compensation that 
a assumes responsibility for the transportation from the port or point of receipt to the port or point of destination,and 
b utilizes,for all or part of that transportation,a vessel operating on the high seas or the great lakes between a port in the united states and a port in a foreign country 
person is defined to include individuals,corporations,partnerships,and other associations recognized by law.id.an ocean common carrier is defined as a common carrier.id.
section of the act,entitled agreements within scope of chapter,provides that the act applies to agreements by or among ocean common carriers regarding certain specified activities,and also to a narrower range of agreements among marine terminal operators.id.a,b.section then provides that a true copy of any agreement covered by section must be filed with the federal maritime commission fmc,but section also creates an exception to the filing requirement for agreements related to transportation to be performed within or between foreign countries and agreements among common carriers to establish,operate,or maintain a marine terminal in the united states.id.a.
section then lists certain agreements and activities to which t he antitrust laws do not apply.id.a.in particular,sections a and a essentially immunize all agreements filed under section.id.a.section a,which in tucor ii was held to apply to appellants conduct,immunizes any agreement or activity concerning the foreign inland segment of through transportation that is part of transportation provided in a united states import or export trade.id.a.section a does not make any explicit reference to common carriers or to ocean common carriers.also,it deals only with transportation the foreign inland segment of through transportation,whereas the act defines common carrier in terms of transportation between the united states and a foreign country.
these considerations tend to make the government position in tucor i and tucor ii,namely,that the grant of immunity in section a applies only to ocean common carriers,look unreasonable.but the government position gains at least some measure of reasonableness when it is understood in terms of the following general underlying premise according to the government,the antitrust immunities granted by the shipping act were intended to be limited to the entities,activities,and agreements that are brought within the fmc regulatory jurisdiction by the act.in essence,the point of section a,according to the government,is to immunize agreements and consequent activities that are within the scope of the act under section but that fall within section a exception for agreements among ocean common carriers.because such agreements are not required to be filed under section a,they are not immunized by sections a and a.the purpose of section a,according to the government,is to fill part of that gap,but as a result it is limited to agreements and consequent activities among ocean common carriers.
these considerations do not,of course,entirely resolve the tensions between the statutory text and the position that the government advocated,and its interpretation of section a was ultimately rejected by this court in tucor ii.but placed in the context of the government understanding of the interplay between the regulatory scope of the shipping act and the antitrust immunities that the act provides,the government interpretation of section a does not seem nearly as contrary to the plain meaning of the statute as it might appear on first look.other than repeatedly asserting that the government position is obviously at odds with the statutory text,appellants have presented no arguments to show that the district court abused its discretion in finding that that position was not so obviously wrong as to be frivolous.
transpacific 
in,the fmc proposed a rule that would have allowed voluntary filing of agreements that are not subject to the filing requirement of section a.fed.reg.proposed.under the proposed rule,such voluntarily filed agreements would thereby be brought within the section a antitrust immunity for filed agreements.id.
after receiving comments from various parties,including vigorous opposition from the department of justice,the fmc withdrew the proposed rule.the fmc reasoned that an entity is a common carrier only insofar as it provides transportation services between the united states and a foreign such a carrier provides transportation services,it does not,as regards those services,qualify as a common carrier under the act.thus,agreements concerning transportation are not agreements within the scope of the act under section,because they are not agreements among common carriers,for purposes of those agreements,the parties are not acting as common carriers.see transpacific,at.on this basis,the fmc issued an order in which it held that it had jurisdiction only over agreements concerning transportation between the united states and a foreign country.the order rejected the concept of voluntary filing and stated that an agreement that concerned both regulated and unregulated activity a mixed agreement could no longer be filed in its entirety.thus,only those portions of a mixed agreement that concerned united transportation could be filed and thereby brought within the antitrust immunity provisions of section a.see transpacific,at.
the transpacific westbound rate agreement,an association of ocean common carriers,challenged the fmc order.transpacific argued that the fmc did have jurisdiction over the portions of mixed agreements and,in the alternative,defended the concept of voluntary filing.transpacific,at.the department of justice and the fmc jointly filed a brief in support of the order.this court found no error in the fmc interpretation of the shipping act and upheld the fmc order.transpacific,at.
appellants now argue that the government position in transpacific conflicts with the government position in the tucor prosecution,for the following reasons in transpacific,the government defended the fmc position that an entity qualifies as a common carrier only insofar as it engages in united transportation.section a,the antitrust immunity provision at issue in the tucor prosecution,concerns only transportation.therefore,under the reasoning successfully advocated by the government in transpacific,section a can not apply to common carriers.but the government contended throughout the tucor prosecution that section a applies to common carriers and to no one else.
this argument amounts to nothing more than a terminological confusion.the government position in the tucor prosecution was that the immunity provisions in section apply only to entities that engage in some common carrier activity,that is,to entities that do qualify as common carriers for at least some of the transportation services that they provide.on this reading,section a immunizes any agreements among such entities that concern transportation.it is true that,under the reasoning of transpacific,those entities are not common carriers for purposes of those agreements.but the government position in the tucor prosecution was simply that those entities would not be eligible for the section a immunity if they were not common carriers for purposes of some other transportation services that they provide.
there is no substantive conflict between that position and the position successfully advocated by the government in transpacific.at most,appellants argument shows that the government should have used the term common carrier more carefully in describing its position in the tucor prosecution.instead of saying that section a applies only to ocean common carriers,the government should have said that section a applies only to entities that engage in some activity that qualifies them as ocean common carriers with respect to that activity,although the activity that makes them ocean common carriers is not itself immunized by section a.
moreover,some of the reasoning of transpacific actually supports the underlying premise of the government position in the tucor prosecution,namely,that the scope of the antitrust immunities granted by the act should be tied to the regulatory jurisdiction conferred on the fmc by the act.in transpacific,we reasoned that because the act describes the fmc regulatory powers as limited to common carriers,it is unlikely that the act was meant to confer antitrust immunity on any entities that are not common carriers.see at.it does not seem logical that congress intended to confer antitrust immunity on parties largely outside of the regulatory power of the fmc id.in this way,the reasoning of transpacific actually embraces,rather than conflicts with,the position advocated by the government in the tucor prosecution.transpacific thus makes the government position in the tucor prosecution look more plausible than it otherwise would it does not undermine it.
for all of these reasons,we reject appellants argument that the government position in the tucor prosecution was contrary to the position successfully advocated by the government in transpacific.
