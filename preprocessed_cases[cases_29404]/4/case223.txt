this is a companion case to city of charleston,south carolina,a municipal corporation v.a fisherman best,incorporated afb of charleston,incorporated ivan miller and the fishing vessel tri liner,cir pending in this court.the two cases are decided concurrently.
this case arose from sharp differences in the city of charleston,south carolina concerning commercial longline fishing and access to the city new maritime center by vessels engaged in that method of fishing the city leased the center to the charleston county park and recreational commission prc for it to manage.in april prc circulated a request for proposals from entities that might wish to operate the new maritime center,which had been built by the city to serve commercial fishing vessels.prc selected the afb group consisting of a fisherman best,incorporated afb of charleston,incorporated and low country lobsters,limited.prc issued a letter of intent to award a contract to afb.afb proposed to serve vessels engaged in longline fishing,along with other vessels.longlining is bitterly opposed by recreational and sportsfishermen and some environmental groups.a public outcry arose against selection of afb.
recreational fishing alliance rfa is a national organization whose stated purpose is rebuilding and preserving fisheries in the united states.it seeks to politically organize saltwater anglers and to safeguard their rights,protect jobs in the marine boat and tackle industry,and ensure the sustainability of our nation saltwater fisheries.it is aligned in principle to sports and recreational fishing and generally opposed to commercial fishing,and it seeks to end longline fishing as an acceptable method of commercial fishing.
the chp group is composed of persons who wanted their group selected as operator of the maritime center,but their response to the request for proposals was rejected as untimely.there is evidence that they requested rfa to ask the mayor to accept their proposal.a mass meeting of sportsfishermen opposing use of the center by longliners took place in charleston.rfa sent representatives to charleston and became involved in the public controversy for two or more months.it wrote letters,contacted local officials and raised public consciousness.at a public forum held by prc the president of rfa denounced longline fishing.prc issued a letter of intent announcing that afb had been selected as operator for the maritime center.apparently there were discussions between the city and prc,and arrangements between prc and afb were cancelled.afb asserts that a contract had been made,but no document had been signed and the city says no agreement had been reached.
prc circulated a second request for proposals.afb and chp responded and again afb was selected.the public outcry resumed,and rfa and others,including chp,planned a rally against longline fishing vessels and their potential use of the center.announcements were made by mail,newspapers,and over radio,and persons were urged to protest to the mayor against alleged use of city tax funds to bring fishing vessels to south carolina waters.in late july the mayor held a meeting in his office,and one or more representatives of rfa were included.the following day the mayor announced that he had come to better understand the issues,that he was changing his position,and that he would support recreational fishermen in the controversy.
the afb group,joined by longline fishermen and their vessels,filed this suit in the united states district court against rfa and chp.plaintiffs alleged conspiracy between rfa and chp,restraint of trade,and interference with competition in violation of the sherman act,and of the south carolina code of laws.they also alleged related state law claims of interference with a contract or a prospective contract and for defamation 
prc second selection of afb was terminated,and the city took over operation of the center.an operator was selected by the city,and the center was opened.several months later the city adopted a resolution barring from the center longline vessels,longline tackle,and swordfish.it then brought in south carolina state court a suit against the afb group,seeking a judgment declaring that its resolution and the operation of the center pursuant to the resolution were constitutional and violated no federal or state law.the case was removed to the district court for the district of south carolina,and the court granted summary judgment to the city.that decision has been appealed to this court,and contemporaneously with the decision of the present case it is reversed for lack of federal jurisdiction.city of charleston,south carolina,mun.v.a fisherman best,afb of charleston,ivan miller and the fishing vessel,cir.
in the instant case claims against all defendants other than rfa were dismissed by plaintiffs.the district court granted summary judgment to rfa on all claims.it held that rfa was exempt from liability under the doctrine.see eastern president conference noerr motor freight,d united mine workers of am.pennington,d.with regard to intentional interference with prospective contractual relations the court,construing the facts favorably to plaintiffs,found that,rfa purpose was to exercise first amendment rights to petition the city government not to allow longliners at the center,and that,if there was any interference with a contract,it was a of the exercise of the first amendment,and,even if there was intentional interference it was not done for an improper purpose.the conspiracy claim was rejected because there was no evidence that rfa had an improper purpose.
the defamation claim was based upon a statement made in ads and mail outs that the city was bringing a big longline fishing fleet from florida,and alleged implications that new boats would be docking at the center,that the city was somehow subsidizing plaintiffs,and that the plaintiffs were destroying resources.the court found that the statements and implications were not defamatory.moreover,it found that,regardless of who had the burden of proving falsity or truthfulness,the indisputable facts showed the statements and implications to be true.
antitrust claims

the district court found that no party had addressed the question of whether plaintiffs had established a violation of antitrust law.rather,for purposes of summary judgment,plaintiffs had assumed that this issue was not disputed and that the question for decision was whether rfa was exempt from antitrust liability.the court proceeded accordingly and held that rfa was exempt under the doctrine.that doctrine states that horizontal competitors may join together to lobby government because antitrust violations can not be predicated on attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws.the first amendment shields such joint lobbying effort from antitrust liability even when the competitors are seeking governmental action that would eliminate competition or exclude competitors.see professional real estate investors,columbia pictures,d.the underpinning of noerr and its progeny is that congress did not intend to subject to antitrust liability actions that had the immediate purpose of influencing legitimate governmental decisionmaking processes.the doctrine provides immunity to those who petition the government for redress.id.the court found that rfa was not a competitor of afb in the fishing industry and it found that rfa actions were simply attempts to solicit governmental action to keep longline fishing vessels from using the maritime center and to avoid additional fishing by out of state vessels off the coast of charleston.rfa actions,therefore,were protected by noerr.
the record reveals that initially the mayor of charleston knew nothing about longline fishing or about the controversy between sportsfishermen and longliners,and he favored afb to be the operator of the maritime center.in a statement on july,he acknowledged that he had changed his mind.he explained that he had learned of the effects of longlining on stocks of fish,of the interests of sportsfishermen,and of the perception of citizens that governmental efforts at managing fisheries were not successful.he spoke of his fears of possible harm to the city aquarium,which was close to the docks,and to the city interests in tourism.he described community opinion as opposed to longliners docking at the center and told of adverse community responses and of pressures upon him reflecting that view.thereafter the city cancelled its lease to prc,took over operation of the center,and later adopted a resolution banning pelagic longline vessels of any kind from docking,landing,unloading,or processing their catch at the maritime center.
the court found that rfa was opposed to longline fishing in general and hoped to eliminate it,and was concerned with the possibility of additional fishing by vessels in the waters off charleston,which are a nursery for spawning swordfish.the court found that no evidence supported plaintiffs argument that rfa sought to have only afb,not longliners in general,banned from the maritime center and no evidence that rfa was engaged in a smear campaign against afb.
a director of rfa had written to the mayor suggesting that he support chp proposal and thanking him for challenging the initial selection of afb.the court found this was not shown to be anything other than part of rfa lobbying against longline fishing,and that from a later letter it was clear that rfa supported chp proposal only because it did not include longline fishing vessels.
in this court the plaintiffs contend that noerr does not apply at all to this case because t he case has nothing to do with fishing,but everything to do with acquiring real estate,the maritime center.this is a mischaracterization that the record does not support.they make a related argument that noerr does not apply because the city did not act as a government in leasing the center but as a commercial enterprise.the city responded to a public need related to a struggling industry,and,using public funds,built a municipal facility.it found itself involved in a public controversy in the community it served concerning who would operate the facility.it addressed the problem.this is not a commercial activity that had a political impact,but a firestorm in which competitive bidding was only incident.see allied tube conduit,indian head,d.
the district court applied proper summary judgment standards.evidence should be viewed in the light most favorable to the party,perini perini,cir.the court must find that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.if no material factual disputes remain,summary judgment should be granted against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case and on which the party bears the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.when the record taken as whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party,disposition by summary judgment is appropriate.teamsters joint council centra,cir.applying these principles,the court held that the doctrine clearly applied because the actions of rfa were simply attempts to solicit government action to keep longline vessels from using a facility built with taxpayer dollars and to avoid additional fishing efforts off the coast by vessels,and that rfa was petitioning the government for redress and therefore was immune from antitrust liability.
ii.alleged exceptions to 
not every concerted effort to influence government action is immune under.the scope of this immunity depends on the source,context,and nature of the anticompetitive restraint at issue.see allied tube conduit indian head,d.unethical and deceptive practices can constitute abuses of administrative or judicial process that may result in antitrust violations.id.at.
afb contends that,even if noerr is generally applicable,rfa lobbying campaign is not protected from antitrust liability because it falls under one of the exceptions to noerr the sham exception that rfa acted in bad faith,misrepresented information,made improper threats,and used other coercive means intended to corrupt the political or administrative processes and that this case involved a commercial bid proposal.
a.the sham exception 
noerr immunity does not apply to petitions or lawsuits that are a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.eastern presidents conference noerr motor freight,d defining the sham exception.under the noerr doctrine filing a lawsuit or seeking other government action can violate antitrust laws when it is a sham.a classic example of a sham is the filing of frivolous objections to the license application of a competitor,with no expectation of achieving denial of the license but simply in order to impose expense and delay.see city of columbia omni outdoor,d.
the essential element of the sham exception is intent to injure a competitor coupled with the absence of a genuine effort to influence the government.e vidence of anticompetitive intent or purpose alone can not transform otherwise legitimate activity into a sham.professional real estate investors columbia pictures,d.the existence of probable cause to institute legal or administrative action precludes a finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation.id.at.the necessary probable cause requires no more than a reasonable belief that there is a chance that a claim may be held valid upon adjudication.id.
rfa lobbying effort was successful.a successful effort to influence governmental action certainly can not be characterized as a sham.professional real estate,at.citing allied tube conduit indian head,d.see also eden hannon sumitomo trust banking,cir holding that a litigant who successfully persuades a neutral judge or jury that it is entitled to legal relief from the conduct of another based upon the law and facts can not be sued under the sham exception to.
a test for sham exceptions was announced in professional real estate.the supreme court explained 
first,the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.if an objective litigant could conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome,the suit is immunized under noerr,and an antitrust claim premised on the sham exception must fail.only if challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the litigant subjective motivation.under the second part of our definition of sham,the court should focus on whether the baseless lawsuit conceals an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor,noerr,supra,at,through the use of the governmental opposed to the outcome of that an anticompetitive weapon.omni,at.this process requires the plaintiff to disprove the challenged lawsuit legal viability before the court will entertain evidence of the suit economic viability.

afb analysis does not satisfy the first step of the professional real estate test.afb did not present sufficient evidence to show that rfa attempt to change the city longlining policy for the maritime center was objectively baseless.rfa engaged in lobbying,using media and political channels to sway public opinion against longlining because of the effect that it perceived longliners would have on atlantic fisheries.rfa could reasonably expect to succeed,and it did so.its lobbying campaign was a success.it successfully educated local government officials concerning its views and helped to obtain a favorable governmental policy barring longline fishing vessels f
