surgical care center contends that north oaks medical center,a public hospital,has violated the sherman antitrust act and louisiana statutes governing monopolies and unfair trade practices.the district court conducted a bench trial and entered judgment for north oaks.we find neither clear error in the fact findings nor any errors of law on the issues tried by the court.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
background 
surgical care center of hammond is a limited liability company doing business as luke surgicenter,an outpatient surgery clinic that opened in in hammond,louisiana.the hospital service district of tangipahoa parish is a political subdivision of the state of louisiana that operates north oaks medical center,the largest hospital in the hammond area.north oaks offers a full range of inpatient and outpatient services,including outpatient surgery.quorum health resources,manages the north oaks facilities.
luke brought this action against north oaks and quorum,alleging that their trade practices violated the sherman act,the louisiana monopolies act.ann.and the louisiana unfair trade practice and consumer protection act.ann.
luke contends that north oaks is attempting to monopolize the outpatient surgery market by exploiting its market power over inpatient care and,more specifically,by pressuring managed care companies to use north oaks exclusively for both inpatient and outpatient care according to luke,these exclusive agreements and the tying of inpatient and outpatient care are violations of both federal and state antitrust laws.luke also alleges that north oaks refused to sign a patient transfer agreement with luke,refused to sign a blood type and cross match agreement,refused to lend medical equipment to luke,and engaged in various unfair employment practices.
after the issue of state action immunity was resolved the district court tried the case and entered judgment for the defendants on all claims.the district court concluded,first,that luke did not prove attempted monopolization of outpatient surgery under of the sherman act according to the district court,luke evidence established neither predatory conduct by north oaks nor a dangerous probability that north oaks would achieve monopoly power in the outpatient surgery market.second,the district court ruled that luke could not prevail on its conspiracy claim under of the sherman act because north oaks and quorum qua principal and agent are incapable of conspiring with one another to violate antitrust laws.finally,the district court ruled that north oaks was entitled to discretionary act immunity shielding it from liability under both the louisiana monopolies act and the louisiana unfair trade practices act.the district court did not address luke claims under of the sherman act because,prior to trial,the court ruled that luke complaint had not included claims and then denied luke request to amend its complaint.luke now appeals.
ii.discussion 
attempted monopolization 
to prevail on its attempted monopolization claim under,luke had to prove that north oaks engaged in predatory or exclusionary conduct with a specific intent to monopolize the relevant outpatient surgery market and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.spectrum sports,mcquillan,d.the district court found,first,that the business practices of which luke complained all had a legitimate business justification and thus could not be deemed predatory or exclusionary under taylor publishing jostens,cir.alternatively,the district court ruled that luke had not shown a dangerous probability that north oaks would achieve monopoly power in the outpatient surgery market.we review legal questions de novo but will set aside the district court findings of fact only if clearly erroneous.a.
we need address only the third element the probability of achieving monopoly power.luke bases its attempted monopolization claim on north oaks contracts with managed care providers.essentially,if a managed care provider agreed to use north oaks for outpatient surgical services,then north oaks would offer substantial discounts on prices for inpatient care.luke alleged that north oaks,by entering into these exclusive agreements,used or leveraged its dominant market power in the inpatient hospital services market in an attempt to gain similar market power in the outpatient surgical services market.this court has not ruled on monopolistic leveraging as a distinct offense,and we do not do so here.see eleven line,north texas state soccer,cir areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law ed.supp.but like the district court,we find that luke claim of monopolistic leveraging fails on its own terms.
the district court noted that any theory of monopolistic leveraging first depends on proof that the defendant possesses market power in a relevant market,power that it then extends into the plaintiff market.this inquiry,in turn,requires a clear definition of the relevant geographic market.see,dimmitt agri,cpc int l,cir.as we have held,
to establish section violations premised on attempt and conspiracy to monopolize,a plaintiff must define the relevant market critically,evidence must be offered demonstrating not just where consumers currently purchase the product,but where consumers could turn for alternative products or sources of the product if a competitor raises prices.the possibilities for substitution must be considered.

nevertheless,luke expert did not attempt to identify the hospitals or clinics that may be deemed competitors of north oaks.he relied solely on what he defined as north oaks service area to compose the geographic market.absent a showing of where people could practicably go for inpatient services,luke failed to meet its burden of presenting sufficient evidence to define the relevant geographic market.without a proper market definition,luke could not establish the predicate of a monopolistic leveraging claim,market power in the market for inpatient hospital services,and thus could not show a dangerous probability that north oaks would gain monopoly power in the outpatient surgery market.the district court,after carefully analyzing the reports presented by experts for both luke and north oaks,found that luke had not adduced sufficient evidence to delineate the relevant geographic market.
luke counters that a detailed analysis of the relevant geographic market is not necessary under federal trade comm indiana fed of dentists,d.to prevail on this argument,luke would have to persuade this court that,even if indiana federation is applicable to cases involving vertical restraints,the district court clearly erred when it did not find actual,sustained adverse effects on competition,at.at.luke has failed to do this.
we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing luke claims of attempted monopolization because luke failed to meet its burden of presenting sufficient evidence to define the geographic market 
conspiracy to monopolize 
luke contends that north oaks and quorum the company that manages north oaks conspired to monopolize the outpatient surgical market.see stewart glass mirror,auto glass discount centers,cir listing the elements of a conspiracy claim under.
the district court dismissed the conspiracy claim because as a matter of law,a corporation and its agent,north oaks and quorum are incapable of conspiring with one another to violate the antitrust laws.this general rule is correct,and none of the recognized exceptions applies to this case.see,siegel transfer,carrier express,cir the district court did not err in dismissing luke conspiracy claim under of the sherman act.
tying and exclusive contracts 
luke alleged in its complaint that north oaks had illegally tied its outpatient ser
