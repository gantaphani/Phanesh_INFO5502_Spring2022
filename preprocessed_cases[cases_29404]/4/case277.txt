this petition for a writ of mandamus arises from the proceedings in united states arctic glacier int l.in that case,arctic glacier international was charged in a criminal information with violating by participating in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition by allocating customers in southeastern michigan and the detroit,michigan metropolitan area.tr.at petitioner martin mcnulty seeks a writ of mandamus to enforce his rights as a victim of this conspiracy under the crime victims rights act cvra.for the reasons set forth below,we deny the petition for mandamus relief.
arctic glacier international,the subsidiary of arctic glacier,which is the subsidiary of the arctic glacier income fund collectively referred to as arctic glacier,produces packaged ice and sells packaged ice in canada and certain regions of the united states.arctic glacier has admitted to a felony offense of participating in a conspiracy to allocate customers of packaged ice sold in southeastern michigan and the detroit,michigan area beginning january,and continuing through at least july.arctic glacier stated that it engaged in discussions and meetings with representatives of other producers and agreed to allocate customers in those areas.according to the plea agreement that arctic glacier has reached with the government,sales of packaged ice affected by the conspiracy totaled million.
according to his testimony before the district court,martin mcnulty was an executive for party time ice,which was acquired by arctic glacier in december of tr.at.he alleges that,while working at party time,as early as,he was told about the conspiracy to allocate customers.id.he alleges that party time executive chuck knowlton informed him about the conspiracy and informed him that if mcnulty were to leave party time,he could have been boycotted from employment anywhere in the packaged ice industry.id.at.after party time was acquired by arctic glacier,mcnulty alleges that he was instructed by arctic glacier executive keith corbin to participate in the customer allocation conspiracy and that corbin threatened to arrange a boycott by the industry if mcnulty refused to do so.id.mcnulty alleges that he refused to do so and expressed his opposition to the conspiracy.he alleges that arctic glacier fired him as a result of his refusal to participate in the conspiracy.id.following his termination from arctic glacier,mcnulty signed an agreement with arctic glacier,titled full and final receipt,release,discharge and agreement.in addition to containing a clause,the agreement provides that in consideration of a severance payment,mcnulty agreed not to sue arctic glacier or its employees with respect to any claims that he had prior to or as of the time that he signed the release.
shortly after his termination in late january,mcnulty contacted the government and served as an informant in the subsequent antitrust investigation of arctic glacier id.
he alleges that,later in,after the clause expired,he began applying to other companies,but that he was unable to find employment with any company.id.at.he asserts that two individuals told him that he would not be able to obtain employment in the industry until he stopped cooperating with the government.id.he alleges that,as a result of this blackball ing,his earnings have been substantially reduced,his house has been foreclosed upon,his credit scores have fallen,he has been unemployed for extended periods of time,and he remains unemployed.
in a related pending action,on july,mcnulty filed a civil complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan against three producers of packaged ice,including arctic glacier,and several of their executives.mcnulty reddy ice holdings,slip copy,wl.may.the court succinctly described mcnulty claims as plaintiff was terminated for refusing to participate in the alleged unlawful collusion and defendants conspired against plaintiff and effectively blackballed him from the packaged ice industry.id.at overruled on other grounds by mcnulty reddy ice holdings,et.slip copy,wl.july.in that litigation,arctic glacier has asserted that the decision to terminate mcnulty was made as a result of the restructuring of the corporate marketing department,and has denied that its decision resulted from any market allocation scheme.id.quoting january,termination confirmation letter to mcnulty.
on september,the united states filed a sealed information charging arctic glacier with a conspiracy to allocate customers in southeastern michigan and the detroit,michigan metropolitan area.on october,the united states filed a plea agreement pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c c in which arctic glacier agreed to plead guilty to the above charge,the parties agreed to recommend a fine of million,and the government agreed not to seek a restitution order.
the government informed mcnulty,who had served as an informant during the assembly of the case,that he could request restitution through the probation officer.as per the probation officer instructions,mcnulty sent a letter and accompanying declaration to the probation officer on january,requesting million in restitution and that he be recognized as a victim of arctic glacier pursuant to the cvra.those documents were provided to the district court.
on february,judge weber held a sentencing hearing at which mcnulty moved for restitution pursuant to the cvra and stated the basis for his claims.the district court noted that martin mcnulty,a former employee of arctic glacier international,claims he is a victim because he refused to participate in the allocation conspiracy and was fired and blackballed in the ice business.tr.at.the district court held that 
the court determines the victims of the offense in this case were the customers mcnulty was an employee of defendant,not a customer.there is no evidence he was directly or proximately harmed by the conspiracy.the cou n t of conviction is a violation of of united states code,section,which is not a listed offense under united states code,section a a.he is not a victim of the offense charged in this case.
tr.at.judge weber imposed a million fine and a term of probation.he has delayed entering the final judgment and conviction pending resolution of outstanding petitions regarding claims for victim status under the cvra 
on february,mcnulty brought this petition for mandamus relief from the district court february,denial of his request for victim status under the cvra.
if the district court in a criminal proceeding denies relief sought under the cvra,the movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.d.the court of appeals shall take up and decide such application forthwith within after the petition has been filed.id.as we held recently in a case arising out of the same criminal case,
the plain language of the statute compels application of the normal mandamus standards.the issuance of a writ of mandamus is relief that is governed by standards.the use of that specific term in the statute,in conjunction with the truncated period in which the court of appeals is to review such a petition and act upon it,convinces us that those usual standards apply here.

however,a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that we will not issue absent a compelling justification.in re prof ls direct ins,cir.traditionally,writs of mandamus were used only to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.in re life investors ins.of,cir quoting kerr dist.court for the dist.of,d.thus,only exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power,or a clear abuse of discretion,will justify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy.cheney dist.court for dist.of columbia,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.and,because mandamus is a discretionary remedy,a court may decline to issue the writ if it finds that it would not be appropriate under the circumstances even if the petitioner has shown he is clear ly and indisputabl y entitled to it.id.at.
