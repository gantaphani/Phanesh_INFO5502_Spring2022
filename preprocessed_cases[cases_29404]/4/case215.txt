tomi bryan filed in north carolina state court a putative class action against bellsouth communications.after bellsouth removed the action to federal court,the district court rejected three of bryan claims on the merits,declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claim,and remanded that claim to state court.on appeal,we held that the remanded claim was a federal claim that should have been dismissed on the merits as well.see bryan bellsouth commc ns,cir bryan i.pursuant to our remand,the district court dismissed that claim and entered judgment for bellsouth.bellsouth then filed a motion in state court,arguing that the federal court dismissal of the claim was entitled to res judicata effect and that the state court should dismiss bryan action.when the state court denied bellsouth motion,bellsouth returned to federal court seeking an injunction of the action.the district court granted bellsouth request and issued an order enjoining further proceedings in state court.bryan now appeals,arguing that the injunction violated the act.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
interstate telecommunication providers are required by law to contribute a portion of their revenues to the federal universal service fund usf to ensure affordable telecommunications services to rural and areas,schools,hospitals,and the like.bryan i,at.bellsouth recovers its usf contribution from its customers by way of a line item on each bill for a federal universal service charge fusc.bellsouth fusc is established in the tariff that it is required to file with the fcc.before april,when the fcc prohibited the practice,bellsouth and other telecommunications carriers charged its customers more than their proportional share of bellsouth usf contribution.see id.at.
bryan initiated a putative class action against bellsouth in north carolina state court.bryan alleged that bellsouth fusc was excessive and that bellsouth violated north carolina unfair trade practices act by not disclosing to its customers certain information about the fusc.bellsouth removed the action to federal court,arguing that bryan claims amounted to challenges to bellsouth tariff and were therefore federal claims.bryan thereafter filed a first amended complaint in federal court.the complaint alleged that bellsouth imposed an fusc that exceeded its required contribution to the usf,that bellsouth did not disclose how it calculated the fusc,and that bellsouth use of the term federal universal service charge was misleading.
bryan filed a motion to remand the complaint to state court,and bellsouth filed a rule b motion to dismiss.bellsouth argued that all of bryan claims were barred by the doctrine in that they challenged bellsouth filed tariff.see,american.central office,d explaining that under the filed rate doctrine,the rate of the carrier duly filed is the only lawful charge.deviation from it is not permitted upon any pretext.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court concluded that removal was proper because bryan presented a federal question by directly challenging the terms of a tariff in her allegations that bellsouth fusc was excessive.the district court then concluded that two of the three claims asserted in bryan complaint must be dismissed under the doctrine,because those claims would have the effect of altering the rates set forth in bellsouth tariff.the district court concluded that the remaining count,count a,was simply a unfair trade practices claim.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that claim and remanded it to state court.bellsouth appealed the district court refusal to dismiss count a under the doctrine bryan did not appeal the dismissal of the other counts.
on appeal,this court concluded that count a also presented a federal question by challenging the tariff.because the claim challenged the tariff,we concluded that count a should have been dismissed under the doctrine.we therefore vacated the district court remand order and directed the district court to dismiss count see bryan i,at.bryan petitioned the supreme court for a writ of certiorari,which the court denied.see bryan bellsouth,d.on remand,the district court denied bryan motion to file an amended complaint and dismissed count a,entering final judgment in favor of bellsouth.
while bellsouth appeal was pending,count a,which had been remanded to state court by the district court,was proceeding in state court the parties engaged in various proceedings,bryan filed an amended complaint,and the north carolina trial court eventually certified a class of bellsouth customers.the parties thereafter agreed to stay the action.
after the supreme court denied bryan petition for certiorari in bryan i,bellsouth filed a motion in state court seeking dismissal of bryan action.bellsouth argued that when this court vacated the district court remand order,that rendered the remand order a nullity and deprived the state court of jurisdiction over the case.bellsouth also contended that the action should be dismissed on res judicata grounds and by virtue of the filed rate doctrine.the north carolina court denied the motion to dismiss.bellsouth then returned to federal court seeking an injunction of the proceedings under the all writs act.see a west.
the district court granted bellsouth request for an injunction.the court concluded that our prior decision vacating its remand order rendered the remand order a nullity and deprived the state court of jurisdiction over the case.because the state court had no jurisdiction over the claim,the district court concluded that it was proper to issue an injunction barring further action on the case.it is from that order that bryan now appeals.
bryan first contends that the injunction must be vacated because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.she claims that when the district court after the first appeal dismissed count a with prejudice,the case was closed,and nothing remained over which the district court could exercise jurisdiction.because the all writs act does not confer an independent basis for the court to exercise jurisdiction,bryan contends that jurisdiction was lacking.we disagree.
as a general rule,courts have jurisdiction to enforce their own judgments.see marino pioneer edsel sales,cir.the district court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction when it issued the order finally dismissing count a,and the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce that judgment.see in re mooney,cir n o independent basis of jurisdiction is required for a federal court to entertain an application to enjoin relitigation in state court.the jurisdiction that the federal court had when it entered its original judgment is enough to support its issuance of an injunction.see also canady allstate ins,cir as long as the original lawsuit was properly brought in federal court,the federal court retains subject matter jurisdiction to remove any subsequent state law action to federal court for purposes of applying the all writs act.bryan claim that the court lacked jurisdiction must therefore fail.
we turn now to bryan challenges to the injunction issued by the district court under the all writs act.the all writs act provides that a court may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a.use of the all writs act,however,is constrained by the act,which provides that a court of the united states may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.west.the injunction entered in this case is thus improper unless it falls within the reach of one of the exceptions contained in the act 
the act exception for injunctions that are necessary to protect or effectuate a court judgment has come to be known as the relitigation exception.see in re am.honda motor.dealerships relations,cir.the relitigation exception was designed to permit a federal court to prevent state litigation of an issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.it is founded in the concepts of res judicata and collateral estoppel.chick kam choo exxon,d.the exception thus permits a court to enjoin proceedings in order to protect the res judicata effects of federal judgments.nationwide mut.ins.burke,cir.an injunction may issue under the relitigation exception only if the claims or issues subject to the injunction have actually been decided by the federal court the exception is inapplicable where an injunction is sought to prevent the litigation of claims or issues that could have been decided in the original action but were not.see chick kam choo,at.lcs,hamrick,cir a complainant seeking to avail himself of the relitigation exception to the statute must make a strong and unequivocal showing of relitigation of the same issues.internal quotation marks omitted.
bryan contends that the relitigation exception is inapplicable because the claim she is asserting in state court is not the same as count a that was dismissed under the doctrine by the district court.according to bryan,the focus of each complaint was substantially the federal complaint challenged the fusc as excessive,challenged the terms of the tariff,and sought to impose a different fusc,the state court complaint focuses on bellsouth misrepresentations about the fusc.bryan thus contends that the claims are different,such that the relitigation exception to the act does not apply.we disagree.
contrary to bryan assertion,bryan did not explicitly challenge bellsouth tariff or seek to impose a different fusc in count a of her federal complaint.instead,we concluded in bryan i that bryan allegations in count a had the legal effect of challenging or seeking to change the terms of bellsouth tariff.thus,the fact that bryan in her state court complaint does not explicitly challenge bellsouth tariff or seek to vary the terms of the tariff is not enough to establish that the state court complaint and count a of the federal complaint involve different claims.
in her complaint in federal court,bryan claimed that bellsouth charging and collecting of the fusc were unfair trade practices under north carolina law.bryan also alleged that bellsouth failure to disclose how it calculates the fusc or disclose that the fusc includes administrative costs and profit amounted to unfair trade practices.in the complaint,bryan omitted any reference to bellsouth charging or collecting of the fusc as constituting an unfair trade practice,alleging instead that bellsouth various failures to fully disclose the relevant aspects of its fusc amounted to unfair trade practices.an examination of the basis for our opinion in bryan i will demonstrate that these changes to the claim asserted in state court are not enough to render the relitigation exception inapplicable.
in bryan i,we explained why count a was barred by the doctrine 
bellsouth maintains that it does,asserting that,because count a seeks damages,the court,were bryan successful,would be put in the position of effectively refunding a portion of the fusc to bryan.in the circumstances presented,we are constrained to agree.
in count a,bryan alleges that bellsouth charging and collecting of the fusc and its failure to make certain disclosures in connection therewith constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices under north carolina general statute section bryan prayer for damages draws no distinction between her separate counts.with no indication to the contrary,we must view part v as seeking monetary damages for the acts alleged in count 
bellsouth asserts that the monetary remedy bryan seeks is a refund of that portion of the fusc that she considers she was wrongfully induced to pay and that,in seeking such a remedy,bryan runs afoul of the doctrine.in actuality,bryan does not specify the nature of her damages in count nonetheless,bellsouth maintains that any award of damages flowing from bellsouth to bryan,no matter how calculated,would violate the doctrine by refunding a portion of the fusc to some consumers but not to others and by requiring the court to determine a reasonable rate 
in our view,the in the light most favorable to the purports to seek any form of damages other than a refund of some portion of the fusc.and it pleads no facts that would put bellsouth on notice that bryan intends to seek damages resulting from any injury other than paying the fusc.in the facts section of the complaint,bryan alleges only that she is a bellsouth customer who was charged and paid the fusc,that bellsouth charged an fusc that was excessive,that it failed to disclose how the fusc was calculated,and that its use of the term fusc was misleading.
bryan i,at.as this passage demonstrates,the nature of the damages sought by bryan was key to the question.we concluded that the complaint could only be understood as seeking a refund of a portion of the fusc.and because other bellsouth customers would not receive such a refund,bryan claim ran afoul of the doctrine.
while bryan in her complaint omitted claims that the fusc was excessive,nothing about the nature of her damages claim has changed.her allegations in the damages section are the same as they were in the federal complaint and both complaints include numerous allegations about misrepresentations by bellsouth.bryan alleges that bellsouth fusc charge was more than its contribution to the usf,and she alleges that she is entitled to damages.just as with the federal complaint,there is nothing in bryan state court complaint that would put bellsouth on notice that bryan intends to seek damages resulting from any injury other than the paying of the fusc.
in bryan i,we rejected bryan argument that it was possible for her to recover damages that did not amount to a refund of the fusc 
at argument,bryan asserted that one could envision an award of damages that would not challenge the filed tariff.she posited that if bellsouth had fully disclosed all information pertaining to its fusc,she might have chosen a different carrier that would have charged a lower fusc,and therefore she would have been damaged in the amount of the difference between the two carriers fuscs.such an award of damages,bryan maintained,would not require the court to determine the reasonableness of bellsouth fusc and therefore would neither present a federal question nor be barred by the doctrine.this example is purely hypothetical,however,and nothing in the complaint suggests such an injury.
id.at.just as there were no allegations in the federal complaint to support this theory,there is nothing in the complaint that would support this theory of liability.in fact,the state court order certifying the class demonstrates that bryan is not seeking damages under this theory of liability.the certification order discusses the damage models that bryan identified in her interrogatory responses 
plaintiff has set forth two damage models which she believes would be appropriate.these are a the total of all monthly fusc amounts billed to plaintiff and every other class member,which total sum is then trebled under the north carolina unfair trade practices act and b the difference between i the total of all monthly fusc amounts billed to plaintiff and every other class member and ii the total of the relevant contribution factor times x the interstate portion of charges for telecommunications service on each customer bill for plaintiff and every other class member for every month that there was an fusc billed.the difference is then trebled.plaintiff does not claim that she is entitled to recover the difference between the federal universal service fees charged by other local carriers and the amount of bellsouth fusc.another measure of damages may be the difference between the amount charged and the amount authorized by the fcc.
emphasis added.
as the allegations in her complaint and the certification order demonstrate,bryan in her action is seeking damages in the form of a refund of the fusc paid by north carolina bellsouth customers.the claim asserted in state court is therefore functionally identical to count a of the federal action.because bryan in the action is seeking to litigate the very claim that we have conclud
