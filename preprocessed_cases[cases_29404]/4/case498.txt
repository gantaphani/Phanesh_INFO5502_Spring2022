when the deer valley resort company dvrc was developing its ski resort in the wasatch mountains,it sold parcels of land within the resort village to third parties,while reserving the right of approval over the conduct of certain ancillary businesses on the property,including ski rentals.for about fifteen years,dvrc granted permission to cole sports and christy sports to rent skis in competition with its own ski rental outlet.more recently,however,dvrc revoked that permission,presumably in order to gain more business for its own ski rental store.the question is whether this revocation violated the antitrust laws.we conclude that it did not.
background 
deer valley is one of three resorts in the vicinity of park city,utah,the vast majority,according to the complaint,deer valley patrons are destination skiers who fly into salt lake city and then take a minute bus or shuttle ride to the resort.the resort itself is divided into two areas the base area,located at the bottom of the mountain,and the ritzier village,located halfway up the slope.dvrc has always been the sole provider of ski rentals at the base area,but at the village,christy and cole sports have operated rental facilities dvrc itself opened a ski rental facility in.
originally,dvrc owned all the property at the village,but over the years it has sold parcels to third parties.in,dvrc sold one such parcel to and betty kimball,subject to a restrictive covenant that prohibited use of the property for either ski rental or real estate sales office purposes without dvrc express written consent.the kimballs built a commercial building and leased space in it to christy corporate predecessor,bulrich corporation.the lease expressly prohibited both the rental of skis and the operation of a real estate office.the next year,though,dvrc gave bulrich permission to rent skis in return for of the rental revenue.when bulrich merged with another company in and formed christy sports,llc,christy continued to operate the rental business.according to the complaint,christy stopped paying dvrc of its rental revenue in,though the reason for this change is unknown.christy rented skis at the deer valley village with no objection from dvrc until.during that time,dvrc was the sole purveyor of rental skis at the base area but did not have a ski rental operation at.
dvrc opened a ski rental outlet in.in august of that year,the resort notified christy that,beginning the following year ski season,the restrictive covenant would be enforced and christy would no longer be allowed to rent skis.christy believes that dvrc issued the same message to cole,leaving dvrc as the only rental ski provider at deer valley,with the exception of a small operation at the stein eriksen lodge,which serves its own lodgers.this leaves that majority of skiers who fly into salt lake city and then shuttle to deer valley with few choices they can carry unwieldy ski equipment onto the plane take a shuttle into park city and hunt for cheaper ski rentals in town,or rent from the more conveniently located dvrc location.christy predicts,not improbably,that most consumers will choose the third option.
christy argues that dvrc decision to begin enforcing its restrictive covenant is an attempt to monopolize the market of ski rentals available to destination skiers in deer valley,or,alternatively,to the destination skiers in the village itself.it alleges that by eliminating its competitors,dvrc will be able to increase prices and reduce output,thus harming consumers.the complaint states that the number of skis available for rental will decline by pairs,and the price will increase by at least to percent.
the district court dismissed christy antitrust complaints.in this appeal,christy challenges only the dismissal of its claims under of the sherman act.
ii.analysis 
we review the grant of a rule b motion to dismiss de novo.teigen renfrow,cir.in doing so,we ask whether there is plausibility in the complaint.bell atlantic twombly,d.the complaint does not need detailed factual allegations,id.at,but the f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.at.when,in twombly,the supreme court emphasized the need for plausibility in the complaint rather than wholly conclusory statement s,id.at,it warned particularly of the high costs and frequent abuses associated with antitrust discovery.id.at it is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery,but quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive.internal citations omitted.the concept of plausibility at the dismissal stage refers not to whether the allegations are likely to be true the court must assume them to be true.the question is whether,if the allegations are true,it is plausible and not merely possible that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under the relevant law.robbins oklahoma,cir.
christy has alleged that dvrc violated of the sherman act by either actual or attempted monopolization.the offense of monopoly under of the sherman act has two elements the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power.united states grinnell,d.similarly,an attempt claim must show that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power,with the third element requiring consider ation of the relevant market and the defendant ability to lessen or destroy competition in that market.spectrum sports,mcquillan,d.under both types of claims christy must therefore plead both power in a relevant market and anticompetitive conduct.the relevant market,according to christy complaint,is the market for ski rentals to destination skiers in deer valley in general or,even more narrowly,the market for ski rentals in the village.compl.the alleged anticompetitive conduct is the enforcement of the restrictive covenant.
a great many pages in the briefs are devoted to whether the defined market set forth in the skiers at deer valley,or alternatively at deer valley too small to constitute a market for antitrust purposes,in light of the proximity of a number of ski rental outlets in park city,just down the road.for purposes of analyzing the complaint,however,we find it not implausible that destination skiers who arrive at the resort by bus or shuttle will find it sufficiently inconvenient to travel into town to rent skis that a successful monopolist over ski rental at deer valley could charge supracompetitive prices.the question,we believe,is not whether dvrc might be able to raise prices and reduce output by becoming the only purveyor of rental skis at the resort,but whether such a market is legally cognizable under the antitrust laws and whether the decision of a resort owner to reserve to itself the right to provide ancillary services counts as anticompetitive conduct.
the defendant argues that these issues must be analyzed primarily from the temporal perspective of dvrc decision to impose a restrictive covenant on the sale of the property to the kimballs.it points out that dvrc had the right not to sell the property at issue at all it could have operated its own ski rental facilities at as it did at the base,without allowing competitors to enter the business.none of this would have violated the antitrust laws.such an arrangement would not have diminished competition on the contrary,by creating a resort and providing all the services ancillary to it,dvrc increased competition in the ski industry as a whole.the defendant argues that the analysis is the same when it allows an outside ski rental provider to operate for a period of time,and later changes its mind.if it is permissible for a resort owner to impose a covenant on land sales restricting potential competition in the provision of ancillary services,defendants argue,it must be permissible to exercise those rights under the covenant at a later date.
the plaintiff argues,on the contrary,that the temporal focus should be on dvrc decision to withdraw its consent to the operation of cole and christy ski rental facilities.it argues that this decision diminished competition in the ski rental business for destination skiers at deer valley or,alternatively,at,and will result in lowered output and higher prices for ski rentals,as compared to the situation before dvrc withdrew its consent.
we begin our analysis with dvrc original decision to impose the restrictive covenant.
imposition of the restrictive covenant 
we agree with the defendant that the creator of a resort has no obligation under the antitrust laws to allow competitive suppliers of ancillary services on its property.a theme park,for example,does not have to permit third parties to open restaurants,hotels,gift shops,or other facilities within the park it can reserve to itself the right to conduct such businesses and receive revenues from them.accordingly,if it sells land within the resort to third parties,the antitrust laws do not bar the resort owner from imposing a covenant against use of the property for competitive businesses.this is so even if food,rooms,gifts,or other ancillary goods and services would be cheaper and more plentiful if the resort owner allowed competition in these businesses.
this conclusion can be reached either by reference to the proper definition of a market or by reference to the absence of anticompetitive conduct.some courts,faced with cases of this sort,have found the market definition implausible.the seventh circuit took this approach in elliott united center,cir,when a peanut vendor challenged a sports arena decision to ban outside food and thereby monopolize the market for food concessions within the arena.the court rejected that market definition as implausible,saying 
the logic of the argument would mean that exclusive restaurants could no longer require customers to purchase their wines only at the establishment,because the restaurant would be monopolizing the sale of wine within its interior.movie theaters,which traditionally and notoriously earn a substantial portion of their revenue from the sale of candies,popcorn,and soda,would be required by the antitrust laws to allow patrons to bring their own food.
id.at.other courts agree.hospitals alleged to have monopolized the market for medical services within that single hospital,collins associated pathologists,cir ginzburg memorial healthcare systems,and a cemetery alleged to have monopolized the market for tombstones within that cemetery,monument builders of michigan cemetery ass n,cir,were all declared too narrow to constitute a relevant market.perhaps even closer to this case is hack president fellows of yale college,cir,in which yale university was alleged to have monopolized the market for housing within its sprawling complex of facilities.the second circuit rejected the idea that it is impermissible for an institution to monopolize one particular product within an establishment that provides a variety of interrelated services,the most important one of which is education.the alleged market was too narrow.
although discussion of sports arenas and universities seems to suggest that christy shortcomings lie with its alleged geographic market,the actual problem lies with its product market.in these cases the two are difficult to disentangle because the product rental skis,as here,or housing,as in hack is intimately related to the location.consumers do not travel to deer valley for rental skis,just as they do not attend yale to live in an eero dormitory.the true product in these cases is the overall experience.deer valley offers a cluster of products that combine to create a destination ski experience rental skis are only one small component.united states phillipsburg nat.bank trust,d t he cluster of products and services termed commercial banking has economic significance well beyond the various products and services involved.united states philadelphia nat.bank,d defining the relevant market under the clayton act merger analysis as the cluster of products various kinds of credit and services such as checking accounts and trust administration denoted by the term commercial banking.the complaint alleges nothing to suggest that destination skiers are choosing their ski resort based on the price of rental skis,separate and apart from the cluster of services associated with the experience.to define one small component of the overall product as the relevant product market is simply implausible 
alternatively,one could say that the monopolization claim would fail because the alleged conduct is not anticompetitive.even if a firm has monopoly power in a relevant market,a plaintiff must also show the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.grinnell,at.deer valley is not required to invite competitors onto its property to rent skis to its patrons,even if a failure to do so would mean it is the sole supplier of rental skis at the ski area.
the supreme court has recognized the economic value of allowing businesses to decide with whom they will deal,as it recently a s a general matter,the sherman act does not restrict the long recognized right of a trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business,freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.verizon commc ns,law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d quoting united states colgate.in trinko,the court acknowledged that in rare circumstances a refusal to cooperate with competitors might constitute a violation,but that such exceptions,because of the uncertain virtue of forced sharing and the difficulty of identifying and remedying anticompetitive conduct by a single firm,should be few.
having invested time and money in developing a premier ski resort that attracts skiers from across the nation,dvrc could recoup its investment in a number of ways.it could increase the price of lift tickets,raise room rates,serve only food,or,as it seems to have chosen,delve more deeply into the rental ski market.see elliott,at the united center can charge very high ticket prices,and allow unlimited numbers of food concessions in and around the stadium,or it can charge somewhat lower ticket prices and restrict the number of concessions thereby earning some of its profits from the food sales.this does not mean consumers have no protection.the ski resort industry is competitive and christy does not allege otherwise.families contemplating ski vacations have many options,and they presumably compare quality and price.if they are rational,the price they are concerned about is the sum of all of their prospective vacation costs,including not just lift ticket prices and resort lodging,but air fare,food and drink,entertainment,ski rentals,and the like.a resort that facilitates lower ski rental prices by allowing competition is able to price other aspects of the ski vacation experience more aggressively.the competitive discipline comes not from introducing competition with respect to each component of the experience,but from competition with other ski resorts with respect to the entire package.christy has not alleged,and it would not likely be plausible to allege,that dvrc decision to foreclose competition in the ski rental business at the village will have any effect on the market for ski resort vacations as a whole.
indeed,allowing resorts to decide for themselves what blend of vertical integration and third party competition will produce the highest return may well increase competition in the ski resort business as a whole,and thus benefit consumers.this flexibility about business strategies induces entrants into the ski resort business by allowing them to reserve the benefits of their investments to themselves.disneyland may have made a business miscalculation in locating where third parties could conveniently supply hotels,restaurants,and other services to its guests.see elliott,at citing jim molnar,a tale of disneys out of a single mouse different playgrounds grew,seattle times,may,at l.the antitrust laws do not make such miscalculations legally obligatory.
