plaintiff appellee magnetar technologies corporation magnetar alleges that defendant appellant intamin limited intamin maliciously prosecuted a patent infringement action against it,asserting patent patent.magnetar claims that intamin prosecuted the action even though the patent was invalid pursuant to the bar of bar.magnetar also contends that intamin,along with its european affiliate corporations,used the invalid patent to monopolize the market for magnetic braking systems,in violation of section of the sherman antitrust act,sherman act.
the district court granted summary judgment to intamin,holding that a reasonable attorney could have concluded that the bar did not apply to the patent,and that intamin thus could not have maliciously prosecuted magnetar for patent infringement.the district court also ruled that magnetar had offered insufficient evidence to prove an antitrust injury in its antitrust claims against intamin.
in its,intamin contends that the district court erred by not imposing rule sanctions against magnetar for bringing a frivolous antitrust action against intamin.the district court denied intamin motion for sanctions,concluding that magnetar brought its antitrust claims in good faith.
we affirm the decision of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
factual backgrounda.the parties 
magnetar is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of nevada,with its principal place of business in california.magnetar manufactures and distributes magnetic brakes and braking systems for use on roller coaster rides.
intamin is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of maryland,with its principal place of business in maryland.intamin is affiliated with intamin ag,located in switzerland,and ride trade,located in liechtenstein.the three corporations design and build roller coaster rides for use in amusement parks.
b.the hellevator 
on september,intamin entered into a written kingdom,an amusement park located in kentucky,concerning a ride named the hellevator.the agreement described the braking system to be installed on the ride as fin brakes,a type of mechanical braking system.
on october,intamin entered into a written letter agreement with kentucky kingdom that augmented the september sales contract.the october agreement required that intamin deliver the hellevator to kentucky kingdom during the amusement park season.the agreement also prohibited intamin from selling the ride to regional competitors of kentucky kingdom until.
on october,intamin sent a fax to kentucky kingdom providing details about the braking system to be installed on the hellevator intamin is planning to have the braking executed by a newly developed magnetic brake unit which does not physically enter in contact with the vehicles.kentucky kingdom subsequently issued a press release stating that the hellevator would use an innovating braking system and does not include the traditional found in existing rides.unlike mechanical braking systems,m agnetic brakes create eddy currents when a conductor passes through a gap between two sets of magnets.these eddy currents,in turn,create a magnetic friction that slows and stops the car attached to the conductor.intamin,magnetar,intamin ii 
after the execution of the october,contract,intamin began work on the hellevator.intamin also continued researching and testing the magnetic braking system mentioned in its october fax.in his affidavit,sandor kernacs,president of intamin,stated that intamin did not deliver the hellevator to kentucky kingdom on time due to the extensive testing that the magnetic brake technology required.for this reason,intamin was forced to pay kentucky kingdom a substantial penalty.
in march of,intamin published a report suggesting that it was still in the early stages of testing the magnetic braking system,and that the system was not yet ready for use on the hellevator.at several points,the report noted that experiments were ongoing,and that the final parameters were not yet known.
one witness testified that the magnetic braking system was ready as early as october of.in his affidavit,ronald berni,general manager of operations at kentucky kingdom,stated that it was never contemplated that the braking system for the ride would be anything other than an eddy current magnetic braking system.the braking system shown on all technical drawings for the giant drop ride will verify this statement.no details on the technical drawings ever indicated an intent to install,or a means for installing mechanical brakes.on the other hand,kentucky kingdom former ceo,ed hart,testified that it was possible for the braking mechanism on the hellevator to have been either magnetic brakes or mechanical brakes.in october of,intamin completed construction on the hellevator,using the magnetic braking system.
c.the patent 
on april,intamin filed an application with the patent and trademark office pto for a patent on the magnetic braking system used in the hellevator.intamin application was submitted on behalf of the inventors of the magnetic braking system,including patrick spieldiener,a director of intamin.see patent.intamin contends that it informed its patent counsel that it had initially proposed the magnetic braking technology in the fall of,when it contracted to provide the hellevator to kentucky kingdom.
the pto issued the patent on may.the inventors listed on the patent were alfons saiko,peter rosner,reinhold spieldiener,robert spieldiener,and patrick spieldiener.see patent.intamin acquired exclusive property rights in the patent on march,when four of the original five inventors assigned their rights to intamin.see intamin,magnetar techs,d,intamin iii.
d.the patent infringement action 
in,intamin filed suit against magnetar,contending that magnetar had infringed the patent by selling soft stop brakes,a type of magnetic braking system.see intamin ii,at.the district court granted summary judgment to magnetar,holding that the soft stop brakes did not infringe the patent because the components of the soft stop brake differed from those in the magnetic braking system intamin had patented.id.at.the federal circuit reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded the case to the central district of california,concluding that the district court had erred by relying on a narrow construction of the patent.id.at.
after remand,the district court again granted summary judgment to magnetar,finding in part that intamin had unclean hands concerning assignment of the patent d espite not having been assigned any rights in the patent,intamin began writing letters in to several companies claiming those companies had infringed intamin patent and threatening litigation if the companies did not compensate intamin by purchasing a license.intamin iii,d at.the federal circuit affirmed the district court second grant of summary judgment,per curiam.see intamin,magnetar techs,app x intamin iv.
ii.prior proceedings in this action 
on september,magnetar filed its complaint in this action,alleging that intamin had violated the sherman act by using a patent to establish a monopoly in the market for magnetic braking systems.on january,magnetar filed a second amended complaint,to add a malicious prosecution claim,based on intamin filing suit against magnetar for patent infringement.the malicious prosecution claim is based on california law.
on may,the district court granted summary judgment to intamin on both the malicious prosecution and sherman act claims.on the former claim,the court held that a reasonable attorney could have concluded that the bar did not apply to the patent.because there was a legitimate dispute as to the applicability of the bar,intamin had probable cause to bring its patent infringement action.on the latter claim,the district court concluded that magnetar theory of antitrust injury was unreliable and speculative,and that magnetar had not provided an adequate causal link between intamin purported anticompetitive conduct and magnetar damages.the district court also denied intamin rule motion for sanctions against magnetar.
this timely appeal followed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over magnetar antitrust claims pursuant to,and had supplemental jurisdiction over the malicious prosecution claim pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
we review de novo the district court decision to grant summary judgment to intamin on the malicious prosecution and antitrust claims.we consider disputed material facts in the light most favorable to magnetar,the party.summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists,and intamin is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett.
we review for an abuse of discretion the district court decision not to sanction magnetar under rule.see comeaux brown williamson tobacco,cir.
discussion 
malicious prosecution 
magnetar contends that intamin maliciously prosecuted the patent infringement action,because intamin brought the action despite knowing that the patent was invalid pursuant to the bar of.to prevail on a claim of malicious prosecution,magnetar must show that the patent infringement action was commenced by or at the defendant direction and terminated in plaintiff favor,was brought without probable cause,and was initiated with malice.see freeman city of santa ana,cir see also sheldon appel albert oliker,cal quoting bertero national general,cal.
whether probable cause exists in a malicious prosecution case is a legal question resolved by the court.wilson parker,covert chidester,cal.the court inquiry is objective,estate of tucker interscope records,cir,asking whether a reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable.sheldon appel co,at.
in this case,we ask whether a reasonable attorney would have thought the bar did not apply to the patent.see id.t he bar applies when two conditions are satisfied before the critical date.first,the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for sale second,the invention must be ready for patenting.pfaff wells.
with regard to the patent,a reasonable attorney could have determined that the bar did not apply due to the genuine dispute concerning whether the magnetic braking system had been offered for sale before the critical date and was ready for patenting before the critical date.we address each of these issues in turn.
offered for sale more than one year prior 
the bar of provides that no person is entitled to patent an invention that has been on sale more than one year before filing a patent application.pfaff,at.although our court has not delineated the precise boundaries of the on sale prong of after the supreme court controlling decision in pfaff,the federal circuit has held that o nly an offer which rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale,one which the other party could make into a binding contract by simple acceptance assuming consideration,constitutes an offer for sale under b.grp.one,hallmark cards.we are persuaded by the federal circuit reasoning,and apply its holding here.we conclude that a reasonable attorney could have determined that the magnetic braking system was not part of intamin contract with kentucky kingdom and that the magnetic braking system was not commercially offered for sale more than one year prior to april.see pfaff,at.
the ride agreement 
the september,contract between intamin and kentucky kingdom did not constitute a commercial offer to sell the magnetic braking system described in the patent.the contract specified that passengers on the hellevator would be stopped by a braking zone where they are stopped by a series of permanently closed fin brakes.fin brakes are a form of mechanical brakes.the september contract further states elsewhere that mechanical brakes would be used.
letter agreement 
the october,letter agreement similarly does not support magnetar position that the magnetic braking system was sold by intamin to kentucky kingdom.this document augments the september contract,but it says nothing about the use of magnetic brakes on the hellevator.
october,letter from intamin ag 
the october,letter from patrick spieldiener specified that magnetic brakes could be used on the hellevator contrary to previous descriptions intamin is planning to have the braking executed by a newly developed magnetic brake unit which does not physically enter in contact with the vehicles.nevertheless,a reasonable attorney could have determined that this letter does not constitute a commercial offer for sale of magnetic brakes.pfaff,at.
the language in the letter does not require that magnetic brakes be used on the hellevator.rather,patrick spieldiener states that intamin is planning to use the magnetic brakes,which implies at least some uncertainty.because the original contract stated that mechanical brakes would be used,the letter suggests only that intamin would attempt to replace the mechanical brakes with magnetic ones.
moreover,an attorney analyzing all the facts could determine that the original contract to provide mechanical brakes had not been modified by the october letter.the parties do not dispute that kentucky law applies to the contract because kentucky is the place of performance,and kentucky kingdom is located in that state.under kentucky law,a modification is subject to the same requirements as the contract itself namely,offer,acceptance,and consideration.see energy home,div.of energy homes,peay.
it is unclear whether the contract modification discussed in the letter was complete.for the terms of a modification to be considered complete they must be definite and certain and must set forth the promises of performance to be rendered by each party.id.quoting kovacs freeman.here,the letter does not refer to the original agreement nor does it clearly state that it is meant as an amendment to the original contract.the alleged modification was signed by patrick spieldiener,who did not state he was signing on behalf of intamin,the party to the original contract.patrick spieldiener was also an officer of intamin ag.in light of these facts,a reasonable attorney could have concluded that the letter did not modify the original contract,and that intamin had only contracted to sell mechanical brakes to magnetar.
experimentation exception 
even if we were to decide that a commercial offer for sale of the magnetic brakes was contained in the october letter,a reasonable attorney could still have concluded that the magnetic braking system was not ready for patenting when the hellevator was sold to kentucky kingdom.an invention is ready for patenting if it has been reduc ed to practice before the critical date or if prior to the critical date the inventor had prepared drawings or other descriptions of the invention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention.pfaff,at.
the federal circuit has described reduction to practice as proof that an invention will work for its intended purpose.see ez dock,schafer.the federal circuit also held that ongoing experiments on an invention after the critical sale date can show that the invention had not been reduced to practice.id.at.we are persuaded by the reasoning of the federal circuit,and we adopt its holding on this issue.
there is ample evidence in the record showing that experiments on the magnetic brakes continued after the critical sale date.according to a report issued in march just one month before the critical date the magnetic brake technology was still being studied,and the final parameters were unknown.sandor kernacs,president of intamin,testified that experiments on the magnetic brake technology continued into june and july of.
magnetar argues that when an invention is reduced to practice,the applicability of the experimentation exception to the bar is negated.we agree that this is legally correct.see,weatherchem clark.in the present case,however,magnetar needed to show that every reasonable attorney would have thought that the magnetic braking system had been reduced to practice,and thus,would have thought that the bar applied.because magnetar has not made such a showing,it can not prove that intamin lacked probable cause to bring the patent infringement action against magnetar.
