these consolidated appeals arise out of an antitrust action brought by a group of west coast fishermen against frank dulcich,the west coast seafood processor entities owned by dulcich collectively,pacific seafood,and ocean gold seafoods,ocean gold,another west coast seafood processor,which was commenced in and settled in.their settlement is documented in a resolution agreement.
in december,pacific seafood informed the other parties to the resolution agreement,including several who are now plaintiffs in the instant action,that pacific seafood was planning to acquire ocean gold.plaintiffs,a second group of west coast fishermen then filed the present action against dulcich,pacific seafood,and an ocean gold entity collectively,defendants,alleging antitrust claims under the sherman act and the clayton act.
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the acquisition pendente lite,which the district court granted.defendants then filed a motion to compel arbitration,arguing that the dispute should be arbitrated pursuant to a provision in the resolution agreement.the district court denied this motion.
defendants now appeal the district court decisions granting the preliminary injunction and denying the motion to compel arbitration.we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the order granting the preliminary injunction under a.we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the order denying defendants motion to compel arbitration under a c.we affirm both decisions.
a.the litigation whaley pacific seafood group 
in,a group of west coast fishermen the whaley plaintiffs sued frank dulcich,pacific seafood,and ocean gold in the district of oregon.the whaley plaintiffs and plaintiffs here sell their catch to processors such as pacific seafood and ocean gold,and seek to insure competition between the buyers of their fish.the whaley plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to restrain trade in,as well as monopolization and attempted monopolization of,multiple west coast seafood markets.
within a few months of filing suit,the whaley plaintiffs learned that pacific seafood was planning to acquire ocean gold and its affiliated companies.they filed for a temporary restraining order to halt the proposed transaction.defendants then represented to the district court and the whaley plaintiffs that they had terminated the transaction,and that they would not pursue it again without prior notice to the plaintiffs and the oregon attorney general.
throughout the course of the whaley litigation,pacific seafood and ocean gold were parties to an exclusive marketing contract,under which pacific seafood acted as the exclusive marketer and distributor of ocean gold products.this agreement was set to expire in.
the whaley litigation continued for twenty months.from february to march,the parties engaged in settlement negotiations,mediated by district judge michael hogan.the parties filed a stipulation and resolution agreement of class action claims the resolution agreement in april.the district court entered a judgment and order of dismissal on may.
in the resolution agreement,the whaley defendants agreed not to renew pacific seafood and ocean gold exclusive marketing contract when it expired in.additionally,in paragraph a of the resolution agreement,defendants agreed that,if pacific seafood and ocean gold were to enter into any new agreement that require d pacific seafood group to act as the exclusive marketer of any seafood product produced by ocean gold seafoods,pacific seafood and ocean gold would give days notice to plaintiffs counsel and the oregon department of justice.objections to the new contractual arrangement were to be submitted to judge hogan,or,if he were unavailable,magistrate judge john jelderks,for resolution.if judge hogan,or his successor,were to determine that the new agreement were it may be approved.
b.the litigation boardman pacific seafood group 
in december,counsel for frank dulcich and pacific seafood informed lead plaintiffs counsel in the whaley litigation that pacific seafood again intended to acquire ocean gold stock.plaintiffs counsel then conducted an investigation into this proposed acquisition,and learned that pacific seafood and ocean gold had been negotiating the proposed transaction for months.on january,plaintiffs counsel asked defendants counsel whether the transaction was scheduled to close in the near future,and defendants counsel replied that he did not know.
plaintiffs,a second group of west coast fishermen then filed this action against pacific seafood,an ocean gold entity ocean gold holding,and dulcich collectively,defendants on january,alleging monopolization and attempted monopolization under of the sherman act,and requesting a declaratory judgment that pacific seafood proposed acquisition of ocean gold violated the whaley resolution agreement plaintiffs also applied for a temporary restraining order to halt pacific seafood proposed acquisition of ocean gold,which the district court granted.
plaintiffs then moved for a preliminary injunction,after which defendants filed a stipulation stating that the oregon attorney general had begun an investigation into pacific seafood proposed acquisition of ocean gold,and that defendants agreed that they would not enter into any purchase transaction with respect to ocean gold while the investigation was pending.further,that defendants could terminate the stipulation upon days prior notice to the oregon attorney general and the court.
the district court judge mcshane granted plaintiffs preliminary injunction motion.the preliminary injunction prohibited defendants from undertaking any further act to acquire or control any interest in ocean gold stock or assets.defendants timely appeal from the decision granting the preliminary injunction.
about a month after the preliminary injunction was granted,defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration,arguing that plaintiffs were obligated to submit their objection to pacific seafood proposed acquisition of ocean gold to magistrate judge jelderks,the replacement for judge hogan,for arbitration under paragraph a of the whaley resolution agreement.the district court judge panner denied defendants motion,holding that plaintiffs claims did not fall within the scope of paragraph a.defendants timely appeal the denial of their motion to compel arbitration.
these consolidated appeals are now before this court.

a.the framework for analyzing a motion to compel arbitration 
section of the federal arbitration act faa makes enforceable a written arbitration provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.chiron ortho diagnostic,cir.when a contract meets this requirement,a court is limited to determining whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists within the contract and,if it does,whether the agreement encompasses the dispute at issue.id.if so,the court must compel arbitration.see id.at.
to interpret the parties contract,a court should look to general principles of contract interpretation,while giving due regard to the federal policy in favor of arbitration by resolving ambiguities as to the scope of arbitration in favor of arbitration.wagner stratton oakmont,cir.under oregon law,t o interpret a contractual provision the court follows three steps.first,the court examines the text of the disputed provision,in the context of the document as a whole.if the provision is clear,the analysis ends.yogman parrott,or,or en banc.if,on the other hand,the provision is ambiguous,the court examine s extrinsic evidence of the contracting parties intent.id.at.if this step does not resolve the ambiguity,the court looks to appropriate canons of construction for guidance.id.
plaintiffs claims are not within the scope of paragraph a of the resolution agreement 
because plaintiffs claims are not within the scope of the purported arbitration provision in the resolution agreement,we conclude that the district court did not err in denying defendants motion to compel arbitration 
defendants contend that the faa applies to the resolution agreement paragraph a of the resolution agreement includes a valid agreement to arbitrate the agreement to arbitrate encompasses plaintiffs suit and the court must therefore compel arbitration of the instant action.
because the faa applies only to arbitration provisions in contract s evidencing a transaction involving commerce,see chiron,at,we must first determine whether the resolution agreement is such a contract.the resolution agreement settled claims regarding seafood processors purchases of fish from fishermen on the west coast accordingly,it evidences a transaction involving commerce.see generally rogers royal caribbean cruise line,cir explaining that the supreme court has adopted a broad interpretation of the phrase evidencing a transaction involving commerce.
thus,the district court would have been obligated to compel arbitration of plaintiffs claims if the resolution agreement contained a valid agreement to arbitrate,and if that arbitration provision encompassed this dispute.chiron,at.we need not decide whether paragraph a of the resolution agreement constitutes a valid agreement to arbitrate because we conclude that plaintiffs claims are not encompassed by paragraph a plain language.
paragraph a of the resolution agreement provides 
the february,agreement between pacific seafood group and ocean gold seafoods,will not be renewed in.in the event that the sic pacific seafood and ocean gold intend to enter into any new agreement that requires pacific seafood group to act as the exclusive marketer of any seafood product produced by ocean gold seafoods,pacific seafood and ocean gold shall first give days notice to class counsel and the oregon department of justice and an opportunity to object to the agreement.in the event of an objection to the new contractual arrangement,judge hogan shall determine whether the proposed new agreement is and if so,it may be approved.
because of the federal policy in favor of arbitration,ambiguities regarding the scope of arbitrable issues are to be resolved in favor of arbitration.id.at.at the same time,arbitration is a matter of contract,and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.see knutson sirius xm radio,cir quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d.
in paragraph a of the resolution agreement,the parties to the whaley lawsuit agreed to submit to district judge hogan,or his replacement,magistrate judge jelderks,disputes regarding any new agreement that requires pacific seafood group to act as the exclusive marketer of any seafood product produced by ocean gold seafoods.the purchase and sale agreements for stock and other interests between pacific seafood and ocean gold that led to the current suit do not pertain to marketing.they do not deal with the marketing of ocean gold products in any explicit way,exclusive or otherwise.instead,they detail pacific seafood plan to purchase ocean gold stock and other interests.
pacific seafood argues that the purchase agreements functionally require it to act as the exclusive marketer of ocean gold products,by virtue of its contemplated ownership of ocean gold stock and other interests.but the owner of a company is not necessarily that company exclusive marketer,just as under the former exclusive marketing agreement,ocean gold was not the marketer of its own products.the owner of a company may have the right to act as the exclusive marketer of the company products,but there is no requirement that it do so.the parties could have drafted the provision more broadly to require any objections to a proposed merger or other combination of pacific seafood and ocean gold,or to any modification of their relationship,to be submitted to judge hogan for resolution,but they did not.instead,the provision only includes objections to a new agreement that requires pacific seafood to act as the exclusive marketer of ocean gold products the purchase and sale agreements at issue in this litigation are thus not fairly encompassed by this provision of the resolution agreement.regardless of whether the provision constitutes a valid agreement to arbitrate,plaintiffs claims are not within the scope of paragraph a.accordingly,the district court order denying defendants motion to compel arbitration is affirmed 
a.the framework for analyzing preliminary injunctions 
to obtain a preliminary injunction,a plaintiff must demonstrate that it is likely to succeed on the merits it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief the balance of equities tips in its favor and an injunction is in the public interest.winter nat.res.def.council,d.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs satisfied each of these requirements and granting their motion for a preliminary injunction.
plaintiffs have shown a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits 
plaintiffs did not release their claims in the prior settlement 
defendants argue that plaintiffs can not show a likelihood of success on the merits of their monopolization and unlawful merger claims because they released these claims in the resolution agreement.when settling the whaley lawsuit,plaintiffs agreed to release the following 
any and all claims for monopolization,attempted monopolization or conspiracy to restrain trade under sections and of the sherman act that relate to the delivery of groundfish,whiting or pink shrimp to west coast processors from bragg,california north to the canadian border between june,and december,and specifically including any claims for damages injunctive relief related to those claims.
as required by oregon contract law,we interpret the above provision by examining its text if the provision is clear,its plain text governs.see yogman,at.plaintiffs argue that the entire release is temporally limited that is,only claims arising between june,and december,were released,while defendants argue that the last clause of the provision including any claims for damages injunctive relief related to those claims is not so limited,and thus encompasses the claims at issue in this case.we agree with plaintiffs and conclude that they did not release their current claims when they settled the whaley lawsuit.
defendants read the last clause of the release expansively to mean that the whaley plaintiffs released all claims for damages or injunctive relief related to which defendants define to mean logically or causally connected to the claims asserted in whaley.by this logic,the whaley plaintiffs released their antitrust claims against defendants that arose between june,and december,and any related claims for damages or injunctive relief arising at any time before or after.this construction would render the temporal limitation in the first clause meaningless.
we decline to reach this illogical result,and we instead read the second clause in the context of the provision as a whole.the release states that the claims in the first clause,which are temporally limited,specifically includ e the claims in the second clause the related claims for damages injunctive relief.thus,the claims in the second clause are a smaller subset of the temporally limited claims in the first clause.see.state bd.for charter sch.dep t of,cir using a construction,the term including indicates that which follows is an illustrative subset of the preceding principle.the release in the resolution agreement is clear the whaley plaintiffs released their antitrust claims against defendants that arose between june and december,which specifically included plaintiffs claims for damages and injunctive relief that arose during the specified time period.accordingly,we conclude that the release in the resolution agreement has no bearing on plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits of their claims in this case,which arose after the resolution agreement was executed.
plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated that the proposed transaction could substantially lessen competition 
to prove an unlawful merger claim under of the clayton act,a plaintiff must show that the effect of the challenged acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition,or to tend to create a monopoly.the plaintiff need not prove that a merger or acquisition has altered prices in the relevant market rather,a ll that is necessary is that the merger create an appreciable danger of such consequences in the future.saint alphonsus med.luke health,cir quoting hosp.of am.ftc,cir.
this court evaluates claims under a framework.id.at.a prima facie case can be established simply by showing a high market share would result from the proposed merger,although plaintiffs often put forth other evidence as well,because market share statistics do not conclusively prove harm to competition.id.at.the burden then shifts to the defendant to cast doubt on the accuracy of the plaintiff evidence as predictive of future anticompetitive effects.id.at quoting chi.bridge iron.ftc,cir.
plaintiffs have adduced evidence that,if pacific seafood were to acquire ocean gold,pacific seafood market power in seafood input on the west coast would increase significantly,to the point that the markets would become highly concentrated.to support their argument,plaintiffs have utilized the herfindahl hirschman index,which is a commonly used metric for determining market share,saint alphonsus med,at,as well as the department of justice and federal trade commission horizontal merger guidelines.plaintiffs expert,radtke,also submitted a declaration explaining that there were multiple barriers to entry in the west coast seafood market.
to cast doubt on plaintiffs evidence as predictive of future anticompetitive effects,defendants respond that pacific seafood and ocean gold have been cooperating for nearly years,with pacific seafood acting as the sole buyer of ocean gold seafood output,using ocean gold seafood processing assets,and offering marketing and distribution services to ocean gold in return.according to defendants,the companies joint efforts have improved the industry by increasing ex vessel and expanding the market.in other words,defendants claim that pacific seafood acquisition of ocean gold would merely continue the companies joint efforts and not change the current market structure.defendants argue that,as a result,the proposed acquisition poses no danger to competition.
plaintiffs respond that pacific seafood acquisition of ocean gold would indeed change the relevant market structure,which is that of input markets on the west coast.in west coast input markets for groundfish,pacific whiting,and pacific coldwater shrimp,ocean gold and pacific seafood are currently competitors,though they cooperate in other respects.thus,according to plaintiffs,pacific seafood acquisition of ocean gold would substantially decrease competition in multiple seafood input markets.
the district court found convincing plaintiffs showing that pacific seafood acquisition of ocean gold would substantially reduce competition in multiple buyers input markets,and it found that defendants had not sufficiently cast doubt on plaintiffs evidence to meet their burden.this conclusion is supported by the evidence in the record summarized above,and it was not implausible in light of the record as a whole.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in finding that the effect of the challenged acquisition could be to lessen competition substantially thus,that plaintiffs had adequately demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.
plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief 
next,a plaintiff must show that she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.see winter,at.this court has ruled that s peculative injury does not constitute irreparable injury sufficient to warrant granting a preliminary injunction.a plaintiff must do more than merely allege imminent harm sufficient to establish standing a plaintiff must demonstrate immediate threatened injury as a prerequisite to preliminary injunctive relief.caribbean marine servs,baldrige,cir citations omitted.
plaintiffs argue that pacific seafood acquisition of ocean gold would create a monopsony in multiple seafood input markets on the west coast.a monopsony occurs when there is market power on the buy side of the market and buyers consequently pay suppliers less than they would in a competitive market.weyerhaeuser ross simmons hardwood lumber,d.as noted above,plaintiffs support their argument with market concentration statistics and expert declarations.a lessening of competition constitutes an irreparable injury under our case law.see united states bns,cir koppers has demonstrated that serious questions exist regarding the possibility of irreparable harm to competition in the irwindale aggregate market if the tender offer is consummated.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs adequately demonstrated a threatened irreparable injury.
defendants argue that there is no immediate danger of irreparable harm because they have terminated the proposed acquisition that led to this suit,and they have stipulated with the oregon attorney general that they would not enter a purchase transaction with ocean gold entities while the attorney general investigation is pending.defendants,however,may terminate the stipulation with days notice to the oregon attorney general and the district court.
defendants argument is unavailing.a threat of irreparable harm is sufficiently immediate to warrant preliminary injunctive relief if the plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered.see winter,at quoting charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.given the limited nature of defendants proposed stipulation not to enter a purchase transaction,when a deal with ocean gold could take on many different structures the expiration of pacific seafood and ocean gold exclusive marketing agreement in february defendants history of negotiating an acquisition for many months in secret before notifying plaintiffs and the fact that defendants may terminate their stipulation with days notice,plaintiffs have established a sufficient likelihood that,in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief,they would suffer irreparable harm before a trial on the merits could be held.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated a threat of irreparable harm.
d.the balance of equities tips in plaintiffs favor 
the district court likewise did not abuse its discretion in finding that the balance of equities tips in favor of plaintiffs.plaintiffs have demonstrated a reasonable probability that pacific seafood acquisition of ocean gold would substantially lessen competition in the relevant input markets on the west coast.this decrease in competition would injure plaintiffs,who sell fish in these markets.defendants,on the other hand,have not established how maintaining the status quo while the district court decides the case on the merits will injure them.accordingly,the district court finding as to the balance of equities in this case was not an abuse of discretion.
e.a preliminary injunction is in the public interest 
a district court should consider whether a preliminary injunction would be in the public interest if the impact of an injunction reaches beyond the parties,carrying with it a potential for public consequences.stormans,at.this court has said that the central purpose of the antitrust laws,state and federal,is to preserve competition.it is competition that these statutes recognize as vital to the public interest.knevelbaard dairies kraft foods,cir emphasis added.again,plaintiffs have demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that pacific seafood acquisition of ocean gold could substantially lessen competition in relevant input markets.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that a preliminary injunction is in the public interest.
f.the preliminary injunction is not overbroad 
finally,defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by granting an overly broad preliminary injunction.an overbroad injunction is an abuse of discretion.lamb weston,mccain foods,cir.
the preliminary injunction provides,as follows 
defendants,their subsidiaries,affiliates,owners,officers,employees,and agents and all persons acting on their behalf are prohibited,through contractual or any other means,from undertaking any further act to acquire or control any interest in the stock,capital assets,real property,quota,or fishing permits of ocean gold seafoods,or its affiliated companies including but not limited to ocean gold international,ocean protein,llc ocean cold,llc ocean cold transport,llc,and hoquiam riverview properties,llc,or their shareholders or members until further order of this court.
defendants take issue with the fact that the district court prohibited them from undertaking any further act to acquire or control any interest in ocean gold.defendants argue that the preliminary injunction is overbroad because it prohibits not only pacific seafood ultimate acquisition of ocean gold,but also any lawful preparatory conduct such as negotiating an acquisition,signing a letter of intent,or entering into an agreement contingent on resolution of plaintiffs antitrust claims.according to defendants,such preparatory conduct was specifically contemplated by the resolution agreement,which states that pacific seafood may enter new contractual arrangements with ocean gold.
district courts have broad latitude in fashioning equitable relief when necessary to remedy an established wrong.earth island inst.carlton,cir quoting sierra hikers ass blackwell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo ante litem pending a determination of the action on the merits.sierra forest legacy rey,cir quoting mem l coliseum comm football league,cir internal quotation marks omitted.status quo ante litem refers to the last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy,walt disney,cir quoting tanner motor livery,avis,cir.
by prohibiting pacific seafood from undertaking any further act to acquire ocean gold stock or assets,the district court effectively preserved the parties last uncontested status,prior to pacific seafood attempt to acquire ocean gold.pacific seafood and ocean gold could combine their operations in a number of ways to lessen competition,and the district court thus did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting pacific seafood from undertaking any further acts to acquire ocean gold stock or assets,as opposed to prohibiting only an actual acquisition.
because the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs had satisfied the winter requirements,we affirm the district court order granting plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.
we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that plaintiffs are not required to arbitrate their claims.we further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.accordingly,both orders of the district court are 
i agree with the majority opinion holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.accordingly,i concur in part iv.of the opinion.i further agree with the majority framework for analyzing motions to compel arbitration as described in part.but i respectfully disagree with the majority conclusion in part.that the plaintiffs claims clearly and unambiguously fall outside the scope of paragraph a of the resolution agreement.such a conclusion strikes me as contrary to circuit precedent and contravenes the emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.see mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d.
reading paragraph a in the context of this particular dispute,i believe that the scope of the language is at best ambiguous.and because this court precedent requires that any ambiguity regarding the scope of an arbitration agreement be resolved in favor of arbitration,i would hold that the plaintiffs claims are arbitrable.i would therefore grant pacific seafood motion to compel arbitration.
paragraph a is a valid arbitration agreement 
the majority states that it need not decide whether paragraph a is a valid arbitration agreement because,notwithstanding such a determination,the plaintiffs claims are not encompassed by paragraph a plain language.in other words,the majority bypasses the first step of the chiron analysis and addresses only the second.but because i would hold that the dispute at issue is fairly encompassed within the scope of paragraph a,i will first consider whether paragraph a constitutes a valid arbitration agreement.see chiron ortho diagnostic,cir.i believe that it does.
the federal arbitration act faa does not specifically define the term arbitration.see.but in wolsey foodmaker,cir,this court adopted the reasoning of two other courts in determining what constitutes an arbitration agreement within the meaning of the faa.the wolsey court first relied on the eastern district of new york rather straightforward definition,which stated if the parties have agreed to submit a dispute for a decision by a third party,they have agreed to arbitration.id.at emphasis omitted quoting amf brunswick.the wolsey court also observed that the third circuit,in a case decided the year before,had narrowed the definition to require that the parties must also agree not to pursue litigation until the process is completed.id.quoting harrison nissan motor,cir.in applying harrison,the wolsey court reasoned that if the agreement in question does not explicitly permit one of the parties to seek recourse to the courts before an arbitrator makes a decision,then the agreement is arbitrable.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
a final factor weighing in favor of arbitration,wolsey emphasized,is the presumption in favor of arbitrability created by the faa.id.noting that the faa was designed to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the wolsey court concluded that the dispute in question satisfied both the eastern district of new york and the third circuit criteria it did not endorse one court definition over the other.id.at.
here,paragraph a of the resolution agreement would likewise satisfy both definitions of an arbitration agreement.pacific seafood and the west coast fishermen,in adopting the resolution agreement,agreed to submit any objection to a new agreement that requires pacific seafood group to act as the exclusive marketer of any seafood product by ocean gold seafoods to a named third party district judge hogan or his replacement,magistrate judge jelderks for a decision to determine whether the proposed new agreement is.this satisfies the eastern district of new york broader definition of arbitration.in addition,paragraph a does not explicitly permit either party to pursue litigation before the named third party renders a decision.see id.at.it therefore satisfies the third circuit narrower definition.so according to either criterion,and in light of the presumption in favor of arbitrability,see,paragraph a should properly be considered as an arbitration agreement.
the plaintiffs do not contest the fact that the west coast fisherman had agreed to submit any dispute regarding a new exclusive marketing agreement to a third party for a decision.but they challenge the validity of paragraph a on three alternate grounds.for the reasons discussed below,i believe that each challenge is without merit.
first,the plaintiffs argue that paragraph a is not an arbitration agreement because its language does not contain the word arbitrate.but such an argument was unequivocally rejected in wolsey.id.at noting that n o magic words such as arbitrate or binding arbitration or final dispute resolution are needed to invoke the faa quoting amf.at.the argument therefore has no merit.
next,the plaintiffs argue that paragraph a can not be an arb
