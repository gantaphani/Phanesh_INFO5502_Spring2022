factual and procedural background 
at t provides wireless telephone service to subscribers in the los angeles area.marcia spielholz and debra petcove are at t subscribers,and wireless consumers alliance,advocates on behalf of wireless telephone users.
spielholz sued at t in february on behalf of herself and others similarly situated,alleging that it falsely advertised a seamless calling area of uninterrupted service throughout southern california and failed to disclose the existence of gaps or dead zones within that area the second amended complaint filed in december alleges causes of action for unfair business practices,false advertising,violation of the consumer legal remedies act,intentional and negligent misrepresentation,breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing spielholz seeks injunctive and monetary relief,including damages and restitution.
at t moved to strike the allegations for monetary relief in january.it argued that although the complaint alleges false advertising,the gravamen of the complaint is that its rates are unreasonable,and the court would be required to determine the fair value of its services in order to award damages or restitution.such a determination,it argued,would conflict with the federal statutory prohibition against state regulation of rates charged by wireless telephone service providers c a and therefore is preempted.the court agreed and granted the motion in february.
spielholz petitioned this court for a writ of mandate,and we issued an alternative writ wireless consumers alliance,also petitioned the federal communications commission fcc for a declaratory ruling on the preemption issue.we stayed the proceedings in this court pending resolution of the fcc petition.the fcc issued its opinion in august,and we vacated the stay.
the fcc concluded that section c a generally does not preempt an award of monetary relief by state courts based on state tort or contract claims,unless a court purports to determine the reasonableness of a prior rate or it sets a prospective charge for services.in re wireless consumers alliance.without purporting to rule on the specific allegations in this action,the fcc distinguished between an outright determination of whether a price charged was unreasonable,which would be preempted,and the determination of whether there was a difference between promise and performance in the context of false advertising or breach of contract,which would not be preempted id.at.
contentions 
spielholz contends section c a does not preempt a state court from awarding monetary relief based on false advertising at t contends an award of monetary relief would require the court to determine the reasonableness of the rates charged and therefore would constitute prohibited rate regulation within the meaning of section c a.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the order striking the allegations for monetary relief de novo,consider the allegations of the complaint as a whole,and assume their truth to determine whether they plead ultimate facts that would support a monetary award.clauson superior court th,d.specifically,our task is to determine whether section c a preempts a state court award of monetary relief for causes of action based on false advertising.
preemption is a legal issue involving statutory construction and the ascertainment of legislative intent,which we also review de novo.service by medallion,clorox th,d.
preemption 
congress has the power to preempt state law under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution art.vi,cl.crosby national foreign trade council,d.congress intent to preempt may be expressly stated or implied where a federal law demonstrates an intent to occupy the field or a state law conflicts with a federal law.ibid.a conflict exists where compliance with both state and federal law is impossible,or where a state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,quoting hines davidowitz.english general electric,d.
to determine whether congress intended to preempt state law with respect to a particular activity,we focus on the nature of the activity that the state seeks to control or regulate rather than on the method of regulation adopted.san diego unions garmon,d.preemption therefore applies not only to positive enactments by legislation or regulation but also to judicial acts that interfere or conflict with congressional intent.id.at.held that a damage award against labor unions was impliedly preempted as state regulation of union activity.
congress intent to preempt must be clear and manifest to preempt state law in a field traditionally occupied by the states,such as the exercise of a state police powers.medtronic,lohr,d california arc america,d.this creates a presumption against preemption.medtronic,at.arc america,at.the states police powers extend to consumer protection,such as claims based on false advertising,so the presumption against preemption applies in the present action.arc america,at.smiley citibank cal th,d,affd,d.
section c a 
section c a is part of the amendments to the communications act of et.omnibus budget reconciliation act of,b a,stat.under the communications act,common carriers engaged in interstate or foreign wire or radio communication must file with the fcc a schedule or tariff showing all charges and the classifications,practices,and regulations affecting those charges.a.the contents of the tariff are subject to fcc approval,and the fcc may determine and prescribe just and reasonable charges,classifications,practices,and regulations.a,a.
the amendments authorized the fcc to exempt wireless telephone service from the tariff filing requirement and the provision allowing the fcc to prescribe just and reasonable charges,classifications,practices,and regulations,provided that the fcc determined that those provisions were not necessary to ensure just and reasonable charges,classifications,practices,and regulations,b a,stat.at,codified at c a.the fcc so determined and ordered the exemption in.in the matter of implementation of sections n and of the communications act,second report and order see cfr c.
section c a states that no state or local government may regulate the rates charged by a wireless telephone service provider,but that a state may regulat e the other terms and conditions of service it further provides that a state may petition the fcc for authority to regulate the rates for service,and that the fcc shall grant the petition if market conditions do not adequately ensure just and reasonable rates.subdivision c b of section provides that a state may petition the fcc for authority to continue any existing regulation concerning the rates for service,which the fcc must review under the same standard 
the communications act also contains a saving clause that predates the amendments,stating nothing in this chapter contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.
express preemption 
the question of whether section c a expressly preempts an award of monetary relief in this action turns on the question of whether such an award would constitute rate regulation within the meaning of section c a intended by congress.
rate regulation,or to regulate the rates charged in the words of section c a,refers,in our view,to an action whose principal purpose and direct effect are to control prices.the term ordinarily refers to direct price controls of the sort that the amendments authorized the fcc to terminate for wireless telephone service providers by exempting them.in the context of amendments that allow the fcc to exempt providers from its authority to determine and prescribe a just and reasonable charges,we construe regulate the rates charged c a to refer to the same sort of direct price controls.thus,section c a allows the fcc to discontinue its direct price controls and prohibits the states from imposing their own.this meaning is clear and manifest medtronic,lohr,supra,at.california arc america,supra,at.the meaning advocated by at t is not 
section c a does not disclose a congressional intent to preempt state court monetary awards that may require a determination of the value of services provided but do not directly regulate rates.we presume that if congress had intended to preempt such state law remedies,it would have expressly so stated.not only does the communications act not so state,but it states that it generally does not preclude state law remedies.courts have held that the saving clause preserves state law remedies for breaches of duties that are distinguishable from duties created under the act kellerman mci telecommunications,false advertising cooperative communications,v.at t,unfair competition see at t central office telephone,d central office telephone the saving clause preserves only those rights that are not inconsistent with federal statutory requirements,and we agree.
a judicial act constitutes rate regulation only if its principal purpose and direct effect are to control rates.for example,an injunction that prevents a wireless telephone service provider from charging specified rates would directly regulate rates.ball gte mobilnet of california th,d accord,in re comcast cellular telecom.litigation.similarly,if a cause of action directly challenges a rate as unreasonable,an award of damages or restitution to compensate a customer for the difference between the rate paid and what the court determines to be a reasonable rate would directly regulate rates.ball,at,d accord,comcast,at.in general,a claim that directly challenges a rate and seeks a remedy to limit or control the rate prospectively or retrospectively is an attempt to regulate rates and therefore is preempted under section c a a claim that directly challenges some other activity,such as false advertising,and requires a determination of the value of services provided in order to award monetary relief is not rate regulation.
ball gte mobilnet of california,supra,th,d,in re comcast cellular telecom.litigation,supra,and tenore v.at t wireless services,supra,all involved the practice of billing in full minute increments,or rounding up to the next full minute,and other practices that resulted in charges for noncommunication time.the courts concluded that section c a preempts claims that directly challenge the rate charged by a wireless telephone service provider ball,at,d comcast,at,but does not preempt claims alleging the failure to disclose a practice that affects the total amount charged ball,at,d comcast,at tenore,at.they considered the billing increment to be an integral part of the rate and therefore held that direct challenges to the reasonableness or legality of the billing increment were preempted,but claims based on the failure to disclose the billing increment were not preempted.ball,at,d comcast,at,tenore,at.
we agree in principal with the distinction drawn in those cases between claims that directly challenge the rate charged and claims that challenge some other practice,such as false advertising.a monetary award based on the latter type of claim would affect the rate charged only incidentally and is not a direct price control or rate regulation.see nader allegheny airlines,d,discussed post.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that a claim that does not directly challenge the rate but directly challenges some other activity,such as false advertising,and seeks a remedy to limit or control that activity or seeks damages arising from the activity is not an attempt to regulate rates and is not expressly preempted under section c a.if the principal purpose and direct effect of a remedy are to prevent false advertising and compensate an aggrieved customer,any prospective or retrospective effect on rates is merely incidental.this is true even if the court determines the value of services provided in awarding damages or restitution.accord,tenore v.at t wireless services,supra,at.contrary to at t argument,an award of damages or restitution for false advertising that requires the court to determine the value of services provided is not rate regulation.ibid.
implied preemption 
the existence of an express preemption provision and a saving clause does not necessarily negate the possibility of implied preemption geier american honda motor,d,although they clearly weigh against implied preemption here the communications act does not evidence an intent to preempt monetary relief for state law causes of action based on false advertising.
the communications act does not address the issue of gaps or dead zones within a calling area,and there is no requirement that a calling area include gaps or dead zones or that the service provider fail to disclose their existence.monetary relief under state law causes of action arising from the misrepresentation and nondisclosure of those conditions therefore would not conflict with any federal requirements.see nader allegheny airlines,supra,at.
the communications act also does not evidence an intent to occupy the field of either calling area continuity or false advertising.although the act requires that charges,classifications,practices,and regulations be just and reasonable b and provides a right of action before the fcc or in federal court for violation of those requirements,those provisions do not evidence an intent to preclude all other remedies within the broad ambit of a service provider practices.a potential federal remedy is not necessarily inconsistent with state remedies,as acknowledged by the saving clause.we perceive no conflict.
moreover,the availability of state law remedies is consistent with the amendments objective to achieve maximum benefits for consumers and providers through reliance on the competitive marketplace,in which state law duties and remedies ordinarily are enforceable.see in re wireless consumers alliance,supra.
the filed rate doctrine 
at t contends we should construe the preemptive effect of section c a by reference to the common law filed rate doctrine,as it has urged in similar cases in other jurisdictions,cited post.we reject this argument.
a.the doctrine and its purposes 
the filed rate doctrine applies to companies that are required to file a tariff with a federal agency where the agency has the authority to determine whether the rates are just and reasonable.arkansas louisiana gas hall,d marcus v.at t cir.the doctrine holds that the only lawful rate is the filed rate and that only the agency can determine the reasonableness of rates.arkansas louisiana gas hall,supra,at.montana dakota utilities northwestern public service.the rates stated in the filed tariff are conclusive and can not be invalidated or altered by judicial action.arkansas louisiana gas,at.the purposes of the filed rate doctrine are to preserve the agency primary jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of rates and to ensure rate uniformity and nondiscrimination among customers.arkansas louisiana gas,at.wegoland nynex cir.
some courts have interpreted the filed rate doctrine to preempt not only claims that directly challenge the rates charged by regulated companies,but also claims that would require a court to det
