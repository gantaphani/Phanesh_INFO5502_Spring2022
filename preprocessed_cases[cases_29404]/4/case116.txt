paycom billing services,paycom appeals from the dismissal of its complaint by judge trager in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.the complaint alleges that three different policies adopted and practiced by mastercard international,mastercard violate section of the sherman act,these policies are mastercard imposition of penalties for charges denied by customers of,and failure to guarantee payment to,merchants who accept credit card charges without obtaining a signed receipt,its limitations on member banks associating with competing credit cards,and rules limiting the participation of foreign banks in mastercard business.we conclude that paycom lacks antitrust standing and has not sufficiently alleged concerted action.we therefore affirm.
background 
because this is an appeal from a dismissal of a complaint under.b,we view the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to appellant.leeds meltz,cir.
a mastercard 
mastercard is one of four major providers in the united states united states visa,cir hereinafter visa ii.it operates a global that provides the infrastructure and network services for the authorization,clearance,and settlement of transactions effected with.id.at.
organizationally,mastercard is a membership association operated as an open joint venture,comprised of and owned by more than member banks who engage in the business for profit.see visa i,d at.mastercard is funded primarily by service and transaction fees paid by its members,and the organization capital surpluses are held basically as security accounts,to pay merchants in the event a member bank defaults on a payment obligation.visa ii,at.mastercard is a consortium of competitors owned and effectively operated by some banks,which compete with one another in the issuance of payment cards and the acquiring of merchants transactions.id.at.the consortium members agree to abide by certain regulations and bylaws promulgated by the association.id.at.
mastercard members fall into one,or both,of two categories i issuing banks,which disseminate to individual cardholders and serve as the intermediary between the network and the cardholder and ii acquiring banks,which contract with merchants to purchase transactions effected with and serve as the intermediary between the network and the merchants accepting mastercard payments.id.
b and transactions 
for purposes of this proceeding,there are two distinct methods by which cardholders use their cards to purchase goods or services.
the first method is a transaction in which a consumer physically presents a card to pay for goods or services from a brick and mortar merchant.we will call these cp transactions.
after the consumer produces the card,a series of electronic messages and transactions follows.the merchant sends the relevant information to its acquiring bank,which packages and processes that information and transmits it to the mastercard network.the network sends this information to the cardholder issuing bank,which approves or disallows the transaction based on the current validity of the card and the cardholder available credit.this authorization or disallowance is sent via electronic message to the acquiring bank,which then sends it to the merchant.the purchase is then consummated or rejected.if consummated,the cardholder signs a receipt.the issuing bank bills the cardholder for the purchase amount and transmits the purchase price to the acquiring bank,deducting an interchange fee,the fee the issuer charges to process the transaction.id.the acquirer places these funds in the merchant account after subtracting the fee for providing its services and executing the transaction,the merchant discount.id.
when a cardholder disputes a charge on his,the process is reversed by means of a chargeback the issuing bank requires the acquiring bank to return the funds,and the acquiring bank then usually deducts these funds from the merchant account.to reverse a chargeback,a merchant must verify the validity of the transaction by producing the sales receipt signed by the cardholder at the point of sale.upon providing such verification,the chargeback is for clearance through the network and the funds are restored to the merchant account.essentially,therefore,mastercard guarantees payment to cp merchants that retain signed sales receipts reflecting the physical use of the card.
cnp transactions differ in that the merchant never sees the card or cardholder but acquires the card number other verifying information generally by phone or online.the ensuing sequence of electronic messages and authorization or disallowance are the same as cp transactions.cnp transactions disputed by cardholders are handled quite differently,however.a chargeback begins with the issuing bank receiving the funds back from the acquiring bank that in turn usually seeks the funds from the merchant,who has paid an unrefunded merchant discount.unlike the cp merchant,the cnp merchant must bear the price plus merchant there is no signed receipt.
cnp transactions of course have a higher risk of fraud than cp transactions.it may be safer for thieves to use stolen cards by phone or online,and the occurrence of cardholders falsely denying purchases is much higher than in the case of cp transactions.
moreover,if a merchant client of an acquiring bank has excessive chargeback activity causing its chargeback ratio to exceed a certain chargeback threshold defined by mastercard,the acquiring bank is subject to fines and penalties.
paycom is a merchant that sells access to websites customer websites owned by independent entities that do not charge their consumers directly.a consumer wanting to purchase the services offered by a customer paycom case,largely,but not exclusively,sexual or adult content websites that charge subscription fees to view materials on the redirected from the customer website to paycom website.once on paycom website,the consumer purchases the desired services from paycom,monthly memberships,account ids,and passwords that allow content to be viewed on the customer website.for payment,paycom accepts mastercard,visa,and discover payment cards,as well as automated clearing house transactions.
in serving as payment processor or agent for its customer website operators,paycom is a merchant purchaser of mastercard network services that has contracted with a mastercard member acquiring bank directly.under its merchant account with an acquiring bank,paycom submits consumers mastercard transactions for authorization and payment.after receiving authorization and payment from the acquiring bank,paycom credits the accounts of its customer websites in the amount of the transaction minus those fees paycom charges for arranging the transaction.all purchases through paycom are cnp transactions.
d the complaint 
on december,paycom filed the present action in the eastern district of new york challenging,inter alia,three mastercard policies and practices the chargeback system,the competitive programs policy cpp,and the acquiring rules cba rules paycom alleged that each of these violated section of the sherman act.we describe these seriatim.
the chargeback system 
mastercard chargeback system is described in the complaint as follows.when a cardholder disputes a charge,the mastercard issuing bank typically issues a chargeback to the acquiring bank.if the merchant fails to present a signed sales receipt,the acquiring bank often debits the entire amount from the merchant account.this forces cnp merchants like paycom to assume the risk of fraud because cnp merchants are not afforded the same payment guarantee as cp merchants that can produce signed sales receipts.cnp merchants are injured in this regard because they pay merchant fees for transactions for which they receive no benefit,as the transaction credit is removed from their account when a chargeback is issued.
moreover,paycom contends that mastercard has imposed an arbitrary and onerous chargeback fine and penalty program that has resulted in paycom payment of substantial fines.paycom alleges that the fine and penalty program results in a supracompetitive price that cnp merchants pay for fraud.paycom claims that these chargeback policies have caused paycom to incur substantial costs to combat fraud that could more readily be addressed by mastercard itself.as such,output has been reduced because merchants like paycom must take costly measures that combat fraud and turn away many honest consumers.
the competitive programs policy 
mastercard instituted the cpp in.visa ii,at.under the cpp,mastercard member banks may not participate either as issuers or acquirers for any other competing network with the exception of visa id.paycom alleges that the cpp allowed mastercard to lock up virtually every bank in the united states and block competing networks,like those of discover and american express,from using the banking industry to distribute their services.such a rule forced competing card networks to operate as networks,limiting their transaction,issuance,and acceptance volumes.paycom claims that the cpp thereby caused it harm by foreclosing competition in the market for network services and reducing the number of payment options available to paycom.other networks were therefore unable to discipline mastercard through competition,leaving it free to impose higher interchange fees,onerous chargebacks,and more burdensome rules than it otherwise could have in the absence of the cpp.
to support its claims of antitrust injury,paycom relies upon recent decisions that found mastercard to be in violation of the antitrust laws.see visa ii,at in the market for network services the exclusionary rules enforced by mastercard have absolutely prevented american express and discover from selling their products at all.visa i,d at not only issuers and card consumers but also merchants would benefit from an increase in competition among general purpose card networks,because merchants,as well as issuers,are consumers of network services moreover,enhanced competition from american express and discover would likely cause defendants to be more responsive to the interests of merchants.
the acquiring rules 
the third challenge levied by paycom relates to mastercard cba rules.paycom contends that,under the cba rules,banks are prohibited from acting as acquiring banks for internet merchants mastercard transactions,limiting the number of acquiring banks with which paycom can contract for the provision of mastercard network services.paycom alleges that the cba rules represent an unlawful market allocation scheme in which domestic banks are insulated from having to compete against foreign banks that might otherwise provide services to internet merchants.
discussion 
the district court dismissed paycom complaint in its entirety.this appeal followed.
a standard of review

b federal antitrust law 
although the sherman act,by its terms,prohibits every agreement in restraint of trade,th e supreme court has long recognized that congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints.state oil khan,d citation omitted some conduct is prohibited because it is deemed unreasonable per se.other conduct is outlawed only after evaluation under the rule of reason.id.
the per se label is applied o nce experience with a particular kind of restraint enables the court to predict with confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it.arizona maricopa county med.soc y,d.these types of restraints have such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect,and such limited potential for procompetitive benefit,that they are deemed unlawful per se.state oil,at.citing pac.united states,d.
most antitrust claims,however,are evaluated under rule of reason analysis,according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition,taking into account a variety of factors,including specific information about the relevant business,its condition before and after the restraint was imposed,and the restraint history,nature,and effect.state oil,at.citations omitted.
while the clayton act sections damages and injunctive relief,and,permit private citizens to sue under the federal antitrust laws,private plaintiffs must demonstrate antitrust standing.see cargill,monfort of,nn,d.standing is required because congress did not intend the antitrust laws to provide a remedy in damages for all injuries that might conceivably be traced to an antitrust violation.associated general contractors,california state council of carpenters,d hereinafter agc quoting hawaii standard oil,d.
to recover,a plaintiff must show,inter alia,that it suffered an antitrust injury.an antitrust injury is an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick pueblo,d.the injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation because t he antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition,not competitors.id.at.quoting brown shoe united states,d emphasis added see also daniel american bd.of emergency medicine,cir citing cases.thus,t he antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a aspect or effect of the defendant behavior.atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d emphasis in original.a plaintiff must demonstrate antitrust injury whether the alleged violation is unreasonable per se or under the rule of reason,id.at,and whether it seeks damages or injunctive relief,cargill,at.
even if a plaintiff adequately alleges an antitrust injury,it may still be held to lack standing.see id.at.a showing of antitrust injury is necessary,but not always sufficient to establish standing.daniel,at.other factors relevant to referred to as the efficient enforcer indicate that a party who states an antitrust injury is nevertheless not a proper antitrust plaintiff.id.at.these include 
the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement the speculativeness of the alleged injury and the difficulty of identifying damages and apportioning them among direct and indirect victims so as to avoid duplicative recoveries.

c chargeback claims 
paycom contends that mastercard chargeback system violates the sherman act in two ways.first,it asserts that the refusal to grant cnp merchants a payment guarantee similar to that accorded cp merchants is the result of an unlawful conspiracy not to compete with respect to the costs or risks of cnp fraud and chargebacks.second,it contends that the systematic imposition of chargeback fines and penalties reflects an agreement among mastercard members to fix the price that merchants like paycom pay for this fraud.
lack of antitrust standing 
paycom complaint does not allege that mastercard requires chargebacks.rather,each issuing bank is free to decide on its own whether to issue a chargeback.moreover,the chargeback is against the acquiring bank,not the merchant.compl.at if the cardholder subsequently disputes the charge and submit
