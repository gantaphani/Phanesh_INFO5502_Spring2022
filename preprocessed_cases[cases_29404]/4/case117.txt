e l consulting,e l,which does business under the name lumber,and wood products,appeal from judge trager dismissal of their complaint against a canadian lumber company and its exclusive distributor.the complaint asserts,among other things,that a distribution agreement between appellees violates section of the sherman act,that the agreement is part of a monopolization scheme,and that the defendants are engaged in unlawful tying of products.we affirm principally because appellants have failed to allege facts that,if proven,would demonstrate harm to competition.
background 
because this is a dismissal under.b for failure to state a claim,we view the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to appellant.leeds meltz,cir.those allegations are as follows.
from until,e l was the distributor of green lumber in new york,new jersey,and pennsylvania for appellees doman industries limited doman and eacom timber sales,a doman subsidiary.the termination of that distribution arrangement gave rise to the present dispute.
green lumber is an inexpensive,durable wood that is often utilized for homebuilding,particularly in the northeast.there is no or green tree the product is a manufactured combination of different woods.doman and eacom together supply percent of the green lumber sold in new york,new jersey,connecticut,rhode island,maryland,delaware,and pennsylvania.
beginning in,e l had an arrangement with doman under which e l would take delivery,but not ownership,of the green lumber products at its port facility in red hook,brooklyn,new york.e l sold the lumber on doman behalf at prices set by doman,and doman provided e l with set monthly payments and commissions.e l had arrangements with two other green distributors,atlantic coast lumber in rhode island and futter lumber in delaware.
by,doman had severed its relationship with atlantic coast lumber.to replace atlantic coast,doman contracted with appellee sherwood lumber,a new york corporation that sells green finished wood products.under its agreement with doman,sherwood purchased green lumber from doman and resold it out of the port in new london,connecticut.doman prohibited e l from selling lumber in the area served by sherwood.
in,doman cancelled its agreement with futter lumber and replaced it with sherwood.doman continued to prohibit e l from selling green lumber in states served by sherwood.
doman allowed sherwood to purchase doman products outright and resell them itself,but it rejected e l request for the same arrangement.furthermore,doman provided sherwood with substantial discounts or favorable price structures for green lumber as compared to the pricing doman required of e as a consequence,sherwood was able to sell doman lumber for substantially lower prices than doman permitted e for example,doman required e l to sell units of green lumber for while sherwood was able to sell the same thing for.
on january,doman terminated its distribution agreement with e on february,doman notified its customers that sherwood had become the exclusive distributor of doman green lumber in areas previously served by e l,futter,and atlantic coast.
e l alleges that there are no commercially feasible alternative sources of green lumber.only one other company beside doman supplies green it supplies very little.furthermore,no shipping carriers operate a route from the western united states to brooklyn,and,consequently,the only way to get lumber from timber west is by rail.this increases the cost of the lumber by more than percent,rendering it uncompetitive for resale.in addition,the only ocean shipping line transporting lumber from canada to new york told e l that no shipments of lumber products could be made for an indefinite period of time.e l alleges that doman reservation of all potential shipping methods was intended to prevent e l and other distributors from obtaining an alternative source of supply.
e l asserts that only a handful of other types of lumber are suitable for the framing of homes,and they cost percent more than green,which precludes these products from being adequate substitutions.once sherwood obtained exclusive distribution rights in the northeast,it raised the price of green lumber by,in some cases,over percent.
finally,sherwood is now requiring customers who want to purchase green lumber also to purchase sherwood finished wood products.in the market for finished wood products,sherwood is a competitor of plaintiff wood products.the complaint alleges that doman and sherwood conspired to allow sherwood to purchase green lumber at a substantially reduced price so as to enable sherwood to tie the sale of this product to the sale of finished wood products,such as plywood,and to drive sherwood competitors out of business.
in february,e l and wood products brought suit against doman and sherwood.their amended complaint asserts five claims under the federal antitrust laws i that the distribution agreement violates section of the sherman act,ii that the defendants have engaged in a monopolization scheme in violation of section of the sherman act,iii that defendants violated section of the clayton act,iv that they engaged in an illegal tying scheme in violation of sections and of the sherman act and v that they have engaged in illegal price discrimination in violation of section of the act.the complaint seeks treble damages under section of the clayton act.the complaint also alleges state law claims including breach of contract,tortious interference with contract,and violations of new york general business law.
on june,doman and sherwood separately moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim.in a memorandum and order dated march,the district court granted the motions.e l consulting,doman indus,d.
the district court indicated that it was inclined to dismiss the suit against doman as a matter of comity because doman was in the canadian equivalent of chapter bankruptcy id.at.it nevertheless resolved the claims on substantive antitrust rather than procedural comity grounds in order to avoid unnecessary duplicative litigation.id.at.
the district court concluded that plaintiffs federal antitrust claims failed because the complaint did not adequately allege a relevant product market,id.at,or injury cognizable under the antitrust laws,id.at.with no remaining federal questions,judge trager declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.id.at.the present appeal ensued.

b section claim 
appellants sherman act section claim,based on the distribution agreement,fails because they have not alleged an injury to competition,an element of a prima facie section claim 
section prohibits e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations.it has long been recognized that congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints.state oil khan,d.a violation of section generally requires a combination or other form of concerted action between two legally distinct entities resulting in an unreasonable restraint on trade.geneva pharms.tech.barr labs,cir.if a restraint alleged is among that small class of actions that courts have deemed to have such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect,and such limited potential for procompetitive benefit,it will be unreasonable per se.state oil,at.most antitrust claims,however,are analyzed under a rule of reason analysis which seeks to determine if the alleged restraint is unreasonable because its anticompetitive effects outweigh its procompetitive
