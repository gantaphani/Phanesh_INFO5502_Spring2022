plaintiffs,county of tuolumne the county and eric runte,a family practitioner,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on their claims of antitrust violations under section of the sherman act,for restraint of trade,conspiracy to boycott,and illegal tying the alleged restraint is a change in the credentialing,or privileging,criteria for physicians by sonora community hospital sch.the change essentially forecloses a class of medical service the service market.
for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants.
factual and procedural background 
sonora,california,has two hospitals,defendant sch and tuolumne general hospital tgh.sch,a,private hospital,has the second highest rate in the adventist west health care system,of which it is a part.christopher mills and defendant obstetricians,teel,lawrence brunel,and louis erich defendant obs,have privileges to perform at sch they are all members of the sch department the ob department,but are not employees of sch.defendant obs have arrangements to cover one another patients.
tgh is operated by the county.it closed its obstetrics facility in because,according to plaintiffs expert,it was uneconomical.tgh considered its inpatient obstetrics facility in the early,but a feasibility study concluded that it would not be,given the anticipated number of deliveries and the other demands on the hospital resources.tgh,however,operated an ambulatory care clinic the clinic.the clinic was staffed by a nurse midwife and primarily provided prenatal services for women entitled to which provides medical benefits to certain disabled persons in california.tgh contracted with defendant obs and mills to provide supervision for the clinic.
in,tgh hired runte as medical director of the clinic and terminated its contract with the obs.runte is not an employee of sch,but is a member of sch general family practice department fp department,of which charles waldman is chair.runte does deliver babies and charges only for vaginal deliveries,while brunel,teel,and erich charge.runte had performed around during his family practice residency program.to gain more experience,runte took additional night and weekend calls during his residency,which he completed in.
runte applied for privileges to perform deliveries at sch in february.sch was in the process of approving new criteria restricting who could obtain privileges.under the new privileging criteria,could only be performed by or obstetricians or by those doctors who had completed a residency program in.runte did not meet these criteria and was denied privileges.
at sch,privileging criteria,including the privileges at issue in this case,are generally drafted by the relevant department.the criteria must be approved by the medical executive committee the mec and sch governing board the board.the mec is comprised of the department chairs,several committee chairs,the chief of staff who is also a board member,and the administrator,lary davis,who does not vote.two of the three defendant obs,erich and brunel,were members of the mec when it recommended the privileging criteria to the board fp department chair waldman was also on the mec.
the board is the final on hospital privileging criteria.none of defendant obs was a member of the board.many board members were community representatives or had backgrounds in administration.
in,kathleen mutchler,sch medical staff coordinator,had recommended that all departments adopt bundled privileges lists,which would group privileges into categories depending on the training and skill required.brunel,who became ob department chair in,drafted the department privileging list and placed in the category of procedures involving high risk requiring special training.the ob department voted to recomment the draft privilege criteria to the mec.brunel presented the draft privileging criteria to the mec in july.runte gave a presentation to the mec,opposing the proposed privileging criteria.at runte urging,the mec formed a task force to advise it on the privileging criteria.the task force was comprised of members of the california academy of family practitioners and the american college of obstetrics and gynecology.the mec made it clear that neither it nor the board would be bound by the task force recommendation.in the following months,mutchler also conducted a telephone survey of seven regional hospitals and found that none granted privileges to family practitioners.in addition,brunel,erich,and karen wright wrote letters to sch,stating that board certification in obstetrics was a proper standard for eligibility.
when the mec met to vote in early november,the task force report had not yet been completed.the task force did,however,furnish the mec with a summary of its findings.it advised that privileges should be based on competence,training,and expertise,rather than specialty.the task force recommended that runte be eligible for privileges.
at the november meeting,runte opposed the ob department proposed privileging criteria.teel also addressed the mec and read a letter to it that he had written.in it,he stated that runte did not have enough surgical experience to perform and asserted that i f the committee proceeds with granting these privileges to runte,each of us in the ob department will then have to individually our present relationship with sonora community hospital.the district court found that the mec devoted more time to this privileging issue than to any other issue in recent memory.by a vote,the mec recommended that the board approve the privilege list.in their declarations,the mec members gave various reasons for their respective votes,including a belief that the standards would provide an optimal level of care for patients.
in late november,the board met to address the mec recommendation.administrator davis reminded the board members of their responsibility to study carefully all issues that the mec recommendation raised and to make their final decisions in the best interest of patient care at the hospital.the board members were provided with pages of documents.they tabled the matter until january,to allow members more time to carefully study the material.the board also had further information gathered.mutchler expanded her survey to nine additional regional hospitals and expanded her questions.she found that of the hospitals surveyed did not grant privileges to family practitioners.
the board met to vote in january.runte had sent a letter,and both runte and fp department chair waldman addressed the board to oppose the proposed privileging criteria.runte acknowledged that certain complications could arise that would require him to request assistance from an obstetrician.teel made a presentation in favor of the proposed criteria.the district court found that board spent more time on this privileging issue than on any other in recent memory.by an,vote,the board approved the privileging criteria as submitted by the mec.the board has never voted in a manner inconsistent with a recommendation of the mec with regard to privileges.
the board members decisions,as stated in their declarations,were affected by the fact that adequate,superior care already existed and thus there was no need to lower the standard and potentially compromise patient care.they were also concerned that the hospital itself could be subject to liability if it acted in a manner that was not in the best interest of its patients by lowering the standard for privileges.
plaintiffs filed this action alleging violations of section of the sherman act,for restraint of trade,conspiracy to boycott,and illegal tying.plaintiffs also claimed violations of section of the sherman act,for attempted monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize.plaintiffs further alleged antitrust violations under the cartwright act,cal.bus.et,unfair competition,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,and defamation of runte by teel.
the district court granted summary judgment for defendants on the all of the federal and state antitrust claims,the unfair competition claim,and,in a separate order,the defamation claims.the district court denied defendants summary judgment motion on the state law tortious interference claim.pursuant to a stipulation between the parties,plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the tortious interference claim,and the district court entered judgment dismissing the action on the merits.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal the district court then entered a modified order directing entry of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,even though the tortious interference claim remained.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over the federal antitrust claims under,and,and supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims under a.
the district court judgment dismissing the action on the merits is a final judgment over which we have jurisdiction under.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see margolis ryan,cir.under federal rule of civil procedure c,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
in the context of antitrust cases,the supreme court has clarified that w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party,there is no genuine issue for trial.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.although antitrust cases are sometimes difficult to resolve on summary judgment because of their factual complexity,summary judgment is still appropriate in certain cases.see bhan nme,cir.
iv.discussion 
we have held that the antitrust laws apply to hospitals in the same manner that they apply to all other sectors of the economy.health care providers are exposed to the same liability and entitled to the same defenses as businesses in other industries.boulware nevada,dep t of human resources,cir.the supreme court has acknowledged,however,a hospital unquestioned right to exercise some control over the identity and the number of doctors to whom it accords staff privileges.jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d see laje thomason,cir observing that the decision of a hospital governing body concerning the granting of hospital privileges is to be accorded great deference.
to establish a claim under section of the sherman act,plaintiffs must show that there was a contract,combination,or conspiracy that the agreement unreasonably restrained trade under either a per se rule of illegality or a rule of reason analysis and that the restraint affected interstate commerce.bhan,at citation omitted.
conspiracy 
the district court properly granted summary judgment for defendants on the conspiracy claims because plaintiffs did not adduce prima facie proof of the existence of a conspiracy.plaintiffs can not survive summary judgment because they have presented neither direct nor circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that defendants had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.monsanto serv,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
direct evidence 
a claim will survive a motion for summary judgment if there is direct evidence of a conspiracy.see arizona standard oil in re coordinated pretrial proceedings in petroleum prods.antitrust litig,cir.we have noted that d irect evidence in a section conspiracy must be evidence that is explicit and requires no inferences to establish the proposition or conclusion being asserted.bottling archer daniels midland in re citric acid litig,cir quoting jacob blinder sons,gerber prods.in re baby food antitrust litig,cir,cert.denied sub,gangi.packing cargill,d.
in oltz peter cmty,cir,for instance,we found direct evidence of a conspiracy,between a hospital and a group of anesthesiologists.the plaintiff,a nurse anesthesiologist,and the anesthesiologists had feuded for a substantial period,and the anesthesiologists had threatened to leave if the plaintiff remained.we further noted that minutes from the hospital board of trustees meeting indicated that the board knew about the threat and feared the quality of the hospital might deteriorate as a result.id.
plaintiffs rely on the letter written by teel,which he read aloud at the november mec meeting and submitted to the board.it states 
the obstetricians and the department of obstetrics and pediatrics wants this committee to be aware that we are opposed to this expansion of privileges.we want to be sure that the record reflects our opposition and that we,as individuals as a department,do not wish to bear the responsibility of such a decision.
if the committee proceeds with granting these privileges,each of us will then have to individually our present relationship with sonora community hospital.
the letter was written on teel own letterhead and was signed only by him.that letter does not constitute direct evidence of a conspiracy because it does not evidence a meeting of minds between defendant obs and the mec or the board.monsanto,at.in contrast to the hospital board minutes in oltz,nothing in the record indicates that teel letter in any way affected the mec or board members decisions to deny privileges to runte.further,the letter was written on teel own letterhead and he was the only one to sign it.there is no evidence that the other defendant obs even knew about the threat.
the supreme court held in monsanto that threats that were followed through can constitute direct evidence that is relevant and persuasive as to a meeting of minds.id.at.see oltz,at.unlike in monsanto,even assuming that the other defendant obs knew about the threat,there is no evidence in the record that they would follow through with it.the letter alone simply does not constitute direct evidence of a conspiracy that is explicit and requires no inferences.in re citric acid,at.
circumstantial evidence 
even though we find no direct evidence of a conspiracy,we must determine whether the evidence establishes a conspiracy through circumstantial evidence.we conclude that it does not.
relying on the supreme court analysis in matsushita,at,this circuit has outlined a test to be applied when a plaintiff relies solely on circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy to sustain a section violation.see in re citric acid,at.a defendant can rebut an allegation of conspiracy by showing a plausible and justifiable reason for its conduct that is consistent with proper business practice.id.quoting richards neilsen freight lines,cir.the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to provide specific evidence tending to show that the defendant was not engaging in permissible competitive behavior.id.
defendants have shown a plausible and justifiable reason for establishing the privileging criteria.id.the setting of privileging criteria by a hospital is consistent with providing quality patient care and keeping insurance costs manageable.the burden,therefore,shifts back to plaintiffs to provide specific evidence tending to show that the defendants were not engaging in permissible competitive behavior and tending to exclude the possibility that defendants acted independently.id.at.even viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,none of the evidence excludes the possibility that the board acted independently.the mec and the board spent more time on the privileging issue than on any other in the past.they had multiple meetings,heard extensive testimony,and reviewed numerous documents.
as the eleventh circuit has noted,simply because the board is likely to follow the recommendations of the medical staff does not establish,or even reasonably suggest,the existence of a conspiracy.the plaintiff argument eviscerates the agreement requirement of section.todorov dch healthcare,cir.we find this analysis persuasive.even though the board has never disagreed with an mec recommendation on privileges,the board did not merely rubber stamp the mec recommendation.the board also did not become the cat paw to defendant obs or davis rather,the board properly reviewed a plethora of information and made a valid,independent decision regarding privileging criteria
