milk and milk products constitute an important source of nutrition for the people of the state of california,supplying various essential nutrients.they also amount to a substantial economic resource,since the state dairy industry,which is the nation largest,is the state leading agricultural enterprise.
the cause before us involves milk,in the form commonly called whole milk,and milk products,in the forms commonly called lowfat milk and skim milk,and the interplay of the laws of the united states and those of the state of california as they apply thereto.
we granted review to resolve an issue concerning certain statutory provisions relating to whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,specifically,state provisions that are more stringent and federal provisions that are less stringent.
the question is whether the more stringent state provisions alone apply or whether the less stringent federal provisions are applicable as alternatives.
the answer,as we shall explain,is that the more stringent state provisions alone apply.
the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act act of june,ch,et,stat.et was enacted by congress in,has subsequently been amended,and is codified at section et of title of the united states code.it provides for the establishment of standards of identity,labeling requirements,for various foods in interstate commerce,including milk and milk products.a standard of identity generally defines a food and lists its components,and hence is sometimes referred to as a standard of composition to the extent that it contains both the definition and the list.the statute is implemented by regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services through the commissioner of food and drugs,which are codified in title of the code of federal regulations.
the milk and milk products act of was enacted in the year indicated stats,ch,et,et,was given its title in stats,ch,et,has subsequently been amended,and is codified at section et of the food and agricultural code.it establishes standards of identity,labeling requirements,for milk and milk products in california.it makes it unlawful for any person to sell or deliver any milk or milk product that does not conform to its provisions.food.it declares that a person shall not make or cause to be made any statement in connection with the sale or delivery of any milk or milk product that is false,deceptive,or misleading in any manner.
regulations implementing the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act establish a standard of identity for whole milk,and through,which includes the period pertinent here,established standards of identity for lowfat milk,former and skim milk,former as well.whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk are each essentially composed of water,milkfat,and nonfat milk solids,each carrying its nutrients,including calories,fat,cholesterol,sodium,carbohydrates,protein,vitamins,and calcium and other minerals,in its milkfat and nonfat milk solids.the federal standards of identity effectively set the maximum minimum percentages of water,milkfat,and nonfat milk solids.
for its part,the milk and milk products act of establishes standards of identity for whole milk food,lowfat milk,percent fat milk,percent fat milk,and skim milk.again,whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk are each essentially composed of water,milkfat,and nonfat milk solids,each carrying its nutrients in its milkfat and nonfat milk solids.the state standards of identity are like the federal standards in effectively setting the maximum minimum percentages of water,milkfat,and nonfat milk solids.the state standards of identity are unlike the federal standards in the percentages that they set.among other things,the state standards of identity require a higher percentage of nonfat milk solids than the federal resulting,for example,in a higher percentage of protein and calcium,sometimes substantially so.usually,such higher percentage does not occur naturally,but must be achieved through addition.the state standards of identity are more stringent than the federal standards.they date back almost years to their ultimate source.see stats,ch.
the nutrition labeling and education act of hereafter the nlea,et,stat.et,which was enacted by congress in the year indicated,has subsequently been amended,and is codified in section et of title of the united states code.it deals with standards of identity,labeling requirements,for foods in interstate commerce.in section a,as amended and codified in section a of title,the act declares a rule of preemption a state may not directly or indirectly establish or continue in effect any standard of identity,labeling requirement,for practically any food in interstate commerce that is not identical to a federal counterpart,if one exists.also in section a,codified in section b of title,the act provides for an exception to its rule of preemption the secretary of health and human services may administratively exempt a state therefrom upon its petition.by the act term,the rule of preemption does not apply,and an exception is not needed,to the extent that any food is not in interstate commerce.see.
through the director of the department of food and is now styled the secretary of food and agriculture food,the state of california,in,filed a petition for administrative exemption from the nlea rule of preemption covering the less stringent federal standards of identity for whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,and,in,filed a superseding petition to the same effect,in which it expressly declined to seek exemption from the rule of preemption covering federal labeling nomenclature.
before the secretary of health and human services acted on the state of california petition for administrative exemption,the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of hereafter faira was enacted by congress,effective april,et,stat.et in section of faira,which is codified at section of title of the united states code,congress granted the state of california alone a statutory exemption from,inter alia,the federal standards of identity for whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,declaring that n othing in any provision of law including the nlea shall be construed to preempt,prohibit,or otherwise limit the authority of the state of california,directly or indirectly,to establish or continue to sic in effect any law,regulation,or requirement regarding,among other things,standards of identity for whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk.see generally shamrock farms veneman cir.
on july,the people of the state of california,by the attorney general,then daniel lungren and now bill lockyer,brought this action in the superior court of san diego county against shamrock foods company,under section et of the business and professions code,the unfair competition law stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,fn,d,for violations of the milk and milk products act of with respect to whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk.
by way of complaint,the people made allegations,in pertinent part,to the following effect shamrock is an arizona corporation with offices in san diego county on and after april,day after faira became sold and delivered whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk that did not meet the state standards of identity,and made,or caused to be made,statements in connection therewith that were false,deceptive,or misleading because it failed to disclose that these foods did not meet these standards in so doing,it victimized elderly disabled persons and,in its activities in the marketplace,it generally engaged in unfair competition,to the detriment of consumers and others.on the basis of such allegations,the people sought relief in the form of civil penalties and preliminary and permanent injunctions.
in answering the complaint,shamrock set out an affirmative defense that would take this form section of the food and agricultural code hereafter sometimes section,one of the provisions of the milk and milk products act of,adopted the less stringent federal standards of identity for milk and milk products,including whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,as alternatives to the more stringent state standards shamrock whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk met the former if not the latter.
on the people motion,the superior court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting shamrock from violating the milk and milk products act of by selling or delivering any whole milk,lowfat milk,or skim milk that did not meet its state standard of identity.
trial was to the superior court without a jury.the people and shamrock disputed whether section adopted the less stringent federal standards of identity for milk and milk products,including whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,as alternatives to the more stringent state standards.they also disputed whether shamrock had violated the preliminary injunction,and if so,whether it had done so intentionally.they did not dispute,however,that shamrock whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk met the federal standards of identity all the evidence was that they did.neither did they dispute that shamrock whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk did not meet the state standards of identity shamrock admitted that they did not.
in a statement of decision following trial,the superior court made findings of fact and conclusions of law favorable to the people and unfavorable to shamrock.among which were these section did not adopt the less stringent federal standards of identity for milk and milk products,including whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,as alternatives to the more stringent state standards shamrock violated the milk and milk products act of by selling and delivering whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk that did not meet the state standards of identity,and by failing to disclose the fact that they did not and it had intentionally violated the preliminary injunction by violating the act by selling and delivering whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk of this sort.alongside its statement of decision,the superior court expressed an underlying view to the effect that,in its activities in the marketplace,shamrock conducted itself in bad faith solely to serve its own interests,and that,in this action,its position was altogether unsupported in either law or fact.
the superior court rendered judgment for the people and against shamrock,and caused entry thereof it permanently enjoined shamrock from selling or delivering any whole milk,lowfat milk,or skim milk that did not meet its state standard of identity it ordered shamrock to pay civil penalties in the amount of,comprising for violating the milk and milk products act of and for intentionally violating the preliminary injunction and it ordered shamrock to pay the people costs in the amount of.
after shamrock filed a notice of appeal in the superior court,an appeal was docketed in the court of appeal for the fourth appellate district,and was assigned to division one.
by a judgment announced in a unanimous opinion certified for publication,the court of appeal reversed the judgment of the superior court.shamrock had presented several claims.the court of appeal reached only one.it subjected to independent review the superior court construction of section.it proceeded to reject it out of hand.it concluded that the plain meaning of section demonstrated that the provision did indeed adopt the less stringent federal standards of identity for milk and milk products,including whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,as alternatives to the more stringent state standards.it then stated that it found nothing in the legislative history of the bill that added section that contradict ed its conclusion concerning the provision plain meaning.inasmuch as it was not disputed that shamrock whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk met the federal standards of identity,it determined that the superior court judgment was unsupported as a matter of law.
the people filed a petition for review we granted the application.we now reverse.
the issue that we address on review concerns the proper construction of section,one of the provisions of the milk and milk products act of 
the question is does section adopt the less stringent federal standards of identity for milk and milk products,including whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,as alternatives to the more stringent state standards 
the answer,as we shall explain,is 
section provides any milk or milk product that is subject to a standard of identity or standard of composition defined in the milk and milk products act of may be specially formulated or processed to lower the content of its milkfat,alter its milkfat composition,or otherwise modify its nutrient profile to the extent that it will not comply with the compositional requirements of its standard of identity or composition.these modified foods shall be labeled in accordance with the applicable provisions of title of the code of federal regulations.here,as elsewhere,the phrase standard of composition is a descriptive variant of standard of identity insofar as it both defines a food and lists its components.see food.
section was added by assembly bill reg.sess.hereafter sometimes assembly bill,in place of an older version with the same number,which dealt with labeling requirements for milk product s and product s resembling milk product s stats,ch.the bill fell within the pendency of the state petition for administrative exemption from the nlea rule of preemption covering the less stringent federal standards of identity for whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,but not federal labeling nomenclature.the bill was mentioned in the petition as a measure to bring state labeling nomenclature into line with federal.
assembly bill was sponsored,and drafted,by the dairy institute of california,which did not favor the establishment of the less stringent federal standards of identity for milk and milk products,including whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,as alternatives to the more stringent state standards.
as introduced,assembly bill would have changed existing law in a single way,by modifying state labeling nomenclature for one form of lowfat milk.assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.
as amended,assembly bill would have changed existing law in additional ways.it would have repealed state standards of identity for specified milk not whole milk,lowfat milk,or skim would have added federal standards in their place through.amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.for example,it would have repealed the state standard of identity for sherbet sherbet is a frozen product which contains milk or products of milk,and may contain approved sweetening,harmless flavoring,and coloring food,as enacted by stats,ch,and would have added the federal standard in its place through sherbet is a food that complies with section of title of the code of federal regulations amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.it would also have added section in its present form,with the substantive exception that the provision would have covered a ny milk product amend.to assem.bill reg.sess,and not a ny milk or milk product food.
as further amended,assembly bill would have changed existing law in one additional way.it would have added section in its present form,covering a ny milk or milk product.amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.may.
as so amended,assembly bill was enacted.stats,ch,et.
the meaning of the first of assembly bill three cited modification of state labeling nomenclature for one form of lowfat plain from what it effected.it conformed state labeling nomenclature to federal.it did not,however,conform any state standard of identity for any milk or milk product to any federal standard,including that for the form of lowfat milk in question it did not even purport to affect any such standard of identity in any way.indeed,from all that appears,it conformed state labeling nomenclature to federal in order not to conform the more stringent state standards of identity for whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk to the less stringent federal standards.or more precisely,it conformed state labeling nomenclature to federal in order to enhance the likelihood of favorable federal action on the state petition for administrative exemption from the nlea rule of preemption,which did not cover federal labeling nomenclature.com.on agr.and wat.resources,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced,accord,com.on agr.and wat.resources,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
the meaning of the second of assembly bill three cited repealing of state standards of identity for specified milk products and the adding of federal standards in their place through also plain from what it effected.it conformed the state standards of identity for those specified foods to the federal standards.it did not,however,conform the state standard of identity for whole milk,lowfat milk,or skim milk to the federal standard it simply did not even touch on the standard of identity for any of these foods.
not plain,at least at first glance,is the meaning of the third of assembly bill three cited addition of section.
considered in isolation,section presents more questions than answers.how should we understand the provision first sentence any milk or milk product that is subject to a standard of identity established in the milk and milk products act of may be specially formulated or processed to modify its nutrient profile to the extent that it will not comply with the compositional requirements of its standard of identity food.even if we take the awkward clause allowing modification of any milk or milk product to the extent that it will not comply with its standard of identity,as we evidently ought,to carry the sense so as not to comply therewith,we are still left to wonder how far may the modification extend for example,to removing all milkfat and all nonfat milk solids from whole milk,with only water remaining next,how should we understand the provision second sentence these modified foods shall be labeled in accordance with the applicable provisions of title of the code of federal regulations.ibid.title contains provisions relating to labeling in both its formal aspects,dealing with appearance,and its substantive aspects,dealing with content.which come into play formal substantive both 
considered in context,however,section presents answers to all of its questions.
part of title of the code of federal regulations hereafter sometimes part was the model for section.by its own terms,part does two things it prescribes a general standard of identity for any food that substitute s for a standardized food and use s the name of that standardized food but do es not comply with its standard of identity because of a deviation that is described by a nutrient content claim defined in title former a accord,a,such as fat free,low calorie,or light,and it requires the labeling of any such substitute food in conformity with both the name of the standardized food and also the defined nutrient content claim former a accord,a.in other words,part prescribe s a general standard of identity for substitute foods named by use of a defined nutrient content claim in conjunction with a traditional standardized name,and requires conforming labeling therefor.
the purpose underlying part is to provid e for modified versions of certain standardized foods that bear descriptive names that are meaningful to consumers,without the and unnecessarily wasteful promulgation of a large number of individual standards of identity and labeling requirements.the purpose is not to adopt alternative standards of identity,whether more or less stringent.indeed,part fails to refer to alternative standards of identity of any kind.
read in light of part,on which it was modeled,section may similarly be understood to do two things to prescribe a general standard of identity for any milk or milk product that substitutes for,and uses the name of,a standardized milk or milk product,but that deviates from the latter standard of identity as indicated in a defined nutrient content claim and to require the labeling of any such substitute milk or milk product in conformity with both the name of the standardized milk or milk product and also the applicable nutrient content claim.
it is true that section does not provide thus in express terms.but it does so by implication.
first,section prescribes a general standard of identity.it covers a ny milk or milk product that is subject to a standard of identity established in the milk and milk products act of,and not a specific milk or milk product subject to a specific standard of identity.food,italics added.for certain milk products,the standards of identity established in the act,through,are federal standards.for whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk,however,the standards of identity established in the act,solely according to its own terms,are strictly state standards.
second,section concerns itself with substitutes for a standardized milk or milk like its predecessor,which dealt in part with product s resembling milk product s stats,ch,italics added.it characterizes the milk or milk product in question broadly as modified.food.it characterizes it more narrowly as specially formulated or processed to modify its nutrient profile.ibid.it does not define the phrase nutrient profile which occurs only here in the milk and milk products act of and,indeed,only here in all of california statutory law.the phrase,however,suggests its own definition,namely,a mix including calories,fat,cholesterol,sodium,carbohydrates,protein,vitamins,and calcium and other minerals.
third,section deals with any covered substitute milk or milk product that uses the name of a standardized milk or milk product.it does not itself provide for any such name,which must be obtained elsewhere in the milk and milk products act of,as for sherbet food.
fourth,section likewise deals with any covered substitute milk or milk product that deviates from the standard of identity for the standardized milk or milk product as indicated in a defined nutrient content claim.it can not reasonably be deemed to allow any and all deviation.otherwise,it would tolerate,for example,the removal of all milkfat and all nonfat milk solids from whole milk,with only water untenable result.rather,it must reasonably be taken to allow only such deviation as indicated in a nutrient content claim that is defined in title of the code of federal regulations,to which it refers.
fifth and final,section requires the labeling of any covered substitute milk or milk product in conformity with both the name of the standardized milk or milk product and also the applicable nutrient content like its predecessor,which dealt,inter alia,with labeling requirements for product s resembling milk product s stats,ch.it mandates that a covered substitute milk or milk product must be labeled in accordance with the applicable provisions of title of the code of federal regulations food,which themselves mandate the labeling of a covered substitute food in conformity with both the name of the standardized food and also the applicable nutrient content claim.
the purpose underlying section is like that underlying part,which,as stated,is to provid e for modified versions of certain standardized foods that bear descriptive names that are meaningful to consumers,without the and unnecessarily wasteful promulgation of a large number of individual standards of identity and labeling requirements.see assem.com.on,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
the purpose underlying section is not to adopt alternative standards of identity,whether more or less stringent.section fails to refer to alternative standards of identity of any kind.it could readily have done so,as through for illustration,any milk or milk product that is subject to a standard of identity established in the milk and milk products act of may be specially formulated or processed to comply with the analogous standard of identity of title of the code of federal regulations.but the fact is,section simply makes no reference whatsoever to any alternative standard of identity.it can not reasonably be treated as though it did.indeed,so far as whole milk,lowfat milk,and skim milk are concerned,it can not even conceivably be thought to implicate any federal standard of identity of any sort.for certain milk products,the standards of identity that section allows deviation from,albeit only as indicated in a defined nutrient content claim,are f
