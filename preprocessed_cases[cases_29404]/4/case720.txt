this appeal requires us to decide whether business and professions code section a more specific repeals section more general one that covers the same subject.section,the more specific statute,mandates disciplinary action against a medical licensee based on discipline that would have been grounds for discipline in california,whereas section,the more general statute,permits state licensing boards to impose discipline based on a disciplinary action taken by another state.
the trial court concluded that a physician can be disciplined only under the more specific statute,section,relying on the principle that a general provision is controlled by one that is special,the latter being treated as an exception to the former.san francisco taxpayers board of supervisors cal th,d.it therefore ruled that the medical board of california sometimes referred to as the board exceeded its jurisdiction by imposing the suspension of the license of a physician on the basis of section.
we disagree.as we shall explain,while sections and overlap,that does not necessarily mean that the more specific,that is,impliedly repeals,the general one.a ll presumptions are against a repeal by implication.citations.implied repeals may be found only where there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two potentially conflicting statutes citation,and the statutes are so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.that is not the case here.
instead,the two statutes here can be reconciled by treating section as an exception to,but not as a replacement of,section.section,subdivision a,permits any licensing board under the jurisdiction of the state department of consumer affairs to impose discipline based on a disciplinary action taken by another state,a federal agency,or another country.its language and origins suggest that it was meant to act as a catchall statute,granting licensing boards broad authority to impose discipline.that it was meant to coexist with specific statutes,like section,is demonstrated in part by section express acknowledgement elsewhere that it does not preclude the administration of more specific statutes by specialized licensing boards.section,in contrast,requires disciplinary action against a medical licensee based on discipline imposed by another jurisdiction,but only where the other jurisdiction action would have been grounds for discipline in california.since the record in this case does not show that the requirements of the more specific statute,section,were satisfied,the two statutes do not even conflict in this matter,and there is no reason why section can not be applied.
in fact,the very case cited by the trial francisco taxpayers board of supervisors,supra,cal th at page,d,a special provision as an exception to,but not as a wholesale replacement of,a general provision.to do otherwise and treat the enactment of a specific statute as an implied repeal of a general one where the statutes are not so inconsistent that they can not have concurrent operation,would condone a judicially inspired repeal of a statute without satisfying the stringent standards required for finding an implied designed to act as a legal bulwark against judicial trespass into the legislative province.
our approach not only comports with settled principles of statutory construction,including the duties to avoid implied repeals and to reconcile two statutes dealing with the same subject but it recognizes this court constitutional role of construing,not rewriting or worse,writing out,duly enacted statutes.
accordingly,we shall issue a peremptory writ of mandate,directing the respondent superior court to set aside its judgment and remanding the matter for further consideration in light of this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
since,anselm lam lam the real party in interest been licensed and registered to practice medicine and surgery in the states of wisconsin and california.
at some point,the wisconsin medical examining board initiated an investigation,following an allegation that lam was premature in his attempt to repair a rectovaginal fistula which developed following repair of a fourth degree tear which occurred at the time of a vaginal delivery.
this investigation was concluded,however,by a stipulation of the the need for an evidentiary hearing or any findings.pursuant to the stipulation,lam maintained that he had engaged in no wrongdoing,and the wisconsin medical examining board ordered that lam not repair or attempt to repair rectovaginal fistulas and that he refer patients who have such a condition to a gynecologist for appropriate evaluation and treatment.
thereafter,the medical board of california filed an administrative accusation against lam pursuant to section,alleging that he had been disciplined by wisconsin.
after an administrative hearing at which lam did not appear or introduce evidence,an administrative law judge recommended that lam california license be suspended for days and that he pay in investigative and enforcement costs pursuant to section.the board adopted the recommendation.
lam then petitioned the superior court pursuant to code of civil procedure section for a writ of administrative mandamus,directing the board to set aside its disciplinary action.he argued in large part that the board lacked jurisdiction to discipline him under section because section,the sole basis for the board action,had been supplanted by section,a more specific statute.
the trial court granted lam petition.in response to the board argument that lam lacked standing because his suspension had expired,the court ruled that this matter is not moot even though the term of the suspension expired during the pendency of these proceedings,since the petition was filed while the suspension was in effect.addressing the merits,it concluded that the board exceeded its jurisdiction by imposing the suspension on the basis of section.it explained section is a more specialized statute in that it applies specifically to medical licenses and requires a more specific finding than section.general principles of statutory interpretation hold that a specific statute relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject as against a general provision,even though the general provision standing alone,would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates.see,san francisco taxpayers ass n.board of supervisors,supra,cal th,d.accordingly,the board could only impose discipline based on the wisconsin action under section,after making a finding that the wisconsin action would be grounds for discipline in california the decision was based upon the wrong statute,and did not contain any findings that would support discipline under section.
the board then brought this petition for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its judgment 
discussion 
standard of review 
under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,the inquiry in an administrative mandamus proceeding is whether the agency has proceeded in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.
here,the trial court determined that the board exceeded its jurisdiction because its decision was based on the wrong statute.
on review in this court,questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law warranting independent review.
lam beneficial interest 
we address preliminarily the board assertion that lam lacked standing to petition the trial court for writ relief because his suspension had expired during the pendency of the proceeding.this argument conflates standing and mootness.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision g provides,in relevant part,that w here any final administrative order or decision is the subject of proceedings under this section,if the petition shall have been filed while the penalty imposed is in full force and effect,the determination shall not be considered to have become moot in cases where the penalty imposed by the administrative agency has been completed or complied with during the pendency of the proceedings.
the board concedes that w hen lam writ was filed,his suspension was still in effect,thus bringing the provision of code of civ il proc edure section,subdivision g into effect.but the board argues that although the controversy may not be moot,lam nevertheless lacks a beneficial interest,for the court can do nothing for him he is no longer aggrieved by the board disciplinary order and can practice medicine in california without restriction or limitation of any kind.
we disagree.mootness has been described as the doctrine of standing set in a time frame the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation standing must continue throughout its existence mootness.citations.but code of civil procedure section,subdivision g restrains the invocation of mootness where the petitioner had standing at the time the petition was filed.
and lam had standing at the time he filed his petition,as the board concedes.the standing requirement for a party petitioning for a writ of mandate is that the petitioner be beneficially interested.this means that he or she must have some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.citation.this standard is equivalent to the federal injury in fact test,which requires a party to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it has suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.citation.the suspension of lam medical license was an invasion of a legally protected interest 
accordingly,lam had a beneficial interest,which existed at the commencement of the proceeding the claimed loss of this legally beneficial interest during the course of the proceeding is an issue of mootness,which code of civil procedure section,subdivision g,governs and deems not a basis for dismissal 
accordingly,the board contention that lam lacks standing is rejected.
c.the interpretation of sections and 
the board principal argument is that the trial court erred in ruling that section,as the more specialized statute,governs over section,the more general statute.
the statutes in issue 
section provides 
a for any licensee holding a license issued by a board under the jurisdiction of the department of consumer affairs,a disciplinary action taken by another state,by any agency of the federal government,or by another country for any act substantially related to the practice regulated by the california license,may be a ground for disciplinary action by the respective state licensing board.a certified copy of the record of the disciplinary action taken against the licensee by another state,an agency of the federal government,or another country shall be conclusive evidence of the events related therein.
b nothing in this section shall preclude a board from applying a specific statutory provision in the licensing act administered by that board that provides for discipline based upon a disciplinary action taken against the licensee by another state,an agency of the federal government,or another country.
section provides 
the revocation,suspension,or other discipline,restriction,or limitation imposed by another state upon a license or certificate to practice medicine issued by that state,or the revocation,suspension,or restriction of the authority to practice medicine by any agency of the federal government,that would have been grounds for discipline in california of a licensee under this chapter,shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct against the licensee in this state.
thus,both sections and authorize the board to initiate a disciplinary action against a physician based upon disciplinary action taken by another jurisdiction.however,section requires that the discipline,restriction,or limitation imposed by the other jurisdiction be grounds for discipline in california,whereas there is no such limitation in section.on the other hand,section is permissive,whereas section is mandatory section provides that a disciplinary action taken by another jurisdiction may be a ground for disciplinary action by the board section states that the discipline,restriction,or limitation imposed by the other jurisdiction shall constitute grounds for discipline,where it is based on actions that would have been grounds for discipline in california.finally,section authorizes disciplinary action based on discipline taken by a foreign country,whereas section is silent on that point.
accordingly,the more general the board to consider disciplinary action based on discipline taken by another state,a federal agency,or another country,whereas the more specific statute section disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct,but only where the discipline,restriction,or limitation imposed by the other jurisdiction would be grounds for discipline in california.section is broader in scope,but overlaps with section in any case where the disciplinary action taken by the other state or federal agency is based on actions that would have been grounds for discipline in california 
however,as the trial court observed here,there was no finding in the record that wisconsin restriction on lam license was based on what would be a ground for discipline in california.thus,the question facing us is whether section should be construed to impliedly repeal section,where the record does not afford a basis for applying section.
the origins of sections and 
in considering whether section impliedly repeals section,we observe that section more general enacted after section more specific statute.
enacted in section originally provided the revocation,suspension,or other discipline by another state of a license or certificate to practice medicine issued by the state to a licensee under this chapter shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct against such licensee in this state.
a amendment added a clause that provided that the revocation,suspension,or restriction of the authority to practice medicine by any agency of the federal government would also constitute grounds for disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct 
in,the legislature enacted section in its present form at that time,aside from the fact that section covered a broad array of licensees and section only dealt with medical licensees,the only material differences between sections and were that section was phrased permissively and section was phrased in mandatory terms,and that section authorized disciplinary action on the basis of action by a foreign country,while section did not address that circumstance.accordingly,as of january,when section took effect both statutes applied,for the most part,to the same set of circumstances as far as medical licenses were concerned.
in,however,the legislature amended section into its present form and restricted its reach the legislature made two material modifications in addition to various technical changes first,it added restriction or limitation to the list of actions revocation,suspension,or other discipline that could be imposed on an license upon which discipline in california could be based second,it amended the statute to provide that discipline could be imposed in california only where the conduct would have been grounds for discipline in california according to the report of the senate committee on business and professions,this phrase was added because the california medical association was concerned that the proposed amendment to the statute,adding,as grounds for discipline,any restriction or limitation imposed by another state,was drafted so broadly as to make subject to discipline in california,restrictions that are not truly disciplinary in nature,a physician who because of physical handicap has been restricted from practicing in some settings.
in sum,section was enacted after section in a form that largely overlapped with section.but section was amended a year later in a way that restricted its reach.now there was some,but not total,overlap between the statutes.
applying the rules of statutory construction 
general principles 
we now turn to whether section was enacted before section but restricted in scope a year after the latter be construed to impliedly repeal section.we again note that the record in this case does not suggest that both sections and apply.in fact,the trial court specifically found that the board decision did not contain any findings that would support discipline under section.accordingly,we need only decide whether section should apply in the absence of findings that would support invocation of section.
the fundamental task of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in order to determine this intent,we begin by examining the language of the statute.
we may also look to the canons of statutory construction to guide our quest for legislative intent.these include the duty to harmonize statutes on the same subject if possible the presumption against implied repeals and the rule that a specific statute prevails over a general one 
but canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining probable legislative intent.citation.no single canon of statutory construction is an infallible guide to correct interpretation in all circumstances.the canons are tools to assist in interpretation,not the formula that always determines it.a court must be careful lest invocation of a canon cause it to lose sight of its objective to ascertain the legislature intent.
in recognition of the courts constitutional role to construe,not write,statutes,a ll presumptions are against a repeal by implication.it is the duty of this court to harmonize statutes on the same subject citations,giving effect to all parts of all statutes if possible citation.w e will find an implied repeal only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two potentially conflicting statutes citation,and the statutes are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.
significantly,whether the canon invoked is that the specific statute prevails over the general or that the latest statutory expression prevails such canons share the requirement that the enforcement of one duly enacted statute at the expense of another on the same subject only applies when the two statutes can not be reconciled restraint of judicial trespass into the legislative province is no doubt the reason for the rule that a judicially determined repeal requires a repugnancy between the two statutes that prevents their concurrent restraint that has constitutional underpinnings premised on the separation of powers 
with these principles in mind,we turn to the interpretation of the two statutes.
b.the statutory language 
t he statutory language is the best indicator of legislative intent.indeed,the most powerful safeguard for the courts adherence to their constitutional role of construing,rather than writing,statutes is to rely on the statute plain language.
the language of section demonstrates that the legislature did not overlook the existence of specific disciplinary statutes governing particular licensing boards,like section,when it enacted section.thus,it presumably did not intend to repeal them.subdivision b of section provides nothing in this section shall preclude a board from applying a specific statutory provision in the licensing act administered by that board that provides for discipline based upon a disciplinary action taken against the licensee by another state,an agency of the federal government,or another country.
the permissive language of section,subdivision a,its broad reach over all state licensing boards under the jurisdiction of the department of consumer affairs,and the express acknowledgement in subdivision b that section was not meant to preclude the application of specific statutory provisions,suggest that section was meant as a catchall statute that grants disciplinary authority to all licensing boards under the jurisdiction of the department of consumer affairs.
yet,despite section express acknowledgement in subdivision b of the existence of more specific statutes,the legislature did not expressly bar section operation where such a specific statute exists.in contrast,another statute enacted as part of the same statutory scheme bars the operation of the general statute when a specific statutory provision exists.section,which is part of the same chapter as section,authorizes the assessment of investigation and enforcement costs upon the resolution of a disciplinary proceeding before any board within the department of consumer affairs.but subdivision j of that statute states this section does not apply to any board if a specific statutory provision in that board licensing act provides for recovery of costs in an administrative disciplinary proceeding.
the absence of such language in section,enacted two years after section,suggests a different intention than that found in section where a statute,with reference to one subject contains a given provision,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different intention existed.accordingly,the plain language of section,particularly when compared with the language of other statutes in the same chapter,demonstrates that it was intended to coexist with more specific statutes administered by licensing boards,not displace them or be displaced by them.
rule of statutes in pari materia 
application of the relevant canons of statutory construction further bolster our conclusion that section was meant to coexist with more specific statutes like section.
as mentioned,i t is the duty of this court to harmonize statutes on the same subject citations,giving effect to all parts of all statutes if possible citation.
one elementary rule of statutory construction is that statutes in pari is,statutes relating to the same subject be construed together.citation.the rule of in pari materia is a corollary of the principle that the goal of statutory interpretation is to determine legislative intent.
this rule applies even when,as here,one statute deals generally with the subject and another deals with the subject with more specificity even when one statute merely deals generally with a particular subject while the other legislates specially upon the same subject with greater detail and particularity,the two should be reconciled and construed so as to uphold both of them if it is reasonably possible to do so citations.
sections and can be harmonized so as to give effect to both.read together,sections and authorize discipline based upon disciplinary action taken by another jurisdiction,but section mandates disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct when the discipline taken by another state or federal agency would have been grounds for discipline in california.
in short,section can be harmonized if it is considered an exception to,and not a replacement of,section where the special statute is later it will be regarded as an exception to or qualification of the prior general one and where the general act is later the special statute will be considered as remaining an exception to its terms unless it is repealed in general words or by necessary implication.as shown in the next section,this is the proper and restrained manner of applying the canon that the specific statute prevails over the general one.
d.the rule that the specific statute prevails over the general 
the trial court ruled that section,as the more specialized statute,replaced section,citing san francisco taxpayers board of supervisors,supra,cal th at page,d.but that case stated that i t is well settled that a general provision is controlled by one that is special,the latter being treated as an exception to the former.thus,that case did not rule that the more specific statute replaced the more general one it ruled that the more specific statute simply served as an exception to the general one.
in san francisco taxpayers board of supervisors,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court construed proposition,which places a constitutional spending limit on appropriations by the state and local governments.the court sought to determine wh
