in this appeal,we address whether the district court properly granted a patentholder motion for judgment on the pleadings in a competitor antitrust suit.the district court granted the motion because it found that the doctrine immunized elan corporation,plc elan from the maintenance of an antitrust suit based on the allegations of andrx pharmaceuticals,andrx that elan engaged in patent infringement proceedings to improperly protect its monopoly on the market for a controlled release naproxen medication.in addition,the district court found that andrx allegations regarding a licensing agreement entered into by elan and another competitor to settle a separate infringement suit were insufficient to support an antitrust action under the sherman act,and.finally,the district court denied andrx motion for leave to amend its complaint.for the reasons discussed more fully in this opinion,we conclude the district court properly construed the doctrine to immunize elan from liability for its infringement suits,and did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.the district court erred,however,in dismissing andrx claims regarding its settlement agreement with one of andrx competitors.accordingly,the district court order is affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded for further proceedings.
at its core,this litigation concerns the right to manufacture and sell the drug naproxen,an analgesic medication prescribed to treat pain and other disorders.because the complex statutory regulations which govern the manufacture and sale of drugs in the united states provide context for the facts in this case,we will begin by briefly summarizing the relevant statutory provisions,after which we will recount the relevant facts specific to the parties.
the food and drug administration fda must give its approval before any new drug can be marketed or sold in the united states.a.under,different fda approval standards apply depending on the drug the applicant is attempting to market.see valley drug geneva,cir,cert.denied,d.to gain approval for a drug that has not been introduced previously to the market,an applicant must file a new drug application nda and must meet the requirements outlined in b.id.section b requires the submission of exhaustive information about the drug,including reports about the safety and efficacy of the drug.id.to gain approval for a generic,bioequivalent version of a drug which has already gained approval under b,however,an applicant may file an abbreviated new drug application anda,in which the applicant must satisfy the less exhaustive requirements outlined in j.see id.while j allows an anda applicant to satisfy its burden by demonstrating a certain bioequivalency between its drug and a drug approved under b,j does require the anda applicant to certify that the manufacture and sale of its drug would not violate any patents held on the drug approved under b.see j a vii.if an anda applicant certifies that its generic drug would not violate an existing patent,or would only violate a patent on a b approved drug which is invalid,see j a vii iv the anda applicant must notify the patentholder,which is then given days to initiate patent infringement proceedings against the anda applicant,see j b iii.if the patentholder timely initiates such litigation,fda approval for the generic drug will be stayed for up to thirty months,unless the patent being litigated expires or a final determination on the patent validity is reached at an earlier date.id.
against this background of information on drug approval procedures,we proceed to the facts relevant to the parties on appeal.elan was the owner of patent the patent,which granted it the exclusive right to manufacture and sell in the united states a controlled release naproxen medication.in,skyepharma,skyepharma filed an anda application pursuant to j to manufacture and sell a generic version of elan controlled release naproxen medication.in making its application,skyepharma certified pursuant to j a vii iv that its activity would not constitute patent infringement.consequently,pursuant to j b iii,elan initiated patent infringement proceedings against skyepharma.according to andrx complaint,elan and skyepharma settled the litigation by entering into an agreement in which skyepharma admitted to infringing the patent in exchange for a license from elan to manufacture a generic controlled release naproxen medication.because skyepharma was the first filing anda applicant,pursuant to j b iv i,the license agreement effectively would have given skyepharma an exclusive period to market a generic naproxen medication.according to andrx complaint,however,skyepharma had no intention of marketing its generic drug and therefore would never trigger the running of the exclusivity period.accordingly,the settlement agreement had the effect of preventing any generic competition in the controlled release naproxen market and constituted a conspiracy to restrain trade.
in addition to skyepharma alleged attempt to seek fda approval for a generic controlled release naproxen medication,andrx contends that it also sought to introduce a generic naproxen to the market.after andrx filed notice of as required by j b ii,however,elan filed patent infringement proceedings against andrx.according to andrx complaint,elan initiated this litigation despite the absence of any reasonable belief that the claim might fairly be held to be valid upon adjudication,at.andrx alleged that elan could not maintain its suit because the patent had not been validly issued because of inter alia,the scrip publication of june,which advertised its controlled release naproxen in the united states more than one year prior to the filing of the application which resulted in the patent.id.moreover,andrx alleged that elan goal and intention in bringing the infringement proceedings was solely to cause andrx damage from the automatic administrative delay in the approval process pursuant to j b iii.id,at.in addition to these allegations,andrx alleged that elan has engaged in a pattern and practice of baseless and sham litigation against companies seeking to complete andas for generic controlled release naproxen medications.id,at.according to andrx,elan sought through this behavior to preserve its monopoly over the controlled release naproxen market in the united states.id,at.
based on these allegations,andrx filed suit against elan and skyepharma and alleged violations of the sherman act,and,and the florida antitrust laws.stat.chs.and.citing the doctrine and precedent which allowed for the licensing settlement reached by elan and skyepharma,the district court granted elan motion for judgment on the pleadings.in addition,the district court denied andrx motion to amend its complaint on account of andrx undue delay.on appeal,andrx argues that the district court erred in dismissing with prejudice its suit against elan because the district court misconstrued the doctrine and its sham litigation exception.in addition,andrx argues that the district court erred by denying its motion for leave to amend its complaint.
ii.discussion 
judgment on the pleadings 
we review de novo the district court ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.horsley rivera,cir.the application of the doctrine is a question of law,and therefore also reviewed de novo.see tec cogeneration.power light,cir,modified in part on other grounds,cir per curiam.judgment on the pleadings is proper when no issues of material fact exist,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the substance of the pleadings and any judicially noticed facts.see horsley,at.
the sherman act provides that e very contract in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is illegal.the act also proscribes acts which seek to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations.citing the sherman act and the florida antitrust statutes,andrx alleges that elan improperly sought to monopolize the controlled release naproxen market and prevent competition by initiating sham patent infringement litigation against andrx and entering into a settlement agreement with skyepharma which granted skyepharma exclusive licensing rights to manufacture and sell a generic controlled release naproxen medication.we will examine each set of allegations in turn.
patent infringement proceedings 
while the sherman act does proscribe activity in restraint of trade,its reach has been tempered when its invocation would impair the exercise of constitutional rights.recognizing that the first amendment guarantees the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances,const.amend.i,and that this guarantee overrides the effect of a contrary federal statute,see marbury madison,cranch,and not wanting to impute to congress an intent to invade the first amendment right to petition,prof l real estate investors columbia pictures,d internal quotations omitted,the supreme court has held that a defendant is immune from sherman act liability for concerted efforts to petition government to pass legislation which has the effect of restraining or monopolizing trade in favor of the defendant.see presidents conf.noerr motor freight,d granting antitrust immunity for publicity campaign designed to spur the adoption of legislation united mine workers pennington,d noting that noerr shielded a defendant from antitrust liability for efforts to influence public officials even though intended to eliminate competition.subsequent precedent has extended immunity to defendants who exercise their right to petition government by resorting to administrative judicial proceedings.see cal.motor transp.trucking unlimited,d.immunity thus shields a defendant from antitrust liability for resorting to litigation to obtain from a court an anticompetitive outcome.
an exception to the doctrine exists,however,where the defendant engages in sham litigation.prof l real estate investors,at.at see noerr,at.at finding sherman act immunity inappropriate where the exercise of the right to petition was a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.to prevail on the argument that immunity should be abrogated based on the sham litigation exception,a litigant must establish that the lawsuit is objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits and the party bringing the allegedly baseless suit did so with a subjective motivation to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.prof l real estate investors,at.at.construing the first prong of the sham litigation exception test,the court noted that the existence of probable cause to bring a lawsuit is sufficient to thwart a claim that litigation was objectively baseless.see prof l real estate investors,at.at.moreover,the court noted that a winning lawsuit is by definition a reasonable effort at petitioning for redress and therefore not a sham.prof l real estate investors,at.at.
based on this precedent,we agree with the district court that the doctrine shields elan from antitrust liability for filing two patent infringement suits against andrx in relation to the manufacture and sale of controlled release naproxen.the united states constitution expressly permits the government to grant exclusive monopolies in the form of patents,see const.art.i,cl,and therefore the sherman act can not be read to impede a litigant from seeking to defend patent rights.see prof l real estate investors,at.at declining to impute an unconstitutional purpose to sherman act.moreover,as the supreme court has noted,engaging in litigation to seek an anticompetitive outcome from a court is first amendment activity that is immune from antitrust liability.see cal.motor transp,at.at.thus,we conclude immunity was triggered by elan filing suit against andrx.in addition,we conclude that the sham litigation exception is inapplicable.andrx main contention in its complaint that the patent litigation was a sham hinged on its claim that the bar found in was triggered by elan naproxen advertisement in the publication scrip world pharmaceutical news.two courts have subsequently rejected that argument.see elan,plc,d at rejecting argument that the scrip advertisement triggered bar elan,plc,at rejecting the argument that the bar was triggered.thus,while elan may not have won its infringement lawsuit at this point,it certainly has made a winning argument against andrx contentions of patent invalidity.prof l real estate investors,at.at.thus,it is manifest that elan patent infringement proceedings were not objectively baseless,and therefore not a sham.accordingly,because the doctrine applies,and the sham litigation exception is inapplicable,the district court properly found that elan was immunized from antitrust liability for filing infringement proceedings against andrx.
settlement agreement 
in contrast,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that andrx had not sufficiently pled an antitrust violation in relation to the licensing agreement which elan signed with skyepharma to terminate patent infringement litigation.under the federal rules of civil procedure,the plaintiff is required in the complaint to make a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.fed.civ.a.while courts had previously applied a heightened pleading requirement in antitrust cases,this view has subsequently been rejected in favor of applying rule a notice pleading standard.quality foods de centro america,latin american agribusiness dev,cir see spanish broad.of,clear channel communications,cir concluding that the liberal pleading regime outlined by.a applies to allegations of antitrust violations covad communications bellsouth,cir describing the threshold requirements for properly pleading an antitrust violation as exceedingly low,vacated on other grounds by,d.accordingly,absent some doctrine which immunizes the conduct alleged,such as the doctrine,dismissals on the pleadings are particularly disfavored in antitrust cases.covad communications,at.against this background,we examine whether andrx allegations sufficiently state a claim under of the sherman act.
as we noted previously,section of the sherman act provides that e very contract in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is illegal.to prevail on a claim that a patent infringement settlement agreement violates of the sherman act,a plaintiff must prove the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent the extent to which the agreements exceed that scope and the resulting anticompetitive effects in the relevant market.ftc,cir citing valley drug,at.with regard to the first element,the allegations in andrx complaint demonstrated that the patent was necessary to the manufacture and sale of a controlled release naproxen medication,and that its owner could effectively exclude competitors from making other controlled release naproxen medications.see.with regard to the second element,andrx alleged that the licensing agreement,coupled with skyepharma putative agreement to refrain from ever marketing a generic controlled release naproxen medication,effectively barr ed any generic competitors from entering the market.id.if true,this dynamic would exceed the scope of exclusion intended by the patent.see j outlining criteria for drug manufacturers to enter the market with a generic version of patented products.with regard to the third element,andrx described the relevant market as the c ontrolled release naproxen market.see.andrx alleged that elan had sufficient market power to affect the controlled release naproxen market because it was the only supplier of naproxen in the united states.see id.finally,demonstrating the anticompetitive effects,andrx alleged that elan licensing agreement with skyepharma,and skyepharma putative agreement to refrain from marketing its generic drug,would prevent competition in the market for controlled release naproxen.id.see also id.stating that the conduct of elan and skyepharma foreclosed entry by competitors into the relevant market and precluded competition.additionally,an
