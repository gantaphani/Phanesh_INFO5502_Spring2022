the incessant demand for pornography,some have said,is an engine of technological development.john tierney,porn,the engine of progress,times,arts leisure desk,at noting as an example new technology.the telephonic system at dispute in this appeal is an example of that was designed and implemented to ensure that consumers paid charges for accessing pornography and other adult entertainment.the system identified the user of an online service by the telephone line used to access that service and then billed the subscriber for the cost of that service as if it was a charge for an international phone call to madagascar.this system had the benefit that the user credit card never had to be processed,but it had a problem as well it was possible for someone to access an service over a telephone line without authorization from the subscriber who understood herself contractually bound to pay all telephone charges,including those that disguised fees for the adult entertainment.
the federal trade commission ftc took a dim view of this billing system and brought suit to shut it down as a deceptive and unfair trade practice within the meaning of a of the federal trade commission act ftc act,a.the ftc sued verity international,verity and automatic communications,acl,corporations that operated this billing system,as well as robert green and marilyn shein,who controlled these corporations during the relevant time period.these four defendants appeal from the district court decision and judgment finding them liable for violating a.green and shein also appeal from a district court order holding them in contempt of court.
background 
the district court found the following facts upon a bench trial.
structure of the billing system 
the billing system operated as follows when a computer user visited a website providing services,the website offered the user the ability to buy adult content using a downloadable dialer program.the user downloaded the dialer program after clicking through a series of website disclosures containing the terms and conditions of use and an explanation that charges for the adult content would be billed to the subscriber as the cost of an international phone call.the computer user then initiated the dialer program,and if the computer was connected by modem to a telephone line,the dialer program placed an international phone call to a madagascar telephone number,bypassing the line subscriber designated carrier in favor of at t and later sprint.
either at t or sprint carried the call to london where it handed off the call to a separate carrier,at t later renamed viatel.instead of routing the call to madagascar for completion,at t viatel carried the call to a designated internet server in the united kingdom,a practice known as the call.that internet server finalized the connection between the user computer and the website providing the desired adult entertainment.
charges for accessing the adult entertainment appeared on bills sent to the consumers whose telephone lines were used.at t and sprint identified the subscribers by the automatic number identification ani system,the standard means by which telephone companies bill for phone calls.these bills,at first telephone bills from at t and later separate bills designed by verity and sent using information provided by sprint,charged line subscribers for phone calls to madagascar.
notably,this billing system did not have a mechanism to ensure that a subscriber authorized the computer user to access a given service.the absence of such a mechanism allowed line subscribers to receive bills for access about which they had no knowledge,which prompted the ftc to bring this lawsuit.
ii.creation and operation of the billing system 
in may,acl contracted with telecom malagasy,the national telecommunications carrier for madagascar,for the right to carry calls placed to certain international telephone numbers assigned to madagascar,the right to collect charges for these calls,and the right to terminate these calls at any location of acl choice,including locations outside madagascar.the right to carry calls to these numbers was valuable because of the calls high tariffed rate under telecommunications law.revenue generated from these calls would ultimately be divided between acl,telecom malagasy,various carriers,acl billing agents,a company that distributed the dialer program mentioned above,and various operators.
to exploit acl right to carry calls to these madagascar phone numbers,acl contracted with global internet billing,gib for gib to market the dialer program to operators and to use its best efforts to generate a minimum usage volume.acl agreed to provide gib with the madagascar telephone numbers for inclusion in gib dialer program.acl paid a portion of call revenues to gib,which in turn paid the operators,effectively making gib a paid intermediary between acl and the website operators.
acl also needed to arrange for the carriage of calls from a computer modem to the internet servers that would connect the calling computer to an adult website in the united states.accordingly,in january,acl contracted with two companies,at t and at t,to carry the calls.at t agreed to carry calls placed to acl madagascar phone numbers to the london facilities of at t.at t would then carry the calls to the designated internet servers.at t was responsible for billing and collection for these calls,and using ani information,at t billed subscribers for the acl calls on their regular monthly telephone statements.
the content of the telephone statements received by the subscribers is relevant here.at t charged subscribers only the tariffed rates for phone calls to madagascar.it listed the charges in the long distance section of the bills,with madagascar as the place called.under the important information header,the bills stated that nonpayment of toll charges may result in disconnection of local service,and other services may be restricted if not paid.
in the period beginning in january,when operators started using acl system to provide services to computer users,at t billings for traffic to acl madagascar numbers totaled million,as compared to million in total billings during the previous twelve months.at the same time,the percentage of total billings refunded to subscribers who contested their bills spiked from in the previous year to during this period.
acl contract with at t,together with acl other agreements,established a multitiered structure at t sent to at t the amounts due both at t and acl at t then paid acl from those funds.acl then paid gib,who in turn paid the operators.each entity kept some of the money along the way.telecom malagasy was compensated separately by both at t and acl for providing the phone numbers.this arrangement was in effect from january until july,when at t terminated the contract and stopped carrying calls for acl.the district court deemed this the at t period.
after at t terminated the agreement,acl turned to sprint as a replacement.acl reached an agreement with sprint which contemplated sprint performing billing and collection functions,as at t did,but sprint then quickly entered into a new agreement that released it from these duties.under the new agreement,sprint agreed to carry calls to the london facilities of at t now renamed viatel,but it would leave billing and collection to acl by providing acl with the ani information identifying the subscribers whose telephone lines were used to call acl madagascar numbers.as it did in the at t agreement,acl warranted that it would receive the calls and terminate them in madagascar.acl agreed to pay a fee to sprint and at t viatel for serving as carriers of the phone calls.this sprint period lasted from july through september,when sprint stopped carrying calls to acl madagascar phone numbers.
to handle billing and collection during the sprint period,acl entered into an agreement,in verity name,with ebillit,a subsidiary of integretel.the agreement required ebillit to prepare and mail bills to line subscribers,collect payments from them,and handle their complaints.the ebillit bills were branded with the verity logo and were separate from the line subscribers regular telephone bills.these verity bills contained an invoice number,an account number,the subscriber telephone number,a summary of charges,a due date,and a statement in capital letters that this bill accounts for international calls,from your modem to a madagascar number,for website access.the bills contained a detail of charges section in which the city called was listed as one of several cities within madagascar.robert green approved the format of these bills.
the bills also contained a number provided for line subscribers to call with questions about their bills.that number was widely used.during the sprint period,bills were sent to line subscribers and at least subscribers contacted verity about the bills.calling the center was not a positive experience for many invoice recipients.the center was so understaffed that of the calls placed to it were abandoned by callers.while waiting on hold for a representative,callers were played a recording warning that f ailure to pay a verity international bill may result in the blocking of your phone line to services of this nature from a variety of content providers and further collection activity of past due amounts.once connected to a representative,callers had to weather a hard sustain approach that involved the representative advising callers that the charges were valid,that the charges must be paid,and that nonpayment would subject the line subscriber to further collection activity.robert green and marilyn shein instructed the call center to maintain this approach,which did not change until the ftc brought the present lawsuit.during the sprint period,the verity bills resulted in million in collected billings and over consumer complaints to the ftc.the billing system has not been resurrected after sprint stopped carrying its calls.
iii.procedural history 
a.the ftc complaint 
the ftc complaint alleged that certain aspects of the billing system were deceptive or unfair trade practices in violation of a of the ftc act.that section provides that unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce are hereby declared unlawful.a.the ftc second amended complaint claimed relief on three grounds relevant on appeal.in count i,the ftc alleged that the engaged in a deceptive practice by falsely representing that a consumer could not legally avoid charges for website content accessed over the consumer telephone line,even if the consumer did not access the content or authorize others to do so.in count ii,the ftc alleged that the engaged in an unfair practice by themselves or through others billing and attempting to collect from line subscribers whose telephone lines were used to access online adult content but who did not access or authorize others to access that content.in count iii,the ftc alleged that it was a deceptive practice for the to cause billing statements to misrepresent the destination of outbound calls as madagascar when in fact the calls did not terminate there.
acl is a bahamian corporation that operated the billing system in dispute.it was founded and controlled by robert green and marilyn shein,each of whom owned of acl shares until september,when an australian corporation,oriel communications,acquired half of acl shares.the acquisition left green and shein each holding of acl shares and approximately of oriel shares.green and shein also founded and controlled verity,a operation that was part of the billing system and was used for accounting purposes.
preliminary injunction and contempt 
on december,the district court entered a preliminary injunction that imposed an asset freeze on verity,green,and shein to preserve funds for a possible monetary remedy.the preliminary injunction also required each of them to complete and return to the ftc a form.the ftc proposed the requirement as a way to evaluate the reasonableness of green and shein requests to unfreeze assets for living expenses,so green and shein did not contest the requirement at the time.green and shein contend that upon seeing the enormous amount of information requested by the disclosure form,they decided not to seek a release of their frozen assets and not to complete the disclosure form.but the court order to do so stood.accordingly,the district court ordered green and shein held in contempt of court for their failure to comply with the preliminary injunction requirement,an order from which green and shein appeal.the district court imposed a coercive fine for their noncompliance and ordered their civil confinement,should they be found within the united states,until they complied with the requirement.soon thereafter,the district court denied their motion to lift the requirement and held that disclosure was necessary to assure enforcement of an asset freeze or to recover proceeds of wrongdoing that are the subject of an equitable claim for disgorgement.to date,neither green nor shein has completed the form.as of october,the date on which this appeal was argued,the coercive monetary fines totaled million per contemnor.
motion practice and bench trial 
the filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,contending that the district court lacked jurisdiction because acl was a common carrier outside of the ftc jurisdiction,the doctrine negated standing by precluding the ftc from contending that line subscribers could avoid the charges in question,and the doctrine required the fcc to first decide the case.the district court asked the fcc to brief,as amicus curiae,the merits of the contentions,and the united states attorney for the southern district of new york submitted a letter brief on behalf of the fcc answering the district court questions.he concluded that acl was not a common carrier under the communications act and that the and doctrines therefore did not apply.with the benefit of the fcc views,the district court denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings and found that it had jurisdiction to hear the case.
on september,following a bench trial on a record of stipulated facts,declarations,exhibits,and other evidence,the district court filed a memorandum opinion.the court incorporated the factual findings and legal holdings of its earlier opinion denying motion for judgment on the pleadings,held that the ftc proved counts i,ii,and iii of its second amended complaint,and held that individual as well as corporate liability was appropriate.finding the restitutionary remedy of disgorgement to be available and proper,the district court entered two money judgments against the for a total of million.the court also replaced the preliminary injunction with a permanent injunction,which did not contain a requirement.the timely appealed from the district court judgment.
discussion 
our review proceeds in multiple parts.in parts,we consider and find meritless the arguments that the district court lacked jurisdiction.next,in part iv,we consider a challenge to the district court determination that the trade practices at issue violated a of the ftc act and uphold the district court.part v discusses why the district court erred in awarding monetary relief of million.finally,part vi turns to the coercive contempt sanctions against green and shein,explaining why we must vacate them as moot.
i.the exception to the ftc enforcement power 
the ftc act limits the ftc enforcement power.pertinent here is the ftc inability to enforce a of the ftc act against common carriers subject to the acts to regulate commerce.a providing this exception to the ftc powers.one such act to regulate commerce is the communications act of,along with its amendatory acts.id.citing the communications act of,et.acl argues that it is a telecommunications common carrier under the communications act and that therefore the exception renders a of the ftc act inapplicable 
this contention raises the question whether the term common carrier under the ftc act has the same meaning as the term common carrier under the communications act.as explained below,we determine that common carrier under the ftc act is properly defined by reference to the common law of carriers and not to the communications act,even though the common law definition does not meaningfully differ from the communications act definition for the purposes of this appeal.under both definitions,acl is not a common carrier.a brief history of the two acts is helpful in explaining our conclusion.
the first federal regulation to impose duties on common carriers was the interstate commerce act of ica,ch,stat,which applied to any common carrier or carriers engaged in the railroad transportation of people or property interstate.the ica imposed on railroad common carriers traditional requirements such as nondiscrimination,and charging just and reasonable rates,id,and it created the interstate commerce commission icc to administer the provisions of the act,id.in,congress passed the act,ch,stat,which amended the ica to apply to interstate telephone companies and to deem such companies common carriers,id.neither the ica nor the act contained a definition of common carrier.
in,in the thick of the antitrust movement,congress passed the federal trade commission act the ftc act,ch,stat,which created the federal trade commission ftc as an enforcement agency.congress did not intend the ftc to enforce law against common carriers because the icc already regulated common carriers under the interstate commerce act.thus,for the purpose of preventing interagency conflict,the ftc act exception was created.see generally marc winerman,the origins of the ftc,antitrust,mentioning the genesis of the exception.just as congress had not provided a definition of common carrier in the interstate commerce act,it did not provide a definition for that term in the ftc act.
regulation of telephone common carriers continued to rest with the icc until,when congress passed the communications act of,ch,stat.that act created the federal communications commission fcc and transferred to the fcc regulatory authority over telephone common carriers.id.the communications act defined common carrier circularly,as any person engaged as a common carrier for hire,in interstate or foreign communications by wire or radio.as one researcher has noted,the conference report for the communications act of suggests that the phrase common carrier had an ordinary meaning at the time,explaining why the interstate commerce act left the term undefined and why the communications act included only a circular definition.phil nichols,redefining common carrier,duke.congress did not modify the exemption of common carriers from ftc regulatory authority except to extend the exemption to common carriers now subject to the communications act.act of,stat.
the foregoing description brings us to the state of the relevant law today,against which we assess acl assertion that the correct definition for common carrier under the ftc act is found in the communications act.we find no statutory basis for so concluding.the term common carrier in a of the ftc act is still undefined,both in the act itself and in ftc regulations.as did our sister circuit when interpreting the circular definition of common carrier under the communications act,we decide to give meaning to common carrier in the ftc act according to the ordinary sense of the word when congress used it to create the exemption.see ass of regulatory util.comm rs fcc naruc ii,turning to the common law to define common carrier under the communications act ass of regulatory util.com rs fcc naruc i,taking the same approach sec.indus.ass bd.of governors of the fed.reserve,d interpreting the undefined terms security and note by reference to their ordinary meaning to the congress that used them.
the concept of a common carrier dates from the english common law and can be traced back to at least and the writings of lord chief justice hale.see munn illinois,otto.referencing lord hale treatise.early law applied to almost all workers and tradesmen,requiring them to serve the public generally and to do so on just and reasonable terms,but over time,the common law of common carriers narrowed its focus to enterprises considered public in some way,such as by the government grant of a legal monopoly or their use of public funds.james speta,a common carrier approach to internet interconnection,fed.comm,see also nichols,supra,at describing lord hale concept of public interest in privately held business.
eventually,the definition of a common carrier coalesced into two requirements the entity holds itself out as undertaking to carry for all people indifferently and the entity carries its cargo without modification.see naruc i,at describing how the common law imposed regulation on entities that undertook to carry for all shippers or travelers indifferently naruc ii,at describing the without modification requirement nichols,supra,at quoting the formulation of an carriers treatise that t o render a person liable as a common carrier,he must exercise the business of carrying as a public employment,and must undertake to carry goods for all persons indiscriminately.this definition does not differ meaningfully for our purposes from the definition of common carrier under the communications require that an entity provides carriage to the public.see,providing that t he term telecommunications carrier means any provider offering to the public the transmission of information.
applying these definitions,we conclude that acl is not a common carrier subject to the communications act and therefore does not fit within the ftc act exemption.the carriage of the telephone calls in this case involved three carriers in concept and two carriers in fact.conceptually,the calls were carried by an originating carrier,a transit carrier,and a destination carrier.at t,and later sprint,served as the originating carrier,routing the calls from the united states to the united kingdom.the transit carrier was at t viatel,whose role as transit carrier was,in concept,to route traffic from an originating carrier to a carrier in another country,the destination carrier.in re at t,wl.conceptually,telecom malagasy was the destination carrier,with acl standing in its shoes by virtue of the agreement assigning acl the right to terminate calls placed to telecom malagasy numbers.even at this conceptual level,acl is not exempt from the ftc act because foreign terminating carriers are not carriers subject to the communications act,as contemplated by the ftc act exemption,a.an entity is subject to the communications act if it is engaged within the united states in interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio or interstate and foreign transmission of energy by radio,which originates is received within the united states.a.as indicated by the engaged within the united states limitation,the communications act does not apply to foreign terminating carriers.cable wireless fcc,finding that because an fcc order applied to only domestic carriers,not foreign carriers,the fcc did not exceed its authority under the communications act in issuing it noting that the fcc claims no authority to directly regulate foreign carriers.thus,as a purely foreign terminating carrier at the conceptual level,acl would not qualify for the ftc act exemption.
yet our determination that acl was not a common carrier is even simpler because,in fact,the telephone calls at issue were carried by only two originating carrier and the transit carrier.at t,and later sprint,carried the phone calls from the united states to the united kingdom as originating carrier,and at t viatel carried the phone calls to the internet servers where they were terminated.acl simply brought together these carriers as part of its billing system it never itself carried any calls.thus,while at t and sprint might be exempt from ftc enforcement,acl is not.
on appeal,acl presses the argument that the a exemption applies to an entity with the status of a common carrier under the communications act even if its activities relevant to a pending lawsuit are not common carriage.assuming arguendo that common carrier status can exist and is determinative,this argument would aid acl only if it had the status of a common carrier.acl contends that it holds such status because the fcc granted it a license pursuant to the license,yet this license simply authorizes acl to become a international common carrier to become a international common carrier emphasis added.the license does not purport to represent or determine that acl is actually engaged in common carriage,nor did acl application for the license so represent.rather than rely on what an entity is authorized to do,courts must examine the actual conduct of an entity to determine if it is a common carrier for purposes of the ftc act exemption.eagleview,mds,cir holding that an entity possession of an fcc license to provide services as a common carrier did not alone make the entity a common carrier under the communications act.here,as explained above,none of acl activities gave it the status of a common carrier subject to the communications act of,and accordingly,the ftc act exception would not apply.
ii.the doctrine 
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction allows a federal court to refer issues extending beyond the conventional expertise of judges or falling within the realm of administrative discretion to the appropriate administrative agency for resolution in the first instance.commc ns ass n,v.at t,cir quoting far east conference united states.specifically,courts apply primary jurisdiction to cases involving technical and intricate questions of fact and policy that congress has assigned to a specific agency.id.at.although there is n o fixed formula for determining whether an agency has primary jurisdiction,courts typically consider four factors in this analysis 
whether the question at issue is within the conventional experience of judges or whether it involves technical or policy considerations within the agency particular field of expertise 
whether the question at issue is particularly within the agency discretion 
whether there exists a substantial danger of inconsistent rulings and 
whether a prior application to the agency has been made.
the contend that the district court should have referred this case to the fcc because it raises complex questions of telecommunications policy.of the questions raised in this case,the only issue that deserves close analysis pertains to the interpretation of communications act terms.that issue,important to our discussion in part iii of the doctrine,is whether the services offered by acl are telecommunications services or,alternatively,information services.
the four factors do not favor finding fcc primary jurisdiction over the characterization of the services provided by acl.first,there are many precedents,including those of the fcc,on the meaning of the communications act terms information service and telecommunications service.see,cable telecommc ns ass brand x internet,d in re joint bd.on universal serv.universal service report,wl see generally peter huber et,federal telecommunications law,at.the job of applying these reasonably settled definitions to the facts of this case is within the court competence.see commc ns ass n,at this record does not present any issues involving intricate interpretations that might need the fcc technical or policy expertise.second,while the classification issue is within the fcc discretion in the sense that the fcc is charged with administering the communications act,nothing about the terms invokes the fcc discretion in the same way that more abstract statutory terms such as reasonable or public interest do.see id.this case,however,does not involve the statutory reasonableness of the tariff or other abstract concepts.instead,it focuses on a rather simple factual question.third,the have pointed to no danger of inconsistent rulings on the classification of their service.fourth,to the extent that the contend that communications,mci worldcom,civ,wl,was a prior application to the fcc on the classification issue,they are incorrect.that case concerned the abstract reasonableness standard of,not application of the descriptors that this case asks the court to apply.id.at.in sum,none of the four factors weigh in favor of referring the case to the fcc on this issue.
the remaining issues in this case go to deceptiveness,unfairness,and status under the ftc act.congress did not place the interpretation of these terms within the realm of fcc discretion,nor does the fcc have special expertise in interpreting these ftc act terms.although the contend that e very other court presented with these issues has referred them to the fcc,in each of the cited cases,the claimed violation was of the communications act,not the ftc act.llc cox commc ns,d,audiotext int l,mci worldcom commc ns,no.civ,wl,at,commc ns,wl,at.we note that the fcc filed an amicus submission stating that it had no particular interest in or expertise over the case so as to warrant declining jurisdiction.for the reasons given above,we conclude that the doctrine does not require referring this case to the fcc.
iii.the doctrine 
the also contend that the doctrine,also known as the doctrine,deprives the ftc of standing and requires dismissal of its complaint.that doctrine is grounded statutorily in the communications act requirement that all common carriers file a schedule of their rates,a tariff,for fcc approval.a.once the fcc approves the tariff,the rates filed for the carrier services are the only lawful charge.id.c at t cent.office,d.under the doctrine,customers of the carrier are charged with notice of the tariff,and they as well as the carrier must abide by it,unless it is found by the fcc to be unreasonable.cent.office,at.quoting louisville nashville ry.maxwell.the doctrine serves the dual purposes of preventing carrier price discrimination and reserving the role to federal agencies by keeping courts from adjudicating the validity or reasonableness of carrier charges.marcus v.at t,cir.it is applied strictly to prevent a plaintiff from bringing a challenge to the validity of a filed tariff,even in the face of apparent inequities.id.at.
the contend that the doctrine bars the present action.they reason that because the fcc approved at t and sprint tariffs for the carriage of calls placed to madagascar and because the bills sent to line subscribers charged only tariffed rates,any lawsuit founded on the premise that some subscribers were not required to pay for calls placed over their lines is attacking the validity of tariffed rates and is therefore barred by the doctrine.underlying this assertion,however,is the foundational assumption that the bills in dispute were for services covered by the tariffs.if,in fact,no filed tariff covered the service for which the sought to charge line subscribers,there would be no filed rate to charge subscribers with notice of and no tariff validity would be called into question by the ftc lawsuit.
we hold that the doctrine does not apply in this case because the point to no tariff that covers the actual service rendered to users of their billing system.the contend that the tariffs filed by at t and sprint apply,but those tariffs cover only telecommunications services,not the information services provided here.the communications act defines these two categories of service.a telecommunications service for example,the carriage of a basic voice telephone call is the offering of the transmission,between or among points specified by the user,of information of the user choosing,without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.an information service,on the other hand,offers a capability for generating,acquiring,storing,transforming,processing,retrieving,utilizing,or making available information via telecommunications.id.examples include services allowing online browsing or electronic publishing.see generally universal service report,wl discussing in depth the meaning of these statutory terms.the fcc has affirmed that the two types of service are mutually exclusive.universal service report,at.the fcc has further explained that mixed or hybrid services,in which the provider offers a capability for generating,acquiring,or making available information via telecommunications,and as an inseparable part of that service transmits information supplied or requested by the user,are information services and not telecommunications services.id.at.
in applying these definitions,the would have us focus on only part of their billing system.they contend,and it is certainly true,that the carriers handling transmission of computer users phone t,sprint,and at t not change the form or content of the information transmitted.but examining only the service provided by these carriers misses the fundamental question in the analysis the nature of the service for which consumers were billed.in this case,while the pure transmission of by at t,sprint,and at t part of the service rendered to computer users,those users received more as part of their purchase,namely,adult content.it can hardly be denied that access to adult websites motivated computer users to run the gib dialer program and incur charges via the billing system.indeed,the funds collected from paying line subscribers compensated both telecommunications carriers and operators.as explained above,and as undisputed by the parties,online adult entertainment is an information service and is therefore not covered by the at t or sprint tariffs upon which the rely.because the point to no other tariff covering the information service rendered to users of their billing system,the doctrine does not apply.accordingly,the ftc has standing to bring this action.
iv.violation of the ftc act 
section a of the ftc act declares unlawful u nfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.a.following a bench trial,the district court ruled that the ftc had proved three bases for relief under a,and the court entered judgment against the accordingly.on appeal,the contend that the district court erred because the ftc did not prove each of the elements required for relief.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states visa,cir.
in count i,the ftc alleged that the engaged in a deceptive act or practice by falsely representing that a consumer could not successfully avoid charges for content accessed over the consumer telephone line,even if the consumer did not access the content or authorize others to do so.to prove a deceptive act or practice under a,the ftc must show three elements a representation,omission,or practice,that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances,and,the representation,omission,or practice is material.in re cliffdale,accord ftc tashman,cir ftc world travel vacation brokers,cir.the deception need not be made with intent to deceive it is enough that the representations or practices were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably.world travel,at.
the ftc contends that the first element is satisfied by proof that the caused subscribers to receive explicit and implicit representations that they could not successfully avoid paying charges for adult entertainment that had been accessed over their phone we call a representation of uncontestability.the district court found that during the at t period,the caused charges for adult entertainment to appear on at t phone bills as telephone calls,thereby capitaliz ing on the common and perception held by consumers that they must pay their telephone bills,irrespective of whether they made or authorized the calls.the district court found that this representation was also made during the sprint period by the format of the verity bills and the messages delivered to bill recipients.upon reviewing the bills and practices,we find that it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that they conveyed a representation of uncontestability.see,kemp v.at t,cir it was clearly foreseeable that this formatting,which listed purchases as charges,would cause some customers to think that the charges had to be paid in order to maintain phone service.
the second requirement for a liability is that the representation be likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably.the ftc contends that the representation of uncontestabilty was false and therefore likely to mislead consumers who did not use or authorize others to use the adult entertainment in question the contend that the representation was rendered true by both the doctrine and common law agency principles.we have already explained why the doctrine does not apply,see supra part iii,so we turn now to the agency argument.
under common law agency principles,a person is liable to pay for services that she does not herself contract for if another person has actual,apparent,or implied authority to consent on her behalf to pay for the services.merrill lynch interfunding,argenti,cir restatement second of agency.the rely on apparent authority,contending that all calls made over a subscriber telephone line were necessarily made with the subscriber apparent authority because any user of a computer connected to that telephone line must have been given authority by the line subscriber to use the computer.
apparent authority,u nlike express or implied authority,exists entirely apart from the principal manifestations of consent to the agent.towers world airways,phh aviation,cir.rather,it would derive here either from manifestations of the principal the line subscriber to a third party an entity involved in the billing system or from the putative agent the computer user position,when justified by ordinary expectations and habits.restatement second of agency cmts.a,b.the analogize the present case to towers world airways,supra,in which we held that purchases by a company employee made with a properly issued company credit card are made with the apparent authority of the company.at.notably,that case concerned a principal entrustment of a payment mechanism to its agent and relied upon specific customs of the aviation industry in finding apparent authority.id.at.here,in contrast,the computer is a multipurpose tool that is not primarily understood as a payment mechanism,and in the ordinary habits of human behavior,one does not reasonably infer that because a person is authorized to use a computer,the subscriber to the telephone line connected to that computer has authorized the computer user to purchase online content on the subscriber account.apparent authority does not exist on these facts.
the representation of uncontestability is therefore false,unsupported by either the doctrine or common law agency principles.because the offer no reason why this misrepresentation would not be likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably,we find that the district court did not err in finding that the ftc proved the second element of its count i claim.
finally,to establish a deceptive act or practice under a,the ftc must prove that the misrepresentation was material to consumers.the district judge never expressly addressed whether the representation of uncontestability was material,but because he stated the correct legal standard for a deceptiveness liability and found liability upon labeling the representation materially false,we understand him to mean that the misrepresentation was material and slightly different,but justifiable,conclusion.the ftc submitted evidence from which the district court could conclude that subscribers found the representation material to their decision whether to pay the billed charges because of the worry of disconnection,the perception of the futility of challenging the charges,the desire to avoid injury,or some combination of these factors.in any event,nowhere in the briefing do they contend that the misrepresentation of uncontestability was immaterial,so we deem the issue waived.norton sam club,cir.
in sum,because the ftc proved all three elements of its a claim premised on the deceptive representation of uncontestability,the district court did not err in holding that the violated the ftc act.because a is phrased in the disjunctive,prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices,a,the ftc need not prove its other claims to obtain relief under the ftc act.liability is supported by the count i claim alone.nonetheless,we give brief attention below to count ii because it affects the scope of injunctive relief.
the district court held the liable under count ii of the ftc complaint,which alleged that billing line subscribers who did not use or authorize use of the internet services offered by the defendants clients was an unfair trade practice.we hold that the waived their right to contest this determination by not raising it as an issue on appeal.the presented several issues for review in their opening brief,and in the paragraph concerning ftc act liability,they mention only the district court deceptiveness determination indeed,in the four pages of their opening brief in which they discuss ftc act liability,they focus only on liability.because the did not contest the district court determination until their reply brief,and then only cursorily,we deem it waived on appeal.tischmann,cir holding an argument waived because the appellant did not raise it until his reply brief united states gabriel,cir same.for this reason,we affirm the district court determination that the act of billing line subscribers who did not use or authorize use of the internet services offered by the defendants clients is an unfair trade practice within the meaning of a.because the ftc prevails on the basis of waiver,we do not reach,and therefore express no opinion on,the district court rulings on the merits of the count ii claim.
in count iii,the ftc alleged that it was a deceptive practice for the to cause consumers to be billed for calls to madagascar when the calls actually terminated in the united kingdom.because liability under this count is not necessary to support the district court order of relief,we express no opinion on the district court determination that the ftc proved this claim for relief.
we affirm the injunctive components of the district court october,final order for relief because they are supported by the liability under counts i and ii of the ftc complaint.
restitution 
two issues determine whether the district court award of disgorgement relief to the ftc should be affirmed.first,is restitution an available remedy under b of the ftc act,the provision under which the ftc seeks relief second,if so,did the district court correctly administer the restitution remedy 
restitution under b of the ftc act 
the ftc brought this action under the second proviso of b of the ftc act,which states that in proper cases the ftc may seek,and after proper proof,the court may issue,a permanent injunction.b.although this provision does not expressly provide for restitution,several courts,including the fifth seventh eighth ninth and eleventh circuits,have concluded that b of the ftc act allows restitution or other ancillary equitable relief.united states lane,cir holding that even though a statute did not expressly allow courts to award restitution,such specificity is not required where the government properly invokes a court equitable jurisdiction.
the do not contest on appeal the district court holding that restitution is available as ancillary equitable relief under b of the ftc act,so we assume without deciding that the district court holding is correct.see,united states georgia,d applying this type of assumption.
the do argue,however,that such restitution must be limited to equitable restitution.we agree.this contention is based on the fact that two types of restitution are distinguishable as justice scalia explained in life annuity insurance knudson,d,in the days of the divided bench,restitution was available in certain cases at law,and in certain others in equity.id.at.equitable restitution allowed the plaintiff to recover money or property in the defendant possession that could clearly be traced to money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff.id.legal restitution,on the other hand,was awarded when the plaintiff could not assert title to or the right to possession of particular property but nevertheless had some basis for recovering for some benefit that the defendant wrongly received from the plaintiff.id.here,because the availability of restitution under b of the ftc act,to the extent it exists,derives from the district court equitable jurisdiction,it follows that the district court may award only equitable restitution the fact that only an equitable remedy is available eviscerates the contention that the seventh amendment confers a right to a jury trial in this case.see granfinanciera,nordberg,d.
administering restitutionary relief 
the district court strayed off course in its application of the framework for calculating the size of disgorgement relief.this framework requires the ftc to first show that its calculations reasonably approximated the amount of the defendant unjust gains,after which the burden shifts to the defendants to show that those figures were inaccurate.ftc febre,cir citing sec lorin,cir per curiam.two errors pervade the district court administration of this framework misidentifying the baseline for restitutionary relief and prematurely shifting the burden of proof to the.
misidentifying the restitutionary baseline 
the district court measured the appropriate amount of restitution as the full amount lost by consumers.this was error.the appropriate measure for restitution is the benefit unjustly received by the defendants.see pereira farace,cir stating that restitution is measured by a defendant unjust gain,rather than by a plaintiff loss internal quotation and alteration marks omitted citing life annuity ins,at.ginsburg,dissenting restatement third of restitution discussion draft liability in restitution is based on and measured by the receipt of a benefit douglas laycock,the scope and significance of restitution,r estitution measures recovery by defendant gain rather than plaintiff loss.labeling the remedy consumer redress or disgorgement,each a restitutionary remedy,does not alter the basic principle that restitution is measured by the defendant gain.
undeniably,in many cases in which the ftc seeks restitution,the defendant gain will be equal to the consumer loss because the consumer buys goods or services directly from the defendant.thus,in these cases it is not inaccurate to say that restitution is measured by the consumer loss.but it is incorrect to generalize this shorthand and apply it as a principle in cases where the two amounts example,when some middleman not party to the lawsuit takes some of the consumer money before it reaches a defendant hands.both the district court and the ftc in its brief adopt this fallacy,relying on shorthand from cases in which only one who sold directly to consumers was sued.see ftc febre,cir direct seller sued ftc gem merch,cir direct seller sued court held that disgorgement,the purpose of which is not to compensate the victims of fraud,but to deprive the wrongdoer of his gain,is appropriate ftc sec.rare coin bullion,cir direct sellers sued ftc amy travel,cir direct sellers sued ftc medicor,llc,d,direct sellers sued ftc auto club,d,measuring the full amount lost by consumers by the amount taken in by the defendant 
this error manifested itself in the district court calculation of the sum to be disgorged.for the at t period,the district court determined that consumers paid at t million for the relevant services videotext services.we uphold this determination but instruct the district court on remand to further consider how much of this sum was in fact received by the and is therefore subject to an order of restitution.the cascading payment structure during the at t period indicates that at t,at t viatel,and telecom malagasy received some fraction of the money paid by consumers before any payments were made to the.only the remaining fraction of total billings unjustly enriched the and may be the basis for a disgorgement remedy.
for the sprint period,the cascading payment structure flowed differently.the received consumers money through ebillit,and they paid sprint,at t viatel,telecom malagasy,and gib from those unjustly received consumer funds.thus,for the sprint period,the district court should determine the amount of the million in total billings that the received from ebillit,without deducting monies paid by the to other parties.for both periods,the focus of the district court restitution calculation should be on the unjust gains.
