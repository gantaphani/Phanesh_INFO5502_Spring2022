this is a suit by illinois prison and jail inmates,inmates family members and other intimates of the inmates,and a law firm that specializes in the defense of inmates on death row in illinois.grounded in,the sherman act,and illinois state law,the suit attacks the practice by which each prison and jail grant one phone company the exclusive right to provide telephone service to the inmates in return for percent of the revenues generated by the service.the suit claims that the rates for the service,which are collect only and are contained in tariffs filed by the phone companies with the federal communications commission and the illinois commerce commission,are exorbitant,being far higher than required to cover the costs involved in providing phone service to inmates.the plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief against the phone companies and the state agencies and officials responsible for the arrangements with the companies.the district court dismissed the suit as beyond its jurisdiction by reason of the and doctrines.
there are a number of jurisdictional bars or bars by the latter term we mean defenses that a court can invoke even if the defendant has not done so,see,higgins mississippi,cir to various pieces of this suit,quite apart from the ones identified by the district court.the state of illinois is not a person within the meaning of section,id.at will michigan of state police,d.the individual defendants have qualified immunity from the damages claims,given the novelty of the suit.the law firm has no standing to sue because there is no indication that it has suffered any detriment from the high price of its phone conversations with its clients the cost of these phone calls is,at least so far as its counsel is aware,an expense that the firm is reimbursed for by the state or federal government.and the inmate plaintiffs are barred from suing because they have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies,as required by the prison litigation reform act.a massey wheeler,cir perez wisconsin of corrections,cir nyhuis reno,cir alexander hawk,cir brown toombs,cir per curiam.the plaintiffs say they have no such remedies against exorbitant phone bills,but the cases we have cited reject a futility exception to the requirement of exhaustion.we have left open the possibility of an exception to the exception for cases in which the only relief sought is monetary and is beyond the power of the prison authorities to give.davis streekstra,cir.that possible exception is unavailable to these plaintiffs,because they are seeking injunctive as well as monetary relief.
but since these various grounds do not dispose of all the plaintiffs or all the defendants,we proceed to consider whether the district court was right to think that the and doctrines place the entire suit outside the jurisdiction of the district court.the doctrine,which is based both on historical antipathy to rate setting by courts,deemed a task they are inherently unsuited to perform competently,and on a policy of forbidding price discrimination by public utilities and common carriers,forbids a court to revise a public utility or as here common carrier filed tariff,which is to say the terms of sale that the carrier has filed with the agency that regulates the carrier service.at t central office telephone,d maislin industries,primary steel,d arkansas louisiana gas hall,d cahnmann sprint,cir wegoland nynex,cir.a customer or competitor can challenge the tariff before the agency itself,and if disappointed with the agency response can seek judicial review,a c,but it can not ask the court in any other type of suit such as this civil rights and antitrust suit to invalidate or modify the tariff.nor can it seek damages based on the difference between the actual tariff and a hypothetical lawful tariff.that would require the court to determine the lawful tariff,and this is not regarded as a proper judicial function.wegoland nynex,supra,at.
the plaintiffs deny that they are challenging tariffs.they say their objection is to the deals by which the correctional authorities in illinois have granted exclusive rights to telephone companies in return for what the plaintiffs characterize as kickbacks.they want to dissolve the deals in the hope that competition among phone companies will lead the companies to file prison tariffs that have lower rates.they point out that a conspiracy to file or not file particular tariffs is not insulated by the doctrine from attack under the antitrust laws or other sources of independent rights,square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,and,d united states radio of america,d georgia pennsylvania railroad.united states pacific arctic ry.navigation.city of mishawaka indiana michigan electric,cir town of norwood new england power,cir barnes arden mayfair,cir,provided that only injunctive relief is sought.square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,supra keogh chicago northwestern.such an attack does not seek to invalidate any tariff,but merely to create an environment in which the regulated firm is more likely to file a tariff that contains terms more favorable to customers.whether what the plaintiffs are attacking here is aptly described as a conspiracy remains to be considered provisionally,however,the suit is not barred by the doctrine.
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is not a bar either.the doctrine is really two doctrines.in its central and original form,in which it is more illuminatingly described,however,as exclusive agency jurisdiction,it applies only when,in a suit involving a regulated firm but not brought under the regulatory statute itself,an issue arises that is within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the regulatory agency to resolve,although the agency resolution of it will usually be subject to judicial review.united states western pacific,d cahnmann sprint,supra,at advance united expressways,eastman kodak,cir city of peoria general electric cablevision,cir.when such an issue arises,the suit must stop and the issue must be referred to the agency for resolution.if the agency resolution of the issue does not dispose of the entire case,the case can resume subject to judicial review of that resolution along whatever path governs review of the agency decisions,whether back to the court in which the original case is pending or,if the statute governing review of the agency decisions designates another court,to that court.id.at kenneth culp davis richard pierce,administrative law treatise,ed.
if the plaintiffs in this case wanted to get a rate change,the version of the doctrine that we have described would kick in but they do not,so it does not.eventually they want a different rate,of course,but at present all they are seeking is to clear the dissolve an arrangement that is preventing the telephone company defendants from competing to file tariffs more advantageous to the inmates.we are oversimplifying,because the complaint includes a claim under the federal communications act,et,that the phone companies charge unreasonably high rates and also engage in rate discrimination.these claims are squarely within the fcc jurisdiction,but have been forfeited.they are not mentioned in the plaintiffs opening briefs,and are merely brushed in their reply brief.
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is sometimes defined quite differently,as a doctrine that allows a court to refer an issue to an agency that knows more about the issue,even if the agency has been given exclusive jurisdiction to resolve it.so,for example,we read in national communications ass n,cir,that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction allows a federal court to refer a matter extending beyond the conventional experiences of judges or falling within the realm of administrative discretion to an administrative agency with more specialized experience,expertise,and insight.this definition obscures the core of the doctrine,described earlier.cases in which a court refers an issue to an agency because of the agency superior expertise,such as the case just cited and american automobile manufacturers ass massachusetts of environmental protection,cir,rather than because of the agency jurisdiction,are not felicitously desc
