introduction 
in this antitrust case originally brought in state court under the cartwright act,cal.bus,the plaintiff milk producers claim that the defendant cheese makers conspired successfully to depress the prices they paid for milk produced in california.the alleged price fix among buyers was accomplished in an unusual way through a auction agency called the national cheese exchange nce,the cheese makers are said to have rigged the price for bulk cheese in order to depress their acquisition costs both for that commodity and for milk.california milk prices were targeted and restrained in that the nce bulk cheese price determined the cost of fluid milk.that allegation,as the parties briefs confirm,means that the california department of food agriculture cdfa used the reported nce bulk cheese price in its formula for setting the support,minimum price for milk produced in that state.thus,the alleged that controlled the nce bulk cheese price was intended to,and did,depress the california milk price as well.the milk producers claim that as a result they received less for their product than they would have received but for the unlawful price restraint.the cheese makers removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,see,and then moved pursuant to.b to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.the district court,without hearing argument,issued a order granting the motion to dismiss,and the milk producers filed a timely notice of appeal.finding that this court has jurisdiction,and that the complaint adequately states claims under california law,we reverse and remand except as to one claim that has been abandoned.
ii.jurisdiction under 
this court has jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district court.no party has argued that jurisdiction is absent,but we must address the issue sua sponte.wmx technologies,miller,cir en banc.
the cheese makers motion in the district court was styled a motion to dismiss the complaint rather than the action.an order granting such a motion must be accompanied by leave to amend unless amendment would be futile.lopez smith,cir.no such leave was granted here.ordinarily an order dismissing the complaint rather than dismissing the action is not a final order and thus not appealable.however,i f it appears that the district court intended the dismissal to dispose of the action,it may be considered final and appealable.hoohuli ariyoshi,cir.gerritsen de la madrid hurtado,cir.accord martinez gomez,cir i t is clear that there is nothing further the plaintiff can do and the district court must have intended this order to end the case.therefore,we treat the dismissal as a final order.
the record here shows that the district court intended its order to end the case.although the cheese makers sought dismissal of the complaint,they repeatedly argued that the plaintiffs not only did not,but can not,allege essential parts of an antitrust or unfair competition claim.the milk producers opposed the motion on the merits and,in the alternative,asked leave to amend unless it is determined that no possible amendment would cure the complaint deficiencies.the district court order reads simply it is ordered that the motions to dismiss be,and hereby are,granted.this ruling necessarily entailed a denial of the alternative request for leave to amend and a determination,in the words of lopez,at,that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.thus the district judge must have intended the dismissal order to end the case.
we have so held in several earlier cases.in gerritsen we said failure to allow leave to amend supports an inference that the district court intended to make the order final.furthermore,the court intention of finality is evinced by its apparent conclusion that amendment of the complaint would not save the action.at citations omitted.accord hoohuli,at,martinez,at scott eversole mortuary,cir.
the inference that finality was intended is especially strong here in light of the milk producers explicit request for leave to amend unless the court determined that no possible amendment would avoid dismissal.no one has suggested an amendment that could change the district court ruling.
also probative is the understanding of the district court clerk that a final dismissal was ordered.the clerk docket entry describes the dismissal order as terminating case.a stamp on the order shows that the clerk reported the case as terminated to the administrative office of the united states courts.see district court clerks manual b.the parties understanding has been the same,as reflected in their briefs on appeal 
we conclude that the district court intended its order to be a final dismissal.accordingly,this court has jurisdiction on appeal under.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court order of dismissal for failure to state a claim.see wyler summit partnership turner broad,cir.a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.in ruling on such a motion,the court must presume all factual allegations of the complaint to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.usher city of los angeles,cir.the complaint need not set out the facts in detail what is required is a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a la salvia united dairymen,cir.antitrust cases are not to be judged by a higher or different pleading standard than other cases.see foods,ragu foods,cir.an antitrust plaintiff need only allege sufficient facts from which the court can discern the elements of an injury resulting from an act forbidden by the antitrust laws.cost management,washington natural gas,cir quoting newman universal pictures,cir.
iv.allegations of the complaint 
the complaint sets out three claims.the first,naming all defendants,alleges a combination in restraint of trade in violation of the cartwright act,cal.bus.the second,also naming all defendants,alleges that the combination in restraint of trade,and acts done pursuant to it,violated the unfair competition act,cal.bus.the third,naming kraft only,alleges that kraft violated the unfair competition act by monopolizing and attempting to monopolize.
the third claim is deemed abandoned because the milk producers have not opposed its dismissal in their briefs and argument to this court.see fed.a a requiring that the appellant brief contain appellant contentions and the reasons for them.see also essery department of,cir nowhere does appellant argue that the agency erred in finding that he violated sections a and b that issue is therefore deemed abandoned.the first and second claims are at issue in this appeal.
for present purposes,the key allegations of the complaint are as follows the plaintiff milk producers are residents and citizens of california who have sold milk directly or indirectly to one or more of the defendants the defendant cheese makers purchase bulk cheese and milk for use in their products nce,in wisconsin,operated the only national cash auction market for bulk cheese the cheese makers purchased substantial quantities of milk from plaintiffs and the members of the class,either directly or indirectly the cheese makers did not compete and instead acted together to suppress the cost of milk purchased by them from plaintiffs and the members of the class b y collusively manipulating nce prices to levels lower than would prevail under conditions of free and open competition,the cheese makers lowered their procurement costs for bulk cheese bought off the nce pursuant to formula prices the nce prices determined the cost of fluid milk used by kraft in its cheese plants the cheese makers formed a combination in unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce in violation of the cartwright act the terms of the unlawful combination included depressing,fixing,pegging,stabilizing and maintaining prices paid for milk used in the manufacture of cheese as an intended result prices paid by the defendants and their for milk were fixed,depressed,maintained and stabilized at artificially low and at levels competition for the purchase of milk in california was unreasonably restrained the cheese makers have been unjustly enriched as a result of their wrongful conduct and unfair competition and the plaintiffs and class members received less for milk than they otherwise would have received in the absence of the defendants unlawful conduct.
the complaint details how the cheese makers allegedly did these things.the milk producers seek treble damages,an injunction,and other relief.
sufficiency of the complaint 
in the absence of a statement by the district court of reasons for the dismissal,the cheese makers on appeal raise a variety of arguments.they contend that the complaint fails to plead antitrust injury and antitrust standing as required by the cartwright act that relief is barred by the filed rate doctrine that the commerce clause precludes application of california antitrust statute in this context and that the milk producers related claims under the state unfair competition statute also must be dismissed.we consider these arguments in light of the rules,summarized above,governing motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
cartwright act and sherman act 
the cartwright act,adopted in,and the sherman act,adopted in,have in common the goal of prohibiting combinations and monopolies and thereby preserving competition.the federal statute purpose is stated in northern pacific railway united states,d 
the sherman act was designed to be a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade.it rests on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources,the lowest prices,the highest quality and the greatest material progress,while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.but even were that premise open to question,the policy unequivocally laid down by the act is competition.
the california statute goal is described in exxon superior court,th,d 
the cartwright act bus,et,as the sherman antitrust act et,was enacted to promote free market competition and to prevent conspiracies or agreements in restraint or monopolization of trade.
there are,however,differences in statutory wording and legislative history that lead,in some respects,to different results.in state of california ex rel.van de kamp texaco,cal d,the court held 
admittedly,in past statements we have suggested that the cartwright act is patterned after the sherman act.as shown above,however,historical and textual analysis reveals that the act was patterned after the texas act and the michigan act,and not the sherman act.hence judicial interpretation of the sherman act,while often helpful,is not directly probative of the cartwright drafters intent,given the different genesis of the provision under review.
thus,federal antitrust precedents are properly included in a cartwright act analysis,but their role is limited they are often helpful but not necessarily decisive.
buyers combinations as per se violations 
the sherman act prohibits e very contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade.the cartwright act prohibits,among other things,any combination t o prevent competition in the sale or purchase of any commodity or to a gree in any manner to keep the price of any commodity at a fixed or graduated figure.cal.bus.c and e.
under both statutes,certain types of collusive conduct are held to be so destructive of competition,and so devoid of redeeming value,that they are conclusively presumed to be,they are per se violations.see northern pac,at.people santa clara valley bowling proprietor ass n,d.
foremost in the category of per se violations is horizontal among competitors.this rule was explained by the supreme court in united states trenton potteries.the aim and result of every agreement,if effective,is the elimination of one form of competition.see also nynex discon,d.restrictions on price and output are the paradigmatic examples of restraints of trade that the sherman act was intended to prohibit.ncaa board of regents,d.
the same rule applies in california under both california and federal law,agreements fixing or tampering with prices are illegal per se.county builders exch.lathrop constr,cal d.
the california statute explicitly makes price fixing by buyers unlawful.see cal.bus.c prohibiting any combination to prevent competition in the sale or purchase of any commodity emphasis added.the federal decisional law,based on a more generally worded statute,reaches the same result.see united states oil.a combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising,depressing,fixing,pegging,or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal per se.emphasis added mandeville island farms american crystal sugar.it is clear that the agreement is the sort of combination condemned by the act,even though the was by purchasers,and the persons specially injured under the treble damage claim are sellers,not customers or consumers.see also harkins amusement,general cinema,cir concerted action to eliminate competitive bidding violates the sherman act.
when a per se violation such as horizontal price fixing has occurred,there is no need to define a relevant market or to show that the defendants had power within the market.see,ftc superior.trial lawyers ass n,d.the california supreme court has held,under the cartwright act,that competitors who agree to fix prices are liable under the per se rule e ven though the members of the group were in no position to control the market.mailand burckle,cal d,quoting oil,at.
the cheese makers cite in re beef industry antitrust litigation,cir,for the proposition that the milk producers claims must fail for lack of a showing that the cheese makers had the power to suppress total industry demand for milk,not just their own demand.the court there,noting that the alleged conspirators were only two of the four major buyers of cattle,described the plaintiffs theory as economically unfeasible,and said that 
a ny attempt at conspiracy between only two of those packers to depress fed cattle prices could not succeed,because the other packers,especially the other two major competitors,could raise their own fed cattle prices a small amount,effectively buy away the fed cattle that had previously been the source of sales to the defendants.
id.at.we need not decide whether in re beef is consistent with controlling supreme court precedent or california law because the case is inapposite.first,the court there found that the plaintiffs had failed to submit sufficient proof of a conspiracy,id.at,a question not involved in the present rule b motion.second,there was no allegation that the defendant cattle purchasers were able to,and did,concertedly depress a statewide commodity price by manipulating a minimum price formula.that claim here is exactly contrary to the in re beef holding that the alleged conspiracy could not succeed.according to the present complaint,the conspiracy had the means to,and did,succeed.
antitrust standing 
private suits to enforce the sherman act are authorized by section of the clayton act,a,which provides that any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained,and the cost of suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.despite the apparent breadth of the phrase any person,the supreme court has held that congress did not intend to afford a remedy to everyone injured by an antitrust violation simply on a showing of causation.the plaintiff must have antitrust standing.to determine whether that requirement is met,the court must evaluate the plaintiff harm,the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants,and the relationship between them.associated contractors of california,california state council of carpenters,d.in american ad management,general,cir,this court summarized the factors relevant to antitrust standing as follows the nature of the plaintiff alleged injury that is,whether it was the type the antitrust laws were intended to forestall the directness of the injury the speculative measure of the harm the risk of duplicative recovery and the complexity in apportioning damages.
antitrust standing is required under the cartwright act.see kolling dow jones,d.as shown below,however,california law affords standing more liberally than does federal law.
a antitrust injury 
the first nature of the plaintiff alleged injury requires a showing of antitrust injury,injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d.as this court stated in american ad management,at 
parsing the supreme court definition,we can identify four requirements for antitrust injury unlawful conduct,causing an injury to the plaintiff,that flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful,and that is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.
the complaint here plainly alleges unlawful conduct,a per se antitrust violation,and that the conduct was intended to and did injure the plaintiffs since the plaintiffs allegedly were subjected to artificially depressed milk prices,the injury flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful,from the collusive price manipulation itself.the cheese makers argue,however,that the fourth the injury be of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent is unmet.they say,in substance,that a conspiracy to depress prices would not harm consumers but benefit them,because reduced milk acquisition costs would mean lower cheese manufacturing costs and,therefore,lower prices for cheese products.they contend that the alleged conduct actually increased competition in the milk market,and that injury from selling at lower,more competitive prices is simply not enough.
the fallacy of this argument becomes clear when we recall that the central purpose of the antitrust laws,state and federal,is to preserve competition.it is the collusive fixing of prices at levels either low or these statutes recognize as vital to the public interest.the supreme court references to the goals of achieving the lowest prices,the highest quality and the greatest material progress,northern pac,at,and of assur ing customers the benefits of price competition,associated,at,do not mean that conspiracies among buyers to depress acquisition prices are tolerated.every precedent in the field makes clear that the interaction of competitive forces,not,is what will benefit consumers.o ur prior cases,the court noted in associated general,have emphasized the central interest in protecting the economic freedom of participants in the relevant market.at.in california,similarly,the public interest requires free competition so that prices be not dependent upon an understanding among suppliers of any given commodity,but upon the interplay of the economic forces of supply and demand.speegle board of fire underwriters,cal d.
the cheese makers argument also confuses vertical price fixing,resale prices imposed by a manufacturer on its distributors with horizontal price fixing collusive price setting or stabilization by competitors.under federal law,vertical arrangements that set minimum prices are illegal per se while those that set maximum prices are tested under the rule of reason and may or may not be deemed to have anticompetitive consequences.see state oil khan,d.horizontal price fixing is a per se violation regardless of whether the prices set are minimum or maximum.see arizona maricopa county medical society,d.the defendants rely largely on cases that involved claims by category much different from that of claims between buyers and sellers.when horizontal price fixing causes buyers to pay more,or sellers to receive less,than the prices that would prevail in a market free of the unlawful trade restraint,antitrust injury occurs.this is seen most often in claims by overcharged buyers as to underpaid sellers it is less common in the reported cases,but is equally true.as stated in a leading text,phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law at ed 
when buyers agree illegally to pay suppliers less than the prices that would otherwise prevail,suppliers are obviously injured in fact.the suppliers loss also constitutes antitrust injury,for it reflects the rationale for condemning buying,suppression of competition among buyers,reduced upstream and downstream output,and distortion of prices.
most courts understand that a buying cartel low buying prices are illegal and bring antitrust injury and standing to the victimized suppliers.clearly mistaken is the occasional court that considers low buying prices or that thinks sellers receiving illegally low prices do not suffer antitrust injury.
to hold otherwise would be contrary to antitrust law 
antitrust injury requires that the injured party be a participant in the same market as the alleged malefactors.american ad management,at quoting bhan nme hospitals,cir.the defendants here contend that they are in one market cheese while the plaintiffs are in another fluid milk.but the complaint allegations unmistakably place all parties in the milk defendants as buyers and the plaintiffs as even have them transacting business with each other.for present purposes those allegations must be accepted as true.
b directness of the injury 
the plaintiffs must prove injury in fact,and the claimed injury must be sufficiently direct.under federal law,there must be not a mere causal link,but a direct effect.city of pittsburgh west penn power,cir not direct where there was no way to determine whether the rates the city will pay for electric service are or will be affected by the alleged actions.to assess the directness of the plaintiff injury,the court look s to the chain of causation between plaintiff injury and the alleged restraint in the market.american ad management,at.
the cheese makers argue that the milk producers were free to sell their milk to others at higher prices than the minimum levels set by the cdfa.but that argument merely denies that the plaintiffs were damaged in fact.it does not speak to the complaint,which alleges that the plaintiffs were damaged when the defendants fixed milk prices at artificially low levels and thereby caused plaintiffs to receive less for milk than they otherwise would have received in the absence of the defendants unlawful conduct.these disputed claims of causation and injury can not be decided on a rule b motion.
the defendants also contend that since the market allegedly restrained was that for cheese,and the milk support price was set by a state agency,the chain of causation is too tenuous to support recovery.but that too overlooks what the complaint the defendants were buyers in the milk market,that they conspired to depress the price of milk produced in california,and that they did so by rigging the nce bulk cheese price at artificially low levels.according to these allegations,the nce price was a tool used by the conspirators to manipulate the california milk price.the result for purposes of antitrust injury analysis should be no different than if the cheese makers had conspired to report a fictitious nce price in order to depress the milk price,which clearly would cause direct injury to the milk producers.see woods exploration producing aluminum of,cir summary judgment reversed where oil producers allegedly conspired to report false production data to state agency so as to increase production allowance city of long beach standard oil,cir injury sufficiently direct notwithstanding federal price ceilings where ceilings allegedly were based on artificially low procurement prices collusively posted by defendants.here,as in city of long beach,the defendants allegedly conspired successfully to subject the plaintiffs their suppliers to artificially low prices by reporting fixed prices to an agency.as the supreme court has stated,the machinery employed by a combination for is immaterial.united states oil.
that the alleged conspiracy restrained prices for two cheese and not immunize the defendants against antitrust claims.the milk sellers,insofar as the alleged conspiracy was meant to and did reduce their sales prices,suffered a direct injury.antitrust violations frequently entail multiple means and objectives,restraining both purchase prices and sales prices or boycotting to enforce price stabilization.see,ftc superior.trial lawyers ass n,d denny marina,renfro productions,cir ancar sara plasma,cir.the law requires that every conspiracy be judged as a whole.this important rule was stated in continental ore union carbide carbon,d citations and internal quotations omitted 
in cases such as this,plaintiffs should be given the full benefit of their proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each.the character and effect of a conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts,but only by looking at it as a whole.
accord beltz travel serv.international air transport ass n,cir.thus,where a plaintiff is injured by one facet of a conspiracy he is entitled to damages regardless of whether the other facets of the defendants collusion had any economic impact on him.washington state bowling proprietors ass pacific lanes,cir.
the extent to which antitrust injury is recognized under the cartwright act is enlarged,by statute,in comparison to federal law.the act provides,at.bus.a emphasis added 
any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter,may sue therefor to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her 
this action may be brought by any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter,regardless of whether such injured person dealt directly or indirectly with the defendant.
the last clause was added by the california legislature following the supreme court decision in illinois brick illinois,d,which limited the ability of indirect purchasers to recover damages under the sherman and clayton acts.as a result,the more restrictive definition of antitrust injury under federal law does not apply to the cartwright act.cellular plus,superior court,th,d.the cellular plus court,affording standing to agents who allegedly lost sales due to prices having been artificially inflated by their principals,said that t he exact parameters of antitrust injury under section have not yet been established but that the scope of that term is broader than under federal law.id 
c speculative nature of harm 
the cheese makers argue that because other factors influence milk prices,the harm to plaintiffs is speculative.see associated contractors,at.partly because the alleged effects on the plaintiff may have been produced by independent factors,the plaintiff damages claim is also highly speculative.this argument fails in light of the complaint allegation that the rigged nce price controlled the price of fluid milk produced in california.whether experts will be able to measure the difference between the allegedly restrained price for milk and the price that would have prevailed but for the antitrust violation remains to be seen in deciding a rule b motion we are dealing only with the complaint allegations,which in this instance do not make the claim speculative.
d the risk of duplicative recovery 
there appears to be no risk of this nature.the allegedly underpaid plaintiffs sustained the injury.the cheese makers have not suggested anyone else who could sue to recover damages for the underpayment.
e complexity in apportioning damages 
this factor comes into play when multiple classes or layers of claimants seek,or might seek,compensation.it is totally absent here.
in summary,all elements of antitrust standing are satisfied on the face of the present complaint.
d.the filed rate doctrine 
california has a regulatory scheme for the marketing of milk.the legislature determined that it was essential to establish minimum producer prices at fair and reasonable levels so as to generate reasonable producer incomes that will promote the intelligent and orderly marketing of market milk and that minimum producer prices established by the director of the cdfa the director should not be unreasonably depressed because other factors have affected the levels of retail prices paid by consumers.cal.food agric.code h.to achieve these ends the director is authorized to prescribe marketing areas and to determine minimum prices to be paid to milk producers.cal.food agric.code.between and,the period of claimed injury to the plaintiffs,the director used the nce bulk cheese price as part of a formula to compute the minimum price of milk in california.by rigging the nce price,according to the complaint,the cheese makers artificially depressed the minimum price for milk,to plaintiffs damage.the cheese makers now argue that the filed rate doctrine requires dismissal of the action.
the filed rate doctrine originated in keogh chicago northwestern railway,where the court held that a private shipper could not recover treble damages against railway companies that had set uniform rates duly filed with,and approved by,the interstate commerce commission.two rationales were offered.first,the regulatory scheme allowed the recovery of damages for illegal rates in proceedings before the icc congress presumably would not have intended a second remedy.second,carrier rate regulation was primarily intended to prevent the charging of discriminatory rates,an objective which would be disserved by affording antitrust recovery to some shippers but not all.although the doctrine has been questioned by many including the supreme court itself,it lives on to a limited extent.see square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,d mci telecommunications v.at t,d.where damages are sought under the federal antitrust laws,the doctrine may preclude relief if the challenged rates or prices were set by either federal or state regulatory authorities.see wegoland nynex,cir.where damages are sought under a state law,it may apply if the challenged rates or prices were set by a federal regulatory authority.see,duggal capital communications,th,d county of stanislaus pacific gas,cir t he filed rate doctrine bars all and attempt to challenge a rate that a federal agency has reviewed and filed.
this case,however,involves only a state antitrust law being applied where an agency of that state has set a commodity price that,according to the complaint,was wrongfully depressed by manufacturers who collusively manipulated data submitted to and used by the agency.whether damages can be awarded to the injured parties is a matter of state law.california has held,in contrast to federal law,that no filed rate doctrine exists as a bar.in cellular plus,superior court,th,d,the defendant telephone service providers contended that the filed rate doctrine shielded them because the prices they charged for which the plaintiffs claimed were the result of a horizontal been filed with and approved by the california public utilities commission.id.at,d.the state court agreed that the filed rate doctrine would avail defendants if it applied,but held that under the cartwright act no such doctrine would bar recovery 
w e find no compelling underlying logic or policy reasons for denying a cartwright act cause of action for treble damages to a person injured by reason of a price fixing conspiracy,even if the fixed prices had been approved as reasonable by a regulatory agency.
the cellular plus court set out a number of reasons for not following keogh and square d,see th at,d,and concluded that to deny standing would implicitly encourage regulated companies to engage in anticompetitive price fixing activities.id.at,d.while the facts alleged here differ in some respects from those asserted in cellular plus,there is no reason to think that california would apply the filed rate doctrine that it has so clearly rejected.as we noted in county of stanislaus,at,cellular plus merely declined to create a state filed rate doctrine where rates filed with the state agency were not subject to federal review.
in a related argument,the cheese makers contend that the director in and considered and rejected claims that the nce bulk cheese price was rigged.the milk producers agree that the director decided to keep the nce price in the california minimum milk price formula,but deny that he exonerated the defendants or made any findings that would permit or justify.this dispute,like others raised by the parties,has no place in deciding a motion under rule b.we express no opinion as to the merits of the argument because,however it might be resolved at a later stage,it can not support a dismissal for failure to state a claim.
e.the commerce clause 
the cheese makers argue that the milk producers action,if allowed to proceed,would run afoul of the commerce clause,const.art.i,cl.but the supreme court has made clear that neither the sherman act nor the commerce clause preempts state antitrust laws.see,california arc am,d.on point is exxon governor of maryland,d,which concerned a maryland statute designed to foster competition by requiring oil refiners to divest themselves of retail service stations and charge a uniform price to all stations they supplied.id.at.the refiners challenged the statute,arguing that the commerce clause precluded enforcement of the maryland statute because the refiners were companies whose transactions should not be subjected to regulation by a state in which no refiners were located.the supreme court rejected the argument and upheld the right of states to apply their competition statutes unless lack of uniformity would impede the flow of goods.there is nothing to suggest that application of the cartwright act to prevent by buyers of california milk would impede the flow of goods.the conduct complained of took place not only in wisconsin,where nce was located,but in california,where the cheese makers allegedly purchased milk at prices artificially depressed by their combination in restraint of trade.that being so,california may apply its antitrust and unfair competition statutes consistent with the commerce clause 
unfair competition claim 
the milk producers unfair competition claim is brought under california unfair competition act,cal.bus,which prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.the cheese makers contend that because the antitrust claim must be dismissed,the unfair competition claim must fail as well because any finding of unfairness must be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition.communications,los angeles cellular,cal th,d.the argument must be rejected for three reasons 
first,the quoted statement in was limited to claims of unfairness to competitors,a category of cases unlike the case at bar.id.
second,the argument must fail in any event because the milk producers antitrust claim survives the present challenge.
third,a plaintiff may bring an unfair competition claim under california law unless some other provision bars the action by clearly permitting the conduct.see id.at,d.the milk producers are not barred from pursuing their cartwright act and unfair competition act claims together.
vi.conclusion 
it bears repeating that we are not concerned with which side will prevail at trial,or even with whether the milk producers claims will survive summary judgment.the cheese makers motion under.b tests only whether the complaint allegations are such that a set of facts within their scope could entitle the plaintiffs to relief.the present complaint satisfies that test.
reversed and remanded as to claims one and two affirmed as to claim three.will recover their costs in this court.
i respectfully dissent on two separate grounds.first,i can not agree with the majority conclusion that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.the record contains no final decision of the district court,as requires.second,even if we did have jurisdiction,i do not agree with the majority that plaintiffs have adequately stated claims for relief under california cartwright act and unfair competition law,california business and professions code et.accepting plaintiffs allegations as true,as we must under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,plaintiffs do not and can not allege any effect resulting from defendants purported collusion.accordingly,they fail to state either an antitrust or unfair competition claim under california law because i can not reconcile the majority analysis of plaintiffs alleged per se horizontal scheme with existing state and federal antitrust jurisprudence,i address the nature of plaintiffs cartwright act claim and plaintiffs failure to allege antitrust injury,as well as the jurisdictional defect 
jurisdiction 
even if the parties do not raise the issue of our jurisdiction,we must.wmx technologies,miller,cir en banc.this court jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of the district court.to be final for jurisdictional purposes,the district court ruling must fully adjudicate the issues,and clearly evidence the judge intention that it be the court final act in the matter.in re slimick,cir,citing united states schaefer brewing,d.

the district court order of december,was brief 
the court has considered defendants motions to dismiss,together with the moving and opposing papers.it is ordered that the motions to dismiss be,and hereby are,granted.
the district court plainly did not dismiss the entire action.by its terms,the order is not final and appealable.
the order,however,bears several stamps.in addition to those stating filed and entered,one is a checklist of four items docketed,mld copy ptys,mld notice ptys,and.the fourth item refers to the termination report that enables the clerk office to report monthly to the administrative office of the courts on the number and type of cases the court has terminated.see district court clerks manual under the federal rules,the clerk is responsible for keeping the civil docket,entering,among other things,all appearances,orders,verdicts,and judgments.a.here,the clerk entry in the civil docket reads order by judge terry hatter granting dfts motion to dismiss,terminating case ent,md,mld cpies nots.lori entry date.the clerk entry in the docket and the stamp on the face of the order thus conflict with the order language.
notwithstanding the clerk designation on the district court order and in the civil docket that the case was closed,a docket entry is not per se a judgment courts render judgments clerks only enter them on the court records.burke commissioner of internal revenue,cir.for purposes of determining whether a final judgment had been entered from which plaintiffs could appeal,the district court action,not the clerk,controls.see financial service yeomans,cir per curiam the entry on the docket sheet is merely a ministerial act performed by the court clerk pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.such entry is not a judicial act of adjudication exhibiting the judge statement of the substance of the court decision,sufficient as a basis for invoking this court jurisdiction.without a transcript,the court of appeals could not assess whether the district court statement from the bench embodied the essential elements of judgment or was merely a forecast of the final action it intended to take.id.at.here,not only is there no transcript,but there was no hearing.similarly,there was no minute order indicating the district court intended to enter a final judgment,nor is there a final judgment.the lack of a final written judgment entered by the clerk of the district court is not a technicality.a final written judgment is an indication to the parties and to this court that the district court considers its task completed.wood coast frame supply,cir see also state of california harvier,at the final order rule is more than a mere formality.the rule embodies the substantive policy that legal issues should be developed initially before the district courts.
the local rules for the central district of california similarly provide that n otation in the civil docket of entry of a memorandum of decision,an opinion of the court,or a minute order of the clerk shall not constitute entry of judgment pursuant to civ.and a unless specifically ordered by the judge.local rules for the central district of california,rule.the clerk act of entering a minute a minute order that would satisfy the separate judgment not effect an entry of judgment unless the district court judge specifically orders it to be so.radio television espanola new world entertainment,cir.the court added in the central district of california,to give the prevailing party awareness of its rights,simple procedures such as rendering a judgment in a separate document and entering that judgment as a judgment on the civil docket are all that have to be followed.the rules require no more than that,but can not be satisfied with less.id.at.
on this record,it is nearly impossible to ascertain the district court,rather than the clerk,intent.there was no hearing,minute order,or statement in the order.in addition,defendants kraft,borden,and alpine lace sought dismissal of plaintiffs complaint not the action for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in the opposition to defendants motion,plaintiffs requested leave to amend if the court granted defendants motion the record thus supports the conclusion that the district court did not intend to terminate the action.
our analysis would not be complete without recognizing the strong policy favoring leave to amend.in dismissing for failure to state a claim,a district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made,unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.lopez smith,cir en banc internal citations omitted.it is of no consequence that no request to amend the pleading was made in the district court.schreiber distributing furniture,cir.here,plaintiffs did seek leave to amend,and the district court nowhere indicated that it had determined plaintiffs could not cure the defects in their complaint.it simply is not reasonable to assume that the district court intended to dismiss the entire action in these circumstances.
it is possible,of course,that the district court did intend to dismiss the entire case and enter the requisite judgment,but that intent is not discernible from this record.i am not inclined either to read the district court subjective intent into the order or to deem the clerk ministerial actions a substitute for the requisite final judgment.accordingly,i would dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
plaintiffs failure to state a claim for relief 
context may not be everything,but it matters.this action presents a novel overarching question when a state has already stepped in to eliminate the uncertainties of competition by setting a price floor,can alleged meddling with the state regulatory scheme which lowers that floor violate the antitrust laws as it turns out,our courts offer no obvious answer.it is clear,though,that a rote application of antitrust federal or not particularly enlightening.only a return briefly to antitrust principles and common sense will aid in resolving the issue.first,though,the context.
california milk pricing system 
unlike the federal milk marketing orders that affect milk prices elsewhere in the united states,california uses a complex set of stabilization,marketing,and pooling plans to determine price.as the dairy marketing branch of the california department of food and agriculture cdfa stated,t he intricacies of the system are often not fully understood which leads to confusion even among those whose livelihood relies on this system.see milk pricing in california,at http.significantly for plaintiffs claims,the milk marketing program establishes minimum prices based on end product use.the cdfa dairy marketing branch explains 
these prices are established within defined marketing areas where milk production and marketing practices are similar.currently,california operates its milk pricing plan with two marketing areas northern california and southern california.each marketing area has a separate but essentially identical stabilization and marketing plan.each plan provides formulas for pricing the five classes of milk.
california milk pricing program dates back to.the legislature enacted the milk stabilization act,authorizing the director of agriculture to set minimum prices for milk at the producer,wholesale,and retail levels.see jersey maid milk products brock,cal d,the constitutionality of the scheme was upheld many years ago.golden cheese company of california voss,d.citations omitted.the legislature expressly intended the act to stabilize milk production and provide an adequate milk supply at reasonable prices to consumers.wallace consumers cooperative of berkeley,d,citing in re willing,cal d,
although the cdfa sets and enforces minimum prices,it has no authority to prohibit purchases and sales above that level.opinion,op.att y.indeed,the california attorney general quoted an earlier formal opinion regarding the milk marketing program with approval as follows the act does not in our opinion intend to protect distributors against the hazards of legitimate competition.id.at,quoting ops.cal.no.the attorney general added that the relevant statutory provisions in no way purport to deal with negotiated prices above the minimum prices established.in sum,california establishes the price floor,artificially propping up milk prices.plaintiffs may not sell and defendants may not purchase milk at a price below the floor,but nothing precludes transactions at any price above the support level.given this context,plaintiffs can not state a claim for violation of california antitrust laws based on the conduct alleged in their complaint.
california antitrust law 
the cartwright act generally condemns as unlawful every trust.cal.bus.it defines trust as a combination of capital,skill or acts to restrain trade,to limit or prevent competition or to fix or control prices.cal.bus.state bar of california antitrust and trade regulation law section,california antitrust law and supp ca antitrust law.california antitrust law generally contains provisions similar to the federal antitrust law,and both find their roots in common law precedent barring restraints of trade.see,exxon superior court koutney,th,d both the cartwright act,bus.et,and the sherman antitrust act,et,were enacted to promote free market competition and to prevent conspiracies or agreements in restraint or monopolization of trade.
although the cartwright act structure and language differ considerably from the sherman act,california courts have repeatedly found that the cartwright act was patterned after the sherman act.ca antitrust law at,citing blank kirwan,cal d,corwin los angeles newspaper service bureau,cal d,decisions under the latter act are applicable to the former.while this history of the cartwright act had no basis in fact,it had the obvious attraction of immediately creating a huge body of readily accessible law available to interpret the cartwright act.ca antitrust law at.
california courts have now recognized that the sherman and cartwright acts do differ in legislative intent and history,as well as in statutory construction and language.see ca antitrust law at.in state ex rel.van de kamp texaco,cal d,the california supreme court the history of the cartwright act.after determining that the cartwright act was not based on the sherman act,the court explained that judicial interpretation of the sherman act,while often helpful,is not directly probative of the cartwright drafters intent.ca antitrust law at,quoting texaco,cal d at.rather,the appropriate use of federal cases interpreting the sherman act is as an aid in interpreting our own cartwright act,not as controlling precedent cellular plus,superior court,th,d finding doctrine inapplicable to cause of action for price fixing under the cartwright act.just the same,the two acts share the purpose of promoting competition and increasing consumer welfare the enormous body of sherman act case law thus assures the continuing influence of sherman act precedents on cartwright act claims.see ca antitrust law at.
plaintiffs have alleged that defendants combined or colluded to suppress the cost of milk defendants purchased from plaintiffs.plaintiffs assert that defendants did so by selling cheese on a commodity exchange the national cheese exchange or nce at prices below those they could have sold their cheese for off the nce.plaintiffs allege that by combining to lower the cheese price on the nce,defendants manipulated the california milk pricing formula,and,consequently,the price of milk.this conduct,plaintiffs maintain,constitutes,and so,they also maintain,warrants application of a rule of per se liability for.see,kolling dow jones,d.any combination which tampers with price structures constitutes an unlawful activity.
there is a well established tradition of applying a rule of per se liability to.the rationale for this condemnation of business behavior that fits within the rubric of was set forth over seventy years ago,when the supreme court explained that the aim and result of every agreement,if effective,is the elimination of one form of competition.the power to fix prices,whether reasonably exercised or not,involves power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and unreasonable prices.united states trenton potteries.
to every rule,though,there are exceptions and limits.and in this area,the supreme court has inveighed against unthinking application of the rule of per se liability when the basic justification for the rule is not present.it is not always the case that a practice that fits the term in fact raises the concerns identified in trenton potteries.see bmi columbia broadcasting system,d literalness is overly simplistic and often overbroad.rather,following the supreme court lead,we should at least take a cursory look to determine whether the conduct at issue has such a predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect that a court can predict with confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it.state oil khan,khan associates,d.
following such a functional approach,the court in khan held that vertical maximum price fixing is not per se illegal the court in bmi similarly held that of the product of a joint venture was not per se illegal price fixing.the common thread in both cases was that an analysis of the economic effects of the practices did not make it clear that the rule of reason would condemn the practice.
while one can find allegations of literal fixing of prices in this case,the alleged behavior is functionally different from the that courts have condemned as illegal per se.plaintiffs fail to allege defendants tampered with prices in a way that necessarily would have an anticompetitive effect.in fact,based on the scheme alleged,anticompetitive effect can not be established at all.reducing plaintiffs allegations to their essence,defendants are accused of manipulating cheese prices,thereby causing the cdfa to use false that is,unrepresentatively low data on cheese prices,which in turn caused the cdfa to permit sales of milk at a lower floor price.
the majority,citing a treatise by professors areeda and hovenkamp,plausibly assert that if defendants successfully colluded to buy at a lower price,potential anticompetitive harm would occur if the buyers were able to drive the buying price below the price that would exist in competitive equilibrium.if buyers successfully fix prices in this way,transactions that would have occurred if buyers and sellers were subject to competitive conditions do not occur.sellers lose sales opportunities the upstream decrease in output areeda and hovenkamp identify and,potentially,buyers sell fewer goods the downstream decrease in output that areeda and hovenkamp describe.
but that is not what we have here.assuming that defendants succeeded in manipulating the nce so as to cause the cdfa to set a lower price support,we must remember that all this means is that there is now a lower lower price below which sellers are restrained from making deals.the to the paradigm case in which market participants meddle with simply to allow deals to be made over a broader range of potential prices.the existence of a new,lower price floor does not mandate that any sellers or buyers make deals at or near the new floor.absent some other alleged restraint on the market,the actual price will be determined by sellers and buyers acting independently of their respective competitors.with the lower price floor,the end result is a broader scope for independent and the free play of market forces.
this negative assessment of the alleged consequences further leads to the conclusion that plaintiffs face another obstacle,one that is fatal to their claim.notably,plaintiffs erroneously assert that they need not plead an antitrust injury when they allege a per se violation.the supreme court resolved this issue a decade ago in atlantic richfield company usa petroleum company,d arco.the court considered whether a firm sales losses caused by a competitor charging nonpredatory prices under a vertical,scheme constituted an antitrust injury.as long as the prices were not predatory,the court found,plaintiff harm was not an antitrust injury.to satisfy the antitrust injury requirement,a plaintiff must be adversely affected by an anticompetitive aspect of the defendant conduct.id.at,citing brunswick pueblo,d.significantly for the instant case,the supreme court held t he allegation of a per se violation does not obviate the need to satisfy this test.arco,at.indeed,t he need for this showing is at least as great under the per se rule as under the rule of reason.id.at.the court rejected the argument that any loss flowing from a per se violation of sherman act automatically satisfies the antitrust injury requirement.id.at.
the antitrust injury requirement serves an important function.as the supreme court explained,the requirement ensures that the harm claimed by the plaintiff corresponds to the rationale for finding a violation of the antitrust laws in the first place,and it prevents losses that stem from competition from supporting suits by private plaintiffs for either damages or equitable relief.id.at.although certain conduct might violate antitrust laws,it may not have effects 
p rocompetitive or aspects of practices that nominally violate the antitrust laws may cause serious harm to individuals,but this kind of harm is the essence of competition and should play no role in the definition of antitrust damages.
id.at,quoting page,the scope of liability for antitrust violations,stan,see also american ad management,general telephone company of california,cir the antitrust laws do not provide a remedy to every party injured by unlawful economic conduct.it is well established that the antitrust laws are only intended to preserve competition for the benefit of consumers.the antitrust injury requirement thus precludes any recovery for losses resulting from competition,even though such competition was actually caused by conduct violating the antitrust laws.ii phillip areeda and herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law ed.
nothing in recent california antitrust jurisprudence eliminates the antitrust injury requirement.in cellular plus,the court observed that the scope of the requirement was broader than under the sherman act,but relied on the definition in kolling,which in turn cited the supreme court decision in brunswick.th at,d.in cellular plus,moreover,the broader parameters of antitrust injury under the cartwright act simply permitted indirect purchasers to seek relief.the court never repudiated the law developed under the sherman act.
indeed,in cases since cellular plus,courts have affirmed california continued reliance on federal law for interpretive guidance.see,freeman san diego ass of realtors,th,d we frequently examine federal precedent because the cartwright act is similar in language and purpose to the sherman act although not.morrison viacom,th,d though not always directly probative of the cartwright drafters intent,judicial interpretations of the sherman act are,nevertheless,often helpful because of the similarity in language and purpose between the federal and state statutes.vinci waste management,th,d because the cartwright act has objectives identical to the federal antitrust acts,the california courts look to cases construing the federal antitrust laws for guidance in interpreting the california act.roth rhodes,th,d federal cases interpreting the sherman act are applicable to problems arising under the cartwright act.plaintiffs can not satisfy the requirement to plead an antitrust injury merely by alleging a per se antitrust violation.
following brunswick,plaintiffs have been required to prove injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.at.as this circuit stated in american ad management,p laintiffs sometimes forget that the antitrust injury analysis must begin with the identification of the defendant specific unlawful conduct.at.one of the functions that the inquiry into antitrust injury serves is to enable antitrust courts to dispose of more claims at an early stage of the litigation by simply examining the logic of plaintiff theory of injury ii areeda and hovenkamp,antitrust law at.
it is axiomatic that antitrust claims must make economic sense.adaptive power solutions,llc hughes missile systems,cir.the very purpose of the sherman act is protection of the economic freedom of participants in the relevant market.american ad management,at,quoting associated general contractors of california,california state council of carpenters,d.consistent with this principle,a plaintiff must suffer its injury in the market where competition is being restrained.parties whose injuries,though flowing from that which makes the defendant conduct unlawful,are experienced in another market do not suffer antitrust injury.id.at.
by alleging that the milk price supports would have been higher in the absence of the defendants manipulation of the nce,plaintiffs acknowledge that california milk prices are not set in a competitive market.over four decades ago,the united states department of agriculture explained the reasoning behind milk support prices,applicable to this day 
to control price cutting and destructive competition,to protect against producer price cuts and losses caused by dealers bankruptcies to protect a state producers and distributors against competition from milk,to maintain distributor margins that will enable the industry to pay reasonable prices to producers to prevent price manipulation by distributors for the purpose of strengthening their competitive position,to check rebates and other advantages given customers with exceptional bargaining powers and to make determination of resale prices public rather than a matter for secret understanding.
see bees butler,making sense of california milk standards and prices,agricultural and resource economics update,winter,quoting,report.the public policy behind price supports is distinctly non competitive in nature.see also knudsen creamery,cal d at,one of the purposes of the milk control act is to authorize and enable the director to prescribe marketing areas and to determine prices to producers for fluid milk or fluid cream,or both,and to eliminate economic disturbances and unfair trade practices in the milk industry.emphasis added.it is not enough to allege a disruption or distortion in competition every antitrust violation can be assumed to disrupt or distort competition.arco,at.injury in fact is not the same as antitrust injury,nor can the requirement be satisfied by broad allegations of harm to the market as an abstract entity.id.
although not so alleged in their complaint,plaintiffs characterize their claims as involving either a buyers cartel or monopsony.they have not,however,alleged that defendants could require plaintiffs to accept a specific price,which,of course,is the essence of a cartel.there are no allegations that defendants dominated the milk market in a manner that enabled them to restrict the milk producers ability to sell their milk to alternative buyers.see mandeville island farms american crystal sugar.describing sugar refiners total domination of the local sugar beet market.plaintiffs counsel conceded during oral argument that the milk producers were free to sell milk at prices above the minimum support price but for the fact that the demand for milk did not support a higher price.the complaint contains no allegation that defendants could or did restrain this demand.indeed,given that milk is used for a variety of other purposes besides the manufacture of cheese,it is doubtful that defendants could ever exercise monopsony power over the milk supply.see healthcare,at rejecting monopsony claim against an hmo that purchased doctors services because doctors have too many alternative buyers for their services.nothing prevents plaintiffs from selling their milk at any price above the floor to a willing buyer,whether that buyer is a cheese manufacturer,fluid milk bottler,butter plant,ice cream company,or other dairy product manufacturer.
the harm plaintiffs have alleged,namely,lowering of the milk price floor,will have one of two effects,neither of which is.if defendants managed to force the price floor down lower than it otherwise would be but that level was still above the price that would exist in a competitive market without any price supports,the lower price floor will simply allow transactions that would not have occurred under the higher price floor.the lower price floor actually opens the market up more to the forces of competition 
the second possibility is that the price floor resulting from defendants conduct will be below competitive equilibrium.there still will be no harm to competition precisely because only a price floor is at issue.milk producers still are permitted to sell at prices above the floor.and without an actual buyer cartel,the price that results should be the price set at competitive equilibrium.after all,milk producers will not sell below cost just because the law permits them to do so.
in sum,plaintiffs have not alleged conduct by defendants that should properly be analyzed as per se violations.moreover,even granting that defendants succeeded in manipulating the price of cheese on the nce and the milk pricing formula in california,plaintiffs have offered no viable theory or relevant authority to explain how lowering the price floor would restrain competitive forces.accordingly,i would affirm the district court order.
the plaintiffs are knevelbaard dairies,a general partnership,and john and sam knevelbaard.they sue for themselves and a putative class of others similarly situated.we express no opinion as to whether a class should be certified pursuant to.
the defendants are kraft foods,kraft,alpine lace brands,and borden.the district court dismissed the action as to a fourth defendant,national cheese exchange,for lack of personal jurisdiction the milk producers have expressly waived any appeal from that order.
the milk producers say the district court demonstrated its intent to issue an appealable dismissal by directing that it be entered pursuant to the rule governing entry of judgments.see martinez gomez,cir order of dismissal appealable when district court intended it to end the action.t
