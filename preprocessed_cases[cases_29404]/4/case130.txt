background 
iri and nielsen are both providers of retail tracking services.these services,as described by the district court,
involve the continuous collection of data on the sale of consumer packaged goods.from this data,retail tracking services suppliers produce estimates of trends in sales of product categories and brands,by relevant geographic region for each product category being tracked.
in short,a retail tracking service is the provision of information to manufacturers and retailers of consumer goods concerning turnover,market share,pricing and other aspects of the sale of fast moving consumer goods and analysis of that information to reveal market trends,business conditions,and the like.
information resources,d at citation omitted.both nielsen and iri provide these services in the united states.while nielsen also offers these services in several foreign countries,iri generally operates abroad through an assortment of subsidiaries and joint ventures.these foreign affiliates find the foreign clients,obtain the data from these clients,and deliver the completed reports to them.id.at.the data are processed and the resulting reports are generated by iri in the united states.
in this action,iri alleges that nielsen engaged in a variety of anticompetitive conduct,both in the united states and abroad,with the purpose of destroying iri as competition in the retail tracking services industry.the alleged antitrust violations include tying and bundling contracts in violation of section of the sherman act,monopolization and attempted monopolization of the export that is,foreign markets in violation of section of the sherman act,and attempted monopolization of the united states market in violation of section of the sherman act.among the principal allegations is that nielsen would offer favorable pricing conditions if nielsen services were purchased in a considerable number of countries,including,at least,one country where iri was present.information resources,d at.for purposes of the motion that is the subject of the instant appeal,nielsen did not contest these allegations.id.
nielsen moved for partial summary judgment on the grounds that iri lacks standing to sue for injuries suffered in foreign markets because the alleged injury was actually suffered by its subsidiaries and joint ventures and the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the foreign trade antitrust improvements act of,ftaia,to hear such claims because the foreign activities of which iri complains are beyond the reach of united states antitrust laws.id.the district court granted the motion on the sole ground that iri lacks standing with respect to harm suffered in the foreign markets.id.at.having found that iri lacks standing,the district court had no occasion to address whether iri claim would have been barred by the ftaia.iri then filed a motion to clarify the district court order and moved for leave to amend its complaint,both to add the foreign affiliates as plaintiffs and to assert claims under article of the treaty of rome.on february,the district court issued an order clarifying its previous judgment and denying leave to amend on the basis that the ftaia deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the foreign affiliates claims and the affiliates treaty of rome claims presented novel and complex questions of foreign law,counseling against the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.id.at.
iri asked the district court to enter final judgment under.b with respect to the grant of partial summary judgment and denial of leave to amend.over nielsen objection,the district court entered a determination and direction pursuant to rule b,directing the clerk to enter partial final judgment.iri appealed the judgment and nielsen moved to dismiss the appeal on grounds that the rule b certification was improperly granted.
discussion 
i.the instant appeal 
we recognize that this appeal poses a complex question of law with important implications for antitrust policy.the question of standing in this case hinges on how one characterizes the unique relationship between iri and its foreign affiliates.
iri contends that the relationship is akin to that between a manufacturer and independent dealers.iri cites to a discussion in phillip areeda et,antitrust law an analysis of antitrust principles and their application ed a leading treatise that canvasses antitrust policy and culls from case law and academic commentary.areeda describes a situation in which a manufacturer seeks to harm a rival manufacturer through anticompetitive conduct at the dealer level.in areeda hypothetical,the defendant is vertically integrated,including both the manufacturing entity and the dealer.the plaintiff operates only on the manufacturing level,using independent dealers for distribution.areeda explains that s tanding should be accorded the manufacturer because the two manufacturers are competitors in every relevant economic sense,even when one or more intermediaries lie between him and consumers.ii id,at.areeda distinguishes this rival manufacturer from a mere supplier,explaining that the former should be afforded standing while the latter should not.id.
iri argues that nielsen is comparable to the integrated defendant in areeda hypothetical,while iri affiliates are essentially the dealers or distributors of the data reports produced by iri.see,karseal richfield oil,cir holding that manufacturer of car wax had standing to sue distributor though they did not compete at same market level see also south dakota kansas city,cir citing with approval karseal and the areeda discussion south carolina council of milk producers,newton,cir holding that milk producers had standing in suit alleging anticompetitive activity at the wholesale and retail level,noting that the difference between the raw milk produced by plaintiffs and the homogenized milk sold by defendants is not so distinct as to categorize the plaintiffs as suppliers of a mere ingredient of the commodity sold by the defendants citicorp interbank card ass n,holding that bank had standing in suit alleging anticompetitive activity in credit card market even though card issuers were more direct participants sulmeyer,holding that producer of soft drink concentrate had standing in suit alleging anticompetitive activity in the marketing and distribution of soft drinks.
nielsen does not dispute the principles set forth by areeda.rather,it argues that iri is more accurately characterized not as a manufacturer or producer but as a mere supplier of one processing.serfecz jewel food stores,cir mall owners who lease rental space to grocery stores do not have standing to bring action alleging anticompetitive activity in the retail grocery market kansas city,at state of south dakota role as supplier of water rights for coal slurry pipeline project does not support antitrust standing in suit alleging anticompetitive conduct aimed at pipeline company associated radio serv.page airways,cir supplier of avionics equipment to companies that install systems in aircraft lacks standing to maintain action alleging antitrust violations in aircraft outfitting industry volasco prods.lloyd fry roo
