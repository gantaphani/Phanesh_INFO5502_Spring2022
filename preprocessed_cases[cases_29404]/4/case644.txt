in professional engineers in california government kempton cal th,d,kempton,we held that proposition,which expressly removed a constitutional restriction on the ability of state agencies to contract with private firms for architectural and engineering services on public works projects,also impliedly repealed certain regulatory statutes pertaining to private contracting that were derived from the constitutional provision.the present case involves two participants from kempton the question presented here is whether a provision of a memorandum of understanding between the state and a state employee union that restricts the use of private contractors for architectural and engineering services by public agencies fatally conflicts with proposition as we construed that initiative in kempton.we answer that it does and,so,affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
statement of the case 
background proposition 
proposition,entitled the fair competition and taxpayer savings act,was passed by the electorate on november.the initiative included both constitutional and statutory provisions.the constitutional provision,article xxii consists of two sections.section provides in relevant part that the state of california and all other governmental entities shall be allowed to contract with qualified private entities for architectural and engineering services for all public works of improvement.the choice and authority to contract shall extend to all phases of project development including permitting and environmental studies,services,design phase services and construction phase services.the choice and authority shall exist without regard to funding sources whether federal,state,regional,local or private,whether or not the project is programmed by a state,regional or local governmental entity,and whether or not the completed project is a part of any state owned or state operated system or facility.cal,art.xxii.section provides nothing contained in article vii of this constitution shall be construed to limit,restrict or prohibit the state or any other governmental entities,including,but not limited to,cities,counties,cities and counties,school districts and other special districts,local and regional agencies and joint power agencies,from contracting with private entities for the performance of architectural and engineering services.cal,art.xxii.
article vii of the state constitution,referred to in article xxii,section of the state constitution,establishes the state civil service.prior to the passage of proposition,the courts had interpreted the civil service mandate of article vii as an implied limitation on the use of private contractors that was intended to protect the civil service from political patronage appointments.article xxii,section thus removed article restrictions on contracting with private entities for architectural and engineering services by the state of california.
proposition also added a new chapter to the government code additionally,section of the initiative specified this initiative may be amended to further its purposes by statute,passed in each house by roll call vote entered in the journal,of the membership concurring,and signed by the governor.voter information guide,text of.
proceedings in the trial court 
on november,consulting engineers and land surveyors of california,john humber,and harris associates,filed an action against professional engineers in california government,the department of personnel administration dpa,and its then director,marty morgenstern,the department of finance,and its then director,steve peace,and the department of transportation caltrans,and its then director,jeff morales the complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief and a writ of mandate it also included a taxpayer action.
the complaint identified the parties as follows consulting engineers is a nonprofit corporation whose member firms perform consulting,architectural,engineering and land surveying services as private contractors with caltrans.humber is a taxpayer on whose behalf the taxpayer action was brought and harris is a corporation that had contracts with the caltrans for construction support services.professional engineers is the duly certified collective bargaining representative for members of state employee bargaining unit unit.dpa is the state agency responsible to conduct negotiations and enter into collective bargaining agreements with the exclusive bargaining units pursuant to the terms and provisions of the state relations act.the department of finance is the state agency responsible for supervision over the financial and business policies of the state.caltrans is the state agency responsible for administering the transportation facilities of the state,including decisions for contracting out architectural and engineering services.
consulting engineers alleged that the state,through the dpa,had entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with professional engineers,approved by the legislature as assembly bill reg.sess.and signed by davis.consulting engineers alleged further that the mou contained a provision that violated california constitution,article xxii,the constitutional provision added by proposition.the mou was attached as an exhibit to the complaint.
the provision in question,article of the mou article,captioned contracting out,consists of seven sections.article,paragraph a,states professional engineers has presented evidence that state departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by unit employees,and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the state.thus,the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the state does not incur unnecessary,additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the state by unit employees,consistent with the terms of this section.in achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the state ability to contract out for personal services.the parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by state departments.
paragraph b of article states except in extremely unusual or urgent,circumstances,or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law,federal mandate,or court,the state must make every effort to hire,utilize and retain unit employees before resorting to the use of private contractors.contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law,federal mandate,or court.
paragraph c of article requires that state agencies provide professional engineers with copies of requests for proposals and invitations for bid for personal services contracts if they call for services found in unit class specifications in order to provide professional engineers with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out,while still satisfying the needs of the state to provide services.department directors or their representatives are required to meet with professional engineers at its request for this purpose.
paragraph d of article establishes a joint committee of which half the members are to be drawn from professional engineers,while the remaining half consists of representatives of the dpa,the department of finance and affected departments.the committee is tasked with a review of all contracts with private entities that called for services found in unit class specifications.upon obtaining this information,the committee is to examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section,the terms of the contracts,all applicable laws,federal mandates and court.in this regard,the committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately,which contracts will take additional time to terminate,which contracts may continue for how long and under what conditions and how if necessary and cost effective to transition contract employees or positions into civil service.all determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the committee.remaining provisions of paragraph d involve distribution of any savings that accrued from termination of personal service contracts.
paragraph e of article states as its objective ensur ing that unit employees have preference over contract employees and,to that end,the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee classification is being performed by a contractor if the joint labor management committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the state to assign the work to a unit employee who would otherwise be displaced,this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section.
paragraph f exempts the department of corrections from article until such time as it has been approved by the federal court special master s.
finally,paragraph g of article provides the state is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations,government code as it pertains to restrictions on contracting out.thus,nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law public contract code.
according to consulting engineers complaint,article violates article xxii of the state constitution because article xxii vests the authority to make contracting out decisions in state agencies,not a committee created as a result of a bargaining process.
in their joint answer to consulting engineers complaint,the department of finance and caltrans agreed that,as to professional engineers,plaintiffs were entitled to the relief they sought including a declaration of the unconstitutionality of article,injunctive relief and a writ of mandate prohibiting implementation of article.professional engineers answered with a general denial of the allegations of the complaint,as did the dpa.
on july,following a court trial,the trial court granted declaratory relief and issued a permanent injunction and a writ of mandate against professional engineers finding that article of the unit mou,as approved and enacted by the legislature in ab,violates article xxii of the state constitution the trial court explained article of the unit mou deals directly with the issue of contracting for architectural and engineering services article establishes a policy that these civil service employees should be preferred over the use of private contractors.article,paragraphs b and it further establishes a procedure through which civil service employee representatives are to be given prior notice of potential outside contracts and the opportunity to present alternatives to them before they are awarded.article,paragraph beyond that,it also establishes a procedure in which a joint committee of civil service employee representatives and management is required to review existing outside contracts and determine when and how to terminate such contracts on grounds that are not specified in the article itself,as well as how to transition contract employees into civil service positions.article,paragraph article also includes a procedure under which outside contracts will be terminated in order to avoid displacement of civil service employees.article,paragraph these provisions of article limit the ability of the state to contract freely for architectural and engineering services.moreover,they do so in order to advance the interests of state civil service employees.they therefore are,on their face,directly in conflict with article xxii article also may not be viewed as a proper amendment of article xxii,because it does not further the purposes of article xxii and it was not passed by a vote of the legislature.see section of the initiative measure.article must therefore be declared as invalid as prayed by petitioner.
professional engineers appealed.a divided court of appeal affirmed the judgment.the majority concluded that article provisions restrict the ability of state authorities to freely contract out engineering services.the mandatory preference for civil service engineers,without a concomitant requirement of cost savings,does not ensure the best value for california taxpayers,and it undermines the goal of promoting fair competition.moreover,common sense dictates that the review and termination of existing contracts is not conducive to speeding the completion of backlogged projects.in other words,article contravenes the goals of proposition and thwarts the intent of the electorate.
the dissent argued that article was consistent with the authority granted to the state by proposition to choose whether to contract with private entities for architectural and engineering services because it represented a choice by the state to restrict its authority to do so.certainly,in light of the constitution,the contracting limitations set forth in the mou could not have been forced on the state.however,in this instance,the limitations were not imposed the state agreed to them.
we granted professional engineers petition for review.
ii.analysis 
introduction 
in its initial briefing,which preceded our decision in kempton,professional engineers raised many of the same arguments it had raised in kempton,and which we considered and rejected there.after we issued kempton,we sought supplemental briefing from the parties on its impact on this case.professional engineers supplemental briefs abandon most of its initial arguments and advance arguments that are both new and inconsistent with its previous arguments.nonetheless,we consider and dispose of these now apparently superseded arguments because this discussion provides the necessary context for discussing the arguments presented in professional engineers supplemental briefs.
professional engineers contends that the legislature approval of the mou in which article appears represents a valid exercise of the expanded authority conferred on the legislature by proposition to set policy with respect to private contracting by state agencies.this contention is supported by a series of predicate arguments.professional engineers argues that the intent of the electorate in enacting proposition was to expand the power of the legislature to decide whether to authorize individual agencies to contract with private entities for architectural and engineering services rather than permit the agencies themselves to make those decisions.this argument,in turn,is premised on professional engineers interpretation of the phrase state of california in section of article xxii of the state constitution as referring only to the legislature.as a corollary,professional engineers maintains that any broader construction of that phrase to include executive agencies violates the separation of powers doctrine by shifting legislative authority to set policy regarding private contracting from the legislature to such agencies.in this same vein,assuming that proposition did no more than expand legislative authority to set policy for private contracting,professional engineers maintains that we,as an appellate court,are required to broadly construe that expansion of authority.
in kempton,we decided whether proposition impliedly repealed certain statutory regulations on private contracting when it removed the constitutional restriction from which those statutes were derived.those provisions included government code sections,et and.each statute incorporated an exception to the general principle that article vii of the state constitution prohibited the use of private contractors to perform state functions in order to preserve the civil service system.those exceptions included the nature of the services rule,the new state function rule,and the cost savings exception.kempton,supra,cal th at,d.
we concluded that proposition impliedly repealed these statutes when it expressly repealed the constitutional restriction judicially construed from article vii of the state constitution because the provisions of proposition,authorizing private contracting free of article vii restrictions,can not be reconciled with the existing statutes that authorize private contracting by caltrans of architectural and engineering services,subject to conditions derived from t
