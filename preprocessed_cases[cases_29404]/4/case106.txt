defendants joseph amato and john fasciana appeal from judgments of conviction entered december,and december,respectively both amended may,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain,following an jury trial.on this appeal we write primarily on the subject of restitution.
three business executive,his lawyer,and an officer in the business from which the criminal activity in this case together and perpetrated a series of frauds against several states and a corporation that had purchased the small company which employed the three individuals.before trial the executive died.the the convicted for the frauds,and the trial court ordered them to make restitution.
restitution is a complex subject because civil and criminal restitution are somewhat different.the civil rule is often stated under the rubric of unjust enrichment a person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.restatement first of restitution.in the criminal law,victims rights are generally the focus of restitution provisions,including those contained in the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra,title ii,subtitle a,stat,the criminal statute with which we deal on this appeal.its purpose is primarily to restore the victim to his or her prior state of,and to that end to require federal criminal defendants to pay full restitution to the identifiable victims of their crimes,at,as reprinted in.
under the mvra,restitution must be ordered without consideration of the defendant economic circumstances.see f a.consequently,while going down the road to committing a crime may be as easy as the descent to avernus,the payment of restitution under the mvra can be as hard as the return to view etherial light.the question we must address is not whether the defendants are capable of making this payment but merely whether the items included in the restitution order fall within the scope of the mvra,as well as whether the order was otherwise properly calculated.
background 
fci,fci,a small manhattan consulting firm,was purchased in by electronic data systems corporation eds,headquartered in plano,texas,and became part of eds global securities industry group gsig.at the time of the purchase,michael reddy was fci chief executive officer,john fasciana was its legal counsel as well as reddy personal attorney,and joseph amato was a shareholder and officer of fci.each of these individuals assumed similar positions within gsig after the purchase.
the purchase agreement included an incentive plan under which eds would pay large bonuses to reddy and other gsig employees if gsig met certain performance targets.these performance targets were linked to gsig work helping client banks and brokerage firms minimize their losses due to escheatment.the work entailed reviewing escheated funds,such as unclaimed dividends or interest payments,and assisting clients in reclaiming from states those funds that were not properly subject to escheatment.it also entailed reviewing accounts in which clients placed funds marked for escheatment before turning them over to states,and identifying those funds that could be removed from these accounts to avoid escheatment in the first place.this work was typically performed on a contingency fee basis,which meant that gsig thus its progress towards meeting its performance tied to the amount of funds its clients were able to recover or save from escheatment.
gsig never met its performance targets.but reddy,fasciana,amato,and other fci employees conspired to deceive eds into believing it had so that eds would pay out the incentive plan bonuses.they did this by urging clients to retain funds to which these clients had no right,creating and submitting to various states fraudulent claims for the return of clients escheated funds,recording income from fees,stealing eds checks and laundering them through fasciana attorney trust accounts to make it look as though the checks were payments for gsig work,and misleading eds auditors in an attempt to conceal all of this fraudulent activity.
criminal charges against defendants 
as a result of this criminal activity the defendants were charged as follows count one of a superseding indictment filed on december,charged amato,fasciana,and reddy with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,in violation of.count two charged fasciana and reddy,and count three charged fasciana,amato,and reddy,with the substantive offense of mail fraud,in violation of,and.count four charged fasciana,amato,and reddy,and counts five through charged fasciana and reddy,with additional substantive mail and wire fraud offenses,in violation of,and.
reddy died before trial.amato and fasciana first trial in ended with a hung jury.following that first trial,judge swain granted fasciana motion for acquittal on count two of the indictment.trial on the remaining counts commenced on april,and ended on july,when the jury convicted both defendants on all counts remaining against them.
on november,judge swain sentenced fasciana to months of imprisonment,followed by three years of supervised release,and a mandatory special assessment of.judge swain sentenced amato on november,to a term of imprisonment of one year and one day,followed by three years of supervised release,and a mandatory special assessment.on may,judge swain held a restitution hearing,at which time she ordered the defendants to pay restitution of to eds as the victim of the offenses.this figure included in attorney fees and accounting costs that the district court found eds to have incurred as a result of its participation in the investigation and prosecution of defendants offenses.from their convictions and sentences both defendants appeal.
discussion 
on their consolidated appeal,amato and fasciana strongest challenge is to the district court restitution order.that is the principal subject of this opinion,and we address it in part i below.defendants also raise additional issues that we dispose of in part ii.those issues are,principally whether the district court erred by refusing to grant a new trial based on the government alleged withholding of impeachment material and newly discovered exculpatory evidence,refusing to sever amato trial from fasciana,improperly instructing the jury as to the meaning of false statements and fraudulent omissions,preventing the defense from fully prosecution witnesses,or allowing the prosecution to display photographs of the conspirators during closing arguments,and whether these purported errors require reversal when considered cumulatively.
we turn first to the restitution issue.
i restitution 
defendants primarily challenge the of eds attorney fees and accounting costs included in the restitution order.they argue such expenses are not authorized under the mandatory victims restitution act,and,even if they are,the expenses were not sufficiently documented to support the restitution ordered in this case.these arguments implicate the district court conclusions of law,which we review de novo,as well as its findings of fact,which we review for clear error.see united states boccagna,cir.overall,we review the district court restitution order deferentially,reversing only if in our view the trial court abused its discretion.see id.
a.the mvra in context 
when congress enacted the mvra,it was adding to a statutory sentencing structure in which restitution had only recently begun to play a prominent role.see,at,at.restitution has deep roots in the common law,but it was not until the victim and witness protection act of vwpa,stat,that congress first gave the federal district courts general statutory authority to order restitution as part of a criminal sentence outside of the probation context.see,at,as reprinted in,see also united states brown,cir discussing restitution common law roots.
the exercise of this authority under the vwpa is discretionary,and the act lists the particular types of restitution that may be considered.see vwpa,stat.at currently codified,as amended,at.in congress added to the list b,which provides that restitution orders may be used to reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care,transportation,and other expenses related to participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.violence against women act of,title iv,stat.
the mvra built on this structure by making restitution a mandatory part of the sentences imposed for certain categories of offenses.see mvra,stat.at codified at.the vwpa discretionary restitution provisions as amended over the years remain in,but the mvra added,among other things,a set of mandatory provisions in.see mvra,stat.at.one of these mandatory provisions,b,parallels nearly verbatim the discretionary provision quoted above.it requires district courts to reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care,transportation,and other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.b.
legal fees and accounting costs under the mvra 
it is undisputed that b applies to the fraud offenses committed by the defendants in the present case.see c a ii.the district court relied on this provision to include in its restitution order as other expenses certain attorney fees and accounting costs the court found eds to have incurred during its participation in the investigation and prosecution of the defendants fraud.
defendants first contention is that the term other expenses in b,as a matter of law,can not be read to include attorney fees and accounting costs.this question is one of first impression in our circuit.we hold that other expenses incurred during the victim participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense may include attorney fees and accounting costs.accord united states gordon,cir united states phillips,cir allowing restitution of costs incurred by victim university in conducting computer damage and systems evaluation and contacting individuals whose information had been stolen as a result of defendant computer hacking.
our conclusion follows from the plain language of the statute.that language gives the district courts broad authority to determine which of the victim expenses may be appropriately included in a restitution order.see gordon,at.the statute requires that the included expenses be necessary,and that they be incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.b.it also requires,as discussed further below,that these expenses be incurred by a victim within the meaning of a and that they not require unduly complicated determinations of fact,see c.the statute does not otherwise limit the type of expenses that may be included.
defendants arguments against including attorney fees and accounting costs in restitution order 
ejusdem generis 
defendants invoke the principle of ejusdem generis in urging us to exclude attorney fees and accounting costs from the definition of other expenses under b.they maintain the term other expenses should be read to include only those expenses similar in nature to the ones specifically listed in this provision lost income,child care expenses,and travel expenses.
ejusdem generis is a canon of statutory construction that dates back in law at least as far as the archbishop of canterbury case,eng.it literally means of the same kind or class.black law dictionary ed.under this canon,general terms that follow specific ones are interpreted to embrace only objects of the same kind or class as the specific ones.see,hall assocs.mattel,d.state dep t of soc.and health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,d.
ejusdem generis has its limits.like other canons of statutory construction,it is simply a helpful guide to legislative intent,not a dispositive one,and it does not require a court to give it unthinking reliance.see ali fed.bureau of prisons,d.moreover,it has long been recognized that ejusdem generis can not be called into play when the specific terms preceding the general one do not themselves have a common attribute from which a kind or class may be defined.see darius apostolos,state eckhardt.in ali federal bureau of prisons,the supreme court relied on this reasoning,in part,to reject ejusdem generis as a guide for interpreting the meaning of any other law enforcement officer in.see.at.while that general term is preceded in by the phrase officer of customs or excise,the supreme court found no relevant common attribute linking customs officers to excise officers.id.in other words,the specific terms did not define any generis within which the meaning of the general term could be circumscribed.
similarly,we find no relevant common attribute linking lost income,child care expenses,and transportation expenses in b.certainly,these are all expenses that one might conceivably incur while participating in an investigation or prosecution or attending proceedings.but we do not need ejusdem generis to limit other expenses to such activities since b already does so expressly.
it is true that our interpretation of the statute renders congress reference to child care and transportation expenses somewhat superfluous.but the supreme court confronted the same dilemma in ali and did not find it to be a sufficient reason,standing alone,to invoke ejusdem generis.see.at.the court reasoned that congress might sometimes use specific terms not to limit the succeeding general ones,but instead simply to remove any doubt that the specific terms are included under the statute.id.this reasoning is especially appropriate to b,the drafters of which may have feared that courts would overlook child care and transportation expenses unless these items were specifically named.such fears would not likely have extended to attorney fees and accounting costs because these expenses are so obviously associated with investigation and prosecution,particularly in the case of fraud offenses.
defendants maintain in addition that other expenses can not encompass attorney fees and accounting costs because such expenses amount only to indirect or consequential damages,whereas restitution is limited to direct harm.to support this assertion,defendants point to a number of cases in other circuits in which courts have rejected the inclusion of attorney fees in restitution orders on this basis united states radziszewski,cir as amended,government of virgin islands davis,cir,united states mullins,cir,and united states arvanitis,cir.
but none of these cases clearly address the language of b.davis,mullins,and arvanitis were all decided when the courts were interpreting the language of the vwpa codified at b.that language deals with the restitution of lost or damaged property,not investigation or prosecution expenses.whether or not attorney fees or auditing costs may be included in the calculation of lost or damaged property says nothing about whether they may be included in the calculation of expenses incurred during investigation or prosecution of an offense.
it is not entirely clear whether the seventh circuit in radziszewski was addressing restitution of property or of investigation and prosecution expenses.the cases cited in that opinion suggest the former.in any event,to the extent the seventh circuit held that attorney fees and auditing costs may not be included in a restitution order under b,we respectfully disagree.we also observe the seventh circuit has allowed the inclusion of auditing costs in a restitution order under b on the theory that such expenses constituted damage to the victim property.see united states scott,cir.
this is not to say defendants concern over the link between an offense and the resulting restitution award may be ignored.as we have said,attorney fees and accounting costs may be included under b only if they were necessary and incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.further,a restitution award under the mvra may be based only on victims who were directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of the offense,a,and restitution may not be imposed if the determination of c
