by petition for a writ of mandate,the coors brewing company coors seeks to invalidate an amended regulation of the department of alcoholic beverage control the department that effectively will prohibit alcoholic beverage licensees from continuing to conduct promotional contests in which cash prizes are given to consumers coors contends that the regulation,tit,which we will refer to as rule,must be struck down because it exceeds the scope of its enabling statute,business and professions code section.further section references are to the business and professions code unless otherwise specified.
at issue in this case is coors use of sweepstakes to promote its products.a sweepstakes is a contest in which a prize is or may be awarded to the winner.webster new internat.dict.in coors sweepstakes,consumers who purchase certain products,or who send in stamped envelopes without buying the products,receive entry cards listing a number.by calling the number,the consumers may enter the sweepstakes and,by following the instructions,are notified whether they have won a cash prize.winners are selected randomly by computer,and the number of prizes is set forth in the rules of the promotion.
coors claims rule is invalid because it will prohibit cash prize sweepstakes which,in coors view,do not run afoul of section.we issued an alternative writ of mandate and stayed the enforcement of rule pending further order of this court.
we now conclude rule is valid because it does not operate more broadly than section,which prohibits a licensee,such as coors,from giving any premium,gift,or free goods in connection with the sale or distribution of an alcoholic beverage,except when the premiums,gifts,or free goods are of inconsequential value.as we shall explain,a cash prize is a premium within the meaning of section.thus,rule prohibition against cash prize sweepstakes in connection with the sale or distribution of an alcoholic beverage is consistent with the enabling statute.
accordingly,we shall deny the relief requested by coors.

for many years,the department authorized alcoholic beverage suppliers to conduct sweepstakes,provided certain criteria were met.those criteria included no purchase of an alcoholic beverage could be required to enter alcoholic beverages could not be given as prizes entry blanks had to be made available through the print media and not exclusively through licensed premises the contest had to be nationwide or at least marketwide and retail licensees could not be given prizes.
effective january,the department promulgated,and the office of administrative law approved,an amended version of rule.
as relevant here,subdivision a of rule now provides free goods.no licensee shall,directly or indirectly,give any premium,gift,free goods,or other thing of value in connection with the sale,distribution,or sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages,and no retailer shall,directly or indirectly,receive any premium,gift,free goods or other thing of value from a supplier of alcoholic beverages,except as authorized by this rule or the alcoholic beverage control act.
subdivision b of rule now provides sale,sales,distribution or sales and distribution as used in this rule mean the total business of merchandising alcoholic beverages,including the solicitation of customers and the various methods and procedures used in advertising and promoting the sale of alcoholic beverages,as well as the actual transfer of title of alcoholic beverages.
and,following subdivisions that identify acceptable merchandising and contest activities,subdivision j was added to rule to provide limitations.nothing in this rule shall be construed to authorize the giving of any premium,gift or goods of any sort,whether by way of sweepstakes,drawings,prizes,promotions with a beverage product or products or any other method if the value of the premium,gift or goods given to an individual exceeds with respect to beer,with respect to wine or with respect to distilled spirits.
the department notified industry members,including coors,of the amendments to rule,and advised them that after april,any promotional activity in violation of the rule would be subject to enforcement action.
pursuant to section,coors petitioned for a writ of mandate to challenge the validity of the amendments to rule 
discussion 
the amendment to the united states constitution,which repealed the eighteenth amendment prohibition,reserves to the states an unusual degree of authority over the transportation and importation of alcoholic beverages.see rice alcoholic bev.appeals bd.cal d.among other things,article xx,section of our state constitution,establishes the department and grants it authority over the manufacture,importation,and sale of alcoholic beverages,in accordance with laws enacted by the legislature.

in miller brewing department of alcoholic beverage control,supra,d at page,this court concluded that,in view of its legislative history,distribution as used in section,must be afforded the broad definition utilized by the department.we found that miller brewing company promotional efforts,which included beverage merchandise giveaways,violated the rule and the statute.ibid.
in this case,coors focuses on the statutory prohibition against any premium,gift or free goods.coors argues that its sweepstakes prizes are always cash awards and thus are not free goods.it asserts that the act of entering the sweepstakes and becoming a random winner is sufficient consider
