continental airlines,and continental express,collectively continental,brought this antitrust action in april to challenge the installation of templates,which limit the size of baggage,at dulles airport.continental alleges that in agreeing to install the templates,united air lines,united,the primary air carrier at dulles,and the dulles airport airline management council amc,an unincorporated association of all airlines serving dulles,unreasonably restrained trade in violation of section of the sherman act.applying an abbreviated analysis,the district court granted summary judgment to continental,awarded continental in trebled damages,and permanently enjoined the use of templates at dulles.see continental airlines,united air lines,d granting summary judgment hereafter continental continental airlines,united air lines,d granting treble damages and an injunction hereafter continental ii.because issues of material fact remain disputed and because both the unique architectural configuration of dulles airport and the competitive effects of templates require thorough consideration in a less quick look,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
before setting forth the factual background giving rise to this case,we take note of the tragic events of september.those events and their ramifications have not yet mooted any aspect of this case although the federal aviation administration faa has now restricted the number of bags permitted to each passenger,to date it has not limited their size.yet we recognize that the tragedies of september now affect any discussion of air travel.their implications for security can not be overlooked and,on remand,the district court and the parties will undoubtedly have to deal with these issues in considering any prospective relief.having said that,we turn to the world before september,and the facts underlying this case.
in the,an increased volume of air travel and a growing desire to avoid checking luggage meant passengers carried more and more baggage onto commercial flights.m any aircraft did not have sufficient or overhead bin storage space to stow securely the number and size of bags brought onboard by the increasing number of passengers.continental,d at.the association of flight attendants,joined by united and some other airlines,lobbied congress and the faa to limit the size of baggage.those efforts have failed instead the faa simply requires each airline to scan baggage to control the size and amount carried on board in accordance with an approved baggage program in the airline operations specifications.a.in compliance with this regulation,each airline has published an faa tariff stating numerical and size limitations on luggage that it may enforce.
the increased volume of baggage has been linked to several problems delays,inconvenience to late boarding passengers from full overhead bins,conflict between airline staff and passengers,and reduced safety if baggage can not be properly stowed.baggage program,at june,codified at pt.airlines have explored various ways to respond to the increase in baggage,including one critical to this use of baggage templates.
baggage templates are pieces of plastic or stainless steel,mounted on hinges,that cover the mouths of baggage screening machines.when the templates are down,they narrow the mouth of the machine,preventing oversize baggage from passing through.generally,even when they are down,the templates permit all baggage sized within the published faa tariff of any airline to pass through.templates can be flipped upward to allow authorized larger baggage to bypass the templates.absent this authorization,when baggage does not fit through the template,it must be checked.
in continental experimented with templates at its hub in houston.frequent fliers in a focus group tested by continental found the templates annoying,and templates could not be used in at least one of continental hubs because another carrier objected.thus,in continental decided not to install templates,opting instead to expand its overhead bins and provide for more equipment and employees to permit passengers to carry on or as much luggage as they wished.
in may,a continental customer advisory board urged the airline to e ncourage people to check bags and complained of early boarding passengers usurping all baggage space people in row are putting bags in overhead bins in row.the majority of the group stated their belief that a baggage template is a good idea.similarly,continental senior vice president for airport services agreed in deposition that templates could reduce or eliminate monopolization of space by passengers,flight delays caused by the need to find space for baggage,conflict between airline crew and passengers over,and hazards to crew taking excess baggage down the jetway to the aircraft.
nevertheless,continental rejected templates and other ways to reduce baggage.instead,it focused on providing more space for baggage,and on increasing its services,so that when space on board had been exhausted,additional baggage could be checked at the gate or at the side of smaller planes without delaying flights.continental has received press attention as well as a number of awards,which it attributes to its excellent customer service,including its liberal baggage policy.it also maintains that this policy has attracted many customers.
united has also expanded its overhead bins to meet the problems of increased baggage.in fact,according to continental manager for product marketing,united began a program of bin expansion before continental followed as a competitive response.in addition,however,united has sought to impose a strict limit on baggage,restricting each passenger to two bags of limited size.finding it difficult to enforce the size limitation because of the subjectivity of the process,united looked for a more objective way to measure size and decided to try baggage templates.united expected many benefits from the use of templates,including a smoother boarding process,better performance,increased passenger comfort,and greater safety.
united initially experimented with templates in mid at its los angeles and chicago hubs,with mixed results.the test reduced delays by up to in los angeles and up to in chicago.however,united received complaints from customers,who threatened to move their business,and an internal united study determined that during the calendar year,while its template program ha d helped improve perceptions compared to american and airways continental larger bins ha d provided a solution with more customer value.nevertheless,united management decided to proceed with a plan to address the problems associated with baggage by consistently enforcing the number and size restrictions of its policy,educating consumers as to the benefits of the policy combined with larger overhead bins,and deploying templates wherever possible.airlines other than united and continental,including american,southwest,and delta,also considered templates,and a number,like united,adopted them.at present united has installed templates at security checkpoints used by its passengers in at least domestic airports.
in late,united sought to install templates at dulles,a united hub and one of the fastest growing airports in the country.this presented a special problem because the configuration of dulles is,as continental chief executive officer testified,unique.most airports have a number of security checkpoints,so that at most only a few airlines share any given security checkpoint.by contrast,at dulles every passenger for every flight must be screened at one of two common security checkpoints located in the main terminal,which in turn lead to a common sterile area.once in the sterile area,passengers take shuttles to the midfield concourse from which their flights depart.the combination of security checkpoints that must be shared by all airlines,a single sterile area also common to all,and the use of mobile shuttles,distinguishes dulles from every other major airport in the united states.
the airlines that serve dulles are members of the amc,an unincorporated association mandated by the faa the amc holds monthly meetings to resolve operating issues that necessarily affect more than one carrier at dulles.for example,federal law charges all airlines with the responsibility for airport security.the amc is thus responsible for the installation,maintenance,and management of security checkpoints at dulles.as a member of the amc,each airline receives one vote,regardless of size.thus,united,with of the gates making it the largest carrier at dulles,and continental,with one gate,each have one vote on the amc 
after some deliberation,the amc agreed to allow united to install templates at the east checkpoint,through which most of united passengers pass,for a trial period beginning december.the west checkpoint became congested because passengers circumvented the templates by avoiding the east checkpoint.once the trial period ended,the chairman of the amc asked united to remove the templates.united was in the middle of changing station managers and increasing service at dulles and did not remove the templates quickly.irritated,the amc hired a contractor to remove the templates from the east checkpoint in june united paid for the removal.
later in,a new united station manager formally asked the amc to consider reinstalling baggage templates,at least at the east checkpoint.after extensive discussion,the amc agreed that it would survey the carriers eligible to vote on the issue to determine whether they favored templates and to identify any specific areas of concern.of the carriers responding to the survey,fifteen,including united,favored the templates and five,including continental,opposed the templates.the survey form instructed that failure to return the ballot would be deemed a vote in favor of templates in accord with this policy,six airlines that did not respond were included with the fifteen voting in favor of templates to make the final vote.
one concern that surfaced both in the survey results and in subsequent amc discussions was the desire not to repeat the mistakes of the prior tests by installing templates at one checkpoint but not the other.deposition testimony revealed that no one participating in the amc template discussions,including continental representative and those of other carriers that did not favor the installation of templates,perceived that any member of the amc voting to install templates at dulles had an anticompetitive purpose in doing so.
the airlines met to discuss implementation of the template program.several airlines expressed concern that passengers not be limited by templates.the amc focused on an alternative system of tokens,called medallions,that airlines could distribute to their passengers,who would present the medallions to have the templates lifted for their bags.the amc adopted the medallion option as part of the template implementation.all amc members were asked to estimate the number of medallions they required and an initial distribution of medallions was made in proportion to each airline,and full coach fare passengers.the templates were installed at dulles on april.
shortly thereafter,continental filed this action,asserting that the dulles template program violated section of the sherman act.see.after filing suit,continental distributed medallions to its customers until it ran out of its initial supply.thereafter,it made no attempt to obtain more medallions.instead,continental had its employees and later contractual workers hired by continental at a cost of approximately a month lift the templates for continental passengers who wished to carry on larger bags.the employees also distributed literature notifying customers that continental was not responsible for the problems caused by the template restriction,attributing the decision to install templates at dulles solely to united not mentioning the majority vote of the amc,and relating that continental was seeking remedies to the problems caused by united.continental ii,d at.
nonetheless,the record reveals few complaints about the dulles templates.the metropolitan washington airport authority received no complaints about the templates and did not believe passengers found them confusing.similarly,no complaints about the templates were lodged with the amc.united received one written complaint and continental fewer than five.northwest airlines,which had opposed installation of the templates,received no complaints and found the template program worked so well that it ultimately found distribution of medallions to be unnecessary.
continental station manager testified at deposition that continental was able to get all customers with oversized bags through the security checkpoint by lifting the templates with or without the contract workers.continental did not reduce flights or reassign planes as a result of the templates.continental does not claim that the dulles templates or the costs of continental method of dealing with them affected any ticket price.
the district court granted summary judgment to continental.the court ruled that the template program constituted a horizontal restraint on output with manifest anticompetitive impact,and so required no further proof of anticompetitive effects.continental,d at.although antitrust law would ordinarily condemn joint restraints on output as illegal per se,because airlines must cooperate at airports,the district court determined to employ a analysis.id.at.accordingly,the court examined each asserted procompetitive justification for the template,timely departures,and passenger comfort.id.the court rejected all three,finding no record support for the proposition that the template program promote d competition among carriers in any way.id.at.having found anticompetitive impact with no redeeming procompetitive justifications,and thus having found an antitrust violation,the district court ruled that continental had suffered antitrust injury.id.at.after another hearing,the court awarded continental in trebled damages for its costs in hiring employees to lift the templates,and enjoined united and the amc from using templates at dulles.continental ii,d at.
we review a district court award of summary judgment de novo.m m med.supplies,pleasant valley,cir.the evidence of the nonmovant s is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in their favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.if after examining the entire record,in light of the controlling legal principles,a reviewing court concludes that material facts remain genuinely disputed,it must hold the grant of summary judgment improper.see,eastman kodak image tech,d.we turn now to those controlling legal principles and then to their application to the above facts 
section of the sherman act prohibits e very combination in restraint of trade.the supreme court,however,long ago established that section only outlaws restraints that are unreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions.standard oil united states.thus,to prevail on a claim that a horizontal restraint,an agreement among competitors,violates section,a plaintiff must prove that the restraint is unreasonable.a plaintiff can not prove the unreasonableness of a restraint merely by showing that it caused economic injury.rather,because t he antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition,not competitors,a plaintiff must show that the net effect of a challenged restraint is harmful to competition.atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d citation and emphasis omitted.a proven antitrust violation is a necessary predicate to recovery of antitrust damages.oil union oil,cir see also atlantic richfield,at.brunswick pueblo,d.
having proven an antitrust violation,an antitrust plaintiff seeking damages must show an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.id.lost profits and the costs of finding alternatives to mitigate the damages caused by an antitrust violation may constitute antitrust injury.oil,at.
in determining whether a plaintiff has proved that a horizontal agreement violates section,the supreme court has authorized three methods of analysis per se analysis,for obviously anticompetitive restraints,analysis,for those with some procompetitive justification,and the full rule of reason,for restraints whose net impact on competition is particularly difficult to determine.the boundaries between these levels of analysis are fluid there is generally no categorical line to be drawn between restraints that give rise to an intuitively obvious inference of anticompetitive effect and those that call for more detailed treatment.california dental ass ftc,d.instead,the three methods are best viewed as a continuum,on which the amount and range of information needed to evaluate a restraint varies depending on how highly suspicious and how unique the restraint is.see herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law see also california dental,at.in all cases,however,the criterion to be used in judging the validity of a restraint on trade is its impact on competition.ncaa bd.of regents of of,d.
the first approach,per se analysis,permits courts to make categorical judgments that certain practices,including price fixing,horizontal output restraints,and agreements,are illegal per se.northwest wholesale stationers,pac.stationery printing,d see also ncaa,at.practices suitable for per se analysis have been found over the years to be one s that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output,and that are not designed to increase economic efficiency and render markets more,rather than less,competitive.broad.music,cbs,d citations omitted hereafter bmi.such restrictions have such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect,and such limited potential for procompetitive benefit,that they are deemed unlawful per se without any need to conduct a detailed study of the markets on which the restraints operate or the actual effect of those restraints on competition.state oil khan,d.
at the other end of the spectrum,if the reasonableness of a restraint can not be determined without a thorough analysis of its net effects on competition in the relevant market,courts must apply a full analysis.see oksanen page mem l,cir.in such cases a plaintiff must prove what market was restrained and that the defendants played a significant role in the relevant market because a bsent this market power,any restraint on trade created by defendant action is unlikely to implicate section.id.the required analysis varies by case and may extend to a plenary market examination,california dental,at,covering the facts peculiar to the business,the history of the restraint,and the reasons why it was imposed,soc y of prof l eng rs united states,d,as well as the availability of reasonable,less restrictive alternatives.ncaa,at.bmi,at.
sometimes,the anticompetitive impact of a restraint is clear from a quick look,as in a per se case,but procompetitive justifications for it also exist.such intermediate cases may involve an industry in which horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all,ncaa,at,or in which a horizontal restraint otherwise plausibly increase s economic efficiency and renders markets more,rather than less,competitive.bmi,at.citation omitted.for these cases,abbreviated or analysis fills in the continuum between per se analysis and the full rule of reason.california dental,at.
the supreme court,in california dental,recently explained and illustrated at some length the subtlety that the analysis may require.the court emphasized that even when a court eschews a full analysis and so forgoes detailed examination of the relevant market,it must carefully consider a challenged restriction possible procompetitive justifications.id.at.
in california dental,the court reviewed a decision of the ninth circuit,which had applied analysis to ftc factual findings based on a full evidentiary record.california dental ass ftc,cir.an association of dentists had restricted its members advertising,banning claims of superior quality and imposing such detailed disclosure requirements for price advertisements that dentists effectively could not advertise across the board discounts or even low or affordable prices.id.at.the ninth circuit accepted that the advertising restrictions had obvious anticompetitive effects,because they reduced the price information available to consumers.id.at.the appeals court limited its analysis to determining whether the proffered justifications for the restrictions had any procompetitive effect,and rejected those justifications because of an asserted lack of record support for them.id.at finding no evidence that the rule has in fact led to increased disclosure and transparency of dental pricing.
the supreme court vacated the ninth circuit analysis as too cursory.ordinarily,advertising restrictions could be expected to harm competition,but the challenged restrictions affected a market for professional services,in which patients typically have much less information about the quality of service than the professionals who serve them.at.the high court instructed that although analysis does carr y the day when the great likelihood of anticompetitive effects can easily be ascertained,a quick look,or at least the kind of quick look employed by the ninth circuit,does not suffice if a challenged restraint might plausibly be thought to have a net procompetitive effect,or possibly no effect at all on competition.id.at.only if an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets would summary review like that conducted by the ninth circuit be proper.id.at.otherwise,determination of a restraint impact on competition call s for more than cursory treatment.id.at.what is required is an enquiry meet for the case,looking to the circumstances,details,and logic of a restraint.id.at.because the ninth circuit failed to provide this,the supreme court vacated its judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.id.
in cases involving plausible procompetitive justifications,which require more than cursory treatment of question s susceptible to empirical but not a priori analysis,id.at,a full record may often be necessary certainly courts have been wary of summary judgment in the context of analysis.in fact,the parties have not cited,and we have not found,a single case in which the supreme court has approved a analysis in which the parties received less than a full evidentiary hearing,either before an administrative agency or in court.see ftc indiana fed of dentists,d ncaa,at.soc y of prof l eng rs,at.see also california dental,at.
these principles govern our examination of the case at hand.for the reasons that follow,we believe that application of them to the facts of this case requires that we vacate the district court judgment.in a nutshell,although the district court demonstrated mastery of many intricacies of antitrust law,it performed too quick an analysis on an insufficiently developed factual record.
in several ways,the district court approach resembles that of the ninth circuit in california dental.
like the ninth circuit,the district court applied analysis because it accepted that the challenged restraint had obvious effects.compare california dental,at finding a fairly naked restraint citation omitted,with continental,d at finding manifest anticompetitive effects.then,again like the ninth circuit,the district court determined that the proffered procompetitive justifications for the alleged restraint were implausible because of a perceived lack of record support for those justifications.compare california dental,at t he record provides no evidence that the restraint has,in fact,led to increased procompetitive effects,with continental,d at there is no record support for the proposition that an agreement to standardize baggage size promotes competition.
in california dental,even though the lower court relied on based on a fully developed record,the supreme court vacated the ninth circuit judgment rejecting procompetitive justifications because the appeals court failed to scrutinize the assumption of relative anticompetitive tendencies.at.here,given the similar difficulty in the district court analysis,rendered on summary judgment without any,we too must vacate the district court judgment.
specifically,in holding the proffered procompetitive justifications for the template program implausible,the district court underestimated the significance of some undisputed material facts and wrongly ruled that other genuine disputes were immaterial we discuss each problem in turn.
although the district court properly noted that airlines must cooperate to share airports,rejecting per se analysis on that basis,continental,d at,it failed to recognize the extent to which dulles indisputably unique architectural configuration requires careful consideration of the template program competitive effect.
at dulles,all embarking passengers on all airlines must pass through one of two common security checkpoints,and because of the congestion problem revealed if templates are installed at just one checkpoint the two checkpoint locations can not vary in their treatment of baggage.unlike other airports,dulles can not use multiple checkpoints to permit variety in its many airlines treatment of baggage.in other words,dulles checkpoints constitute a single bottleneck facility that can not feasibly be duplicated,and therefore must be shared among rivals.paddock publ ns,chicago tribune,cir.absent an efficient way to differentiate among various airlines passengers at the checkpoints,but see part iv,the machines at the checkpoints must have mouths of some uniform size,and the airlines must cooperate in determining that size either small,as united and the amc prefer,or larger,as continental prefers.
of course,although operation of the machines themselves require cooperation,security concerns do not require the airlines to cooperate on the use of templates or justify the airlines agreement to do so.see see generally herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law.templates are not security devices,and no one in this litigation even contends that the need for the airlines to cooperate on security justifies the dulles template program ncaa,at.i t can not be said that the agreement on price is necessary to market the product at all.citation omitted.but unless an efficient way to differentiate among the passengers of different airlines emerges,dulles unique architecture does force all of its airlines to cooperate on a single decision as to the use of templates.when the economic implications of physical or geographical limitations require coordination among competitors,the supreme court has long applied section of the sherman act with flexibility.
more than ninety years ago,the court considered a railroad terminal in which the geographical and topographical situation required all railroad companies passing through the city to use one terminal,just as all airline passengers may have to pass through one type of security checkpoint at dulles.united states terminal ass n.the court held that because of the unique configuration of the railroad terminus,competing railway companies could legally combine indeed,were legally required to do so to control the facility.here,if the airlines did not have to share the continental had a security checkpoint at dulles that served only its would not permit the amc to require it to use templates.however,as in terminal railroad association,the presence of unique architectural constraints requires flexibility in applying section 
moreover,beyond the general need for greater cooperation at dulles than at other airports,united and continental each make a more specific claim,related to dulles unique configuration,as to why their respective preferred outcomes benefit competition.each argues that only a uniform policy in accordance with its preference will make possible an entire service that would not otherwise be available at dulles assertedly,continental must win to offer flights with largesse,and united must win to offer flights with rigor.the district court may ultimately have to choose between two procompetitive claims either outcome would both help and hurt competition,and which helps competition more than the other may be far from plain.see part iv.
in such a situation,the supreme court has advised that a fuller examination is necessary.in california dental,too,the context of the restraint plausibly had a similar mixed effect on competition.ordinarily,the restraint at competition,but the restrictions in california dental occurred in a professional context,at,a market in which patients had much less information on the quality of service than their dentists had.at bottom,the restrictions net impact on the information available to patients was unclear.accordingly,the restraint net effect could not be might even have been nil.id.at.the supreme court simply could not be sure how such a restraint would affect competition.
we have a similar difficulty.here also,the context in which the restraint airport with unique it possible that the restraint yields both positive and negative effects on competition.because the airlines must share the checkpoints,a decision that aids one airline service may necessarily hamper another.therefore,without additional analysis,it is as difficult for us as it was for the supreme court in california dental to determine the nature of the challenged restraint net effect on competition.the district court failure to give careful consideration to dulles unique architecture when it examined the templates impact on competition thus requires us to vacate its judgment.
the district court also erred in ruling that factual disputes over the proffered procompetitive justifications for the safety,more timely departures,and a better experience for immaterial.the court recognized the existence of genuine factual disputes as to the justifications,but miscalculated in ruling that they were not material.the district court concluded that the flying public wants sufficient onboard storage capacity and flexible policies,and that united attendant incidental problems with safety,timeliness,and passenger comfort only occurred because united had failed to meet that desire.continental,d at.even if the templates did improve safety,timeliness,and comfort,they were not procompetitive because,according to the district court,customers preferred that such problems be solved through generous policies like that of continental.thus in the district court view,the proffered justifications for the templates were,as a matter of law,not plausible or material.id.at.
again,the district court rationale resembles the ninth circuit in california dental.the ninth circuit found no record evidence that the challenged restrictions had the asserted positive effects,and further suggested that they were unlikely to have such effects.california dental,at.here,the district court recognized a dispute as to whether the templates had the asserted positive effects,but ruled that even if so,there was no record support for the proposition that achieving safety,timeliness,and comfort through templates promote d competition.continental,d at.in essence,each court dismissed the proffered procompetitive justifications because it found them implausible.compare california dental,at,with continental,d at.the supreme court held that the plausibility of competing claims as to the effect of the challenged is,the possibility that the restriction might have procompetitive effects or no effect at all rule d out the indulgently abbreviated review of the ninth circuit.at.so it is here.
review of the record in this case simply does not support the conclusion that the proffered justifications for the template program are,as a matter of law,implausible.rather,the record reveals factual disputes as to whether the proffered justifications plausibly enhance competition.continental has,to be sure,offered evidence indicating that these justifications are illusory.but united has submitted evidence that a size restriction on luggage can improve safety,takeoffs,and passengers flying experience,and that templates increase its efficiency in offering a new output,a service with these improved features.moreover,evidence in the record,including studies by both airlines,also supports the view that some customers value and have sought such benefits,achieved by
