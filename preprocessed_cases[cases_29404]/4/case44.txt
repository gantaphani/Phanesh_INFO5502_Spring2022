various new england subaru dealers dealers appeal the summary judgment entered in favor of their distributor,subaru of new england,sne,its sole shareholder and president,the late ernest boch,and its general manager,joseph appelbe,in a class action commenced on march.dealers assert that sne controlled the vehicle allocation process to coerce them into purchasing unwanted accessories,and stated claims under the federal automobile dealers day in court act addca,state dealer statutes,state contract law,the sherman and clayton antitrust acts,and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico.all claims were dismissed after discovery,and after careful review,we affirm.
background 
sne is the exclusive new england distributor of subaru products.since,it has contracted with subaru of america,soa to purchase a designated number of vehicles and to use its best efforts to promote and sell subaru vehicles and accessories through sales representatives.sne does not have the contractual right to sell vehicles to the public rather,its distributorship agreement limits its activities to promoting the sale of subaru products through the solicitation of and contracting with dealers.
sne contract with subaru dealers incorporates soa standard provisions.it requires the dealer to order and purchase cars,subject to availability,in adequate quantities and on a regular periodic basis in order for dealer to achieve adequate sales performance.although the agreement does not require sne to sell all of the cars to its dealers,it requires sne to allocate all subaru products equitably,using appropriate factors such as the respective inventory levels and sales performance of distributor dealers during a representative period of time immediately prior to such allocation.
a.the allocation system 
from february,until early,sne implemented the allocation provision under fair share ii.
fair share ii established the number of regular allocation cars that each dealer was entitled to receive under fixed and variable components.the fixed component was based on the higher of a dealership planned sales volume or its average actual sales three years prior to fair share ii.the variable component was based on a dealer rate of sales over time.essentially,the more cars the dealers sold,the more cars they would earn in future allocations.regular allocation vehicles comprised of all vehicles sold to dealers during the class period.
not every car that sne buys from soa,however,is distributed immediately to the dealers.sne engages in the industry of retaining a certain percentage of cars for discretionary purposes.fair share ii authorized sne to withhold of each vehicle shipment as discretionary vehicles,which was later revised to of legacy models and of all other models.fair share ii further states that sne will use these discretionary vehicles for demonstration,major auto shows,assistance to dealers,and vips.discretionary vehicles comprised of all vehicles sold to dealers during the class period.
meanwhile,the regular allocation vehicles rejected by dealers are referred to as turndown vehicles.fair share ii did not specify how turndown vehicles should be reallocated sne sold them to other dealers in their districts.any turndown vehicle that remained unsold at the end of the month became subject to the next monthly allocation.
finally,initial allocation and package models vehicles comprised of all cars distributed during the class period.initial allocation vehicles are distributed in the first monthly allocation of each new model year and are preaccessorized for dealers to display in the showroom.special package models are cars that sne accessorized to create new models they are sometimes built from the discretionary pool.
conditioning and concealment of accessories 
dealers allege that during the class january to august hit upon a scheme to maximize its profits by accessories before vehicle distribution.sne installed more than million worth of accessories during the class period,resulting in an average charge of per vehicle.to encourage such sales,sne paid its district managers commissions on the sale of these accessories,which amounted to between to of the managers total compensation.sne did not pay these commissions unless the district managers average gross profit on such sales met a prescribed target of,requiring about in accessory sales per vehicle.sne further encouraged the sale of overstocked accessories by providing district managers with focus letters identifying such accessories.
dealers assert that sne conditioned access to discretionary and turndown cars by coercing dealers to purchase accessories in regular allocation cars.as evidence,dealers present an expert analysis establishing a strong and statistically significant relationship between the volume of accessories purchased by dealers and the number of discretionary and turndown cars they subsequently purchased.dealers also present anecdotal evidence from dealers and former sne employees alleging that sne conditioned access to discretionary and turndown cars on a dealer assent to purchase accessories for regular allocations cars,and used techniques such as tampering with the allocations,altering the color and model mix of cars assigned to particular dealers,and refusing to fill sold orders from dealers who did not purchase enough accessories.
dealers also assert that sne fraudulently concealed its conditioning practice.as evidence,dealers offer letters sent by appelbe and another sne employee stating that accessories are strictly optional you do not have to purchase any accessories on any subaru you purchase from sne.moreover,sne told dealers at an advisory meeting on october,that no vehicles will be in the future with the exception of safari and rally models.an sne representative also stated in a letter to a dealer that you are always entitled to purchase vehicles with or without port installed accessories.
dealers filed suit under the addca,state dealer acts,rico,the sherman and clayton antitrust acts,and state contract law,arguing that sne coerced them into purchasing unwanted accessories and fraudulently concealed this practice.both dealers and sne submitted dueling summary judgment motions.on september,the district court denied dealers summary judgment motion and granted sne summary judgment motion on the addca,state dealer statutes,antitrust acts,rico,and state contract law claims specifically,the court held,inter alia,that sne conditioning practices do not violate the addca or the state dealer acts and will not support a rico extortion claim because they are not coercive they do not violate the antitrust laws because sne lacks market power in the relevant tying product market and they do not breach sne dealer agreements because they are not unlawful,unethical,or inequitable.george lussier,d at.dealers appeal the addca,state dealer law,state contract law,and rico claims.

ii.analysis 
a.the addca 
the addca provides automobile dealers with a federal cause of action against automobile manufacturers who fail to act in good faith in performing or complying with any of the terms or provisions of the franchise,or in terminating,canceling,or not renewing the franchise with said dealer emphasis added.the act defines good faith as 
the duty to act in a fair and equitable manner toward each other so as to guarantee the one party freedom from coercion,intimidation,or threats of coercion or intimidation from the other party provided,that recommendation,endorsement,exposition,persuasion,urging or argument shall not be deemed to constitute a lack of good faith.
in interpreting addca good faith provision,t his court has read the requirements of the addca very narrowly to require actual or threatened coercion or intimidation.general gmc,volvo white truck,et,cir quoting of puerto rico ford motor,cir emphasis added.lack of good faith does not simply mean malicious conduct or unfairness it must be found in the context of actual or threatened coercion or intimidation,at.coercion must be actual the mere fact that a dealer may have felt it had been coerced or intimidated is not sufficient.id.for example,a manufacturer condition ing continuation of a franchise upon certain conduct,even if characterizable as a threat,can not constitute forbidden coercion per se.it must appear that the condition was unfair or inequitable.volkswagen interamericana,rohlsen,cir.
this court has held,and we again emphasize,that coercion or intimidation under the addca must include a wrongful demand that would result in penalties or sanctions if not complied with.wallace motor sales,am.motors sales,cir agreeing with several other circuits that coercion or intimidation must include a wrongful demand which will result in sanctions if met.that is,to state a cause of action under the addca,the aggrieved dealer must produce evidence that the manufacturer or made a wrongful demand,coupled with sanctions,or threat thereof.id.at.otherwise,summary judgment is warranted if the dealer has produced no evidence showing that it was subjected to coercion or intimidation by the manufacturer or distributor.general gmc,at.
in the instant case,appellants argue that sne practice amounts to coercion and thus violates addca requirement because it solely benefits sne at the expense of dealers.appellants present three key pieces of evidence to show coercion expert testimony establishing a strong and statistically significant relationship between the volume of accessories purchased by dealers and the number of discretionary and turndown cars they subsequently purchased anecdotal evidence from dealers and former sne employees alleging that sne conditioned access to turndown and discretionary cars based on dealers assent to purchase accessories for regular allocation cars and data indicating the disparity in price of average accessories between turndown,discretionary,and initial and special model vehicles,respectively versus regular allocation vehicles.this proffered evidence ostensibly demonstrates that sne coerced appellant dealers to buy accessories in regular allocation cars to gain access to discretionary and turndown cars,and that sne installed leftover and unwanted accessories in turndown and discretionary cars.sne coercive practice,appellants argue,confers sole benefit to sne to the sole detriment of the dealers,who allegedly are unable to pass the cost increases to consumers and must wait longer to sell these highly accessorized cars.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants,we find that sne conduct does not amount to coercion within the meaning of addca.we simply fail to see how sne practice of conditioning access to,or accessorizing,discretionary and turndown which dealers concede they had no contractual right to coercion.
several courts have found no coercion for various conditions imposed by distributors for dealers access to vehicles which they were not entitled to receive.in cabriolet porsche audi,am.honda motor,cir,for example,the eleventh circuit held that a distributor offer of extra cars beyond the regular allocation process,in return for establishing an exclusive facility,does not amount to coercion in violation of addca.at.the court stated that w e have little doubt that had the distributor threatened to deny the dealer all cars,or any cars to which it was entitled,unless the dealer provided an exclusive facility,this would be evidence of coercion.id.at emphasis added.the distributor did not make a wrongful demand because it did not threaten to take away,and did not take away,cars to which the dealer was entitled under the allocation system.id.a manufacturer or distributor suggestions of ways to obtain extra cars than a dealer is entitled to receive under the regular allocation not amount to coercion in violation of addca.id.
similarly,in colonial dodge,chrysler,d,aff,cir,a district court granted summary judgment for the manufacturer because its requirement that dealers accept automobiles as a precondition to receiving excess,automobiles did not amount to coercion under the addca.as evidence,the dealers offered affidavits indicating that the manufacturer refused to supply vehicles beyond what was allocated under the turn and earn method unless the dealers agreed to order additional models.id.at.the court held that since dealers offered no evidence that the manufacturer was required under any existing agreement to provide these extra vehicles,or that the manufacturer threatened to cut back on their supply of other vehicles if dealers did not order additional vehicles beyond the turn and earn system,dealers can not demonstrate coercion within the meaning of the statute.id.thus,the court granted summary judgment for the manufacturer because dealers failed to establish any genuine dispute of material fact under the addca.id.
we find these cases persuasive,and thus hold that a manufacturer conditioning of access to vehicles beyond the regular allocation process,without more,does not amount to a wrongful demand that would constitute coercion under addca requirement.since dealers are not contractually entitled to these extra vehicles,a manufacturer decision to impose reasonable conditions for dealer access is neither wrongful nor even a demand.these conditions are not wrongful because they are part of a exchange,accessories for extra cars,taking cars to access discretionary highly desirable cars neither do these conditions constitute a demand because dealers need not take these extra cars.rather,these conditions constitute reasonable business judgments in a free market economy,and a distributor acting honestly is entitled to latitude in making commercial judgments.coady toyota motor,cir.summary judgment is therefore proper if a plaintiff dealer fails to offer evidence showing a wrongful demand and sanctions,and thus coercion,under the addca requirement.
here,since dealers concede that they had no contractual right to receive either turndown or discretionary vehicles this ends our inquiry.dealers proffered evidence,even if taken to be true,merely establishes that sne conditioned access to turndown and discretionary cars based on dealers assent to purchase accessories for regular allocation cars,and sne installed unwanted leftover accessories on the turndown and discretionary cars.however,since dealers offer no evidence indicating that sne made wrongful demands to access vehicles that dealers were contractually entitled to receive,the district court properly granted summary judgment for sne.
appellants nonetheless urge us to follow language from our decision in volkswagen interamericana,rohlsen,cir to define good faith under addca.in rohlsen,we held that the distributor termination of a dealer franchise related to the conduct of a dealer agency,or the dealer rejection of the distributor as partner on unreasonable terms,was a jury question.id.at.rohlsen states,in relevant part,that we think there is an important difference between two kinds of improper conditions that a manufacturer might impose and back up by threats.id.at.particularly suspect under the act are conditions which benefit only,or primarily,the manufacturer as distinguished from requirements that would tend to work to the mutual advantage of both parties.id.appellants allege that under this test,sne practice only benefits sne,and thus violates sne requirement.
we reject appellants reading on two grounds.first,appellants proffered test is mere dicta we merely explored two possible scenarios for a condition to constitute coercion under addca requirement.we never announced a test for coercion,and thus good faith,in rohlsen.see wallace,at this is the first time the meaning of this provision good faith in e has come up for review in this circuit.rather,we have now clarified that good faith under addca requires a showing of wrongful conduct coupled with sanctions,or threat thereof.see also id.at.and as we have explained,appellants fail to state a claim under this test.second,even under the alleged rohlsen test,appellants fail to show that sne practice lacks mutual benefit.appellant dealers gained the additional benefit of cars that they were not otherwise entitled to receive and the additional profits that could be gained therefrom.
finally,although we agree with appellants and amicus that the district court erred in instituting a brand new viability test,summary judgment is nonetheless warranted under the coercion test.contrary to the district court analysis,plaintiff dealers need not offer evidence that the contested practices threatened any dealer ability to conduct successful business operations to state a claim under addca.such requirement is too narrow.it is enough that dealers offer evidence that the manufacturer or distributor made a wrongful demand coupled with threats of sanctions,such as withholding vehicles that dealers are legally entitled to receive.the district court error,however,does not change the propriety of summary judgment in the instant case.see,torres dupont de nemours,cir citations omitted we may uphold the district court order granting summary judgment regardless of whether we reject or adopt its rationale,so long as an independently sufficient ground is made manifest by the record.
thus,we affirm the district court judgment on the addca claim.
state dealer acts 
in addition to the addca claim,appellants allege that the state statutory counterparts to the addca prohibit sne conduct.appellants argue that contrary to the district court holding,these state dealer statutes define coercion more broadly than the addca and,consequently,cover the type of conduct engaged in by sne.we disagree.
each of the six states where sne operates have enacted statutory counterparts to the adcca.makes it unlawful to coerce,rhode island maine and new make it unlawful to coerce or attempt to coerce,makes it unlawful to require or coerce,and makes it unlawful to require,dealers to buy,order,or accept accessories that they have not voluntarily ordered.of these,only the new hampshire statute defines coercion,which adopts language analogous to the addca 
appellants argue that the state dealer statutes prohibitions against coercing dealers into purchasing unordered accessories extend beyond coercion as understood under the addca.appellants cite a first circuit decision where we stated that in construing the massachusetts dealer act,b ad faith may encompass broader conduct under chapter than mere coercion or intimidation.general gmc,at citing tober foreign motors,reiter oldsmobile.this precedent,along with the statutes legislative history,ostensibly demonstrate a legislative intent to eliminate the dealer burden of showing wrongful conduct and threat of sanctions to state a claim under the state dealer acts.
although more compelling than the addca claim,we find appellants argument unpersuasive.first,appellants reliance on general gmc is misplaced.in general gmc,we held that although summary judgment was proper as to the addca claim because the dealer produced no evidence of coercion,summary judgment was improper as to the state dealer claim because genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the manufacturer acted in bad faith in terminating the dealer franchise.at.we reasoned that because chapter massachusetts counterpart to the not define bad faith or good cause,a court is not bound by the same restrictions that exist under addca b ad faith may encompass broader conduct than mere coercion or intimidation.id.at.our holding,however,interpreted section of,which prohibits manufacturers from acting in bad faith,and section e,which prohibits manufacturers from canceling or terminating a franchise without good cause.the issue here pertains to a different which prohibits coercion,specifically,the manufacturer coercion of dealers into purchasing accessories.therefore,we do not read general gmc to mean that coercion under the state dealer statutes automatically encompasses conduct beyond its meaning under addca.
to the contrary,courts have consistently held that coercion under state dealer statutes holds the same meaning as under the addca.see,hubbard chevrolet motors,cir declining to read a broader definition of coercion under mississippi dealer act because there is no evidence indicating that the mississippi statute further definition of coerce represents an effort to broaden the scope of good faith.gage motors,cir assuming that federal case law interpreting coercion under the addca also governed the similar language in the colorado statute subaru distrib.subaru of,d,noting that coercion has been interpreted to have the same meaning under both the new york dealer act and the addca colonial dodge,d at holding that w hile there are slight differences between the state and federal statutes,coercion under both the state act and the addca embodies the same concept,and accordingly the same analysis applies.
we find these cases instructive,and agree with the district court that coercion holds the same meaning under both the state dealer acts and the addca the rhode island supreme court has already defined its own state dealer statute as such we define coercion as a wrongful demand which will result in sanctions if not complied with.dunne leases cars trucks,kenworth truck,quoting marquis chrysler,cir quoting fray chevrolet sales,general motors,cir.as for massachusetts,maine,and vermont the fact that their state legislatures have not defined coercion suggest that they did not intend to give the word a different meaning than it has in the addca.while we are not bound by the same restrictions under addca because the state legislatures did not define coercion,general gmc,at reasoning that because the state counterpart to the addca does not define bad faith or good cause,a court is not bound by the same restrictions as under the addca in determining bad faith,we see no reason to depart from its federal meaning in this case.as for new hampshire,the fact that its definition of coercion mirrors the addca language suggests that it holds the same meaning of wrongful conduct and threat of sanctions as the addca.
finally,the fact that connecticut does not mention coercion,but merely makes it unlawful to require dealers to purchase unordered accessories,does not warrant reversal on the state dealer statute issue.we simply fail to see how sne is requiring dealers to purchase accessories in the discretionary and turndown cars when dealers need not purchase these cars in the first place individual dealers have no contractual obligation to receive or purchase any cars beyond the regular allocation process.since dealers are not required to purchase these accessories,no genuine issue of material fact exists under the connecticut statute.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court summary judgment on the state dealer statute claims.
state contract claims 
appellants also allege that sne breached its contractual obligation to allocate cars fairly and equitably by concealing the true terms for allocating discretionary and turndown cars the purchase of accessories.we are not convinced.
sne franchise agreement with each dealer obligates sne to perform its obligations under the agreement in a lawful and ethical manner,including allocat ing all affected subaru products equitably,using appropriate factors.fair share ii similarly expressed sne desire to allocate vehicles in a manner that,in sne opinion,will maximize the business opportunity for both sne and its dealers consistent with sne desire to allocate vehicles fairly and equitably.emphasis added.fair share ii is silent on turndown vehicles,but describes discretionary cars as v ehicles to be used as demonstrators by sne vehicles used for major auto shows vehicles set aside to assist dealers who,at the sole discretion of sne,need assistance and vehicles delivered to vips.emphasis in original.fair share ii also refers to discretionary cars as potentially used for market action,an undefined term.
appellants argue that sne breached these contractual obligations and deceived dealers by not stating that it intended to sell discretionary cars only with accessories,by not stating anything about turndown cars,and by using discretionary cars to
