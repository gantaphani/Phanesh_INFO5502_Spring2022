this appeal is taken from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york griesa,dismissing a complaint alleging that defendant elevator companies conspired to engage in anticompetitive conduct in violation of sections and of the sherman act,et the conspiracy claims,and that they unilaterally monopolized and attempted to monopolize the maintenance market for their elevators,in violation of section of the sherman act the claims.we affirm.the conspiracy claims provide no plausible ground to support the inference of an unlawful agreement,and the allegations of unilateral monopolization fail to allege a prior course of dealing.finally,the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing leave to amend the complaint.
plaintiffs represent a putative class of persons who purchased elevators elevator maintenance and repair services from defendants,sellers of elevators and maintenance services am.compl.the complaint alleges that 
defendants conspired to fix prices for the sale and the continuing maintenance of elevators,in violation of section of the sherman act,count i 
defendants conspired to monopolize the markets for the sale and maintenance of elevators,in violation of section of the sherman act,count ii and 
each defendant unilaterally monopolized and attempted to monopolize the maintenance market for its own elevators by making it difficult for independent maintenance companies and each other to service each defendant elevators,in violation of section of the sherman act counts 
as to the conspiracy claims,plaintiffs allege that,beginning in,defendants agreed 
to suppress and eliminate competition in the sale and service of elevators by fixing the price of elevators and replacement parts and services,rigging bids for contracts for elevator sales,allocating markets and customers for elevator sales and maintenance services,and rigging bids for contracts for elevator maintenance and repair services.
am.compl.plaintiffs assert that the conspiracy was undertaken and its effects felt in europe as well as in the united states,and that the conspiracy was effected by price fixing,bid rigging,and collusion to drive independent repair companies out of business.am.compl.the complaint references various investigations into alleged antitrust violations by defendants and their affiliates,one in italy and another by the european commission.am.compl.
as to the claims,plaintiffs assert that each defendant monopolized the maintenance market for its own elevators by such measures as interfering with delivery of replacement parts and intentionally designing their elevators to require proprietary maintenance tools which are not made available to competing service companies,embedded computer systems that can only be interfaced with handheld units.am.compl.
the district court granted defendants rule b motion to dismiss on the ground that the claims lacked the requisite factual predicate.in re elevator antitrust,civ,wl may.the court denied leave to and entered judgment in favor of defendants.id.at.this appeal followed.

we affirm the district court dismissal of the conspiracy claims because plaintiffs are unable to allege facts that would provide plausible grounds to infer an agreement,bell atlantic twombly,d.considerable uncertainty surrounds the breadth of the supreme court recent decision in twombly.iqbal hasty,cir.but we need not draw fine lines here our precedents support application of twombly to the conspiracy claims asserted under both section and section to survive a motion to dismiss under twombly,it is not enough to make allegations of an antitrust conspiracy that are consistent with an unlawful agreement to be viable,a complaint must contain enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that an agreement to engage in anticompetitive conduct was made.twombly.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.while twombly does not require heightened fact pleading of specifics,it does require enough facts to nudge plaintiffs claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.twombly.at.
plaintiffs argue that a plausible inference can be drawn from three sources in the complaint a averments of agreements made at some unidentified place and time b averments of parallel conduct and c evidence suggesting anticompetitive wrongdoing by certain defendants in europe.these allegations are insufficient to establish a plausible inference of agreement,and therefore to state a claim.
a conclusory allegations of agreement.as the district court observed,the complaint enumerates basically every type of conspiratorial activity that one could imagine the list is in entirely general terms without any specification of any particular activities by any particular defendant it is nothing more than a list of theoretical possibilities,which one could postulate without knowing any facts whatever.in re elevator antitrust,wl,at citing am.compl.such conclusory allegation s of agreement at some unidentified point do not supply facts adequate to show illegality.twombly.at amron morgan stanley inv.advisors,cir concluding that,in resisting a motion to dismiss,bald assertions and conclusions of law will not suffice.
b parallel conduct.plaintiffs argue that certain parallel conduct evinces a conspiracy,such as similarities in contractual language,pricing,and equipment design.am.compl.but these allegations do not constitute plausible grounds to infer an agreement because,while that conduct is consistent with conspiracy,it is just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.twombly.at.similar contract terms can reflect similar bargaining power and commercial goals not to mention boilerplate similar contract language can reflect the copying of documents that may not be secret similar pricing can suggest competition at least as plausibly as it can suggest anticompetitive conspiracy and similar equipment design can reflect the state of the art.an allegation of parallel conduct gets the complaint close to stating a claim,but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
c european misconduct.plaintiffs assert that the conspiracy claims are rendered plausible by specific factual allegations of defendants apparent anticompetitive misconduct in europe.the particulars are set out in the margin the european misconduct is alleged to reflect the existence of a worldwide conspiracy and even if the misconduct took place only in europe,it is alleged that the market in elevators is a global market,such that prices charged in the european market affect the prices in the united states and vice versa.am.compl.
plaintiffs provide an insufficient factual basis for their assertions of a worldwide conspiracy affecting a global market for elevators and maintenance services.allegations of anticompetitive wrongdoing in any evidence of linkage between such foreign conduct and conduct merely to suggest in defendants words that if it happened there,it could have happened here.and,regarding the nature of the elevator market,plaintiffs offer nothing more than conclusory allegations for example,there are no allegations of global marketing or fungible products,see empagran,no indication that participants monitored prices in other markets,see,heveafil sdn.bhd,cir,and no allegations of the actual pricing of elevators or maintenance services in the united states or changes therein attributable to defendants alleged misconduct.see generally todd exxon,cir to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,an alleged product market must bear a rational relation to the methodology courts prescribe to define a market for antitrust of the interchangeability of use or the of demand,and it must be pla
