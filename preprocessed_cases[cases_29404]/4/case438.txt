when a customer of telephone company a places a local call to a customer of telephone company b,the two companies cooperate to complete the call.traditionally,the telephone company of the individual receiving the call company b would bill the originating phone company company a for completing,or terminating,the call,on a basis.when the phone call went in the opposite direction from a company b customer to a company a customer the billing,too,would be reversed.underlying this reciprocal compensation arrangement was the assumption that,over time,the telephone traffic going in each direction would even out.
in the late,however,a technological development undermined that assumption the explosive growth of internet access.unlike calls exchanged between friends and family members,your internet service provider isp never calls you back all the telephone traffic originates from your phone line and terminates at the isp.following passage of the telecommunications act of,telephone companies were allowed for the first time to compete with each other for local telephone customers.some of these companies called competitive local exchange carriers clecs,as distinct from the monopolies that prevailed before,which are now known as the incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs realized that,in light of the reciprocal compensation regime,on the one hand,and the massively unidirectional traffic flows to isps,on the other,they could make a great deal of easy money by putting the two together.and so many of them did,targeting as their customers isps providing internet access.each time their isp customers received a phone call,the clecs would bill the originating phone company which tended,at least at first,to be an ilec for having terminated its call.but because the isps rarely made any outgoing phone calls,the clecs could receive a great deal of compensation without ever having to put the reciprocal in reciprocal compensation.
in,the federal communications commission fcc addressed this game of regulatory arbitrage in the in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic,hereinafter,isp remand order,which imposed a new compensation regime for traffic.in this case,we are asked to decide the proper scope of this alternative compensation regime.
at t which is a clec in california maintains that the isp remand order applies when the carrier originating the call and the carrier terminating the call are both clecs.pac west also a clec and the california public utilities commission cpuc together,appellees contend that the isp remand order compensation regime applies only to traffic between a clec and an ilec.the cpuc agreed with pac west limited reading of the reach of the compensation regime,finding it inapplicable to the traffic originating with at t and terminated by pac west,and so it assessed against at t charges consistent with pac west tariff.at t then sued pac west and the cpuc in federal district court,alleging that the isp remand order preempted appellees attempts to assess at t charges for traffic based on tariffs.the district court granted summary judgment to appellees,agreeing with their argument that the isp remand order does not apply to clec to clec traffic.
we agree with at t,and with the analysis contained in an amicus brief filed upon our request by the fcc,that the isp remand order compensation regime applies to traffic exchanged between two clecs.we therefore reverse.
regulatory background 
until passage of the telecommunications act of tca,stat.codified,as amended,in scattered sections of,local exchange carriers lecs those carriers responsible for telephone traffic within regions known as local access and transport areas latas,as distinct from or interexchange traffic operated as monopolies.see global naps cal.pub.utils.comm of,cir pac.bell.cal.pub.utils.comm n,cir see also verizon commcn,fcc,at t iowa utils.with the tca congress opened up the lec market to new entrants,eliminating their protected monopoly status.see verizon commc ns,at global naps,at.both at t and pac west took advantage of the new statute to compete with the two companies that had previously enjoyed monopoly lec status in different parts of california,verizon and pacific bell now sbc california.thus,for purposes of the local telephone markets relevant to this case,at t and pac west are clecs,and verizon and sbc california are ilecs.
the tca imposed special obligations on ilecs to mitigate their dominant market position.see c.but it also imposed on all carriers the duty to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.id.a.interconnection allows customers of one lec to call the customers of another,with the calling party lec the originating carrier transporting the call to the connection point,where the called party lec the terminating carrier takes over and transports the call to its end point.global naps,at quoting verizon cal.peevey,cir.
interconnection,however,is not costless.the tca therefore obligates lecs to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.b see also global naps,at.under a reciprocal compensation arrangement,the originating lec must compensate the terminating lec for delivering its customer call to the end point.peevey,at see also e.shortly after the passage of the tca,the fcc clarified that reciprocal compensation obligations apply only to traffic that originates and terminates within a local area.in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,interconnection between local exchange carriers and commercial mobile radio service providers,hereinafter,local competition order.
traditionally that is,before the widespread adoption of internet connectivity reciprocal compensation arrangements required the originating lec to pay the terminating lec for each minute of each call,each minute of use,or mou.see,isp remand order,at discussing the traditional assumptions of per minute pricing.the logic behind this system was that,over time,the number of calls going each way would be essentially the same,and no lec would pay more than its fair share of the costs associated with terminating other lecs traffic.see id.at.
with the advent of internet access,however,this arrangement led to a classic example of regulatory arbitrage certain clecs including pac west took advantage of the traditional reciprocal compensation scheme to target as its customers a species of company that received a high number of telephone calls but originated very few namely,isps offering internet access.see isp remand order,at.not only do isps rarely,if ever,make outgoing calls,but calls to isps are much longer than average telephone calls.see id.at.thus,clecs predominantly serving isp customers could collect huge sums in reciprocal compensation without ever having actually to reciprocate.
in response to the widespread practice of doing just that,the fcc promulgated an order in addressing the problem of phone calls.see in the matter of implementation of the local competition provision in the telecommunications act of,intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic,hereinafter,declaratory ruling.applying an analysis,whereby the geographic location of the telecommunications transmission beginning and end points are compared,the fcc took the position that phone calls to an isp do not actually terminate at the isp computers,but instead continue on to the servers typically located across state lines or even in foreign countries hosting the particular websites visited by the isp customers.see id.at.
for present purposes,the declaratory ruling analysis had two primary consequences.first,the fcc held that traffic is jurisdictionally interstate,see id.at and second,the fcc concluded that because traffic was not local,the statutory reciprocal compensation obligation did not apply to it.see id.at.there were no federal regulations or rulings governing intercarrier compensation for traffic at the time.the fcc filled the gap by directing that parties should be bound by their existing interconnection agreements.id.at.recognizing that some lecs had not yet entered into interconnection agreements,the fcc specified that state public utility commissions could determine in their arbitration proceedings at this point whether reciprocal compensation should be paid for traffic.id.at 
the declaratory ruling was subsequently challenged in a petition to the circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia,resulting in a decision vacating it as insufficiently legally justified and remanding to the fcc for further proceedings.see bell atl.fcc.
on remand,the fcc issued a new ruling reaching the same conclusion that traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation but,in light of the circuit legal ruling,on new grounds.see isp remand order,at.the fcc held that all local telecommunications traffic was subject to the b reciprocal compensation obligation unless it fell into one of the three exceptions contained in g,for exchange access,information access,and exchange services.the fcc then ruled that congress,through section g,expressly limited the reach of section b to exclude traffic.at see also id.at traffic falls within at least one of the three enumerated categories in subsection g.
in addition to setting forth a new legal basis for excluding traffic from the statutory reciprocal compensation obligation,the fcc acknowledged the degree to which regulatory arbitrage had distorted the market for telecommunications services.accordingly,and as an exercise of the fcc power under b the isp remand order set forth interim rules for how lecs would be compensated for traffic.these interim rules,central to this appeal,had four components 
rate caps.rather than implementing a flash cut to a new compensation regime that would upset the legitimate business expectations of carriers and their customers,the fcc imposed declining rate caps,starting at per mou and stabilizing,months after the isp remand order issued,at per mou.at.the rate caps had several limitations.first,they had no effect to the extent that states have ordered lecs to exchange traffic either at rates below the caps we adopt here or on a bill and keep basis or otherwise have not required payment of compensation for this traffic.id.at.insofar as particular interconnection agreements provided for compensation at higher rates,those higher rates were to apply only until carriers renegotiate expired or expiring interconnection agreements.id.at see also id.stating that the new rate caps d id not alter existing contractual obligations,except to the extent that parties are entitled to invoke contractual provisions.
the fcc d id not preempt any state commission decision regarding compensation for traffic for the period prior to the effective date of the interim regime we adopt here,but stated that b ecause we now exercise our authority under section to determine the appropriate intercarrier compensation for traffic state commissions will no longer have authority to address this issue.id.if the rate caps did not adequately compensate lecs for their expenses,the isp remand order explained,the lecs should look to their own customers for additional compensation.id.at.finally,as it is difficult for some carriers to identify particular traffic as,the fcc adopted a rebuttable presumption that traffic between two carriers that exceeds a ratio of terminating traffic to originating traffic is traffic subject to the new compensation regime.id.at.
growth cap.next,the isp remand order imposed a growth cap on total minutes for which a lec could receive reciprocal compensation.id.at.in,a lec could receive compensation for minutes equal to of what the lec received on an annualized basis for the first quarter of in,it could receive of what it received in and in onwards,it could receive compensation for the same amount of traffic that it received in.id.
new markets rule.third,the fcc implemented the new markets rule,which provided that where carriers are not exchanging traffic pursuant to interconnection agreements prior to adoption of the isp remand order,carriers shall exchange traffic on a basis.id.at.again,in a bill and keep compensation regime,each carrier bills its own customers for its costs and keeps those payments as its compensation,with no compensation exchanged between the originating and terminating lecs.see id.at.
mirroring rule.last,the isp remand order imposed a special rule on ilecs only the mirroring rule.id.at.the fcc thought that it would be unwise as a policy matter,and patently unfair to permit ilecs to benefit from the reduced rates the isp remand order instituted for traffic for which ilecs were,by and large,net payors while simultaneously allowing ilecs to recover the higher rates applicable to other forms of traffic for which ilecs were typically net payees.id.accordingly,it mandated that t he rate caps for traffic that we adopt here apply,therefore,only if an incumbent lec offers to exchange all traffic subject to section b at the same rate.id.
as the isp remand order emphasized,this new compensation regime was to be an interim measure.on the same day the isp remand order issued,the fcc published a notice of proposed rulemaking,setting forth for consideration a wholesale revision of the intercarrier compensation regime.see developing a unified intercarrier compensation regime,cc docket,notice of proposed rulemaking.
like its predecessor,the isp remand order was challenged via a petition to the circuit.once more,that circuit found the fcc legal justification for the new rules lacking,rejecting the fcc reliance on g.see worldcom,fcc.but in light of the fact that m any of the petitioners themselves favor,and there is plainly a likelihood that the commission has authority to elect such a system,the circuit refused to vacate the isp remand order,choosing instead to remand the case to give the fcc the opportunity to provide an alternative legal justification for its interim rules.id.at.
thus,all four components of the isp remand order remained in effect from the date of its issuance april,until october,when the fcc granted in part a petition of a clec,core communications,to forebear from enforcing the isp remand order.see petition of core communications,for forbearance under c from application of the isp remand order.hereinafter,core order.specifically,the fcc granted the petition with regards to the growth caps and new markets rule.
with regard to the growth caps,the fcc found that they were no longer in the public interest,particularly in light of the growth of broadband internet access and the corresponding decline in usage of internet services.see id.at see also id.at.the fcc explained that its decision to forebear from enforcing the new markets rule was due to a decrease in its concern over opportunities for arbitrage,primarily because of the widespread replacement of internet access with faster broadband services.in light of that development,the fcc explained,enforcing the new markets rule no longer outweighed the public interest in a uniform compensation regime.see id.at see also id.at.but the fcc declined to forebear from enforcing the rate caps and mirroring rule,finding that the petitioner had failed to justify their discontinuation.see id.
core communications then petitioned the circuit,challenging the partial denial of its petition for forbearance,and an ilec petitioned to challenge the fcc partial grant of core petition.the circuit upheld the core order in its entirety.in re core commc ns.the rate caps and mirroring rule remain in effect today,but the fcc has not the growth cap or new markets rule.
meanwhile,the fcc was dilatory in responding to the circuit remand in worldcom.therefore,on july,the circuit granted a writ of mandamus,ordering the fcc to provide a valid legal justification for its interim isp compensation regime in the form of a final,appealable order no later than november.in re core commc ns.the fcc responded with an order entitled in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,developing a unified intercarrier compensation regime,intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic,hereinafter,isp mandate order.the isp mandate order asserted yet another legal basis for its interim isp compensation regime the fcc general rulemaking authority under b and j see id.at.this time the circuit accepted the fcc legal justification as reasonable,see core commc ns,fcc,and rejected the argument that the interim rules were arbitrary and capricious,see id.at.
the net result of these lengthy set of proceedings,as relevant to this case,is as follows the new markets rule,which required lecs not exchanging traffic pursuant to an interconnection agreement prior to the issuance of the isp remand order on april,to compensate each other on a bill and keep basis,remained in effect until october,when the core order was issued.the mirroring rule and the rate caps including its rebuttable presumption regarding traffic have remained in effect continuously since the isp remand order was issued.from april,onwards,the intercarrier rate for traffic has been capped at mou.
factual and procedural history 
pac west has been operating in california as a clec since and has had intrastate tariffs on file with the cpuc since december.these tariffs,which have been amended several times since first filed,purport to set pacwest rates for,inter alia,terminating local traffic originating with another lec they apply only in the absence of an interconnection agreement.
at t and pac west do not have and have never had an interconnection agreement with each other.therefore,at all times relevant to this appeal,they have been exchanging traffic indirectly,with the traffic routed primarily through one of california two ilecs,verizon and sbc california,with whom both at t and pac west have interconnection agreements.the ilecs thus served as conduits for traffic going between pac west and at pac west agreements with the ilecs provided that neither party would bill the other for this transit traffic,and that for all transit traffic pac west terminated,pac west would bill the lec originating the traffic.nonetheless,and for reasons unknown to us,for a few years,pac west billed the ilecs rather than at t for transit traffic at t originated.
starting in july,sbc california refused to pay pacwest for this transit traffic,and verizon did the same beginning in september.pac west then began billing at t for the traffic at t originated,but at t refused to pay.the parties had no direct discussions about the issue until late,when pac west sent at t a formal request for negotiation of an interconnection agreement between our companies as provided for in sections a and specifically b of the tca.at t responded in february by stating that it has no interest in entering into such an agreement that,as a clec,it had no obligation to negotiate an interconnection and that under the new markets rule,the two carriers should continue to exchange all of their traffic including that which was on a bill and keep basis.the parties had additional communications but could not reach an accord.
pac west filed a complaint with the cpuc on october,alleging that at t owed it more than million in reciprocal compensation for the at traffic pacwest had terminated since august,billed at pac west state tariff rates.for the sole purpose of deciding the legal issues,pac west stipulated that all at traffic it terminated was once the legal issues were resolved,however,pac west reserved its right to demonstrate later that at least some of the traffic was not bound to isps similarly,both parties stipulated to the amount of traffic at issue and the amount of compensation pac west would be due million if its tariff applied.
the cpuc issued its order on june,holding that the new markets rule did not apply where,as here,two clecs are exchanging traffic indirectly and without an interconnection agreement.see pac west telecomm v.at t commc ns of,wl,at cal.pub.util.june.the cpuc ruled that the new markets rule can not be applied absent a mirroring offer,because to do so would permit at t to receive compensation in situations in which it is a net payee,but avoid paying anything when,as in the at t pac west relationship,at t is a net payor.because the mirroring rule only applies to ilecs,which at t is not in california,the cpuc held that at t could not benefit from the new markets rule.see id.at.relying on a fcc order,t mobile the cpuc held that in the absence of governing federal law,pac west tariff was the appropriate place to look for the applicable rate,and awarded pacwest million in compensation,but no interest.see id.at.
thereafter,at t sought rehearing by the cpuc,arguing for the first time that the cpuc lacked jurisdiction to hear a dispute regarding interstate traffic outside of an arbitration proceeding pursuant to.see pacific bell pac west telecomm,cir discussing the state public utilities commissions powers under to arbitrat e,approv e,and enforc e interconnection agreements.the cpuc denied at t rehearing request.see pac west telecomm v.at t commc ns of,wl,at.
in the meanwhile,at t filed this suit in the district court for the northern district of california requesting a declaration that the cpuc order was preempted by the tca an order enjoining the cpuc from enforcing it and an order requiring pac west to return the approximately million at t had paid it in accordance with the cpuc decision following for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to pac west and the cpuc,upholding the cpuc decision in all respects.see at t commc ns pac west telecomm,no.c,wl,at.with regard to the applicability of isp remand order isp compensation regime to the manner in which two clecs may be compensated for the exchange traffic,the district court held that this issue was not before the fcc when it crafted the isp remand order,and so the isp remand order did not preempt the cpuc decision.id.at citation omitted.at t timely appealed.
after oral argument on this appeal,we invited the fcc to submit its views regarding the scope of the isp remand order.the fcc accepted the invitation and submitted an amicus brief on february,to which the parties responded several weeks later.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see pacific bell,at.in so doing,we review de novo whether the cpuc orders are consistent with the tca and the implementing regulations,and we review all other issues under an arbitrary and capricious standard.id.
we begin with a few principles.first,there is no question that,for jurisdictional purposes,traffic is interstate in nature.see pacific bell,at.traffic is therefore subject to the fcc jurisdiction.see core commc ns,at.within this ambit,the fcc actions can preempt state regulation to the contrary.see barrientos morton llc,cir citing city of n.fcc,see also wyeth levine.
but,as the district court noted,a matter may be subject to fcc jurisdiction without the fcc having exercised that jurisdiction and preempted state regulation.wl,at quoting global naps,verizon new,cir hereinafter global naps i.determining whether the fcc has chosen to displace state law turns on the scope of its intent in exercising its jurisdiction.see barrientos,at.
in issuing the isp remand order,the fcc clearly understood that it was displacing at least some state laws.see isp remand order,at because we now exercise our authority under section to determine the appropriate intercarrier compensation for traffic,however,state commissions will no longer have authority to address this issue.nonetheless,it is also well settled that,with the isp remand order and related pronouncements,the fcc has not exercised its jurisdiction over all manifestations of traffic.for example,this court held in peevey that the cpuc correctly interpreted the isp remand order as not applying to interexchange that is,traffic.see at.other courts have reached the same conclusion.see global naps i,at global naps,verizon new,cir global naps iii same,even after isp mandate order global naps,verizon new,cir global naps ii holding that the fcc did not intend to preempt the state commissions authority to define local calling areas for the purposes of intercarrier compensation.
in sum,it is well settled that the isp remand order has preemptive effect with regard to the issues it encompasses.the operative question in this case,then,is whether the isp remand order evidences the fcc intent to exercise its jurisdiction over local traffic exchanged between two clecs.
we begin with the fcc language choice in that order.to facilitate our inquiry,we reproduce the paragraph of the isp remand order setting forth the new markets rule in its entirety 
a different rule applies in the case where carriers are not exchanging traffic pursuant to interconnection agreements prior to adoption of this order where,for example,a new carrier enters the market or an existing carrier expands into a market it previously had not served.in such a case,as of the effective date of this order,carriers shall exchange traffic on a basis during this interim period.we adopt this rule for several reasons.first,our goal here is to address and curtail a pressing problem that has created opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and distorted the operation of competitive markets.in so doing,we seek to confine these market problems to the maximum extent while seeking an appropriate resolution in the proceeding initiated by the companion notice of proposed rulemaking.allowing carriers in the interim to expand into new markets using the very intercarrier compensation mechanisms that have led to the existing problems would exacerbate the market problems we seek to ameliorate.for this reason,we believe that a standstill on any expansion of the old compensation regime into new markets is the more appropriate interim answer.second,unlike those carriers that are presently serving isp customers under existing interconnection agreements,carriers entering new markets to serve isps have not acted in reliance on reciprocal compensation revenues and thus have no need of a transition during which to make adjustments to their prior business plans.
isp remand order,at emphases added,footnote omitted.use of the broad terms carrier and intercarrier compensation,the former of which is a term encompassing both clecs and ilecs suggests an intent to apply the new markets rule to all intercarrier relationships,not solely to ilec clec arrangements.
moreover,the fcc at other junctures in the isp remand order referred specifically to ilecs and clecs,further indicating that the terms carrier and lecs,used throughout the order,applied generally to all carriers,except as otherwise stated.for example,in the paragraph describing the mirroring rule which,everyone agrees,applies only to ilecs the isp remand order referred specifically to ilecs seven times not once did it use the generic term lec or refer to clecs.see isp remand order,at.ordinarily,we presume that the use of different words in connection with the same subject signifies that the drafter intended to convey different meanings by its disparate word choice arizona health care cost containment mcclellan,cir see also warre.comm r of the ssa,cir.
nonetheless,the cpuc and the district court held that other portions of the isp remand order indicate an intent to apply the entire interim compensation regime only to ilec clec combinations.for example,just after describing the new markets rule,the isp remand order stated that t he interim compensation regime we establish here applies as carriers renegotiate expired or expiring interconnection agreements.it does not alter existing contractual obligations isp remand order,at.the district court reasoned that because only ilecs have a duty to negotiate interconnection agreements,t hat fact suggests that the fcc was focused on the relationship between ilecs and clecs when it crafted the isp remand order.wl,at.
the cpuc and the district court found further evidence that the fcc was concerned only with clecs taking advantage of ilecs in the description of the mirroring rule.in setting forth that rule,the isp remand order explained 
it would be unwise as a policy matter,and patently unfair,to allow incumbent lecs to benefit from reduced intercarrier compensation rates for traffic,with respect to which they are net payors,while permitting them to exchange traffic at state reciprocal compensation rates,which are much higher than the caps we adopt here,when the traffic imbalance is reversed.because we are concerned about the superior bargaining power of incumbent lecs,we will not allow them to pick and choose intercarrier compensation regimes,depending on the nature of the traffic exchanged with another carrier.the rate caps for traffic that we adopt here apply,therefore,only if an incumbent lec offers to exchange all traffic subject to section b at the same rate.thus,if the applicable rate cap is mou,the ilec must offer to exchange section b traffic at that same rate.similarly,if an ilec wishes to continue to exchange traffic on a bill and keep basis in a state that has ordered bill and keep,it must offer to exchange all section b traffic on a bill and keep basis.for those incumbent lecs that choose not to offer to exchange section b traffic subject to the same rate caps we adopt for traffic,we order them to exchange traffic at the or reciprocal compensation rates reflected in their contracts.this mirroring rule ensures that incumbent lecs will pay the same rates for traffic that they receive for section b traffic.
isp remand order,at footnotes omitted.as previously mentioned,the mirroring rule reflects the fcc concern for the possibility of a different kind of arbitrage created by the new rules that ilecs,responsible for terminating the majority of local traffic,would be able to avoid paying anything to clecs for traffic or paying the capped rate for traffic if the ilec and clec had an agreement while still receiving uncapped compensation for all other types of traffic.
the district court reasoned that i f the fcc was concerned about the possibility of regulatory arbitrage between two clecs,it is reasonable to assume that it would have required the mirroring rule to apply to all lecs.wl,at.the cpuc reasoned similarly in its decision that if the new markets rule could be applied in the absence of a mirroring offer,then clecs could exploit this new opportunity for arbitrage by pick ing and choos ing intercarrier compensation regimes depending on the type of traffic being exchanged,the very concern that led the fcc to adopt the mirroring rule and apply it to ilecs.see wl,at.this potential loophole,created only if the new markets rule applies absent a mirroring offer,led both the cpuc and the district court to hold that the fcc must have meant to apply the entire interim compensation regime for traffic solely to ilec clec relationships.
although the isp remand order could be clearer,we are convinced that the cpuc and the district court erred in holding that it does not apply to traffic exchanged between two clecs.at base,the rules implemented by the isp remand order addressed a particular problem the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage created by application of the prevailing reciprocal compensation scheme to local traffic.as discussed,traffic is uniquely unidirectional,and for that reason,incompatible with a compensation regime that assumes relative traffic parity.the defining feature of the problem the fcc sought to remedy is thus the type of traffic being exchanged traffic.it is true that,at the time the isp remand order was issued,the arbitrage problem was manifesting in a particular lec to lec relationship new clecs,free to pick and choose particular types of customers that would generate lots of unidirectional traffic isps,were taking advantage of the reciprocal compensation regime at the expense of ilecs,who,prior to the passage of the act and the entry of clecs,served all customers within a particular area,and therefore maintained those customers unless and until they were lured away by clecs.see isp remand order,at.but the dominance of that clec ilec arrangement was,as this case demonstrates,both transient and in no way essential to the market distortions the fcc was trying to remedy.
both the declaratory ruling and the isp remand order reflect that the fcc was well aware that the market distortion problem was not limited to ilec clec arrangements,and so addressed the problem of traffic generally,regardless of the precise type of lec to lec relationship in which it was manifested.the declaratory ruling,which first held that traffic was jurisdictionally interstate,but chose not to impose a federal rule regarding how that traffic ought to be compensated,described the question that had arisen as whether a local exchange carrier lec is entitled to receive reciprocal compensation for traffic that it delivers to an information service provider,particularly an internet service provider isp.at.the fcc noted this question sometimes has been posed more narrowly,whether an incumbent lec must pay reciprocal compensation to a competitive lec clec that delivers incumbent traffic to isps,but stated that b ecause the pertinent provision of the tca pertains to all lecs,we examine this issue in the broader context.id.at citing b.
similarly,in the isp remand order,the fcc presented the question it was answering as whether reciprocal compensation obligations apply to the delivery of calls from one lec customer to an isp in the same local calling area that is served by a competing lec.at.as with carrier,local exchange carrier is a term that encompasses both clecs and ilecs.see note,supra.in concluding that traffic was not subject to b reciprocal compensation requirement,moreover,the isp remand order repeatedly indicates that it is the nature of the traffic,not the particular intercarrier relationship,that prompted the fcc to institute the interim rules see,at the commission has struggled with how to treat internet traffic for regulatory purposes.id.at the issue of intercarrier compensation for traffic with which we are presently wrestling is a manifestation of this growing challenge.id.at traffic is not subject to the reciprocal compensation requirement in section b.id.at congress intended to exempt certain enumerated categories of service from section b when the service was provided to interexchange carriers or information service providers.the exemption focuses not only on the nature of the service,but on to whom the service is provided.id.at congress intended to exclude the traffic listed in subsection g from the reciprocal compensation requirements of subsection b.id.w e conclude that traffic is not subject to the reciprocal compensation provisions of section b.id.at congress excluded all such access traffic from the purview of section b.id.at we conclude that this definition of information access in g was meant to include all access traffic that was routed by a lec to or from providers of information services,of which isps are a subset.id.at having found that traffic is excluded from section b by section g,we find that the commission has the authority pursuant to section to establish rules governing intercarrier compensation for such traffic.see also isp mandate order,at w e conclude that we have authority to impose traffic rules.
although not presented with the precise issue before us,other courts have similarly described the isp remand order as applying to traffic exchanged between two lecs,not distinguishing traffic originating with ilecs or terminating with clecs.see peevey,at in the isp remand order,the fcc held that g carves out a category of telecommunications traffic not subject to the reciprocal compensation requirement of b,and that traffic is within this category.this was done to eliminate the regulatory arbitrage opportunity available to clecs.citations omitted core commc ns,at at least as early as the fcc was concerned that the regulatory procedures under which the sending lec compensated the recipient lec were leading to the imposition of excessive rates,and that these rates in turn were distorting the markets for internet and telephone services.in re core commc ns,at the commission adopted rate caps,which established a gradually declining maximum rate that a carrier typically,a clec could charge another carrier typically,an ilec for delivering a call to an isp.although the rate caps limited how much carriers could recover from other carriers,the carriers remained free to recover a ny additional costs from endusers,that is,from their own customers.quoting the isp remand order,at emphases added,some citations omitted,alterations in original global naps ii,at the ultimate conclusion of the isp remand order was that traffic within a single calling area is not subject to reciprocal compensation.worldcom,at explaining that,in the isp remand order,the fcc held that under g of the tca it was authorized to carve out from b calls made to isps located within the caller local calling area.
in sum,in adopting an interim compensation regime for traffic,the fcc was primarily concerned with arbitrage opportunities created by traffic of a particular nature we therefore measure the scope of the fcc intent with regard to the reach of the isp remand order on the same basis.it is true that the fcc was also concerned with how its new rules would play out in a regulatory environment in which ilecs dominated the marketplace.for that reason,the fcc adopted the mirroring rule,ensuring that the ilecs would not unduly benefit from their dominant market position.but this concern for new arbitrage opportunities that ilecs were uniquely positioned to exploit was a corollary to the fcc overriding concern for the arbitrage opportunities created by isp traffic generally.and as this case demonstrates,arbitrage related to traffic in no way depends on the participation of an ilec.the isp remand order reflects this reality,imposing its rules on all lecs,with the exception of the mirroring rule,which the fcc singled out as applicable only to ilecs.
the only verbiage in the various fcc orders concerning traffic that supports appellees view is one paragraph of the core order discussing the new markets rule,which states 
t he commission concluded that different interim intercarrier compensation rules should apply if two carriers were not exchanging traffic pursuant to an interconnection agreement prior to the adoption of the isp remand order.in this situation,if an incumbent lec has opted into the federal rate caps for traffic,the two carriers must exchange this traffic on a basis during the interim period the new markets rule.this rule applies,for example,when a new carrier enters a market or an existing carrier expands into a market it previously had not served.the commission implemented this rule in order to confine the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage to the maximum extent while seeking an appropriate resolution for the problems associated with the existing intercarrier compensation regime.
core order,at emphasis added.the district court reasoned that this paragraph indicates that the fcc did not intend the new markets rule to apply broadly to any carriers that were not exchanging traffic pursuant to an interconnection agreement.rather,it intended the new markets rule to apply when a clec requested interconnection from an ilec,after the effective date of the isp remand order.wl,at.
the district court misread of the core order by construing it without attending to its context.coming,as it does,just after a discussion of the mirroring rule,which applies only to ilecs,see at,it is almost surely not intended as an exhaustive treatment of the new markets rule.instead,the paragraph explains how the rule would apply to an ilec that has opted into the federal rate caps for traffic.id.at.given the fcc concern for ilec arbitrage opportunities created by the new rules,is best understood as a reiteration that an ilec can not simultaneously benefit from the new markets rule when a new clec enters a market,and ignore the rate caps in its dealings with other clecs with whom the ilec had previously been exchanging traffic.id.at nor does petitioner address the commission concern that,without the mirroring rule,incumbent lecs would too easily be able to take advantage of the discrepancy between reduced rates for traffic and higher rates for section b voice traffic.the mirroring rule was adopted to preclude incumbent lecs from paying reduced intercarrier compensation rates for traffic,which they send to c
