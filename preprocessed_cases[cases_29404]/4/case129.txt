this appeal from a grant of summary judgment requires us to examine concepts underlying antitrust law.foremost among them is the notion that competition fosters consumer welfare.since competition,which is the very essence of business,results in lower prices for consumers,it is a positive aspect of the marketplace.thus,what the antitrust laws are designed to protect is competitive conduct,not individual competitors.this concept is the framework upon which we decide this appeal.
plaintiff virgin atlantic airways limited virgin brings antitrust causes of action under and of the sherman act,against defendant british airways plc british airways.it alleges that defendant,while marketing its global network of airline services,engaged in predatory business practices,pointing specifically to british airways use of incentive agreements with corporate clients and travel agencies.virgin theorizes that these agreements offered pricing and thus attracted passengers to british airways transatlantic flights.losses from pricing tickets below cost,virgin continues,were recouped by coupling these flights with other routes on which british airways exercised monopoly power and could charge higher fares.the net effect,according to virgin,was to impede virgin efforts to expand service from london heathrow airport to five markets in the united states new york john kennedy airport los angeles chicago san francisco and washington,virgin further claims british airways offset its losses from the incentive agreements by charging higher fares on these five transatlantic routes,until virgin emerged as a competitor.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york cedarbaum,granted summary judgment to british airways finding that virgin claims lacked factual support.see virgin atl.airways british airways plc,d.on appeal,virgin contends the district court misunderstood the economic analysis of its key expert witness and failed to apply the correct legal standards.
after reviewing the voluminous exhibits filed under seal in this case,as well as virgin letter of july,filed pursuant to rule j of the federal rules of appellate procedure,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment,not only agreeing that virgin submitted insufficient proof to permit a factfinder to render a verdict in its favor,but also concluding that virgin failed to show how british airways competition harmed consumers.
background 
history of virgin and british airways and the desirability of heathrow flights 
the british government founded british airways as a airline in,a status it maintained until its privatization in.british airways is now incorporated under english law.virgin is also incorporated under english law,but is a newer company,having been founded by its present chairman richard branson in.when it began operations,virgin offered only a single daily flight between london gatwick airport gatwick and newark airport in new jersey.the united kingdom traffic distribution rules then in effect limited virgin to operating flights out of gatwick,because only carriers operating out of heathrow as of the rules effective date could continue to do so.british airways was one such carrier.the restrictions were imposed because heathrow was congested and the british government wished to promote the development of other london airports,such as gatwick.
heathrow is considered superior to gatwick because it has two runways and a large terminal,while gatwick has one runway and more limited gate facilities.heathrow is also located near a number of major corporate offices that generate demand for international travel,while fewer corporate offices surround gatwick and local ground transportation is less developed.further,since heathrow is perceived as the premier airport in europe,it is preferred by national flag carriers of other countries,resulting in more connecting traffic to the benefit of local hub carriers.gatwick,on the other hand,serves a large proportion of charter flights,which provide fewer connecting passengers.
by,seven years after its founding,virgin had added five new routes out of gatwick.since virgin wanted to operate from heathrow,it lobbied for access and ultimately the traffic distribution rules were abolished,freeing up a limited number of slots at heathrow.virgin promptly transferred three routes from gatwick new york jfk tokyo and los angeles.in making this change,it gave up peak operating times at gatwick for less attractive times at heathrow.even though it has gained access to the desired airport,richard branson acknowledges virgin can never replicate british airways network due to heathrow limited space and the method used for assigning slots.
allocation of slots at heathrow 
significant aspects of this appeal are tied to the assignment of slots,so we take a moment to describe the allocation process.a slot is a time period allotted to an airline at a particular airport for taking off or landing.an airline requires both a departure and an arrival slot to operate a single flight.in an independent coordinator was hired to administer the slot allocation process at heathrow.every six months airlines desiring slots must submit an application to the coordinator.the application is used to designate new slots desired,and to identify which old slots should be retained and which should be relinquished for reallocation.
any airline that has operated a slot at least percent of the time in the prior six months has a grandfathered right to reclaim it for the upcoming six months.if not operated sufficiently often,the airline loses its right to the slot.more than percent of the slots at heathrow are allocated based upon the exercise of grandfathered rights.the remaining slots are known as pool slots and generally consist of commercially undesirable early in the morning or late at inconsistent times that make it difficult to sustain a regular frequency,flight.most of these slots go unclaimed even though priority over pool slots is given to new entrants to the airport.
once a slot is allocated,an airline may use the slot for any destination,operate it for any commercial purpose,lease it to other carriers,share it with partners,or swap it for another slot held by a different carrier.an airline may also engage in secondary trading,that is,it may swap a desirable slot for another airline undesirable slot plus monetary compensation.given the capacity restraints at heathrow,such trading is rare.the airport declared in that,because it has almost no room to expand,the number of available slots would grow,if at all,by only three percent over the next several years.
presence of virgin and british airways at heathrow 
at the close of discovery in july,british airways held the largest number of heathrow slots for the operating amounting to percent of those available and totaling nearly three times as many slots as the holder,british midland,with.british airways operated monopoly routes out of heathrow,duopoly routes,competed with two other airlines on routes,and competed with three or more airlines on its remaining routes.although british airways added flights to its schedule between and,it maintained a relatively constant percent share of total heathrow departures in the ten years between july and.about percent of heathrow passengers fly british airways.meanwhile,passenger operations at heathrow increased overall by percent.the number of passengers between united states and united kingdom airports grew from to.
british airways considers its united states united kingdom routes the most profitable and views virgin as a seeking to take business from those routes.richard branson has in fact said that virgin atlantic flies only on intensely competitive routes.by july virgin held slots at two percent of those which it operated six transatlantic routes,while it flew another three transatlantic routes from gatwick.
virgin is economically successful.in the new york market it carried more passengers flight for flight in than its competitors,including british airways.it is the third largest carrier across the atlantic,and reputedly largely because of its entry into the market,the market share of united kingdom carriers in united kingdom united states traffic grew from percent in to percent in.
british airways incentive agreements 
part of the way in which british airways competes in the airline industry is through the use of incentive agreements entered into with travel agencies and corporate customers.such practice is allegedly common,with at least three different united carriers purportedly using similar incentives.as british airways describes its own agreements,commissions or discounts are awarded when specified thresholds of sales are reached,but the agreements contain no set mandatory minimum.as a general rule,the incentive agreements are based exclusively on measures such as sectors flown or revenue earned.in some agreements,travel anywhere on british airways will count toward the thresholds,while in other agreements certain routes are specified.provisions allow the discount or rebate to apply retroactively to all sales under the agreement once a performance target is met.
graphs prepared by british airways show that in corporate deals accounted for percent of united kingdom bookings on routes between the united kingdom and the united states.no figures are provided for corporate deals involving united states sales.travel agencies that booked percent or more of their bookings between the united states and the united kingdom on british airways accounted for percent of tickets sold in the united states and percent of tickets sold in the united kingdom.
with respect to the individual routes for which virgin claims it was delayed entry,british airways corporate deals accounted for the following percentages of united kingdom bookings in between heathrow and new york between london and los angeles between london and chicago between london and san francisco and between london and washington,for united kingdom sales through travel agencies in the same time frame,those agencies that booked percent or more on a particular route through british airways accounted for the following percentages between heathrow and new york between london and los angeles between london and chicago between london and san francisco and between london and washington,
for united states sales,travel agencies that booked percent or more of their bookings through british airways accounted for the following percentages of bookings from london to new york to los angeles to chicago to san francisco and to washington,
proceedings 
virgin filed the instant complaint alleging antitrust causes of action on october,in the southern district of new york.a motion to dismiss by british airways was granted in part and denied in part on january.discovery on virgin remaining claims under and of the sherman act was completed in july,after which british airways moved for summary judgment.
british airways argued that insufficient evidence existed to show predatory or anticompetitive conduct.virgin responded by submitting extensive exhibits and affidavits,with the heart of its argument set forth in the november,affidavit of douglas bernheim,which we analyze in our discussion.bernheim explains virgin theory of predatory foreclosure and the bundling of ticket sales,and predicts that had british airways not engaged in these practices,virgin would have initiated service to san francisco in instead of,initiated service to washington,in instead of,initiated service to chicago in,added a second flight to los angeles in,and added a third flight to new york jfk in.
the district court granted summary judgment to british airways principally on the ground that virgin failed to support its expert theories of anticompetitive practices with factual evidence pertaining to the five routes for which virgin claims injury.see virgin atl.airways,d at.virgin filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
i standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate only if british airways can show the absence of genuine issues of material fact and its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.no special burden is imposed on a plaintiff opposing summary judgment in an antitrust case,eastman kodak image technical,d,and virgin as plaintiff can defeat the motion by coming forward with specific facts to show a genuine issue exists requiring a trial,matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the trial court should not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of any matter,anderson liberty lobby,d,but should instead draw all inferences from the facts in the light most favorable to virgin,matsushita,at.
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.capital imaging,mohawk valley med,cir.although such relief may be difficult to obtain due to the factual complexities of antitrust cases,the motion can serve as a tool by which to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims.celotex,at.wasteful trials and prolonged litigation that may have a chilling effect on procompetitive market forces should be avoided.tops,quality,cir.
ii restraint of trade claim under of sherman act 
turning now to the merits,virgin alleges that british airways incentive agreements constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of of the sherman act.that provision makes illegal e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations.to establish a claim virgin must show a combination or some form of concerted action between at least two legally distinct economic entities and such combination or conduct constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade either per se or under the rule of reason.tops,at.
the district court disposed of virgin claim on the second prong.see virgin atl.airways,d at.before discussing the second prong,we address for a moment whether virgin can satisfy the first prong by showing concerted action.see mcnally wellman state gas,cir we need not affirm for the reasons expressed by the district court but may affirm on any ground supported by the record.
concerted action 
independent actions taken by an entity fall outside the purview of.see monsanto serv,d explaining that in the context of of the sherman act,i ndependent action is not proscribed capital imaging,at unilateral conduct on the part of a single person or enterprise falls outside the purview of this provision in the antitrust law.accordingly,to prevail on its claim,virgin must produce direct or circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove that british airways and other parties to the incentive agreements were consciously committed to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.monsanto,at.see also id.at.capital imaging,at the plaintiff evidence must prove the actors had an intent to adhere to an agreement that was designed to achieve an unlawful objective.
virgin acknowledges in its appellate brief that t his case turns on british airways unilateral conduct,not on any alleged conspiracy.this admission is supported by the fact that there is no allegation that british airways incentive arrangement partners agreed to do anything in exchange for the benefits british airways awarded to ticket buyers.for example,no mandatory minimum purchases are required under british airways incentive arrangements,and purchasers are free to choose whatever flight package best suits them or to purchase tickets on competing airlines.in the absence of anything other than unilateral conduct on the part of british airways,virgin claim must fail.
unreasonable restraint of trade 
even if virgin could establish concerted action,it still must show the contracts unreasonably restrained trade either per se or under the rule of reason.see capital imaging,at.as virgin has conceded throughout this litigation,see virgin atl.airways,d at,the agreements challenged here do not fall within one of the classes of agreements that the supreme court has declared illegal,per se.accordingly,our analysis proceeds under the rule of reason.
under the rule of reason,virgin is first required to show the incentive agreements had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market.id.at accord tops,at.the fact that the defendant actions prevent a plaintiff from competing in a market is not enough,standing alone,to satisfy this initial burden of proof.see tops,at.if virgin surmounts its first hurdle,the burden shifts to british airways to establish the procompetitive value of its incentive agreements.clorox sterling winthrop,cir.if defendant carries that burden,the burden of proof then shifts back to virgin to show the same procompetitive effect could be achieved through alternative means that are less restrictive of competition.id.in other words,virgin can recover only if it were ultimately to show that british airways actions had a effect,harming consumers.atl.richfield usa petroleum,d.
actual adverse effect.the district court dismissed virgin cause of action for failure to show that british airways incentive agreements had an actual adverse effect on the relevant market.see virgin atl.airways,d at.in making this ruling,the trial court relied on its analysis of virgin claims,under which it concluded that virgin had not furnished a factual basis to support its theories of anticompetitive conduct.see id.at.
regardless of whether a analysis may be neatly imported into a relevant analysis,our precedents suggest that whether an actual adverse effect has occurred is determined by examining factors like reduced output,increased prices and decreased quality.see tops,at capital imaging,at.with respect to price,virgin does not submit any data comparing the cost of a british airways ticket on any of the five routes in question before and after virgin entry or expansion in these markets.although bernheim,virgin expert economist,calculated that fares are approximately lower,on average,when virgin is present on a route,virgin does not provide the hard data upon which he relied.
moreover,the charts and graphs the expert attached as exhibits incorporate data only through the years when virgin added its flight to chicago,its second flight to los angeles and its third flight to new york jfk.although bernheim affidavit purports to be useful in interpreting market facts affecting this litigation,expert testimony rooted in hypothetical assumptions can not substitute for actual market data.see brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d.
with respect to whether consumers experienced a decrease in quality due to virgin delayed entry,bernheim cites richard branson affidavit and other uncontested documentary evidence showing virgin offered higher quality services than british airways.virgin met its burden on this point,as the evidence suggests that consumers had fewer services available until virgin entered or expanded flights in the five markets.regarding output,bernheim calculated that when virgin competes on a new route,passenger traffic on that route increases at a greater rate than average passenger growth on other routes where virgin is not present.
virgin also could meet its initial burden of showing adverse impact on competition in the relevant market by demonstrating that british airways had sufficient market power to cause an adverse effect on competition.tops,at.market power is defined as the ability of a single seller to raise price s and restrict output.eastman kodak,at.rather than determine whether virgin could establish that british airways possessed market power when it entered into the incentive analysis complicated by the particular facts surrounding the allocation of slots at this question because the claim must be dismissed for virgin failure to meet its ultimate burden of proof,that is,harm to consumers from british airways agreements.
procompetitive justification.the efficiency argument in favor of incentive agreements like those used by british airways is obvious,yet quite important.bernheim acknowledged that the use of corporate deals and travel agent commission overrides can be a natural and desirable consequence of competition among airlines for corporate and travel agent business.these kinds of agreements allow firms to reward their most loyal customers.rewarding customer loyalty promotes competition on the merits.since the incentive agreements serve a procompetitive purpose,virgin must show the same purpose could be achieved without restricting competition.
alternative means.we find nothing in the record in which virgin suggests an alternative program that would achieve the same procompetitive effect as the incentive agreements.since the ultimate goal of our analysis is to determine whether restrictions in an agreement among competitors have a potential to harm consumers,clorox,at,virgin failure to address this point leaves intact the evidence that british airways incentive agreements are good for competition.
while virgin believes it was disadvantaged by such agreements,injury to a competitor can not be said to be the sine qua non of a violation.the sherman act and other antitrust laws are designed to protect competition,not individual competitors.atl.richfield,at.accordingly,virgin cause of action under of the sherman act was properly dismissed.
iii attempted monopolization claim under of sherman act 
we next address the claim of attempted monopolization under of the sherman act.section makes it a crime to monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,or combine or conspire with any other person or persons,to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations.virgin charges british airways with engaging in predatory foreclosure and the bundling of ticket sales in an attempt to foreclose transatlantic competition by diverting passengers from virgin and other airlines to itself.virgin atl.airways,d at.virgin arguments to support this theory of attempted monopolization are set out in detail in bernheim page affidavit.we include his views,where pertinent,in the discussion that follows.
to prove that british airways practices constituted an attempted monopolization,virgin must establish that british airways has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.spectrum sports,mcquillan,d.the relevant markets for virgin claims are the five cities,serviced from london heathrow,which are the subject of this litigation new york,chicago,los angeles,san francisco and washington.
bernheim defines his attempted monopolization theory of predatory foreclosure as pricing a good or service below cost with the object of deterring delaying the entry or expansion of a competitor.losses on sales priced below cost are,under bernheim theory,immediately recouped by setting prices substantially above costs on other sales.his theory of predatory foreclosure is derived from the theory of predatory pricing.predatory pricing is a means by which a single firm,having a dominant share of the relevant market,cuts its prices in order to force competitors out of the market,or perhaps to deter potential entrants from coming in.matsushita,at.the purpose is to gain and exercise control over prices in the relevant market.brooke group,at.
to succeed on a predatory pricing claim,a plaintiff must prove two elements that the prices complained of are below an appropriate measure of its rival costs,and that the predatory rival has a dangerous probability of recouping its investment through a below cost pricing scheme,id.at.to show how market foreclosure through predation works,bernheim uses hypothetical examples based on assumptions said to reflect actual conditions involving british airways and travel.
below cost pricing 
virgin expert alleges that british airways has monopoly power over routes originating at heathrow because of the large number of slots it owns and the limitation on total supply brought about by space constraints.his theory of predatory foreclosure derives from british airways monopoly control over the limited slots.we summarize in a moment how his theory applies in this case.but,we must note first that even with monopoly power,a business entity is not guilty of predatory conduct through excluding its competitors from the market when it is simply exploiting competitive advantages legitimately available to it.advanced,radford cmty,cir.moreover,the supreme court has expressed deep skepticism regarding the viability of proving a predatory pricing scheme.see matsushita,at.p redatory pricing schemes are rarely tried,and even more rarely successful.accord brooke group,at.success under such a scheme is rare because a predatory competitor must not only sustain losses to drive out competition,but also maintain monopoly power long enough to recoup those losses and derive additional gain.matsushita,at.
costs of added flights.passing to bernheim theory,he concludes that british airways induced corporate customers and travel agents to shift in its favor as much airline traffic as possible,and that its incentive schemes became noncompensatory on the margin.that is to say,bernheim believes that the incentive agreements resulted in incremental,those who would not have traveled on british airways but for the charged below cost.bernheim calculated british airways cost by positing that the airline offered additional frequencies and thereby incurred additional costs to carry the customers it attracted through the incentive agreements.he relied on a june paper prepared by the antitrust division of the department of justice antitrust division,which instructed that individual flights or groupings of flights on a are the relevant increments for calculating costs,more costs are incremental the longer a strategy is in place and aircraft costs are incremental within a relatively short to medium time frame.
bernheim reasons that since british airways incentive agreements are meant to be deterrents to competition,nearly all of the airline costs of flying an additional frequency should be counted as relevant incremental costs,defined as the cost of incremental incentive payments plus the variable costs incurred in adding an additional frequency.to determine whether british airways additional frequencies are noncompensatory on the margin,bernheim measured the ratio of the incremental incentive payments to incremental revenue,as well as the ratio of the other variable costs to incremental revenue.if the sum of those ratios exceeded one,the competitive frequency was deemed noncompensatory.
based on information retrieved from a british airways database,he estimated that the incremental cost of adding a frequency from london to the united states is approximately percent of incremental revenue,without accounting for incremental incentive payments to travel agents and corporate clients.he then calculated the ratio of incremental incentive payments to incremental revenue for each of british airways incentive agreements with corporations and travel agencies.using two methods of calculation,he found the incremental incentive payments quite large,usually greater than percent.because the incremental cost is percent of incremental revenue,bernheim concluded that the incremental frequencies added to accommodate passengers gained through incentive agreements were noncompensatory on the margin.
the expert reasoned from this conclusion that competition was foreclosed because another airline could attract customers away from british airways incentive agreements only by offering flights below both its own and british airways costs.with regard to the deterrent effect of british airways practices upon virgin specifically,bernheim explains that an airline will not add a flight to its schedule unless it can maintain a load factor,the percentage of occupied seats,of between percent.with british airways incentive agreements diverting passengers who would otherwise be available to the competition,another airline needs more time to attract sufficient customers to make a new route economically feasible.hence,bernheim concludes that but for these agreements,virgin would have earlier expanded service to new york and los angeles and initiated service to chicago,san francisco and washington,
virgin has failed to prove underpricing due to the incentive agreements.considering that bernheim relied on the june paper prepared by the antitrust division in formulating his theory,we find it important to note that the paper also explained that the antitrust division determines whether an airline is pricing tickets below cost by identify ing and measur ing only those costs that the incumbent airline could have avoided had it not embarked on the strategy under scrutiny.emphasis added.british airways submitted an affidavit from robert pindyck,also an expert economist,who notes that because bernheim compared incremental costs only against incremental revenue from incentivized passengers,his results necessarily relied on the assumption that only incentivized passengers were ultimately funding additional frequencies.the district court,with which we agree on this point,criticized bernheim for making that assumption.see virgin atl.airways,d at.
virgin attempts to substantiate its theory of underpricing using the following evidence british airways over time has maintained a constant average load factor of about percent and two british airways executives testified at depositions that the use of incentive agreements enabled the airline to offer more flight services.regarding the load factor,virgin argues that because that factor has remained constant even as british airways flew more passengers,british airways necessarily must have added flights to accommodate incentivized passengers.we know that the airline added flights to its schedule between and.the question is whether these flights would have been added absent the incentive agreements.if they would have been,then bernheim incorrectly charges their entire cost against incremental revenue.
according to charts submitted by british airways,in total just over five percent of its bookings on united states united kingdom routes derive from corporate deals and travel agencies that book percent or more of their flights on british airways.these figures are roughly consistent with bernheim estimate that between three and percent of passengers on united states united kingdom routes are incremental.considering these relatively small percentages,along with the fact that since the number of passengers flown between the united states and the united kingdom has increased by more than five million people,virgin has not shown that the additional flights to british airways schedule were entirely attributable to the use of incentive agreements.without such a showing,a factfinder can only speculate whether the costs of those additional flights were incurred solely because of the agreements.see brooke group,at.when an expert opinion is not supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law,or when indisputable record facts contradict or otherwise render the opinion unreasonable,it can not support a jury verdict.
the deposition testimony of british airways chief executive,which provides that without incentive agreements the number of flights the airline operates would go down,is not a sufficient substitute for market data to support a finding that british airways added flights on its new york,los angeles,chicago,san francisco or washington,routes because of incentivized passengers.the same is true of the testimony given by british airways director of passenger and cargo business,who stated broadly that selling the network offers the potential to mount more services.without more,a factfinder can not make a reasoned determination whether virgin was delayed in entering or expanding services in the five subject markets because of alleged below cost pricing.
virgin contends it has no obligation to produce particularized market data so long as it can show sufficient profits were diverted from the five routes to prevent its entry or expansion.but virgin fails to prove even that much.bernheim determined that if virgin had received its share of profits that were otherwise diverted by british airways incentive agreements,it would have added flights to each of the five markets at issue.the share of diverted revenues however,is calculated based on assumptions involving all of british airways united kingdom routes.
finally,nothing in the record suggests british airways stopped using or restructured its incentive agreements following virgin entry or expansion.since virgin
