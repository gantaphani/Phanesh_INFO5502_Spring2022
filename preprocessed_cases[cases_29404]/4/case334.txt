this case was brought by frustrated depositors of superior bank fsb superior in an effort to recoup some of the money they lost when the bank failed.a class of plaintiffs,represented by john courtney,frances lax,lawrence green,and irene kortas,charged that the defendant bank owners,officers,directors,and accountants violated the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act,ilcs et.cfa and the illinois public accounting act,ilcs et,through the actions they took while superior was going under.the district court dismissed the rico claims for lack of standing,and it dismissed without prejudice the supplemental state claims.it also initially dismissed a request for an injunction as unripe,but on reconsideration it denied the motion,finding that the requested relief would violate the prohibition in the banking laws on judicial interference with actions of the federal deposit insurance corporation.see j.although the plaintiffs urge us to revive some or all of this litigation,we conclude that the district court resolved matters correctly,and we therefore affirm.
during the latter part of the,more than a thousand savings and loan associations in the united states failed.see savings and loan crisis,visited april,fed.deposit ins,the s l crisis a,l fdic chronology visited april.the rate of failure was so great that the general accounting office gao declared the federal savings loan insurance corporation fslic fund insolvent by at least billion in january.see fdic chronology.during this crisis,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic had organized a program that permitted the consolidation of several failing or failed thrift organizations into one larger entity,which the fdic hoped would enjoy greater economies of scale and which would be eligible for significant government assistance.see lasalle talman bank,united states.it dubbed this the phoenix program.see id.at.
one of the institutions that failed was the lyons illinois savings bank,which went under in december.taking advantage of the phoenix program,a group of investors including penny pritzker,thomas pritzker,and alvin dworman,through a holding company called financial corporation ccfc,acquired lyons at the end of.the group paid million of its own money,and it received assistance from the fslic,which contributed a package of cash,tax credits,and loan guarantees worth million.the pritzkers together and dworman each owned of ccfc ccfc in turn created a company called superior holdings,which was the nominal owner of the successor bank,superior bank fsb.as the district judge did,we refer to the owners as the ccfc defendants or group.the term bank defendants refers to the officers and directors of superior.
after the,superior began accumulating assets associated with retained interests in mortgage securitizations.essentially,superior would make a loan to an auto or home buyer with a poor credit history it then pooled groups of these loans and sold the portfolios to investors.superior then collected the income due from the underlying loans,and paid a fixed rate of return to the investors.this was capable of being a winning strategy as long as superior correctly estimated the rate of default or prepayment of the underlying loans,and as long as it was not obligated to pay too high a fixed rate to its investors.
the plaintiffs were depositors of superior.they claim that the ccfc group plundered superior assets by withdrawing excessive amounts of money from the bank and by engaging in transactions with it.for example,they charge that the ccfc principals took out large loans from superior that they had no intention of repaying,and that they drained superior assets by directing superior to pay ccfc million in dividends over the period from to.eventually,superior was not able to withstand the alleged financial hemorrhage and it was forced to declare insolvency.this is the second time that this court has been asked to consider aspects of that collapse.see fdic ernst young llp,cir.
according to plaintiffs,the ccfc group initially was able to conceal its misfeasance in several ways.first,its auditors,the accounting firm of ernst young,allegedly cooperated in the cooking of superior books so that they reflected vastly inflated values for the bank assets.based on ernst young purported conclusions,the ccfc group and the bank defendants made statements to depositors designed to assure them that superior was financially sound.plaintiffs also allege that the bank defendants misrepresented the availability of fdic insurance to existing and potential depositors.they charge that the bank defendants told them that if they opened up multiple accounts in different names,then each account would be insured up to the maximum permitted by the fdic.this was inaccurate,but,in reliance on this advice,the plaintiffs say that they were duped into depositing far more than the maximum that could be insured,just when superior was about to fold.
by,superior alleged mismanagement could no longer be ignored.the office of thrift supervision ots and the fdic began to investigate,and they determined that several of superior audited financial statements significantly overstated the value of its assets.in january,ernst young conceded that its accounting treatment of superior retained interests was incorrect,and it agreed to its conclusions.that led to a writedown of superior retained interests first by million,and later by another million.insolvency followed soon thereafter on july,the ots appointed an fdic receiver for superior.the receiver transferred all insured deposits that is,accounts that had up to in them to a new entity,superior federal,and it retained million of uninsured deposits.as of the time the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit,superior was still unable to refund those uninsured deposits.
the fdic eventually settled superior claims against ccfc principals for million,of which million was to be paid immediately and the remaining million was to be paid over a period.those monies are to be distributed in accordance with the federal statutory priority scheme,under which the plaintiff depositors will recover some,but not all,of their investments.see d a.plaintiffs are dissatisfied with the results of the settlement.they go further,in fact,and claim that the settlement itself violates the statute.they object to a feature under which the fdic agreed with the ccfc group jointly to pursue the misrepresentation claims against ernst young.if,and to the extent that,the fdic prevailed in that suit,it agreed to assign the parties a percentage of its recovery.in the plaintiffs view,this arrangement was a thinly disguised way of circumventing the statutory priority scheme and allowing the ccfc group to get more than its proper share.
acting in its corporate capacity,the fdic filed a lawsuit against ernst young on november.the district court dismissed that action for lack of standing.this court affirmed on different grounds,finding that the fdic in its corporate capacity had no claim against the accountants.instead,we held,under the fdic in its capacity as receiver is the correct plaintiff to pursue any claim against superior bank accountants.fdic ernst young llp,at.no further actions the fdic may have taken in any capacity are relevant to the present case.
after an initial foray into state court,plaintiffs found themselves in federal court when the defendants removed the case.successive rounds of pleadings culminated in a fourth amended complaint,in which the plaintiffs asserted the following legal theories against the various defendants 
count i violations of the illinois consumer fraud act by the ccfc group,the bank defendants,and ernst young 
count ii violations of rico,c,against ccfc and ernst young 
count iii violation of the illinois public accounting act,against ernst young 
count iv aiding and abetting a violation of rico,against ernst young 
count v action for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment,against the pritzkers,dworman,and the fdic,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief designed to enforce the plaintiff depositors priority under d a over any assets recovered on behalf of superior.
the district court dismissed the two rico counts ii and iv with prejudice,finding that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue it initially rejected count v as unripe,but later denied the requested declaratory and injunctive relief as precluded by j and it dismissed the supplemental state claims in counts i and iii without prejudice.after plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the denial of injunctive relief,this court briefly stayed the distribution of the ernst young settlement proceeds to the shareholders of ccfc,but we dissolved the stay a week later.the district court entered its final judgment on july,and this appeal followed.
we begin with a discussion of count v of the complaint,because that is the one that the plaintiffs have emphasized before this court.they claim,in brief,that the fdic agreement about the disposition of potential proceeds from its suit against ernst young violates the mandatory distribution priorities established by the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act firrea,stat,the pertinent part of which is codified at d.they argue that a private party is entitled to an injunction against the fdic when the agency fails properly to implement the distribution priorities of d,notwithstanding the provision of firrea,j.finally,they argue that any amounts realized by the fdic in its capacity as superior receiver are necessarily subject to the distribution priorities of d.they offer three arguments in support of their position first,that the firrea priority scheme is functionally identical to priorities under the bankruptcy code,and thus bankruptcy cases requiring strict adherence to priorities dictate the outcome here as well second,that the fdic authority as conservator or receiver to transfer assets without obtaining any special approval or consent under d g is qualified by the priority scheme of d and third,that funds recovered through litigation or settlement should be treated as amounts realized by other resolution under d a.the fdic,the pritzkers,and dworman parry with several arguments there is no private right of action to enforce d section j squarely precludes granting declaratory,injunctive,or other equitable relief where such relief would interfere with the receiver management of the estate and there is no violation of the d priorities in any event.
we begin our evaluation of these claims with a look at the pertinent statutory language.four parts of are implicated,the key parts of which we set forth here for ease of reference 
d g.merger transfer of assets and liabilities 
i in general 
the corporation may,as conservator or receiver 
ii subject to clause ii,transfer any asset or liability of the institution in default including assets and liabilities associated with any trust business without any approval,assignment,or consent with respect to such transfer 
d.depositor preference 
a in general 
subject to section e c of this title relating to losses incurred by the fdic,amounts realized from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver appointed for such institution shall be distributed to pay claims other than secured claims to the extent of any such security in the following order of priority 
i administrative expenses of the receiver.
ii any deposit liability of the institution.
iii any other general or senior liability of the institution which is not a liability described in clause iv or v.
iv any obligation subordinated to depositors or general creditors which is not an obligation described in clause v.
v any obligation to shareholders or members arising as a result of their status as shareholders or members including any depository institution holding company or any shareholder or creditor of such company 
j.limitation on court action 
except as provided in this section,no court may take any action,except at the request of the board of directors by regulation or order,to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the corporation as a conservator or a receiver 
p.settlement of claims 
paragraphs prohibiting the sale of assets of a failed institution to certain persons and forbidding debtors convicted of certain crimes from buying assets shall not apply to the sale or transfer by the corporation of any asset of any insured depository institution to any person if the sale or transfer of the asset resolves or settles,or is part of the resolution or settlement,of 
a or more claims that have been,or could have been,asserted by the corporation against the person or 
b obligations owed by the person to any insured depository institution,the fslic resolution fund,the resolution trust corporation,or the corporation.
although the fdic and the ccfc defendants would like us to sweep this claim away by finding that there is no private right of action to enforce the priority scheme established by d,we prefer not to take that approach.we are not compelled to consider this issue,because it relates only to the question whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim,not to the question of the district court jurisdiction.the district court did not rule on it,and it is sufficiently complex,compare hindes fdic,cir no private right of action under d e,with first pac.bancorp,helfer,cir finding private right of action under d and acknowledging conflict with hindes,that it should not be handled as some kind of.furthermore,since we have concluded that plaintiffs claims were properly dismissed,this would at most be an alternative ground for decision.we therefore save the question whether any kind of private right of action exists under for another day.in addition,we express no opinion on the fdic alternative argument that plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies is fatal to their claims.see d d am.first,lake forest park,cir maher harris trust sav.bank,cir.recall that the district court had originally dismissed count v as unripe on reconsideration it relied exclusively on the bar against injunctive relief found in j,to which we are about to turn.we see no reason why we should be compelled to consider exhaustion before j,and thus we express no opinion on the plaintiffs arguments that they have done enough to exhaust and that exhaustion does not apply under these circumstances.
the glaring problem with the plaintiffs overall position on this part of the case lies in the language of j.that section prohibits a court from taking any action either to restrain or affect the fdic exercise of its powers as a receiver,unless authorization can be found elsewhere in the section.far from finding such an authorization,however,we see nothing but language that reinforces j.for example,p permits the fdic to sell or transfer assets as part of a settlement of claims that it could have asserted against someone.section d g i ii permits the fdic to transfer assets or liabilities without any further approvals.
other courts have recognized the breadth of j prohibition.the ninth circuit described the ban as an essential part of the fdic ability to function as a receiver.sahni am.diversified partners,cir.the circuit said that j effect s a sweeping ouster of courts power to grant equitable remedies to parties like the plaintiffs.freeman fdic.indeed,the court went on to make a point equally important to the case before us,in discussing whether the prohibition also reaches declaratory relief and other equitable relief 
not only does j bar injunctive relief,but in the circumstances of the present case where appellants seek a declaratory judgment that would effectively restrain the fdic from foreclosing on their property,j deprives the court of power to grant that remedy as well for the same reason,j also bars the court from granting the plaintiffs plea for rescission of the underlying transaction.
id.see also hotels,fdic,cir reaching the same conclusion.
the plaintiffs try to avoid this significant obstacle to their suit by arguing that j can not apply to actions of the fdic that are ultra vires.first,they claim that the fdic is rigidly bound to the priority structure set forth in d,just as a bankruptcy court is bound by th
