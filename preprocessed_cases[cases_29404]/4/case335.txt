background 
general drilling is a company that owns large drill rigs and drills blast holes for limestone quarries in indiana,kentucky,tennessee,and illinois.drilling blast holes is the first step in the process of mining limestone from a quarry.the following people hold positions at general drilling william boatman is president,david keil is a director,and catherine diehr is secretary,controller,and treasurer.chicago companies,such as raimonde drilling raimonde,ludwig explosives ludwig,callahan schoe,and lambert drilling also subcontract to drill blast holes.these four are known collectively as the chicago union drillers.a wisconsin driller,finn drill,also competes with general drilling and the chicago union drillers for drilling work.
local is a labor organization that represents employees in the material production industry in northwest indiana,northern illinois,and northeast iowa.the northern illinois material producers agreement nimpa is a association collective bargaining agreement between material producers and local.all of the chicago union drillers and finn drill are signatories to the nimpa.unlike its competitors,general drilling has not signed the nimpa.kevin troglio serves as the agent for local members employed by raimonde,ludwig,callihan schoe,and finn drill.he is authorized to represent any local member employed by a signatory contractor if that contractor performs work in his jurisdiction.
quarry owners in northwest indiana include vulcan materials vulcan,prairie materials prairie,northern indiana materials company northern indiana,and material service.material service has operated quarries in northwest indiana since approximately,when it purchased three quarries.the following people serve in positions for material service david olson is senior vice president of operations,michael bernardi is vice president for human resources and administration,scott jorns is manager of drilling and blasting,and rick mcelfresh is a superintendent.
material service does its own drilling at its quarries in northeast illinois,but not at its northwest indiana quarries.when material service originally purchased the indiana quarries,general drilling was doing the drill work.after the purchase,material service decided to continue using general drilling as the contract driller for the quarries because,under boatman leadership,general drilling had performed satisfactory work.material service is a signatory to the nimpa.material service also had a separate collective bargaining agreement with local,international union of laborers laborers for its employees who do drilling work.
in,troglio met with general drilling officials boatman,diehr,and keil to discuss the company drill work at quarries near manteno,illinois,owned by vulcan and prairie.troglio stated that he wanted general drilling to be union or be out of illinois.he also stated that general drilling was not paying the prevailing area wage.boatman disagreed.troglio also stated that he was under pressure from the chicago union drillers.shortly thereafter,general drilling decided to relinquish its drilling work in illinois.after general drilling left,ludwig took over the work at the manteno quarries.
on march,local sent a letter to general drilling claiming that general drilling was engaged in the construction industry and was paying wages below those established in the area by local.local also threatened pickets to advertise to the public the inadequate wages.after receiving the letter,general drilling officials met with troglio on two occasions in the spring of to discuss the company operations in northwest indiana.general drilling secretly recorded the two meetings.at the time,general drilling was drilling blast holes on a subcontract basis at quarries throughout indiana at quarries owned by vulcan,northern indiana,and material service.again,troglio voiced his concern that general drilling was not paying the area wage according to the nimpa and was not on the same playing field as those people within our jurisdiction.general drilling was reluctant to sign the nimpa because it would have,as diehr testified,hugely increased general drilling labor costs.boatman for his part argued that general drilling paid its employees more in wages and benefits than quarry employees who do drill work.again,there was talk of pressure from the chicago union drillers.
troglio faxed a copy of the march letter to material service,with the added note please review and any support would be appreciated.any questions please call.after receiving the letter,olson and bernardi decided to develop a plan in case it became necessary to terminate general drilling.olson instructed jorns to put a plan b together to solicit bids from alternate drillers.all involved material service officials testified that they developed the plan b because they wanted to avoid interference with material service production and sales.initially,jorns selected two drillers,ludwig and raimonde,as possible replacements and received bids from them.jorns approved ludwig,the lower bidder,as the replacement on june.material service officials testified that troglio was not involved in the development of plan b or in the selection of the alternate driller.
troglio met with material service employees twice,once in may or june and again in june or july of.at those meetings,he explained his intention to start organizing against general drilling and informed them of the possible picket.he also educated them of their rights to cross the picket line.on july,troglio received final authorization for the picket.
in august,mcelfresh suggested to boatman that he lease his equipment to a new driller so that the work could continue uninterrupted.after boatman told him that he would be contacted,finn drill president,pat garvin,called mcelfresh to schedule an appointment to view the facility.boatman had worked out a deal with finn drill whereby the same equipment and personnel could operate at the quarry under the finn drill name.garvin toured the quarry on august,and later that week came in with the lowest bid.finn drill bid at per foot,the same rate that material service had paid to general drilling.
on august,troglio sent a second letter to material service describing its labor dispute with general drilling and notifying it of a possible common situs picket.attached to this letter was a list of some chicago union drillers.both ludwig,jorns original alternate driller,and finn drill,the ultimate replacement,were on the list.troglio testified that he sent the list to quarry owners that requested information about possible union drillers.
on august,local picketed the babcock quarry in rennselaer while general drilling was working there.local displayed a notice mentioning general drilling substandard wages and benefits.that same day material service terminated general drilling and replaced it with finn drill.material service officials testified that,had it not been for these pickets,general drilling would still be drilling for the company.material service twice invited general drilling back to drill at its quarries,in the spring and fall of.general drilling continues to work in northwest indiana,at the vulcan and northern indiana quarries,and to solicit business in northwest indiana.
general drilling sued local,alleging that local conspired to restrain trade in violation of the sherman act and local engaged in unlawful picketing against general drilling and material service in violation of section of the labor management relations act lmra.defendants moved to dismiss and for summary judgment on all counts.the district court ruled in favor of defendants on january,and plaintiff appealed.
ii.discussion 
the district court considered defendants motions to dismiss and for summary judgment together,and did not clarify which motion it granted in defendants favor.where,however,
matters outside the pleadings were presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule,and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all materials made pertinent to such a motion by rule.

antitrust claim 
in its complaint,general drilling asserted that local violated section of the sherman act,because it entered into 
schemes,understandings or conspiracies with one or more of general drilling union competitors to suppress price competition by forcing general drilling customers to terminate,and cease hiring,general drilling so that one or more of the union drillers might get the business.material service was coerced into effectuating the conspiracy.

the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of local on the sherman act claims was based on the following findings general drilling could not establish antitrust standing general drilling fell short of demonstrating a per se unreasonable restraint of trade local was entitled to the protection of the statutory exemption to the antitrust laws and general drilling did not sufficiently establish that local entered into a conspiracy to achieve an unlawful purpose.we review the summary judgment ruling de novo to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact existed.to survive a defendant motion for summary judgment,a plaintiff must present sufficient evidence to show the existence of each element of its case on which it will bear the burden at trial.serfecz jewel food stores,cir.
antitrust standing 
in order to bring an antitrust claim,a plaintiff must establish that it has antitrust standing that is,that its claimed injuries are of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and reflect the anticompetitive effect of either the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.brunswick pueblo,d.general drilling complaint alleged that local repeatedly sought to suppress price competition by coercing general drilling not to do business in a given area.in moving for summary judgment local argued that general drilling did not have antitrust standing.in its brief opposing summary judgment,instead of affirmatively asserting its standing,general drilling dismissed the standing argument with a footnote stating that the cases cited by local do not have any applicability to the case at bar.
in most instances,a plaintiff must demonstrate consumer injury to have standing to assert antitrust violations.wigod chicago mercantile,cir.in this case,the quarry owner material service was the consumer of the drilling services provided by general drilling and the chicago union drillers.material service,however,is not bringing this suit general drilling is.general drilling claims that it suffered an antitrust injury as a competitor in the drilling services industry when local and the chicago union drillers conspired to force material service to terminate general drilling.because the parties do not dispute that material service terminated general drilling,general drilling plainly suffered a loss.transfer of business from one company to another,however,without an accompanying effect on competition,can not be an antitrust violation,because the antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition,not competitors.midwest gas.gas,cir quoting brunswick,at.to have standing as a competitor,general drilling needed to show that its loss comes from acts that reduce output or raise prices to consumers.stamatakis industries,king,cir.
general drilling failed to present evidence indicating a negative effect on competition in the drilling services market.the consumer,material service,purchased the drilling services first from general drilling and then from finn drill.the undisputed record evidence reveals that the price material service paid for those services did not change under finn price remained per foot,the same as it was under general drilling.local established as much through olson deposition testimony 
q.did you review the bids of raimonde or ludwig 
a.they were higher than what we were paying with general drilling.and finn drill was the exact same amount.and i believe it was per foot.
because general drilling did not present evidence to contest this fact,no reasonable jury could find that the claimed conspiracy resulted in raised prices to the consumer,material service.moreover,no record evidence suggests that the claimed conspiracy reduced output in the market.
in stamatakis,chicago firms provided color separation services to advertising agencies.one of these firms,the plaintiff,alleged that its competitor conspired with others to deprive it of business in the market.this court upheld the district court grant of summary judgment,holding that premier did not suffer an antitrust injury.finding that the victims of the scheme were the advertising agencies,the court stated that because an advertising agency had no reason to bring higher prices upon itself,it made sense to infer that there was never a threat to consumers.id.at.as for premier decline in sales,the court held that a producer loss is no concern of the antitrust laws,which protect consumers from suppliers rather than suppliers from each other.id.at.
the same reasoning applies with equal force here.as in stamatakis,the plaintiff supplier of drilling services alleges that its competitors the chicago union drillers conspired with others to deprive it of business in the market.the victims of this alleged antitrust scheme would be quarry owners like material service,who would logically not desire to bring higher prices upon themselves.moreover,because the evidence reveals that prices did not rise when finn drill took over,there in fact was never a threat to consumers.id.at.in fact,the evidence presented by local reflects that finn drill was able to compete more efficiently in the market than general drilling.in her deposition,diehr testified that signing the nimpa would have hugely increased general drilling labor costs.finn drill,on the other hand,was able to drill at the same quarry with the same rig and employee at the same price,per foot,and still pay higher wages under the nimpa.again general drilling offered no evidence to dispute these facts.as this court has held,the transfer of a plaintiff business to a competitor who can compete more efficiently in the marketplace is not an antitrust violation.midwest gas,at.
finally,this court has recognized that competitors can bring an antitrust claim when they are excluded from the market and injured by defendants actions.serfecz,at.general drilling was not excluded from the market.general drilling president,boatman,testified in his deposition that the company continues to work at the vulcan and northern indiana quarries,and continues to solicit business in northwest indiana.moreover,boatman testified that material service twice invited general drilling back to drill at its quarries,in the spring and fall of.because general drilling presented no record evidence to dispute these facts,no reasonable jury could find that general drilling was excluded from the market.summary judgment on this issue was proper.
per se unreasonable restraint of trade 
because general drilling could not establish an antitrust injury outright,it relied at argument before the district court on the presumption of injury that arises from a per se unreasonable restraint of trade.this court has held that antitrust remedies may be available without a showing of market injury if an individual competitor can show that the defendant anticompetitive actions were per se illegal under section.wigod,at.per se violations are actions where the nature and necessary effects that result are so plainly anticompetitive that an analysis of their illegality is unnecessary.id.general drilling claims that conspiracies to eliminate a low price competitor to suppress price competition are per se unreasonable restraints of trade.a sherman act combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising,depressing,fixing,pegging,or stabilizing the price in the marketplace is illegal per se.united states oil.to establish a per se conspiracy,a plaintiff must produce evidence that a combination was formed for the purpose of fixing prices and that it caused them to be fixed or contributed to that result id.at.
general drilling predicates its conspiracy claim on troglio statements to general drilling officials at the and meetings.for instance,keil testified that troglio spoke at the meeting of complaints from the union drillers.according to diehr,there were contract drillers up there that were not happy with general drilling being in their area.finally,boatman testified that ludwig in particular was the one that put pressure at various times and tried to come down and get that business.boatman could not testify to any specific conversations between troglio and union drillers about general drilling.
the taped conversations also provide some indication of pressure from the chicago union drillers.on those tapes,troglio is heard saying,i have to get this repaired.it is an issue.an issue to the other guys and i got ta get this done.when asked who it was an issue to,troglio replied,well,i not going to mention names but you have got a lot of competition although he would not specify,he intimated that the other parties were general drilling signed competition.when asked in the deposition what names he had refused to mention,troglio replied,none.at other times on the tapes,troglio says,bill,i,we were to the point that i have to do something about you and politically,you know,i got to do it.general drilling,then,presented some evidence of a conspiracy.the evidence fails,however,to show that the conspiracy was formed for the purpose and with the effect of,which is necessary to establish a per se claim of conspiracy.on tape,troglio voices the concerns that he shared with the chicago union drillers 
kt what i am talking about,bill,is your competition.be it ludwig.be it raimonde.be it lamberts.uh.be it calahan and shue sic.your competition within our jurisdiction pays a rate.that all i care about.that you on the same playing field as those people within our jurisdiction 
troglio and the chicago union drillers,then,focused not on the price paid by material service for the services general drilling provided,but on the amount of wages and benefits general drilling paid to their employees.there is no evidence that troglio ever discussed pricing with any of the chicago union drillers or with general drilling.as discussed below in reference to the section claims,troglio played no role in formulating material service decision to terminate general drilling or its choice of a driller to replace general drilling.undisputed record evidence reveals that material service paid the same price to finn drill as it did to general drilling for the drilling price remained at per foot.any evidence of was insufficient to survive summary judgment.
general drilling reliance on denny marina,renfro,cir,to support its claim is misplaced.in denny marina,this court held that the defendants actions constituted a per se violation of the sherman act because the conspiracy was both horizontal and formed for the purpose of fixing prices.the court found that a group of boat dealers in the central indiana market took concerted action to protect themselves from price competition by the discounter,denny.when participating in industry boat shows,denny had a policy to meet or beat its competitors prices.as a result,its competitors complained and succeeded in preventing denny from participating in the boat show.
in contrast,general drilling presented no evidence to indicate that it was prevented from participating in the northwest indiana market.instead,general drilling continues to solicit business and to work for vulcan and northern indiana in the market.general drilling was not even prevented from working for material service,who asked general drilling to work at its quarries again twice in.because general drilling neither presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that it had antitrust standing nor demonstrated a per se violation of the sherman act,defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.the district court grant of summary judgment on this issue was proper.
section claim 
the national labor relations board nlrb is vested with primary jurisdiction to determine what constitutes an unfair labor practice.kaiser steel mullins,d.as a general rule,federal courts do not have jurisdiction over activity which is arguably subject to or of the nlra,and they must defer to the exclusive competence of the national labor relations board.id.quoting.trades council garmon,d.federal courts may decide labor law questions that arise as collateral issues in suits brought under independent federal remedies,such as the antitrust laws.connell const,plumbers and steamfitters local union,d.as discussed above,however,there is no viable antitrust claim in this case,so the court can not assert jurisdiction over the section claims as collateral to the antitrust claim.
district courts may also entertain suits brought for violations of section b of the nlra.b.section of the lmra,a,prohibits unions from engaging in any activity or conduct defined as an unfair labor practice in section b.section b defines an unfair labor practice,in relevant part,as an attempt by a labor organization 
ii to threaten,coerce,or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce,where in either case an object thereof is 
b forcing or requiring any person to cease doing business with any other person 
b.the statute permits a union to pressure an employer with whom it has a primary labor dispute.be k const.will grundy counties.trades council,cir.but a union may not advance its cause by pressuring unrelated,secondary employers to stop dealing with the primary employer.id.moreover,union pressure is unlawful under section b where the union acts with mixed motives,partially primary and partially secondary.mautz oren,teamsters union,local,cir.in such a situation,it is not necessary to find that the sole object of the strike was secondary so long as one of the union objectives was to influence the secondary employer to bring pressure to bear on the primary.id.
with a conclusory analysis,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of local on the plaintiff section claim.because we review this ruling de novo,we must determine if a genuine issue of material fact existed for the trier of fact to determine.the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of local only if general drilling presented no probative evidence from which a reasonable jury could find local activities violated b.see anderson liberty lobby,d.if there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the union conduct was protected primary activity,then summary judgment was proper.landgrebe motor,district,int l of machinists,cir.
lawful primary picketing 
where a union has a grievance with the terms and conditions of employment of a particular employer,the primary employer,it must focus its picketing activity on that employer.mautz oren,at.the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of local only if general drilling presented no probative evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that local activities violated section b.see anderson,at.because local was involved in a primary labor dispute with general drilling,there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the primary nature of local conduct against general drilling.
all of the evidence presented to the district court supported local assertion that it picketed general drilling both for recognition and for area wages.troglio succinctly stated the grounds for the dispute in his deposition testimony 
q.so you were picketing,trying to get boatman to sign a collective bargaining agreement 
and picketing for area standards.
in their testimony,general drilling officials corroborated these two asserted motivations for picketing.boatman,diehr,and keil all met with troglio in to discuss troglio concerns about general drilling.both boatman and diehr confirmed that even at that early date troglio was pressuring general drilling for recognition on behalf of local.describing the attitude that troglio took at the meeting,boatman stated,it was just,join or leave.diehr elaborated on her understanding of troglio intentions 
q did he ever say he wanted you to sign a collective bargaining agreement 
a he wanted us to either be union or be out.that was it.
q what did you understand that to mean,be union 
a it meant join the union.
q sign a collective bargaining agreement 
a that correct.
the deposition testimony of these two general drilling officials illustrates that as far back as troglio was plainly interested in unionizing general drilling.
the testimony also establishes troglio early concern over general drilling area wages.keil testified that troglio suggested at the same meeting that he did think we were paying the prevailing wage for that area.diehr named wages and benefits as the topic of discussion at the meeting and specifically remembered troglio saying we were not paying the wages that they paid.
tape recordings of the two spring conversations between troglio and general drilling indicate that troglio remained interested in both recognition and adequate wages some six years later.troglio again voiced his concerns about area wages,saying,your competition within our jurisdiction pays a rate.that all i care about.that you on the same playing field as those people within our jurisdiction.the two letters that troglio sent out,as well as the notice posted on the day of the picket,named area wages as the motivation.when asked if he would be satisfied if general drilling paid the union rates but did not join the union,troglio responded that it would not satisfy him.this does not,as general drilling claims,reveal as pretextual troglio interest in wages,but merely affirms that his concern was not limited to wages alone.
the picket that troglio threatened in march,and instituted in august,then,resulted from the dispute between the two parties about troglio twin concerns.nonetheless,general drilling maintains that those concerns were illegitimate and construes as pretextual local assertion that general drilling was not paying area wages.instead,general drilling argues,local worked to expel it from the quarries because of a preference for the chicago union drillers.
in his deposition testimony,troglio admitted that the collective bargaining agreements between the union and quarry owners material service and vulcan provided a top wage that was less than the top wage provided in the nimpa.troglio,however,argued that general drilling should pay the rate that contract drilling companies,not quarry owners,paid when they did drilling work.general drilling presented no evidence to contradict the legitimacy of troglio argument.in fact,boatman testified to the different approaches taken by the two parties 
q the comparison you were making to him at the time,to kevin troglio in,was between a general drilling driller and a vulcan employee doing the drilling work,correct 
a that right,because they were members of the laborer union.
q okay.the position,kevin troglio position,was because you were doing it on a subcontract basis,the comparison should be between your driller employee and another subcontract driller employee,correct 
a i believe that what he was doing,yeah.
general drilling president,then,acknowledged that the difference of opinion over the prevailing area wage was predicated on differing views on how to calculate that wage.
in,troglio and general drilling again met and discussed the difference of opinion.troglio felt that the nimpa set the area standard,saying,um,if you are drilling blast holes you come under the northern illinois materials producers contract.boatman responded by way of comparison to other quarries we paying comparable wage to where we,monon,rensselaer sic and comparable to what that operating engineer driller would be making.in turn,troglio stated,i not concerned with what the quarry rates is.you are not competing against the quarry people.you are competing against the other drillers.boatman recognized the difference of opinion,saying,not that i do understand where you coming from.i do think you necessarily right.but you understand where i coming from and you do think i necessarily right.after acknowledging that troglio had legitimate labor concerns,then,general drilling president continued,so,we had a little of an impasse,i believe,but at least we know where everybody is and there no hidden agenda.general drilling,through its president,essentially acknowledged that troglio concerns were not pretextual.although general drilling now argues on appeal that local was acting on its preference for chicago union drillers,no evidence supports this claim.
general drilling also claims that local falsely asserted that it was engaged in the construction industry so that local could seek a prehire agreement.section f allows for prehire agreements,agreements setting the terms and conditions of employment for workers hired by the signatory employer without the union majority status first having been established,only for construction industry employers and unions.jim mcneff,todd,d.in the march letter,local claimed that general drilling was performing construction work at a project within its geographic jurisdiction.sometime after receiving the letter,general drilling officials met with troglio and had the following exchange 
kt but you not a material worker.you are a driller.you are a contract driller.
wmb yes.only for material producers.
kt you not dealing in materials.
wmb i not in construction.
thus,initially the two parties disputed whether general drilling was in the construction industry.troglio,though,later admitted in his deposition that it was not 
tell me what construction work it is you thought general drilling was doing 
i do know,but i sure 
q.you do know,right 
and you did know then,did you 
even if local was seeking a prehire agreement with a company that was not engaged in the construction industry,however,that conduct would be violative of section b a,not section b.nlrb local union,int l of bridge workers,d.as the supreme court has held,there could be no clearer abridgement of the rights enforced by section b a than to grant exclusive bargaining status to an agency selected by a minority of its employees.int l ladies garment workers union nlrb,d.because federal court jurisdiction under extends only to violations of section b,a violation of section b a would properly be heard by the nlrb.see local union,d reviewing the nlrb initial determination under that section.
some record evidence,described above in reference to the antitrust claim,suggests that the chicago union drillers applied pressure on troglio and local.nonetheless,taking those facts in the light most favorable to general drilling,local activity was still primary.the reason behind any pressure from the union drillers comports with one of troglio avowed motivations for,his concern over area wages.according to keil,the complaints from the union drillers arose because they did think we were paying the prevailing wage for that area.similarly,diehr relayed the reason for the drillers unhappiness they said that we were paying had an unfair advantage because we were not paying the wages that they paid.general drilling argument focuses on the origination of the dispute union drillers prodding troglio into action rather than the nature of the dispute one over wages and benefits.all involved witnesses stated that troglio and local were acting on the belief that general drilling paid inadequate wages and benefits.under section,the term labor dispute includes 
any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment,or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating,fixing,maintaining,changing,or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment,regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee.
c.because local actions fall squarely within this definition,the quarrel represents a classic case of a primary labor dispute under section b.see nlrb denver constr.trades council.
even if the chicago union drillers notified troglio of general drilling advantage and spurred his complaints about comparative wages,the undisputed fact remains that the quarrel troglio initiated was a primary labor dispute.a plaintiff may not defeat the defendant properly supported motion for summary judgment without offering any significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.anderson,at.quoting first nat.bank of cities servs,d.general drilling did not present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that local engaged in conduct defined as an unfair labor practice under section b.because there was no genuine issue of material fact,local activity was primary as a matter of law,and summary judgment on this issue was properly granted.see landgrebe,at.
lawful secondary effects of primary picketing 
lawful primary picketing often has substantial and foreseeable effects on secondary employers.mautz oren,at.in its amended complaint,though,general drilling asserted that local violated section b because b y the threatened picketing or by the picket at material service indiana quarries,local at least one objective sic forcing material service to terminate general drilling.when the primary employer shares a work site with a secondary employer,the picketing is presumed lawful so long as the union does not intend to enmesh the secondary employer in the dispute.coolsaet const.local,int l union of operating engineers,cir.the parties do not dispute that troglio acted as an agent for local and that material service was a secondary employer.at issue here is whether local exerted unlawful secondary pressure on material service during its primary labor dispute with general drilling.
because the parties also do not dispute that the august picket occurred at the material service quarry while general drilling was working there,this case falls under the common situs analysis.the nlrb and the courts have developed the moore dry dock standards to frame the common situs analysis,see sailors union of the pacific moore dry dock,but the focus remains on the defendant motive,which is a question of fact to be determined through examination of the totality of the union conduct in the given situation.int l union of operating engineers,local nlrb,cir quoting nlrb local,plumbers,cir see also coolsaet,at.at trial the burden is on the plaintiff employer to establish that any alleged secondary effects were the intended consequence of union activity.landgrebe,at.to survive summary judgment,general drilling needed to present some probative evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that local intended to force material service to terminate general drilling and install a union driller in its place.see anderson,at.all of the evidence presented to the district court indicates that local did not act with that intent to the contrary,the evidence reveals that material service made an independent decision to terminate general drilling.because the record evidence does not reflect a genuine issue of material fact,the grant of summary judgment on this issue was proper.
in early,when olson became aware of the possible picket,he consulted with bernardi and decided to develop a plan to hire a union driller in case terminating general drilling became necessary.olson then instructed jorns to put a plan b together to get some bids for alternate drillers.material service admittedly developed the contingency plan in order to avoid interference with material service production and sales.in his deposition testimony,olson stated that at the time he thought it possible that local production employees would refuse to cross the picket line,and consequently that material service production and sales would suffer.more specifically,he said,we did want to bring labor disputes that were not,we are not involved with,inside our property,both jorns and mcelfresh shared his understanding of the company reason for developing the alternate plan.thus,all the witnesses agreed on the impetus for material service actions after local notified material service that a picket was forthcoming,material service officials made a business decision that it could not sustain the loss of production and sales that would result from a picket in which its union employees refused to cross the picket line.general drilling presented no evidence to contradict this asserted motivation.
material service then informed general drilling of its intentions.according to mcelfresh,he spoke with boatman and explained to him that in the event of a picket general drilling could no longer do the drill work u ntil he got unionized or something.when material service finally terminated general drilling on august,the same reason motivated the decision.olson testified that boatman got terminated because material service did want to bring other labor issues into our,the quarry boundaries.additionally,both jorns and olson believed that,if not for the picket,general drilling would still be doing the drill work at the quarry.
even if the union picketing has substantial and foreseeable secondary effects,that conduct does not violate section b unless the employer satisfies its burden of establishing that the union intended to cause disruption of the secondary employer business.mautz oren,at.the evidence detailed above indicates that,after learning of local intentions,material service made the decision to terminate general drilling in the event of a picket.the deposition of olson buttresses this point 
q.if i understand it correctly,olson,neither you nor anyone else at material services sic wanted to terminate general drilling 
i believe that correct.
and it was,i think you testified,your fear about the picketing interfering with your business sales,production,et cetera that made you do what you did 
although this testimony unequivocally explains material service reason for terminating general drilling,it reveals nothing about local intent.material service decision to terminate general drilling was a consequence of local legitimate,primary labor activity.but even if the termination result
