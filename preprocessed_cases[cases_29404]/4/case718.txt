plaintiff visionshape,visionshape,appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered after the court sustained,without leave to amend,a demurrer filed by defendant kofax image products,kofax,to visionshape third amended complaint.visionshape and kofax both marketed software that was compatible with certain video scanner hardware or video boards manufactured and marketed by kofax.the genesis of the instant action was kofax introduction of a new video board that was compatible with software concurrently released by kofax but not with visionshape software.visionshape contends it sufficiently pleaded the following causes of action unlawful loss leader sales unlawful sales below cost unlawful tying arrangement intentional interference with prospective economic advantage negligent interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
because this is an appeal of a judgment of dismissal entered after the sustaining of a general demurrer,we accept as true all the material allegations of the complaint.shoemaker myers cal d.visionshape alleges the following facts in its third amended complaint the complaint 
kofax manufactures video boards used to connect document scanners to personal computers.video boards are marketed to and kofax has a percent share of that market.kofax also manufactures and markets a separate intermediate application product called image controls,which kofax refers to as a developer or imaging components.kofax markets image controls to,who integrate it with video boards and then market the integrated applications to end users of scanners.the integrated application enables the end user to perform a variety of functions,including scanning,viewing,printing and image indexing.visionshape refers to the to market for image controls as the intermediate application market.an who sells an end user application typically pays a royalty or licensing fee to the manufacturer of the intermediate application.
visionshape directly competes with kofax in the intermediate application market with an intermediate application called vision tools.like image controls,vision tools is integrated with video boards made by kofax and other manufacturers to create end user applications.it is standard in the video board integration industry for manufacturers of video boards to provide competing manufacturers of intermediate applications access to a low level tool kit,which is integrated with the video board to provide basic scanning and printing functions.the low level tool kit assists the intermediate application manufacturers in developing high level intermediate applications to sell to.
in september,kofax began to market a new line of video boards called adrenaline.the adrenaline boards were higher performance boards than those previously manufactured by kofax.kofax notified that the adrenaline boards would not be available with a low level tool kit and would not be compatible with kofax former low level tool kit,and image controls was the only high level intermediate application that could be integrated with the new boards.kofax then started giving away image controls or selling it below cost to purchasers of adrenaline boards,with the intent of eliminating or reducing competition in the intermediate application market.
by not making a low level tool kit available and representing that the only way to integrate the adrenaline board is through image controls,kofax eliminated competition.who want to integrate an adrenaline board with a high level intermediate application other than image controls are forced to use image controls instead of a low level tool kit to achieve the integration.when this is done,the two high level applications compete and wrap around each other,making integration inefficient and unpredictable.by denying its competitors access to a low level tool kit also referred to as a bedrock code for adrenaline boards,kofax has created a that denies access by its competitors to the level of code necessary to develop efficient and competitive intermediate applications.
after kofax answered visionshape first amended complaint,visionshape successfully moved to file a second amended complaint.the court sustained kofax demurrer to the second amended complaint with leave to amend,ruling visionshape failed to state any cause of action against kofax.the court sustained kofax demurrer to the third amended complaint without leave to amend and dismissed the action.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a general demurrer without leave to amend,our task is to determine whether the complaint states,or can be amended to state,a cause of action.for that purpose we accept as true the properly pleaded material factual allegations of the complaint,together with facts that may properly be judicially noticed.citations.crowley katleman cal th,d.
we review the court denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.hendy losse cal d,d.a court abuses its discretion in denying leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability the defect in a complaint can be cured by amendment.however,the burden is on the plaintiff to show how the complaint might be amended to cure the defect.ibid.
ii.loss leader and sales below cost 
in its first cause of action visionshape alleges the following kofax sold image controls at less than cost and also gave it away for the purpose of promoting sales of adrenaline boards.the sales at less than cost had the effect of misleading the buyers in the intermediate application market that the use of other intermediate applications like vision tools was unnecessary and impractical.kofax also misled buyers by representing its boards could only be integrated by using image controls.kofax engaged in such conduct with the intent to injure or eliminate competition in the intermediate application market.the second cause of action reiterates that kofax gave away image controls and sold it at less than cost with the intent to injure or eliminate its competition in the intermediate application market.
business and professions code section provides it is unlawful for any person engaged in business within this state to sell any article or product at less than the cost thereof to such vendor,or to give away any article or product,for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition.section provides it is unlawful for any person engaged in business within this state to sell or use any article or product as a loss leader as defined in section section defines loss leader as any article or product sold at less than cost a where the purpose is to induce,promote or encourage the purchase of other merchandise or b where the effect is a tendency or capacity to mislead or deceive purchasers or prospective purchasers or c where the effect is to divert trade from or otherwise injure competitors.although sections and contain no language requiring a culpable mental state for an unlawful loss leader,courts consistently have interpreted section to require the same mental state as section,the intent to injure competitors or destroy competition.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
to satisfy the pleading requirements of section,the plaintiff must allege,in other than conclusory terms,the defendant sales price,costs in the product and cost of doing business.mts,d.the same pleading requirements apply to section because a violation of that statute also requires a sale below cost.independent journal newspapers united western newspapers,d.in addition,the plaintiff must allege specific facts supporting the conclusory allegation that a sale below cost was done with the intent of injuring competitors or destroying competition,as such a conclusory allegation,whether viewed as a conclusion of fact or law,is not admitted by a demurrer.id.at.
in its first and second causes of action,visionshape alleges kofax sold image controls at less than cost.however,visionshape fails to allege the sales price of image controls,kofax costs in the product or kofax cost of doing business.hence,the first and second causes of action fall short of the plead
