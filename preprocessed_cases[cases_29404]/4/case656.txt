plaintiff kimberly aleksick,individually and on behalf of a class of those similarly situated,appeals a judgment following an order granting defendant eleven eleven motion for summary judgment.eleven provides payroll services to its franchisees.aleksick contends reversal is required because eleven payroll system violates both the unlawful and unfair prongs of business and professions code section specifically,she asserts that eleven practice of converting any partial hour worked in a pay period from minutes to hundredths of an hour sometimes shorts employees of a few seconds of time,and commensurate pay,and thus violates labor code wage statutes.she focuses on the following elementary example minutes is of an hour,and at an hourly rate of,pay should be.when eleven converts the minutes to,however,and multiplies that figure by,pay is.aleksick challenges eleven practice of ignoring numbers more than two places from the decimal point.
we affirm the judgment.aleksick complaint does not allege any statutory predicate for her unfair competition law ucl claim of unlawfulness,and she did not seek leave to amend.thus,the principle of forfeiture applies.moreover,even without forfeiture,she can not pursue a ucl claim for unlawfulness because the labor code wage statutes govern the relationship,and undisputed evidence shows eleven was not the class members employer.for the same reason,aleksick can not pursue her claim of unfairness under the ucl,which is tethered to the public policy in favor of requiring employers to comport with labor code wage statutes and promptly and fully pay their employees.the trial court correctly determined eleven is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
factual and procedural background 
michael tucker owns franchises for two eleven stores.his relationship with eleven is governed by a franchise agreement that designates him an independent contractor.he is responsible for overall store operations,including all matters pertaining to employees,such as hiring and firing,setting pay,and scheduling work.
the franchise agreement requires tucker to use eleven weekly payroll processing service for his employees.hourly employees clock in and out on an in store processor isp.the isp records time in hours,minutes and seconds,but for purposes of pay,eleven uses hours and whole minutes seconds are ignored.for any partial hours,eleven calculates pay using decimal hours rather than minutes.eleven converts the total number of hours and minutes worked to a total number of minutes,and divides that figure by to convert the time to hours and hundredths of an hour.eleven ignores numbers beyond the hundredth place,the second number to the right of the decimal point,a practice the parties refer to as truncation.
in august tucker hired aleksick to work as a clerk in his eleven stores.her employment ended in february.she sued eleven,individually and as a proposed class representative,for violation of the ucl the operative fourth amended complaint complaint alleges eleven payroll method,specifically the practice of truncating decimal hours to the hundredth place,is both unlawful and unfair because it shorts class members of seconds of work time per pay period,and commensurate pay.the complaint prays for restitution and injunctive relief.
to avoid protracted litigation over certification issues,the parties stipulated to certification of the following class all individuals who received employment compensation at any time between april,and date of class certification based on an hourly rate multiplied by the total hours worked in a work week whose compensation was processed by the eleven payroll system and involved the application of the practice of truncating the total hours worked in a work week to two decimal places and who worked for a eleven franchisee in california who had signed a store franchise agreement with eleven.italics omitted.
aleksick moved for summary adjudication.she sought findings that eleven had a duty to refrain from committing unfair business practices,and that it breached the duty eleven moved for summary judgment,or in the alternative,summary adjudication.eleven argued it is not subject to a ucl claim because the complaint alleges no statutory predicate,as a payroll services provider eleven was not the employer of aleksick or other class members,and the alleged injury is insufficient to support the claim.
in support of its motion,eleven submitted evidence that tucker,not eleven,was aleksick employer.eleven also submitted the expert declaration of an economist and statistician,dwight steward,on the issue of damages.the declaration states steward reviewed the timesheets and earnings statements of randomly drawn eleven employees for a total of pay periods.disregarding salaried employees,who are not members of the class,steward found that of the pay periods were subjected to truncation by eleven.in of those pay periods,steward calculated there was no difference between the employee pay based on the hours and the employee pay based on the truncated hours.
as to the remaining pay periods reviewed,which involved eight employees,steward attached a table to his declaration to show the potential damages.his declaration states as the table shows in column,the largest discrepancy for any employee or pay period was hours or about seconds of lost time for the entire week of work.the majority of pay periods that were affected by eleven truncation policy potentially lost seconds of time per week of work.the average amount per pay period that was affected by the eleven truncation policy was per week.the declaration also states the table shows that c ollectively,for the pay periods that were affected by truncation,there is a total potential loss of minutes of work time or a total wage loss of.
aleksick did not present any expert evidence.she submitted timecards and earnings statements for herself and a few other employees.most of the copies of earnings statements in the clerk transcript,however,are too dark to decipher.the timecards show the time an employee clocked in and out each day,and eleven conversion of the hours and minutes to hours and decimal hours.aleksick claimed the timecards show the class members were shorted on their time,but she did not present mathematical calculations required to support the showing.thus,without performing the math itself,the trial court could not ascertain whether the timecards support aleksick claim.
after a hearing,the court granted eleven motion for summary judgment and denied aleksick motion for summary adjudication.the court did not address eleven arguments the ucl is inapplicable because the complaint does not allege any statutory predicate for it,and eleven is not the class members employer.
the court held the practice of calculating employee pay based upon the decimal system,rather than using a fractional system,is inherently reasonable,and does not constitute a violation of the ucl.the court also held the practice of truncating the decimal point after the second digit once a week is inherently reasonable,and does not violate the ucl.the court explained the plaintiff class will never be able to prove harm from this,because the law requires that all wages be paid in the context of the human ability to measure and the human ability to deal with the world.the court noted the m aximum value of the third decimal is.by my calculation,simple enough,applied to an hour results in a little over seconds.
further,the court determined there was no unfair business practice because the potential for error in eleven truncation practice was less than the potential for error in the input data the recording of time in whole minutes twice per work shift.for instance,an employee clocking in at and clocking out at would be paid for minutes of work rather than the minutes and two seconds actually worked.

istandard of review 
the standard of review of an order granting summary judgment is well established.our review is de novo.citation.we independently review the entire record,except as to evidence to which objections were timely made and sustained,in the same manner as the trial court.citation.first,we review the issues framed by the operative pleadings to determine the scope of material issues.we then determine if the moving party has discharged its initial movant burden of production.if we determine the moving party made the requisite prima facie showing of the nonexistence of a triable issue of fact,we then review the opposing party submissions to determine if a material triable issue exists.citations.in performing our de novo review,we must view the evidence in a light favorable to plaintiff as the losing party citation,liberally construing his or her evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing defendant own showing,and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in plaintiff favor.united parcel service wage hour cases th.

as the predicate for her claim of unlawfulness under the ucl,aleksick cites labor code sections,subdivision a requires employer to pay wages twice a month,prohibits employer from secretly paying a lower wage while purporting to pay a wage designated by statute or contract,subdivision a requires employer to pay overtime compensation,requires employer to pay minimum wages,and,subdivision a authorizes civil action by employee for unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation.aleksick contends the court erred by not finding eleven payroll method,specifically the practice of truncating decimal hours to the hundredth place,violates these labor code wage statutes.
aleksick,however,cites the labor code wage statutes for the first time on appeal.her complaint does not allege any statutory predicate for the ucl cause of action.the complaint merely alleges eleven has violated both california law its own contractual promise,thereby depriving the class members of money earned by them.this vague allegation did not notify eleven that in moving for summary judgment it was required to address labor code sections,subdivision a,subdivision a,and,subdivision a.
in its motion,eleven argued it was entitled to judgment on the ucl claim of unlawfulness because the complaint failed to cite any underlying law or statutory violation.in opposition,aleksick nonetheless neither cited any statutory predicate for the ucl claim nor sought leave to amend the complaint to do so.she merely argued e ntitlement to wages and overtime compensation is based on an important public policy,and the legislature decision to criminalize certain employer conduct,such as wage and overtime violations,reflects a determination that the conduct involves a broader public interest.aleksick attorney argued at the hearing that the court proposed ruling is abrogating the california minimum wage and overtime laws,but he did not cite the labor code or request leave to amend the complaint.regardless of his comments,this showing was insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact.
this court opinion in distefano forester th distefano,is instructive.in distefano,the plaintiff argued in his written opposition to a summary judgment motion that the defendant violated statutory duties of care under specified provisions of the vehicle code.we concluded the argument was insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact because the complaint included no such allegation and the plaintiff did not seek leave to amend.we explained to create a triable issue of material fact,the opposition evidence must be directed to issues raised by the pleadings.citation.if the opposing party evidence would show some factual assertion,legal theory,defense or claim not yet pleaded,that party should seek leave to amend the pleadings before the hearing on the summary judgment motion.distefano,supra,at laabs city of victorville th,complaint measures the materiality of the facts tendered in a defendant challenge to the plaintiff cause of action.

invalidity of claim 
even if aleksick complaint had cited the labor code wage statutes,however,we would find against her because they govern the relationship,and undisputed evidence shows eleven was not the class members employer.again,the trial court did not address this theory,but we affirm a summary judgment if it is correct on any theory.united parcel service wage hour cases,supra,th at.
