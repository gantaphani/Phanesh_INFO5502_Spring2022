energy trigen sued oklahoma gas electric og e in federal district court,alleging violations of the federal antitrust laws,oklahoma antitrust laws,and oklahoma tort law.a jury returned a verdict for trigen on all counts except attempted monopolization.the court awarded trigen over million in damages.og e appeals the jury verdict and trigen the damages award.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.because we find that og e is immune from federal antitrust liability under the state action doctrine and that trigen remaining claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the oklahoma corporation commission occ,we reverse.
background 
a.the parties 
oklahoma gas electric og e is a regulated electric utility that serves communities in oklahoma and arkansas.the occ and the arkansas public service commission regulate the rates,terms,and conditions for og e retail electricity sales.the federal energy regulatory commission regulates og e wholesale electricity sales.aplt.br.at.
trigen,a subsidiary of trigen energy corporation,operates urban and industrial district systems around the country.vi.at.in,trigen entered the oklahoma city market by acquiring district plants from another company.at its plants,trigen produces steam and chilled water,which are then pumped from a central station through trigen underground pipeline to trigen customers.in order to use trigen system,buildings must be accessible to trigen underground pipeline.trigen oklahoma city sales are not regulated.id.at.
og e and trigen compete indirectly in oklahoma city.og e attempts to persuade trigen customers to purchase cooling equipment chillers from a third party and install it in the customers buildings.buildings that use electric chillers consume more electricity for cooling than buildings served by trigen.obviously,buildings with electric chillers for cooling also do not need trigen services.id.at aplee.br.at.significantly,without a chiller,og e electricity is not a substitute for trigen system.og e only sells does not manufacture or sell chillers.og e also has no control over its electricity prices as its rates are set by the occ.aplt.br.at.
b.the conduct at issue 
at trial,trigen sought twenty years of lost profits from og e based on three allegedly anticompetitive incidents.first,trigen and og e competed for oklahoma county buildings.the county had originally signed a contract with trigen in december.however,this contract lapsed at the end of every fiscal year,as the oklahoma constitution prohibits political subdivisions from entering into contracts exceeding one fiscal year.i aplt.add.ex.in,the county board became dissatisfied with trigen rates and began to investigate installing electric chillers.og e conducted a study for the county that concluded the county could save significant amounts of money by installing chillers.convinced by the study,the county board began negotiations with trigen,with trigen ultimately agreeing to reduce the county capacity charge by about annually.at trial,trigen sought to regain these lost profits as damages from og aplt.br.at aplee.br.at.
second,og e and trigen competed to win the contract to serve the city myriad convention center.the city ultimately selected og e,after og e offered to include the city in the experimental real time pricing rtp tariff recently approved by the occ.aplt.br.at.under the rtp tariff,the customer is given a schedule of hourly prices a day or a week in advance,and the customer may adjust its usage accordingly.id.at.the occ approval of the rtp program gave og e complete discretion to select customers.id.an outside consulting firm,hired by og e,estimated but did not guarantee that by using rtp,the city could achieve an average rate of cents per.id.at.trigen contends that og e misrepresented the rtp rate to the city.aplee.br.at.again,trigen sought lost profits as damages from og 
third and finally,og e and trigen competed for the business of corporate tower,a building.trigen succeeded to the corporate tower contract when it entered the oklahoma city market in.corporate tower contract with trigen had a primary term of ten years,with two renewal periods.aplt.br.at ii.add.ex.at.the first of these renewal periods expired in september.in anticipation of that expiration,og e attempted to persuade corporate tower to install an cooling system.to this end,og e provided information to the building manager on how to evaluate cooling,offered to pay for a feasibility study,sponsored an informational breakfast meeting and an energy conference,and had its lawyers evaluate corporate tower contract with trigen for legal termination options.aplt.br.at.corporate tower decided to terminate its relationship with trigen at the end of the first period and install chillers and heaters.at trial,trigen sought to recover twenty years of lost profits from the loss of corporate tower business based on the assumption that,but for og e,trigen would have received a contract extension.see i.add.ex.
c.the litigation 
in september,trigen filed this action in federal district court alleging monopolization and attempted monopolization in violation of of the sherman act,unreasonable restraint of trade and discrimination in violation of.stat.tit,and tortious interference with contract and prospective business advantage.i.doc.first am.compl.the trial took place in december,and the jury returned a verdict for trigen on all counts except attempted monopolization.iii.doc.og e made three motions for judgment as a matter of law during trial,xi.at,at the close of all the evidence,xii.at,and after the jury verdict,iv.doc.the trial court denied the motions.xi.at xii.at v.doc.in january,the trial court trebled the damages award and entered judgment for against og v.doc.
discussion 
trigen brought federal antitrust claims against og e,as well as state antitrust and tort claims.og e argues that a combination of the state action,and filed rate doctrines mandate that the court dismiss both the federal and state antitrust claims against it.og e also argues that the district court had no jurisdiction to hear the state tort claims against og e as the exclusive jurisdiction to hear such claims rests with the occ.because we hold that the state action doctrine mandates the dismissal of the federal antitrust claims,and that the state antitrust and tort claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the occ,we decline to reach the and filed rate doctrine defenses.nor is it necessary to address og e arguments concerning reversible error at trial,the damages award,or trigen.
a.the state action doctrine 
og e contends that the state action doctrine immunizes its conduct from federal antitrust scrutiny in three ways all of trigen claims are based on og e efforts to sell electricity,and og e electricity sales are immune from antitrust actions because the state has chosen to regulate them og e offer to the city to participate in og e pilot rtp program falls within the state action doctrine because the occ expressly approved the rtp tariffs and the decisions of the city and county on whether or not to contract with trigen are immune from antitrust actions,and this immunity extends to og aplt.br.at.
we see no significant legal difference between og e first two grounds for state action immunity.the rtp program in which og e offered to enroll the city is just another electricity sale.therefore,we will treat og e simply as arguing that all of its regulated electricity sales are protected by the state action doctrine.this argument,standing alone,is enough to mandate dismissal of the federal antitrust claims.accordingly,we need not address og e third contention,that the city and county immunity under the state action doctrine should extend to og 
at the outset,we must deal with the issue of waiver.based on arguments that og e made at trial,trigen argues that og e has waived state action immunity except with respect to og e offer of the rtp rate to the city.see xi.at vi.at.we disagree.based on our review of the entire record,we find the issue of state action immunity to be pervasive throughout the litigation.og e clearly raised the issue of state action immunity as applying to all of its regulated e
