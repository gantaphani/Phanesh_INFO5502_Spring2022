llc and its subsidiary,sawstop,llc together,sawstop,contend that several major manufacturers conspired to boycott sawstop safety technology and corrupt a private process,all with the aim of keeping that technology off the market.consequently,sawstop sued nearly two dozen saw manufacturers and affiliated entities,alleging that they violated of the sherman antitrust act.the district court dismissed sawstop amended complaint based on,among other things,its belief that sawstop had failed to plead facts establishing an unlawful agreement.see,llc black decker,cv,wl.july.sawstop appealed.
we agree with the district court that several parts of sawstop case can not go forward.sawstop complaint does not plausibly allege any conspiracy to manipulate safety standards,so we affirm the district court decision to dismiss sawstop claims concerning.likewise,the complaint fails to allege any facts at all against several corporate parents and affiliates,so we affirm the district court decision to dismiss all claims against those defendants.
but as to the remaining defendants,sawstop has alleged enough to suggest a plausible agreement to engage in a group boycott.although that claim may not prove ultimately successful at trial,or even survive summary judgment,the complaint offers enough to survive the defendants motion to dismiss.a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.bell atl.twombly.thus,we vacate the district court decision dismissing sawstop claim and remand for further proceedings.
background 
relevant facts 
this appeal concerns a decision on a motion to dismiss,so we draw the relevant facts only from allegations in sawstop complaint and from sources incorporated into that complaint.in reviewing the dismissal of a complaint,we must assume all facts to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.cooksey futrell,cir.keeping that standard in mind,we now consider the relevant facts.
in the,sawstop founder,stephen gass,created a form of active injury mitigation technology aimt meant to prevent some hand and finger injuries on table saws.in basic terms,gass technology detects contact between a person and the blade and then stops and retracts the blade to mitigate injury.j.when this system works as it should,a user who makes contact with the blade will suffer only a small nick rather than more serious injury.
gass and his initially sought to capitalize on their invention by pursuing licensing agreements with the major manufacturers.the effort began in august,when sawstop first took a prototype table saw to a trade show to publicly demonstrate the technology.that demonstration spurred meetings with some manufacturers,including s b power tool black decker,emerson electric company and ryobi technologies.during these meetings,sawstop sought royalties at typical commercial rates of about of wholesale prices in any license agreement.
the technology impressed the manufacturers.ryobi,for instance,formed a team to determine whether it could incorporate sawstop technology into its products ryobi counsel wanted to adopt the technology as fast as they could.s b power tool likewise expressed interest in going forward.one black decker employee told gass that he felt a licensing agreement was inevitable,even though black decker was used to being able to crush little guys.emerson also held meetings with sawstop to discuss a potential deal.several manufacturers conducted technical studies to evaluate sawstop effectiveness in preventing accidents,which produced positive results.
still,manufacturers also held reservations,one of which was product liability exposure.if some manufacturers adopted aimt while others did not,then an issue could arise as to whether the might be sued for producing an inherently unsafe product.but a lawyer for one defendant noted that the aimt technology might be deemed infeasible,and therefore less relevant in suits,if it did not enter the market for some period.
putting aside product liability,some saw manufacturers held other concerns,including that engineering and cost factors could render the technology infeasible.by all accounts,sawstop had not yet tested its technology in the marketplace.that testing would take some time,and sawstop itself estimated that the device could not have been fully implemented on all table saws until as late as.at least one industry insider also believed that sawstop aimt could induce consumers to dispense with other safety features.furthermore,aimt did not prevent certain other common injuries,like kickback.id.
sawstop licensing discussions did not produce any immediate results.one manufacturer,s b power tool,ended licensing discussions in september.
in october,manufacturers allegedly met and decide d how to respond,as an industry,to the sawstop t echnology.the meeting occurred in conjunction with the annual meeting of the power tool institute,a trade association.like the broader annual meeting,the session drew representatives from across the industry,including s b power tool ryobi makita usa,emerson porter cable hitachi koki usa black decker and milwaukee electric tool.
sawstop alleges that the october meeting gave birth to a group boycott against sawstop.the manufacturers first purportedly determined to take an all or nothing approach,in which all manufacturers would adopt sawstop technology or none would.then,they allegedly took the latter path they agree d not to purchase technology licenses from sawstop or otherwise implement aimt.n o contrary views were articulated.id.by keeping sawstop out of the market,the manufacturers hoped that it would remain at least plausible for them to contend,in defending product liability lawsuits,that aimt was not viable.
ultimately,sawstop contends,the group boycott succeeded.t hose defendants not yet in license negotiations with sawstop refrained from requesting a license,while defendants who were already in negotiations found ways to abort them as opportunities arose.
according to the complaint,it took only a matter of months for the few defendants who had been negotiating with sawstop to find ways to end those discussions.in january,for instance,ryobi had agreed to a licensing agreement with an initial royalty and a to escalator clause.sawstop,however,identified a minor ambiguity in the agreement and asked ryobi to correct the error.although ryobi counsel assured sawstop that would happen,ryobi instead ended negotiations entirely ryobi stopped responding to sawstop communications,and never explained its failure to communicate further.id.similarly,emerson abruptly ended negotiations,offering pretextual reasons for its lack of interest.and black decker offered a disingenuous and not made in good faith offer a royalty,paired with an indemnification provision that would have placed liability on sawstop for various risks.
having failed to sign any manufacturer to a licensing agreement,sawstop turned to a private organization,underwriters laboratories,ul,to advance the aimt product.in december,gass submitted a proposal to ul suggesting that the organization modify its widely accepted safety standards to require aimt on all table saws.ul in turn referred the proposal to standards technical panel stp,a subgroup of ul that sets standards for table saws.
sawstop proposal to modify the ul standards failed,and sawstop alleges that the failure traces to a second conspiracy,which we will term the conspiracy.in sawstop view,stp was under the firm control of the defendants,as its members comprised either employees of the defendants or purportedly unaffiliated consultants who are aligned with the defendants.thus,the defendants allegedly agreed to vote as a bloc to thwart the proposal.after the vote,the defendants are said to have promulgated falsehoods,factual distortions and product defamation to ensure that stp would not adopt any standard incorporating aimt.
later,the defendants are alleged to have additionally conspired to develop their own safety standards,purportedly to impose unnecessary costs on sawstop and foreclose any wide adoption of aimt.sawstop says that the defendants implemented this conspiracy in multiple stages.first,in october,several defendants black decker hitachi pentair,robert bosch tool robert bosch gmbh ryobi one world technologies and techtronics industries,formed a joint venture to develop blade avoidance technology.sawstop maintains that this venture was a mere smokescreen to fend off intervention from the consumer products safety commission,a federal safety agency,and constituted an act of fraudulent concealment.id.the venture failed to produce any results.later,in november,four decker,makita usa,robert bosch tool,and techtronic industries north america formed another joint venture.this venture,too,was alleged to be a fake effort to develop a uniform blade guard standard to preclude quality competition on blade guard standards.id.members of the power tool institute also began work on a new blade guard design around the same time.
this third conspiracy,which we will call the conspiracy,led to two standards changes adopted by ul in and.the first change added certain devices.the second specified that the blade guard should not be a hood,but rather a modular design with a element and two guarding elements.sawstop maintains that this second change is too and ineffective it deduces that the change must therefore serve an illegitimate purpose.
sawstop further believes that the manufacturers are trying to extend the conspiracy abroad,as they control the international electrotechnical commission,the european counterpart to ul.
sawstop maintains that all of the alleged conspiracies have continued through today,and the defendants purportedly communicate weekly to maintain the conspiracies.nonetheless,sawstop was eventually able to enter the market by making its own table saws employing aimt in.when sawstop filed its complaint,it sold three types of these saws.the company represented at oral argument that it now makes additional models.
proceedings below 
based on the three purported conspiracies,sawstop filed a complaint in february in the district court for the eastern district of virginia.the original complaint against separate defendants alleged that the,conspiring with ul and the power tool institute,violated of the sherman act.after the defendants moved to dismiss,however,sawstop filed a first amended complaint the operative pleading on appeal dropping some defendants and adding three new counts under state law.for convenience,we refer to the first amended complaint as simply the complaint.
the district court dismissed sawstop complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b after identifying a number of problems that it perceived in the facts alleged.first,plaintiffs conspiracy allegations were belied by their negotiating history with varying defendants,llc,wl,at.in the district court view,sawstop could not plausibly allege a refusal to deal when several defendants had actually offered to deal,and the facts alleged did not tend to exclude lawful explanations.id.at.second,sawstop failed to allege anything as to several defendants,instead choosing to lump them together in the complaint without explanation.id.third,sawstop did not allege direct evidence of agreement by referring to testimony from a ryobi engineer,david peot.the district court found that peot testimony,when read in its full context,indicated only that certain defendants launched a joint venture to develop technology to prevent accidents.id.at.fourth,sawstop had not established any harm from any of its alleged conspiracies because the purported motivation for the alleged conspiracy is.id.and fifth,sawstop conspiracies alleged nothing more than ordinary participation in trade groups,organizations,and joint ventures,which does not create antitrust liability.id.at.
sawstop timely appealed,challenging the district court decision as to its three sherman act claims.sawstop does not address the district court decision to dismiss its three remaining state law claims.as to those claims,sawstop has forfeited review,and we do not consider them.see powell palisades acquisition xvi,llc,cir.we have jurisdiction under.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of the defendants motion to dismiss de novo.johnson am.towers,llc,cir.w e accept as true all facts in the complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to sawstop.united states triple canopy,cir.we do not,however,accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.anand ocwen loan servicing,llc,cir.nor do we accept unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.united states ex rel.oberg.higher educ.assistance agency,cir.we can further put aside any naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.id.
iii.allegations against parents and affiliates 
we begin by addressing a problem common to all counts of the complaint.
a plaintiff in a case can not assemble some collection of defendants and then make vague,allegations against all of them as a group.at trial,a plaintiff will be required to make a factual showing that each defendant conspired in violation of the antitrust laws,div.of skylight,associated press,cir united states foley,cir examining whether a jury charge in a criminal antitrust case require d a sufficient involvement by each defendant.thus,the complaint must forecast that factual showing,and if it fails to allege particular facts against a particular defendant,then the defendant must be dismissed.in other words,the complaint must specify how these defendants were involved in the alleged conspiracy,without relying on indeterminate assertions against all defendants.in re travel agent comm antitrust,cir see also total benefits planning agency,anthem blue cross blue shield,cir in re elevator antitrust,cir.
nevertheless,sawstop means to bring claims against some corporate parents including hitachi koki,makita corporation and chang type industrial,even though no factual allegations are made against them.instead,sawstop nakedly alleges only that all of the corporate subsidiaries are dominated by,and are alter ego s of,these corporate parents.that allegation offers only a legal conclusion,and sawstop has alleged no facts suggesting the kind of unity of interests that we usually require a party to plead before permitting them to advance an alter ego theory.see,trust,first flight,cir.the fact that two separate legal entities may have a corporate affiliation does not alter the pleading requirement to separately identify each defendant pleading requirement to separately identify each defendant antitrust,md kbf,wl,at.
the complaint also fails to allege any facts pertaining to certain of the corporate subsidiaries.in discussing the alleged group boycott,for example,sawstop never mentions techtronic industries north america,owt industries,or pentair water group.owt industries,and pentair water group also go unmentioned in sawstop allegations as to the ul safety standards.a defendant obviously may not pursue an antitrust claim against a defendant who is not alleged to have done anything at all.antitrust law does recognize guilt by mere association,imputing corporate liability to any affiliate company unlucky enough to be a bystander to its sister company alleged misdeeds.
sawstop tries to tie other defendants to the purported conspiracies with nothing more than conclusory statements,even though those defendants entered the industry well after these conspiracies allegedly began.stanley black decker,for instance,is purportedly liable because persons speaking for the company have affirmed its understanding of the purpose of the conspiracies,and agreed to participate in them.sawstop alleges the same as to delta power equipment.u nadorned conclusory allegations like these are akin to no allegations at all.vitol,primerose shipping,cir.
for these reasons,sawstop can not proceed against all of the defendants.in particular,hitachi koki,makita corporation chang type industrial,owt industries,pentair water group,stanley black decker,and delta power equipment,must be dismissed as to all counts.the claim against techtronic industries north america,must also be dismissed.the district court correctly dismissed these defendants because,at least as to them,the complaint was vague,never explained its case,and lumped them together without sufficient detail.bates city of chicago,cir.
we now consider whether sawstop has properly alleged an antitrust conspiracy against the remaining manufacturers.
iv.pleading a conspiracy 
section of the sherman antitrust act prohibits e very contract,combination,or conspiracy in restraint of trade.to establish a antitrust violation,a plaintiff must prove a contract,combination,or conspiracy that imposed an unreasonable restraint of trade.state bd.of dental exam rs ftc,cir.
this appeal principally concerns the first element,the conspiracy.s ection one prohibition against restraint of trade applies only to concerted action,which requires evidence of a relationship between at least two legally distinct persons or entities.robertson sea pines real estate,cir.to be actionable,the defendants must have specifically made a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.monsanto spray rite serv.not even conscious parallelism is enough,brooke,brown williamson tobacco,as independent action is not proscribed by.vermiculite,historic green springs,cir.
accordingly,a plaintiff bringing a claim must first plead an agreement to restrain trade.in bell atlantic twombly,the supreme court explained that such a plaintiff must plead enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that the requisite agreement was made.in other words,the complaint must contain enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.id.for this reason,allegations of parallel conduct on the part of the defendants must be placed in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement,not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.id.at.a conclusory allegation of agreement at some unidentified point also does not supply facts adequate to show illegality.id.
at bottom,twombly applies a principle in antitrust law to the pleading stage parallel conduct,standing alone,does not establish the required agreement because it is equally consistent with lawful conduct.the twombly plaintiffs asked the court to reject that idea and assume a conspiracy exclusively from action that seemed too coincidentally similar to be independent.id.at.the court refused,and for good reason.parallel conduct or interdependence,after all,is just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.id.at.thus,the complaint in twombly failed because it rested only on descriptions of parallel conduct that could be just as easily explained by natural,unilateral reaction s from each defendant.id.at,see also robertson,at twombly required contextual evidence to substantiate a speculative claim about the existence and substance of a conspiracy.
for a claim to survive,then,a plaintiff must plead parallel conduct and something more.twombly,at.that more must consist of further circumstance s pointing toward a meeting of the minds.id.allegations could suffice,for instance,where a plaintiff demonstrates that the parallel behavior would probably not result from chance,coincidence,independent responses to common stimuli,or mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the parties.id.at.often characterized as parallel plus or plus factors,evergreen partnering,pactiv,cir,these facts must be evaluated holistically,see cont l ore union carbide carbon,cautioning courts not to compartmentaliz e the various factual components of an antitrust case.
we do not take the approach that the dissent pursues,which seems to parse each plus factor individually and ask whether that factor,standing alone,would be sufficient to provide the more.tellabs,makor issues rights,explaining that courts must consider the complaint in its entirety to determine whether all of the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to relevant inferences,rather than asking whether any individual allegation,scrutinized in isolation,meets that standard.actions that might seem otherwise neutral in isolation can take on a different shape when considered in conjunction with other surrounding circumstances.see william kovacic,et,plus factors and agreement in antitrust law,explaining why plus factors must be analyzed in groups or constellations.
importantly,twombly requirement to plead something more than parallel conduct does not impose a probability standard at the stage.see ashcroft iqbal.courts must be careful,then,not to subject the complaint allegations to the familiar preponderance of the evidence standard.text messaging antitrust,cir.when a court confuses probability and plausibility,it inevitably begins weighing the competing inferences that can be drawn from the complaint.but it is not our task at the stage to determine whether a lawful alternative explanation appear s more likely from the facts of the complaint.houck substitute tr,cir.post twombly appellate courts have often been called upon to correct district courts that mistakenly engaged in this sort of premature weighing exercise in antitrust cases.see,evergreen partnering,at erie,ohio morton salt,cir anderson news,am.media,cir.
similarly,courts must be careful not to import the standard into the stage.at summary judgment in a case,a plaintiff must summon evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action.twombly,at see also monsanto,at matsushita indus.zenith radio.but the stage concerns an antecedent question,twombly,at,and t he plausibly suggesting threshold for a conspiracy complaint remains considerably less than the tends to rule out the possibility standard for summary judgment,starr sony bmg music entm t,cir.thus,a lthough twombly articulation of the pleading standard for cases draws from summary judgment jurisprudence,the standards applicable to rule b and rule motions remain distinct.in re ins.brokerage antitrust,cir.t here is no authority for extending the standard to the pleading stage.erie,at.indeed,such an extension would be wholly unrealistic,as a plaintiff may only have so much information at his disposal at the outset.robertson,at.here,for instance,sawstop was three months into its case and had not conducted any discovery when the defendants moved to dismiss.we can hardly expect it to have built its entire case so early on.
we therefore consider whether the district court properly applied this standard.
group boycott 
sawstop initially alleges a group boycott,which generally constitutes a concerted refusal by traders to deal with other traders.klor,broadway hale stores.most often,group boycotts involve horizontal agreements among direct competitors with the aim of injuring a rival.nynex discon.this sort of naked concerted refusal occurs when the defendants are not engaged in any significant integration of production or distribution,and the only rationale for the restraint is the elimination of additional,or more innovative output from the market.phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,fundamentals of antitrust law a ed supp.s uch agreements cripple the freedom of traders and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment.kiefer stewart joseph seagram sons.
the district court held that sawstop had not adequately alleged an agreement to boycott.however,in reaching that conclusion,the district court committed the two errors that we earlier cautioned against.
first,it confused the standard with the standard for summary judgment.the district court twice cited matsushita the case defining the tends to exclude standard for summary a basis for its ruling.see,llc,wl,at.it then mistakenly dismissed certain claims because the facts alleged did not tend to exclude independent action.id.at.it made explicit findings of fact including a finding that motive was nonexistent that were plainly contradicted by the terms of the complaint.see alleging motive.the district court further required sawstop to definitively show an agreement,llc,wl,at,rather than asking whether the allegations plausibly suggest ed such an agreement,twombly,at.and it erroneously looked to summary judgment cases to define the relevant standards.see,llc,wl,at citing gtr.rockford energy tech.shell oil,cir.
second,the district court applied a standard much closer to probability than plausibility.for instance,the district court opinion adopts defendants characterizations of the licensing negotiations and then draws unsurprisingly adverse inferences against sawstop based on them.the district court noted,for example,that emerson had made a offer to license,but believed that sawstop had made no allegation that emerson rescinded that offer,llc,wl,at.sawstop specifically alleged to the contrary that emerson cut off all license negotiations with sawstop,offering pretextual reasons for its lack of interest,and did not renew them.in much the same way,it concluded that a disingenuous offer to license from black decker usa was inconsistent with conspiracy,llc,wl,at,without explaining why an offer that sawstop pled was intended to be rejected was unavoidably inconsistent with a refusal to license.on the whole,these inferences seem to have been colored by the district court belief that sawstop was a technology with uncertain commercial viability and safety.id.at.
in short,the district court imposed a heightened pleading requirement but such a standard does not apply on a rule b motion,even in an antitrust case.see marucci sports,collegiate ath.ass n,cir penn allegheny health,upmc,cir.this heightened pleading standard was error.instead,the district court should have asked whether sawstop has alleged parallel action and something more that indicates agreement,as twombly provides.
our de novo standard of review means that we can decide the matter without deference to the lower court.thus,we may apply the appropriate,standard ourselves rather than remanding to the district court for another attempt of its own.see,houck,at triple canopy,at.further,we enjoy the benefit of the parties briefs,and can read and understand the complaint in the same way as could the district court.thus,we proceed to consider whether sawstop has adequately alleged a group boycott.
a plaintiff establishes parallel conduct when it pleads facts indicating that the defendants acted similarly.petruzzi iga supermarkets,darling delaware,cir see also hyland homeservices of,inc,cir considering whether the defendants actions were uniform.
sawstop adequately alleged parallel conduct.the similar or uniform actions alleged are obvious none of the defendants ultimately took a license or otherwise implemented sawstop technology.as a result,sawstop could not pursue its initial business strategy of entering the market through a license agreement with a major manufacturer.such actions are classically anticompetitive,as parallel action that excludes new entrants both facilitates price elevation and can slow innovation.scott hemphill tim wu,price exclusion,yale.
the manufacturers incorrectly insist that their conduct must be deemed dissimilar at this stage because some licensing negotiations continued after the conspiracy formed.the district court agreed.see,llc,wl,at the sequence of all of these events undermines the plaintiffs group boycott allegations.so does the dissent.
but that argument misunderstands the nature of the alleged boycott,while again confusing probability with plausibility.the manufacturers could have achieved their alleged objective of keeping sawstop off the market in any number of ways they could refuse any licensing discussions at all,they could engage in spurious licensing discussions,see,they could sign a license agreement and then never implement it,or they could scare sawstop off with commercially unreasonable offers.all of these actions could be consistent with the boycott ultimate alleged objective,exclusion from the marketplace.see evergreen partnering,at faulting the district court for improperly weigh ing the defendants alleged ly inconsistent responses anderson news,at holding that defendants varied actions during the initial stages of the alleged conspiracy did not render the existence of a conspiracy implausible.
sawstop never alleged that the manufacturers agreed on a common manner of preventing sawstop entry into the market.that not surprising.commercially sophisticated parties like the defendants could well understand the red flags that would be raised from a blanket,total refusal to negotiate.see,am.tobacco united states,detailing a conspiracy in which the defendants used a variety of differing methods to achieve the same ultimate objective,an understood and settled price for tobacco.sawstop might have become suspicious if all of the defendants fled the negotiations en masse without any pretextual cover.but if the defendants employed different courses of action,then their conspiracy might better avoid detection.sawstop alleges they did exactly that.see defendants fraudulently concealed the aimt boycott by,among other things,giving separate excuses for not taking a license.sawstop inquiries were met with silence,false denials and misleading explanations.
the dissent,however,is unwilling to credit sawstop factual allegation that the different paths of negotiations were themselves part of the claimed conspiratorial ruse.it contends that,in crediting sawstop allegation,we underestimate the difficulty of getting a group of competitors to agree on a course of action that separate contract negotiations may or may not have shown to be in their best commercial interest.dissenting op.at.but the same thing could be said about most any alleged agreement between competing businesses and yet the law has never embraced a presumption against business agreements.much of antitrust law is premised on such agreements.more importantly,we are in no position at this stage to make estimates of the sort the dissent posits.it should hardly need to be said again that we must proceed on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.twombly.rule b does not countenance dismissals based on a judge disbelief of a complaint factual allegations.colon health ctrs.of,lllc hazel,cir.
we must be careful not to rely on our own subjective disbelief here,as even the acts that the manufacturers and the dissent say are dissimilar might also be read to suggest deception.ryobi and emerson,for example,suddenly ended negotiations without sufficient explanation after proceeding all the way to a draft license agreement.see.this sort of abrupt and unexplained shift in behavior can suggest that a defendant acts were not entirely independent,as the shift came after the alleged october agreement to launch the boycott.see,toys r us,ftc,cir explaining that the defendants sudden decision to stop dealing,which was an abrupt shift from the past,provided more reason to infer a horizontal agreement.for its part,black decker usa purportedly tendered only a disingenuous offer that was not made in good faith.assuming that characterization is accurate as we must,few benign purposes would be served by such an offer.
but the dissent would require more,even at this early stage of the proceedings it would find parallel conduct only when defendants move in relative lockstep,achieving their common anticompetitive ends exclusion only by substantially identical means.so far as we can tell,this standard finds no support in any existing authority.
the three decisions that the dissent cites do not support the proposed rule,as they all involved ends.one involved inconsistent pricing in an alleged conspiracy,see city of moundridge exxon mobil,d,while another addressed wildly varying surcharges in both amount and timing in an alleged conspiracy,laflamme societe air france,d.the last,an appeal from a summary judgment decision,held only that the defendant had not established conscious parallelism on the part of one defendant it assumed,however,that the actions alleged were parallel.see cosmetic gallery,schoeneneman,cir.at best,these cases stand for an unremarkable proposition parallel conduct must produce parallel results.and they further recognize the very point so hotly contested by the dissent parallel conduct need not be exactly simultaneous and identical in order to give rise to an inference of agreement.laflamme,d at city of moundridge exxon mobil,civil action rwr,wl,at,can occur even though the price increases are not identical in absolute or relative terms.
our own precedent does not support the dissent view.take,for example,united states foley,cir,in which a group of real estate brokers were convicted of violating by conspiring to fix real estate commissions.it seems an understatement to say that the foley defendants did not move in any way close to perfect tandem some defendants did not act to implement the agreement until months after it formed,while at least one defendant implemented the new commissions before the conspiracy formed.id.at.still other defendants only partially joined,taking higher commissions when available but otherwise pursuing lower ones.id.had foley been decided under the dissent framework,these divergent paths to the same end higher commissions would apparently have required reversal of the convictions.the court,however,reached a different result it affirmed all nine criminal convictions after finding sufficient evidence of agreement.id.at.foley,then,effectively rejects the dissent proposed methodology.
lastly,we disagree that the dissent definition is needed to avoid imposing antitrust liability on innocent activities.the dissent proceeds as if a finding of parallel conduct inexorably leads to liability.but twombly foundational principle is that parallel conduct,standing alone,is not enough to impose antitrust liability.in other words,the plaintiff initial showing of parallel conduct is only an initial step in a process.it is the additional steps required of an antitrust plaintiff that are meant to ensure that innocent business activities are not tarred as antitrust violations,whether at the stage or later.
thus,we think it plain that sawstop alleged parallel conduct.the remaining question is whether sawstop also pleads the requisite more that point s toward a meeting of the minds.twombly,at.
sawstop has alleged the more necessary to move its allegations of parallel conduct into the realm of plausibility.
the claim pled in the complaint builds a detailed story.sawstop identifies the particular time,place,and manner in which the boycott initially formed,describing a separate meeting held for that purpose during the power tool institute october annual meeting.see.the complaint names at least six specific individuals who took part in forming the boycott,noting which defendant each person ostensibly represented.see.the complaint further tells us the means by which the defendants sealed their boycott agreement a majority vote.see.and the complaint then explains how the manufacturers implemented the boycott refusing to respond to entreaties from sawstop,going silent after long negotiations,or offering only terms that were intended to be rejected.thus,u nlike the plaintiffs in twombly,sawstop clearly has alleged an express agreement to restrain trade.watson carpet floor covering,mohawk,cir swierkiewicz sorema,explaining that a title vii complaint should not have been dismissed where it detailed the events leading to his termination,provided relevant dates,and included the ages and nationalities of at least some of the relevant persons involved with his termination.
antitrust complaints,like sawstop,that include detailed fact allegations as to the who,what,when and where of the claimed antitrust misconduct not surprisingly survive dismissal.william holmes melissa mangiaracina,antitrust law handbook supp.see also carrier outokumpu oyj,cir kendall visa,cir goldfarb mayor city council of,cir a complaint should not be dismissed as long as it provides sufficient detail about the claim to show that the plaintiff has a chance of success on the merits.detail in a complaint of further circumstances pointing toward a meeting of the minds allays the suspicion that the plaintiff is merely speculating a conspiracy into existence from coincidentally similar action.twombly,at.that,after all,was twombly principal concern.see swanson citibank,cir a more complex case like one involving antitrust violations will require more detail,both to give the opposing party notice of what the case is all about and to show how,in the plaintiff mind at least,the dots should be connected.
the dissent contends that the complaint rests on a casual presumption of liability.but that view overlooks the complaint detailed account of the alleged events an account that,again,we must take as true for rule b purposes.instead,the dissent seems to rely on a series of factual suppositions that might perhaps explain the relevant parallel conduct.but that approach forces us to ignore the factual allegations that form the heart of sawstop complaint a particular meeting on a particular day with particular participants making a particular agreement that generated the conspiracy at issue.and by favoring its perception of the relevant events over the narrative offered by the complaint,the dissent makes the very mistake that the district court made,recasting plausibility into probability.
the dissent underscores the weakness in its position by mischaracterizing the factual allegations in sawstop complaint as conclusory in an effort to avoid them.it may be that the dissent does believe the complaint detailed allegations,but that skepticism does not render the allegations conclusory.see iqbal,at explaining allegations can not be called conclusory merely because a judge views them as extravagantly fanciful,unrealistic,or nonsensical.indeed,just two weeks after twombly,the supreme court reversed one of our sister circuits for making much the same error.see erickson pardus,reversing dismissal of a complaint as conclusory where the complaint alleged harm only by saying that prison officials endanger ed his life by taking away needed treatment.and,as a practical matter,demanding more than the particularized allegations that sawstop offered here would compel an antitrust plaintiff to plead evidence and we have already expressly refused to impose such a requirement.see robertson,at.
in any event,we observe that sawstop not only alleges the who,what,when,and where in its complaint,but also the why.m otivation for common action is a key circumstantial fact.einer elhauge damien geradin,global antitrust law and economics see also hyland,at listing common motive to conspire as a potential plus factor mayor city council of balt.citigroup,cir same.according to the complaint,the defendants here were motivated to conspire out of a fear of exposure if one manufacturer adopted the technology,then manufacturers could face liability exposure from their failure to employ aimt.thus,under sawstop theory,the manufacturers conceived a group boycott to keep aimt off the market,thereby preventing its use as a design alternative in cases.and even though a complaint need not forecast evidence to support its theory,robertson,at,sawstop complaint does so by referencing testimony from peot the former ryobi engineer,who agrees that manufacturers could have been in real legal trouble if a major manufacturer had adopted aimt.transcript of trial at,osorio v.one world,cv,ecf cited at.the complaint further describes statements in which black decker counsel is alleged to have said that product liability could be lessened if a couple of years passed without implementation of the sawstop t echnology.
the defendants insist that this alleged motive is implausible,and the dissent agrees.they theorize that,if sawstop theory of motive were true,one would have expected all of the manufacturers to take a license once sawstop began making its own saws in.the complaint indicates that course of events did not occur.
once more,the manufacturers argument embraced by the dissent seems to misconstrue the complaint allegations.sawstop entered the market as a peripheral player.see appellant br.sawstop sales did not even constitute of total industry sales of table saws in the united states.thus,the manufacturers were still conceptually able to argue that sawstop was peddling a fringe technology,as reflected in its marginaliz ed market position.see see,osorio v.one world,cir describing defendant argument that sawstop technology was not viable.indeed,the fact that the conspiracy did not include every player in the industry implies that the conspirators were concerned with major manufacturers taking a license,not smaller ones.thus,the defendants post actions which,in any event,are not fully discussed in the complaint are not much help in evaluating the manufacturers potential motives.
even if the who,what,where,when,and why were not enough,the complaint also describes a number of communications among the defendants.allegations of communications and meetings among conspirators can support an inference of agreement because they provide the means and opportunity to conspire.see,evergreen partnering,at hyland,f d at mayor city council of,at.here,in addition to discussing the october meeting where the alleged conspiracy formed,the complaint describes phone calls,meetings,and discussions among the various conspirators.such allegation s identif y a practice,not illegal in itself,that facilitates an antitrust conspiracy that would be difficult for the authorities to detect.text messaging,at accord todd exxon,cir see also sharon foster,libor manipulation and antitrust allegations,depaul bus.com,facilitating practices may evidence the plus factors necessary to establish the inference of an agreement.
a market in which sales power is concentrated in the hands of the few can also facilitate coercion.see,evergreen partnering,at todd,at in re high fructose corn syrup antitrust,cir.fewer minds must meet in a concentrated market.and the complaint implies that the market is so concentrated,as the defendants here purportedly control of that market,see,starr,at listing the defendants control of of the market as a relevant plus factor.further,the complaint describes ways in which the manufacturers attempted to hide their actions,including a mutual agreement not to leave a paper trail.see.these alleged attempts by the manufacturers to hide their actions could suggest that the defendants knew their actions would attract antitrust scrutiny,starr,at in other words,the alleged facts suggest consciousness of guilt.those actions give us further reason to conclude that a group boycott is plausibly alleged 
generally,i n addition to establishing a conspiracy,a successful plaintiff must also show that the conspiracy produced adverse,effects within the relevant product and geographic market.terry floor fashions,burlington,cir.in a viable complaint,the plaintiff must allege,not only an injury to himself,but an injury to the market as well.agnew collegiate ath.ass n,cir accord todd,at.actual anticompetitive effects include,but are not limited to,reduction of output,increase in price,or deterioration in quality.jacobs tempur pedic int l,cir.
in cases involving per se violations of the sherman act,however,this harm is essentially presumed.c ertain agreements or practices have such a pernicious effect on competition that they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm that they caused.tfws,schaefer,cir.claims that such agreements lacked anticompetitive effects are simply irrelevant.in re cardizem cd antitrust,cir.
although the manufacturers contend that sawstop failed to allege anticompetitive harm,sawstop maintains that its alleged group boycott violates the sherman act per se such that no separate allegations of harm were necessary.i n some circumstances a group boycott may be considered a per se violation.precision piping instruments,du pont de nemours,cir.and the alleged agreement here comes close to the paradigmatic boycott,in which a group of competitors here,the manufacturers take collective action here,the refusal to license or implement that may inhibit the competitive vitality of rivals here,sawstop.nynex,at see also nw.wholesale stationers,pac.stationery printing,explaining that per se illegal boycotts often cut off access to a supply,facility,or market necessary to enable the boycotted firm to compete and frequently the boycotting firms possessed a dominant position in the relevant market.
despite the facial appeal of sawstop per se argument,neither the manufacturer brief nor the district court opinion directly address it.the district court remarked only in passing that sawstop had fail ed to establish a naked boycott organized for a concerted refusal to deal,llc,wl,at.it did not discuss the issue further,and offered only a cursory citation to northwest wholesale.the manufacturers similarly assert,without explanation,that sawstop failed to allege any per se violation of the sherman act.response br.
because the issue of competitive harm is inadequately briefed,and because the district court opinion likewise gives us no guidance,we can not decide that issue or affirm on that basis.if the manufacturers so choose,however,they may again raise the issue of competitive harm before the district court on remand so that it may fully consider and discuss the question with the benefit of proper argument.
in sum,sawstop complaint is very different from the one seen in twombly,which rested solely on descriptions of parallel conduct and not on any independent allegation of actual agreement.twombly,at see also id.at t he question is whether a complaint can survive when it alleges certain parallel conduct,absent some factual context suggesting agreement.emphasis added.sawstop complaint alleges an actual agreement to boycott in detail and does not rely,as in twombly,on parallel conduct alone.the dissent observation to the contrary is,respectfully,simply an inaccurate reading of twombly.see dissenting.in particular,the supreme court directly rejected the dissent reading of the twombly complaint although in form a few stray statements sp oke directly of agreement,on fair reading these were merely legal conclusions resting on the prior allegations.twombly,at.the supreme court was explicit in finding that the twombly complaint did not contain any independent allegation of actual agreement among the ilecs.id.
as to the district court,it erred by applying a standard to sawstop group boycott claim and by confusing plausibility with probability.again,because the complaint pleads parallel conduct in conjunction with circumstance s pointing toward a meeting of the minds,twombly,at,sawstop has adequately alleged the agreement needed to support a sherman act conspiracy.of course,it remains to be seen whether sawstop has also adequately alleged any requisite harm to the market.
our decision should not be mistaken for an endorsement of the ultimate merits of sawstop case.at this point,sawstop prospects for success are largely irrelevant,as a lawsuit need not be meritorious to proceed past the stage.ringgold lockhart cnty.of los angeles,cir.in fact,a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.twombly,at accord cardigan mountain sch.ins,cir carpenters health fund royal bank of scotland,plc,cir iqbal,at w e do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical.to dismiss sawstop complaint because of some initial skepticism would be to mistakenly collapse discovery,summary judgment,and trial into the pleading stages of a case.petro hunt,united states,fed.cl.
our decision also is not meant to afford sawstop a license for unlimited discovery.like the dissent,we are well aware of the substantial cost that discovery in an antitrust case can impose,twombly,at,and recognize that the cost largely falls on the defendants.when not appropriately managed,that cost can have an extortionate effect,compelling some defendants to enter early settlements even in meritless suits.but we are neither the advisory committee on the rules of civil procedure,nor the supreme court,nor congress.we must take the rules as we find them.
district courts possess a number of tools including limitations on discovery or consideration of a timely motion for summary judgment to combat any sort of predatory discovery.see federal judicial center,manual for complex litigation ed.effective management of antitrust litigation requires identifying,clarifying,and narrowing pivotal factual and legal issues as soon as practicable.although tools like these do not permit us to give the benefit of the doubt to groundless claims,twombly,at,they confirm that our antitrust jurisprudence can not be driven solely by fears about the expense of modern antitrust litigation.we have faith that district courts possess both the will and the ability to make good use of available mechanisms,employing them as needed to preserve a level playing field particularly in antitrust cases 
vi.standard setting conspiracies 
in addition to its claim,sawstop alleges two separate but related conspiracies concerning private standard setting the conspiracy and the conspriacy.industry particpants allegedly used their influence over ul to prevent the private organization from adopting aimt as a required safety device.the defendants then purportedly encouraged ul to adopt other standards that imposed needless costs on sawstop and insulated the defendants from liability.
we find that the complaint does not plausibly establish either conspiracy.although the and conspiracies are separately alleged,they fail for the same fundamental reason the facts alleged imply nothing beyond ordinary participation in lawful processes.thus,in contrast to its claim,sawstop conspiracies fail to allege the more necessary to raise an inference of agreement.
organizations are voluntary membership organizations whose participants develop technical specifications to ensure that products from different manufacturers are compatible with each other,address certain threshold safety concerns,or serve other beneficial functions.microsoft motorola,cir.these organizations have enjoyed a rather complicated relationship with antitrust law.m embers of such associations often have economic incentives to restrain competition and the product standards set by such associations have a serious potential for anticompetitive harm.allied tube conduit indian head,see also soc y of mech.eng rs hydrolevel.as a result,private associations have traditionally been objects of antitrust scrutiny.allied tube,at.
still,such ventures can also have decidedly procompetitive effects by encouraging greater product interoperability,generating network effects,and building incentives to innovate.princo int l trade comm n,accord lotes,hai precision indus,cir broadcom qualcomm,cir.as a result,one can hardly infer anticompetitive intent to exclude from rule making alone.antitrust must therefore seek out the exceptional case,where rule making is used to facilitate collusion or the exclusion of rivals whose competitiveness or innovation threatens the relevant decision makers.areeda hovenkamp,supra,
courts have found organizations and their members to have violated the antitrust laws in some cases,but those cases are relatively few and far between.of most relevance here,an entity may be prosecuted for an antitrust violation on the basis of improper coercion of a body.coalition for icann transparency,verisign,cir.allied tube is the example of that concept.in that case,the defendant deliberately packed a panel with paid supporters who then banned a competing product.allied tube,at.coalition for icann transparency is another example.there,the ninth circuit found potential antitrust liability when a powerful corporation allegedly used vexatious litigation and financial pressure to coerce a standards organization into providing advantages to that defendant.coalition for icann transparency,at.
the common thread in the few cases finding liability in the private context is unique,external pressure applied to achieve an end.t he principal concern has been the use of standards setting as a predatory device normally there is a showing that the standard was deliberately distorted by competitors of the injured party,sometimes through lies,bribes,or other improper forms of influence,in addition to a further showing of market foreclosure.dm research,coll.of am.pathologists,cir.in other words,a plaintiff must ordinarily show that the activity had a effect that was committed through the use of unfair,or improper practices or procedures.clamp all cast iron soil pipe,cir breyer.
in the usual case,neither the organization nor its participants will run afoul of antitrust law when they use ordinary processes to adopt unexceptional standards.it is axiomatic that a standard setting organization must exclude some products,and such exclusions are not themselves antitrust violations.golden bridge,motorola,cir see also gtr.rockford energy tech,at the failure of a private,body to certify a product is not,by itself,a violation of.plant oil powered diesel fuel,exxonmobil,d,holding that the plaintiff did not plausibly allege an antitrust conspiracy based on the defendant mere opposition to a particular standard.to hold otherwise would stifle the beneficial functions of such organizations.golden bridge,at.similarly,it is not problematic,standing alone,for market participants to try to influence the process through the organization ordinary procedures.see clamp all,at.
sawstop never alleges that ul normal procedures were thwarted,or that the defendants engaged in some form of external misconduct.instead,it asks us to infer malfeasance because some of the defendants representative served on the relevant panel.but sawstop provides no authority drawing that sort of naked inference,and we have found none.certifiers may reasonably believe that they can do their job properly a job that benefits consumers only if all interested parties are allowed to present proposals,frankly present their views,and vote.id.
sawstop complaint takes issue with ul actions largely because the organization is alleged to have erred in rejecting sawstop proposed standard and selecting another one.the unstated assumption of this argument is that,lacking a valid technical justification,the only remaining explanation must be an antirust conspiracy.
even if ul ultimate decision can be called wrong,that mistake alone does not indicate concerted action to manipulate the result.s bodies sometimes err,but simple error creates no reason for liability without some further indication that the organization activities are merely a ploy to obscure a conspiracy against competing producers.consol.metal,am.petroleum,cir see also dm research,at merely to say that the standards are disputable or have some market effects has not generally been enough to condemn them as unreasonable under the sherman act.moore boating indus.ass ns,f d,cir finding no evidence of an actionable conspiracy despite the jury finding that the association was unreasonable and arbitrary in setting standards brookins int l motor contest ass n,cir so long as imca made rules decisions based upon its purposes as a sports organization,an antitrust court need not be concerned with the rationality or fairness of those decisions.m h tire hoosier racing tire,cir we discern no duty to provide an absolutely objective or scientific basis for decision.a ntitrust is not concerned with whether a standard might be unreasonable as an abstract proposition.areeda hovenkamp,supra,
if antitrust suits were permitted to go forward based solely on an allegation that the body erred,courts would be cast into the role of appellate bodies.consol.metal,at.any disagreement big or small with the ultimate adoption of a safety standard would,to follow sawstop reasoning,create potential antitrust liability.not only would this tax the abilities of the federal courts,but fear of treble damages and judicial would discourage the establishment of useful industry standards.id.
beyond its allegations,the complaint only assertions of concerted action are conclusory and a collective decision was made,or the defendants agreed to vote as a bloc,or designs were a smokescreen.the complaint identifies no fact other than consistent votes against sawstop proposal and for the other designs to establish the alleged illegal agreements.that would be parallel conduct,but such conduct is equally consistent with legal behavior.after all,even if sawstop is right that technical reasons did not support the organizations decisions,other explanations remain.see,golden bridge,at t he existence of an independent financial motive to change the standard might be an independent reason for each appellee company to support the change.advanced tech,instron,d,dismissing a complaint where t he crux of the plaintiff antitrust claim wa s simply that competitors in a market declined to support a standard that would promote another competitor technology.
lastly,we note that sawstop does not allege the sort of anticompetitive objectives that are ordinarily seen in cases.usually,cases are brought when products are effectively excluded from the market by adopted safety standards.here,sawstop largely complains that it could not use the process to impose its own product on everyone else.the anticompetitive harms of a refusal to impose are much harder to identify.nothing that ul or the groups did barred sawstop saws from the market,as sawstop entry into the competitive market establishes.from all appearances,sawstop remains free to offer its saws with the ul seal of approval,along with its perceived market advantage of also offering aimt on those saws.and if ul newer standards generate some additional costs,those costs are common to each member of the industry who chooses to make a table saw.we see nothing anticompetitive or exclusionary in that.
the district court thus did not err in granting the defendants motions to dismiss on the claims.
for the reasons described above,the district court correctly dismissed the claims as to all the defendants.the district court also correctly dismissed the claims against hitachi koki,makita corporation chang type industrial,owt industries,pentair water group,inc.stanley black decker,delta power equipment,and techtronic industries north america.however,the district court erred in dismissing the claims against the remaining defendants.
therefore,the district court decision dismissing sawstop complaint is 
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
judges ought to remember that their office is jus dicere,and not jus dare to interpret law,and not to make law,or give law.francis bacon,essay lvi of judicature,essays,reported in richard whately,bacon essays with annotations.here,the judiciously majority opinion resists the temptation to move beyond our limited role and into the colorful realm of policy.respectfully,the dissenting opinion strays beyond our limited review here and encroaches on policy issues best left to other branches of government.
first,rather than confront the issues actually in play,the dissenting opinion dresses up points of agreement as dire rifts.the dissent asserts,for example,that plaintiffs seek to achieve through litigation a monopoly for their product and claims that the majority opinion turns a blind eye to anticompetitive impulse s driving sawstop claims.post at.the dissenting opinion claims that the majority opinion ignores all the benefits of ventures such as standards setters and trade groups in its rush to flatten pleading standards,make communications perilous,and consign antitrust law to isolationist ends.id.at.thus,the dissent takes the policy view that today opinion will doom american companies to competitive disadvantage at the very time global commercial interactions are becoming more commonplace.id.nonsense beyond the obvious problem that a competitive disadvantage is meaningful only in the context of a comparison with america global competitors,many of whom also have antitrust laws.
the majority opinion fully accords with the view that j oint ventures,organizations,and trade association meetings may allow individuals of different specialties to benefit from each other expertise.these fora may prove invaluable for efficient and effective product development.post at.as the majority opinion plainly states,such ventures can have decidedly procompetitive effects by encouraging greater product interoperability,generating network effects,and building incentives to innovate.ante at quotation marks and citations omitted.the majority opinion in no uncertain terms affirms the district court dismissal of sawstop claims a crucial fact relegated to a dissenting footnote.
second,rather than address sawstop complaint as it is written,the dissenting opinion employs verbiage like commercial interactions to revise the complaint so as to omit the allegations of a secret agreement to refuse to deal.again sounding in policy,the dissenting opinion asserts that the majority drape s innocent commercial activity in sinister garb because the complaint hardly bespeaks a collective agreement not to deal.post at.thus,the dissenting opinion editorializes that due to the majority opinion,holding or attending a trade association meeting will increase your exposure to antitrust suits.id.at emphasis added.
yet,when read with a judicious eye,sawstop complaint clearly alleges that defendants entered into a secret agreement to refuse to deal at a trade association just that defendants held or attended such meetings.indeed,the complaint plainly bespeaks a collective agreement not to deal.
specifically,the complaint alleges,among other things 
in conjunction with the power tool institute annual meeting,a separate meeting of representatives of table saw manufacturers was held.attendees at the meeting included,but were not necessarily limited to,domeny on behalf of sbtc and bosch,peot on behalf of ryobi,tic and affiliates,stanley rodrigues for makita,ray mayginnes for emerson,david keller of porter cable,who also spoke for pentair and dicm,steven karaga for hitachi,and representatives of b d and milwaukee electric.domeny,at the time,was the chair of the power tool institute product liability committee,and chaired the meeting.emphasis added.
at the meeting,domeny and the other participants expressed concerns that if one manufacturer adopted sawstop technology,then all manufacturers would be subject to greater liability in future product liability cases.peot shared this concern.power tool institute table saw manufacturers determined at that meeting that they would decide how to respond,as an industry,to the sawstop technology.a consensus was reached that all should take a sawstop license implement aimt,or none take it or otherwise implement aimt since if one or more took a license offered a product with aimt,the others would be more vulnerable to product liability.it was also agreed that collective action would proceed only if all,or at least a substantial majority,of participants voted to participate.members also discussed developing something like sawstop technology,without having to pay a royalty to gass.the consensus reached by the attendees,with no contrary views articulated,was that industry members would collectively agree not to purchase technology licenses from plaintiffs or otherwise implement aimt.emphasis added and citations omitted.
the consensus reached at the meeting was based on a calculated economic determination that the manufacturers would,collectively,fare better by collectively agreeing to marginalize sawstop and aimt,than by allowing the marketplace to determine whether any manufacturers did business with sawstop or otherwise implemented aimt.the defendants believed that bringing aimt into the mass market would have catastrophic product liability consequences for them.purchasers of their existing and prior inventories of table saws and,perhaps,other products would point to the viability of aimt as evidence that other products were inherently unsafe because they lacked aimt.defendants believed that,in the short term,if sawstop was unable to obtain a major manufacturing partner,it would not be able to produce or market a meaningful quantity of saws with its aimt this way,the major manufacturers could continue to earn current profit margins on their existing inferior product lines without paying royalties to plaintiffs,and it would remain for the time being at least plausible for the major manufacturers to contend,in defending product liability lawsuits,that aimt was not viable.thus,defendant business calculation was that they,collectively,would fare better by marginalizing sawstop and aimt,than by working with sawstop otherwise adopting aimt.
it was agreed at the meeting and thereafter that all discussions concerning a collaborative response to sawstop would be confidential and concealed from persons other than power tool institute members who manufactured table saws.it was further agreed that,going forward,information relevant to sawstop and table saw product liability defense issues would only be shared among those industry participants who affirmatively agreed to act collectively in response to sawstop.emphasis added.
at,or within a period of months following the october meeting,each of defendants bosch,ryobi,makita,hitachi,pentair,emerson and milwaukee electric,and entities affiliated with them,had agreed to enter into a boycott the aimt boycott of sawstop intellectual property,by collectively refusing to license sawstop technology,and agreeing not to otherwise implement aimt.emphasis added.
during this time frame,in which power tool institute table saw manufacturers voted to respond collectively to sawstop technology,those defendants not yet in license negotiations with sawstop refrained from requesting a license,and the defendants who were already in negotiations found ways to abort them as opportunities arose.emphasis added.
in other words,sawstop complaint alleges a specific meeting in which defendants agreed to refuse to deal with sawstop and to keep that pact a secret.around the same time,defendants refrained from seeking sawstop technology or,if in licensing negotiations with sawstop,found ways to abort them.the dissenting opinion dismissive characterization of these detailed allegations as mere conclusory assertions,post at,thus plainly misses the mark.
on the contrary,sawstop allegations squarely conform to what we require sherman act plaintiffs to plead.to establish a antitrust violation,a plaintiff must prove,and therefore plead,a contract,combination,or conspiracy that imposed an unreasonable restraint of trade.robertson sea pines real estate companies,cir wilkinson,quotation marks and citation omitted.further,iqbal and twombly do not require a plaintiff to prove his case in the complaint.id.at.instead,the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state elements of the claim.id.quotation marks and citations omitted.and at the rule b stage,which is where we are,the complaint is to be construed liberally so as to do substantial justice.pub.employees ret.ass of deloitte touche llp,cir wilkinson,quotation marks and citation omitted.
in its revisionist account of sawstop allegations,the dissenting opinion essentially turns the rule b standard on its head.a motion to dismiss under rule b tests the sufficiency of a complaint importantly,it does not resolve contests surrounding the facts,the merits of a claim,or the applicability of defenses.republican party of martin,cir.instead,a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.bell atlantic twombly,quotation marks and citation omitted.
despite our mandate in reviewing this rule b dismissal,the dissenting opinion nevertheless attacks the complaint in a light least favorable to sawstop,viewing the facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to defendants.for example,the dissenting opinion opines that i gnoring the many practical reasons for declining sawstop offers,the majority hones in on the fear of product liability as the key motivation behind defendants alleged boycott.post at.yet,the majority opinion rightly focuses on the products liability reasoning because sawstop specifically alleges it.see.we are thus not at liberty to swap that pled reasoning out for other practical reasons we might make up out of whole cloth.a further example the dissenting opinion asserts that it was consistent with each manufacturer best interest to reject an expensive,unproven,undeveloped,and possibly unsafe technology.each defendant could easily have arrived at this business decision on its own.post at.but sawstop alleges that they did arrive at that decision independently.instead,the complaint specifically alleges that defendants expressly agreed to refuse to deal and to keep that agreement secret.see.ignoring such specific allegations to sawstop detriment is nothing shy of an perversion of the generous lens through which we at.
finally,the dissenting opinion focuses on its own policy preferences,thereby abandoning this court limited role which is simply to assess whether sawstop plausibly alleges the elements of its section claim.because the majority opinion sticks to its limited role,it steers clear of considering things like different approach es in a globalized marketplace,whether the word conspiracy is bound to stoke paranoia,or the appropriate amount of lag time in product development.post at.
the dissenting opinion sees itself in no way so bound and thus insists,for example,that h ere,plaintiffs are the ones acting.post at.it is simply not our job in reviewing a rule b motion to assess which party conduct we deem more.in refusing to stick to our limited role,the dissenting opinion engages in breathtaking judicial activism.
as the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized,congress is the policymaker not the courts.in re sunterra,cir.see also,hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,achieving a better policy outcome is a task for congress,not the courts.it is thus inappropriate to suggest,for example,that,as a matter of law,a boycott conspiracy may not be motivated by liability concerns.congress can pencil such categorical limitations into the sherman act we can not.
the dissenting opinion embarks on yet another odyssey into policy,as well as assumptions untethered to reality,much less the complaint at issue here,when it asserts that t hese days secrets are harder to keep.a secret is something that is held by only one.or maybe two.but managers everywhere must be relieved to learn from my concurring colleague that you can let people in on a secret and have nothing leak out.post at.yet in reviewing a complaint for rule b purposes,we may not peer into a crystal ball and decide how many people we personally believe can keep a secret and kick complaints out of court on such a basis.
moreover,to the extent the dissenting opinion suggests that a large,conspiracy by definition can not exist,it is simply uninformed.large antitrust conspiracies have not only existed but have been caught a perfect example being the famous international vitamin scandal of the which involved firms engaged in a conspiracy that lasted over a decade 
from to,chemical manufacturers headquartered in seven nations joined vitamins cartels sales by these cartels exceeded billion the pharmaceutical manufacturers involved became virtually addicted to the infusion of monopoly profits,giddy financial results that prompted the conspirators to continue their clandestine activities for up to years.these illegal activities persisted in the face of among other things several public prosecutions of parallel conspiracies and multiple antitrust investigations the conspirators simply burrowed deeper and developed more elaborate methods of subterfuge.
john connor,the great global vitamins cartels,available at.
in other words,large,conspiracies involving elaborate ruses can indeed exist as a matter of law and fact.and here,sawstop alleges that one did,and that it undertook a group boycott to freeze sawstop technology out of the marketplace.in refusing to accept those allegations,as we must at this stage,the dissenting opinion plainly oversteps its bounds.
in sum,courts exist to resolve disputes,not to pervert procedural rules into swords with which to fight policy battles.and today,we do not confront whether sawstop should ultimately succeed on its boycott claim.instead,we confront only whether,when viewing sawstop complaint with an unjaundiced eye and using the proper standard,we can say that it has made allegations sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state such a claim.it has.accordingly,with all due respect for the dissenting view,i join in the judicious and majority opinion.
the majority view of modern commerce is unfortunate.it takes an isolationist approach in which each business must all but lock itself in or risk the taint of antitrust claims.whatever validity the isolationist approach may once have had,it is profoundly injurious in an increasingly interconnected,necessarily collaborative,and globalized marketplace.the majority rightly observes that agreement is the crux of an antitrust claim,but it has made mere communication the touchstone of liability.ante at.
the majority rejects this as a statement of policy,ante at,but it is hardly that.it is rather a statement of consequences that flow from the majority refusal to follow the supreme court decision in bell atlantic twombly,which established pleading requirements for a sherman act section complaint.the supreme court lacks the institutional resources to ensure full compliance with its decisions.among other things,it has room on its docket for a limited number of cases,and the twombly decisions from the lower courts may be routinely pitched as pertaining to no more than the particulars of an individual complaint.
it just may be,however,that the institutional limitations at the court impart institutional obligations on the courts of appeals to respect in fullest measure the highest court approach.in this obligation,i believe the majority has defaulted.i shall show throughout how it has failed to follow twombly at every turn.i would suggest,most respectfully,that the majority has committed basic conceptual errors and that the consequences of those errors,which the majority prefers not to face and to dismiss as policy,are regrettable.most regrettable,however,is the treatment of a supreme court decision,even a controversial one,at the hands of this court.
among twombly insights was that markets,every bit as much as conspiracies,play a significant role in governing commercial conduct.see at.twombly counsels that we not leap to pejorative explanations when legitimate business considerations are more likely at play.id.at.the fact that sherman act conspiracies in restraint of trade do assuredly continue to exist does not mean that we should rush too quickly to drape innocent commercial activity in sinister garb.
the majority,however,adopts the reverse sequence.it fashions a template for the frustrated market participant whenever routine business decisions do go your way,for whatever reason,simply claim an industry conspiracy under the sherman act and the courts will infer malfeasance.but such casual presumptions of antitrust infractions can only chill communications among companies,which in turn may hinder product development,innovative joint ventures,and useful trade association conclaves.warning holding or attending this trade association meeting will increase your exposure to antitrust suits.
the chilling effect is most acute when the majority considers independent behavior to be parallel conduct warranting antitrust scrutiny.parallel industry conduct is,of course,the lynchpin of many a sherman act section claim.the majority cardinal conceptual error lies in the adoption of an approach to parallel conduct in a circumstantial antitrust case.see infra part.the end of course is the fact that a plaintiff product was not adopted.but the products most likely to meet the end of rejection are those of the least utility or those that would cause the most expense.the majority thus uses its analysis to reward the least marketable products with the greatest possibility of litigation success.warning failure to adopt this product for whatever reason will increase your exposure to antitrust suits.
this treatment of ends and means in antitrust litigation undermines the twombly decision.an analysis of means rather than ends is the most sensitive tool we possess to measure the plausibility of a complaint.see twombly.and here,the means by which the conspiracy was carried out paint a clear picture of conduct.the complaint is the best evidence of that.after introduced its product,certain defendants entered into licensing negotiations that continued well after the alleged group boycott agreement.some of them offered to license the technology,again after the supposed agreement,and were rebuffed by.other negotiations yielded no offers,with one defendant leaving the table saw industry altogether.the vast majority of named defendants are not even mentioned in account of the supposedly parallel behavior.their negotiation posture,which would seem well within plaintiffs knowledge,is nowhere set forth or detailed.
while the majority highlights cases in which plaintiffs successfully alleged parallel conduct,none of them features disparate actions such as these.if defendants behavior qualifies as parallel conduct,then plainly divergent actions among competitors in any field will now give rise to antitrust claims.this is but part and parcel of the majority attempt to impose a presumption of guilt on antitrust defendants who now must bear the burden of proving a negative when the burden properly lies with the party bringing the claim.
it is no accident that twombly itself was an antitrust decision.for what we confront in antitrust law is a perfect storm of treble damages,large discovery costs,and relaxed pleading standards.it is the three factors in combination that pose a threat to legitimate marketplace behavior.the supreme court in twombly sought to calm the waters by addressing the latter two.the majority,however,adds to the turbulence by sanctioning complaints that would in all likelihood have failed even under standards.here,plaintiffs are the ones acting.they seek to achieve through litigation a monopoly for their product that neither the table saw market nor contractual negotiations would yield.the result,as noted,is that marketplace failures will increasingly lead to litigation success.and that is only the beginning of the difficulty.
the majority appears to believe that the full course of discovery is the proper mechanism for winnowing out meritless claims.in many fields,that observation would be correct.the bone of contention in federal civil litigation is most frequently over summary judgment versus trial.in antitrust law,however,the flashpoint is often over motions to dismiss versus summary judgment.for the supreme court has clearly recognized that in the area of antitrust it is the threat of steep litigation costs that produces deleterious consequences in and of itself,no matter who the victor in the antitrust marathon may ultimately prove to be.
as twombly emphasized,discovery costs have escalated dramatically since the adoption of the federal rules.twombly,at see brian fitzpatrick,twombly and iqbal reconsidered,notre dame.multiplying electronic and paper records,combined with increased regulatory obligations,have caused discovery costs to mount even further since the issuance of twombly itself.before we impose these climbing costs on companies,there must exist confidence that the claims leveled against them allege actual facts that make conspiracy and other illicit intentions plausible.fails to clear this bar,but still the majority just piles it on.
the majority approach to twombly tells an old intermediate appellate story.the majority alights on a minor motif of that supreme court decision,while leaving its main point wholly unobserved.the court made clear in twombly,and reiterated in iqbal,that a plaintiff must allege enough factual content in the complaint to render his legal claim for relief plausible on its face in order to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b.ashcroft iqbal,citing twombly,at.plausibility requires more than a sheer possibility that a defendant acted unlawfully.id.citation omitted.complaint can not clear this hurdle.its conclusory assertions that defendants agreed to an boycott of its product are fully consistent with,and most plausibly reflect,independent and legitimate business decisions.put simply,the majority proceeds as if twombly were at most persuasive authority,and not very persuasive authority at that.
twombly is particularly important here,for the supreme court in that case addressed the meaning of plausibility in the context of a conspiracy allegation based on descriptions of parallel conduct.the court instructed that when allegations of parallel conduct are set out in order to make a claim,they must be placed in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement,not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.twombly,at.even conscious parallelism,a common reaction of firms in a concentrated market that recognize their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions is not in itself unlawful.id.at citations omitted.nor should a court infer that the companies had agreed among themselves to do what was only natural anyway.id.at.thus,a plaintiff fails to adequately plead his claim that a defendant unlawfully conspired under section if there exists an obvious alternative explanation for the defendant conduct that renders the prohibited explanation implausible.iqbal,at citation omitted twombly,at.
this could not be more clear.in light of twombly directives,allegations fall well short of the plausibility requirement.the complaint hardly bespeaks a collective agreement not to deal.instead,it most plausibly reflects typical market forces at work and rational business choices being made the kind of things that happen every day.why did the manufacturers not adopt product perhaps they realized the technology was too nascent to license,in short unproven.perhaps it would not have been cost effective for the manufacturers to incorporate it.or perhaps incipient product actually increased the risk of injury to consumers.these varied market explanations may well have been different for different companies.they reflect business decisions of the most common and ordinary character.they are obvious alternative explanations and have not been sufficiently rebutted by any valid assertions of a preceding agreement to collude.all the behavior described by was not only compatible with,but indeed was more likely explained by,lawful,unchoreographed behavior.iqbal,at quoting twombly,at.
in the majority eyes,however,the above discussion is all wasted effort,merely practical reasons and factual suppositions that must not be considered.ante at.instead,we should take plaintiffs allegations at face value and call it a day.it is certainly true that we assume the truth of factual allegations at the stage.twombly,at citations omitted.even after accepting plaintiffs claims as true,however,the court must further analyze whether those allegations are plausible under twombly.id.at.the majority refuses to undertake this second,more analytic step.my concurring colleague simply wishes it away.there is a time warp here,a nostalgia for the old pleading ways and days.those earlier standards were easier on us,i admit.but our nostalgia now flies in the face of a controlling supreme court decision.
boycott claim is not plausible for the same reasons twombly was not plausible.boycott claim is hardly distinguishable from the very allegations that the supreme court rejected in twombly.according to the complaint in that case,defendants who,like the defendants here,owned a significant share of the market agreed to engage in parallel conduct and prevent competitive entry.twombly,at.the complaint charged that the defendants compelling common motivation to thwart plaintiffs competitive efforts naturally led them to form a conspiracy.id.at.if these allegations sound familiar,it is because they almost perfectly parrot the claims made by in its complaint.argued that the defendants at least the few named defendants it actually bothered to discuss agreed among themselves to collectively refuse licensing offers based on a calculated economic determination that they would fare better in the marketplace if were excluded.if twombly complaint could not pass as,then should not fare any better.
the majority claims that the complaint in twombly rested solely on descriptions of parallel conduct,and not on any independent allegation of actual agreement.ante at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this is simply incorrect.the majority overlooks the actual language in the twombly complaint defendants had compelling common motivations to include in their unlawful horizontal agreement an agreement that each of them would engage in a course of concerted conduct calculated to prevent effective competition from plaintiffs amended complaint at,twombly bell atl.d see also id.at noting that defendants have agreed not to compete with one another.to be sure,after twombly complaints have sought length in the hope that courts would mistake such length for substance.but the substance here is thin gruel.the complaint allegation of an agreement is weaker than in twombly,boiling down to a contention that the defendants met at a trade association meeting followed by the inconvenient fact for the majority that conduct ensued.
in fact,the twombly complaint was much stronger than the one in this case and it went much further.that complaint relied on evidence that defendants refused to provide plaintiffs with network connections and services of equal quality,that they billed plaintiffs customers in a manner to ruin plaintiffs customer relations,that they refused plaintiffs access to certain facilities and delayed the provision of network elements after plaintiffs had invested tens of billions of dollars.twombly.at.despite this support for plaintiffs conspiracy allegations,the court maintained that each defendant had reason to want to avoid dealing with plaintiffs,and each defendant would attempt to keep plaintiffs out,regardless of the actions of the other defendants.twombly,at.defendants actions in twombly,like defendants actions in this case,were just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.id.at citation omitted.consequently,plaintiffs conspiracy claims in both cases stop short of the line between possibility and plausibility.id.at citation omitted.if only the plaintiffs in twombly could have called upon this court to refashion their complaint.
but,insists the majority,t o dismiss sawstop complaint because of some initial skepticism would be to mistakenly collapse discovery,summary judgment,and trial into the pleading stages of a case.district courts possess a number of tools to combat any sort of predatory discovery.ante at citation omitted.that approach is astonishing,for it is precisely what twombly warned against it is no answer to say that a claim just shy of a plausible entitlement to relief can,if groundless,be weeded out early in the discovery process given the common lament that the success of judicial supervision in checking discovery abuse has been on the modest side.twombly,at citation omitted.
the majority assurance that of course district courts can control discovery is the sort of appellate that ignores every reality on the ground.trial judges are busy they must set priorities.many understandably feel that time is better spent in trial or in dealing with dispositive motions to dismiss or for summary judgment than in wading into the big muddy of discovery disputes.there is the temptation,and it is again an understandable one,to say to the parties,folks,go work this out among yourselves.the problem has become even more acute with the advent of.modern electronic devices generate and record a great variety and volume of information.it is now easier and faster to store evidence,which in turn has spawned greater opportunities for discovery requests and conflict.regulatory mandates from governments at every level add to the store of both paper and electronic files.all of this makes companies more and more vulnerable to discovery requests.the majority pays no more than lip service to what has become a serious problem.its casualness stands in contrast to the gravity of the twombly court concern.
to overlook this concern is to resurrect the dangers that twombly sought to lay to rest.conley gibson was doubtless correct when decided.see,abrogated by twombly.it made sense to skip through the pleadings on the theory that discovery would somehow sort it all out.see id.at.but times have changed.although the majority the expense of modern antitrust litigation,ante at,it is altogether legitimate for the supreme court to take cognizance of the shifting interplay between causes of action here sherman act section claims and the federal rules here those of pleading and discovery.thus,the court in twombly sought to shield defendants from what it later described as the heavy costs of litigation in terms of efficiency and expenditure of valuable time and resources by allocating the plausibility burden to those who allege unlawful conduct.iqbal,at.
the court understood what the majority does not that an antitrust complaint is often too tempting to pass up.it provides a tantalizing weapon for parties whose business endeavors are going badly.the term conspiracy is bound to stoke paranoia,and to kindle an effort to pin on others the blame for business failures of one own.the treble damages awards of antitrust actions are a further temptation for floundering companies armed with the knowledge that defendants would rather settle than face the prospect of such damages,especially with the attendant high litigation costs.see twombly,at.twombly sought to reduce these dangers in language of no moment to the majority it is only by taking care to require allegations that reach the level suggesting conspiracy that we can hope to avoid the potentially enormous expense of discovery id.at.so much for that hope the majority just loads it on.
with its inverted version of twombly,the majority allows plaintiffs to contort normal marketplace behavior into a potential antitrust violation.even by the majority diluted pleading standard,however,group boycott claim fails as its complaint plainly alleges conduct.the majority bases its contrary conclusion on an expansive definition of parallel conduct focused solely on a perceived uniformity of ends without regard to dissimilarity of means.the majority observes the similar or uniform actions alleged are obvious none of the defendants ultimately took a license or otherwise implemented sawstop technology.ante at.the defendants vastly different courses of action are seen as part of some grand scheme to conceal the underlying conspiracy.ante at.by that logic,the majority would find parallel conduct as long as defendants all allegedly reached the same end not adopting a product regardless of how the dealings between plaintiffs and defendants proceeded or fell apart.
such an focus misses the entire point of twombly,which is to determine whether allegedly anticompetitive conduct stems from independent decision or from an agreement,tacit or express.twombly,at citation omitted.if defendants act in parallel whenever they arrive at the same general end or outcome,then parallel conduct will embrace independent but identical business decisions borne by market forces precisely the conduct that twombly excluded from antitrust liability.in distinguishing horizontal conspiracies from innocuous coincidences,the means matter.that competitors travelled divergent paths to the same end reflects the absence,not the presence,of illicit coordination or agreement.
certainly,direct evidence of a collusive end would amount to a plausible section claim.see american chiropractic ass trigon healthcare,cir direct evidence in antitrust cases is explicit and requires no inferences to establish the proposition or conclusion being asserted.by contrast,when plaintiffs rely on circumstantial evidence of conspiracy,as in twombly and the case at hand,the approach carries an unacceptably high risk of finding parallel conduct in wildly disparate behaviors motivated by independent economic concerns.with its sweep,the majority erodes the right of one party not to deal with another.monsanto spray rite service.as long as competitors respond in the same way to an unappealing offer or product,a business refusal to deal now becomes part of parallel conduct potentially triggering antitrust liability.
the assumption running throughout the complaint is that sawstop was the only product anyone could have thought of adopting.no other business decision could have been reasonable.therefore,defendants rejection of sawstop must have been part of a group boycott.case closed.we are not told exactly why product was demonstrably superior to other competing products in terms of cost effectiveness and safety,such that only one business decision with respect to it was conceivable.the naked assumption of its irresistible appeal and inevitable adoption operates in a comparative vacuum.but defendants faced comparative decisions.they had to weigh options.the majority ready acceptance of unsupported superiority assumption is part of the fallacy of its perspective,namely that any ultimate refusal to adopt is nothing more than one more instance of parallel behavior.
a analysis,one that focuses on the means by which the conspiracy was carried out,is the most sensitive gauge of parallel conduct and complaint plausibility.the majority contends the dissent would find parallel conduct only when defendants move in relative lockstep or by substantially identical means.ante at.not so.a focus on analysis comes nowhere close to requiring identical means.as circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy,the similarity of conduct lies along a spectrum.beyond a certain point,starkly dissimilar means render a secret agreement among competitors less plausible.the majority dismisses this analysis,apparently because dissimilar means might also be read to suggest deception rather than independent business activity.ante at.the majority thus sets a nifty trap if defendants engage in similar means,it collusion if they engage in dissimilar means,it deceit.given those options,businesses should either keep to themselves or close up shop.
for good reason then,courts have shied away from the majority conception of parallel conduct and instead required more specific similarities.see,cosmetic gallery,schoeneman.cir deeming uniform refusal to sell insufficient to show conscious parallelism because one distributor decided not to deal prior to the alleged agreement laflamme societe air france,d,casting doubt on parallel conduct claim where defendants engaged in disparate strategies at different times city of moundridge exxon mobil,d,expressing skepticism towards an allegation of parallel conduct based on evidence that defendants did no more than exchange information.although the majority insists these cases foundered on findings of ends,their common failing was in fact patently disparate means.ante at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
turning to the means here,there is simply nothing parallel about separate licensing discussions proceeding along separate timetables with different results and different motivations.alleges that defendants collectively agreed not to license its technology in october.defendants then supposedly found ways to abort the negotiations and conceal their agreement by giving separate excuses.as stated in the complaint,however,three defendants continued to negotiate with after october while the fourth,bosch,ended negotiations a month before and restarted discussions years later.ryobi sent a signed licensing agreement to in january three months after the collective refusal to deal.the contract offered a royalty initially that would increase to if the technology proved successful on the market.refused to accept what appear to be generous terms based on a minor wording issue.emerson offered the same royalty rate as ryobi and participated in negotiations for several months after october,eventually ending talks and leaving the table saw industry altogether the following year.six months after the alleged refusal to deal,black decker offered a licensing agreement with a royalty.balked at what it considered unreasonably stingy terms for its untested and undeveloped technology.id.if all this is parallel conduct and evidence of a refusal to deal,well then anything will qualify.
and yet,despite all this,the agreement is repeatedly characterized as a refusal to deal,ante at.how can this be defendants did deal and did offer to purchase technology.how were the eighteen defendants not discussed in the complaint supposed to deal when,insofar as the complaint is concerned,they were never even approached 
in short,all four discussed defendants were willing to deal with but their negotiations broke down at various times for various reasons,not least because demanded more than defendants were willing to offer.the record shows no refusal to deal,much less parallel means to that end.it is not plausible to think that the defendants disparate actions were somehow a carefully choreographed plan to exclude from the market.by supposing it possible,the majority severely underestimates the difficulty of getting a group of competitors to agree on a course of action that separate contract negotiations may or may not have shown to be in their best commercial interest.it would be quite a feat of stage management,moreover,to have some of those competitors actually extend generous but different licensing offers at different times to the very party that was the subject of the supposed group boycott.this is the type of claim on the far margins of conceivability that twombly condemned.
the hail mary nature of complaint is underscored by the fact that only four of named defendants are even so much as discussed in the allegations the figure comes from the original complaint as one defendant somehow failed to appear in the amended version.compare original complaint with amended complaint.indeed,even the majority chides plaintiffs for assembl ing some collection of defendants and then mak ing vague,allegations against all of them as a group.ante at.
even plaintiffs appear to realize how tenuous their claim of parallel conduct is.in contrast to the original complaint,amended complaint collapses its description of the various negotiations and timelines to create an illusion of uniformity.compare original complaint with amended complaint.while the original version details each of the discussed defendant negotiation history in a separate section,plaintiffs second effort weaves those divergent strands into one vague narrative,obscuring dates and distinctions along the way.id.
this attempt at obfuscation hardly inspires confidence in promise that discovery will bolster its claims.even with its artful redrafting,however,falls short of the bare minimum required for alleging a group boycott.to hold otherwise is to use antitrust law to badly skew the market forces normally at play in contract negotiations.from now on,defendants decline to deal with an entity proposing any new design feature of product development at their peril.they also can not refuse to purchase a product in the course of licensing negotiations because that too,under the majority rubric,is grounds for possible antitrust liability if others arrive independently at a similar business judgment.again,attempt to achieve through litigation more than what markets or contracts would ever independently confer is precisely the kind of abuse of sherman act claims that twombly sought to prohibit.
the majority believes that all the behavior and disparate means of proceeding were hatched in secret.the concurrence makes much of the fact that the meeting among table saw manufacturers was secret.ante at.in fact,no fewer than four times does the concurring opinion refer to the alleged agreement not to deal as a secret agreement or a pact kept secret.id.this is manifestly a cover for the fact that my concurring colleague is unable to point to the traces of an agreement,hoping,i suppose,that a fishing expedition will unearth them.
but there is a larger problem here.these days secrets are harder to keep.a secret is something that is held by only one.or maybe two.but managers everywhere must be relieved to learn from my concurring colleague that you can let people in on a secret and have nothing leak out.
we also run into a significant collective action difficulty here.the larger the alleged conspiracy,the larger the number of alleged participants that need to be brought into line both as to the object and execution of the conspiracy as well as the need to keep it secret.the vast number of antitrust cases involve a much smaller number of conspirators,and it is telling that my concurring friend must venture back to the even to find an inapposite situation.the concurrence again labels the dissent discussion of collective action problems a foray into policy.it is not.it is an inquiry into plausibility,which twombly absolutely requires that we undertake.the failure to do this is but one more example of the majority failure to follow that decision.
assuming,though only for the sake of argument,that plaintiffs had properly alleged parallel conduct,the amended complaint still fails to show the something more needed to turn conscious parallelism into a plausible conspiracy.twombly,at.the majority contends that the more necessary to nudge group boycott claim across the goal line is the complaint identification of the particular time,place,and manner in which the boycott initially formed,describing a separate meeting among table saw manufacturers held for that purpose during the power tool institute october annual meeting.ante at citation omitted.this,we are told,is the heart of sawstop complaint.ante at.
but perfectly lawful trade association meetings do in fact take place on a particular day at a particular time for a particular purpose.and the majority assertion that table saw manufacturers broke off in a separate meeting in the course of a larger trade convention is nothing more than a description of ordinary conduct.indeed,it would be unusual for a bar association meeting,health care convention,or any other gathering not to break out into more specialized subgroups to discuss matters of common interest.we need not coin the term breakout discussion liability to note that these sessions have long been a staple of business and professional life,and the majority has now made even this form of communication more perilous.
courts have recognized behavior contrary to defendants economic interests as a plus factor for showing concerted action.see,hyland homeservices of america,cir.it is hard to see how any defendant in this case acted against its economic interest.boldly asserts that,but for the boycott,all table saw manufacturers would have licensed its technology.there is little support for such inflated.plaintiffs conceded that any licensing agreements could not have taken effect until,and that its technology would not have been fully implemented until years after it demanded acceptance.defendants were also concerned that the new technology could actually increase hand injuries,discourage the use of blade guards,and fail to address kickback injuries.despite the lukewarm reception,set its royalty rate at approximately of wholesale prices,a costly gamble for manufacturers operating on often thin and always uncertain profit margins.response br.for all these reasons,it was consistent with each manufacturer best interest to reject an expensive,unproven,undeveloped,and possibly unsafe technology.each defendant could easily have arrived at this business decision on its own.
one recalls the world fairs at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century.they were held almost annually,most often serving as the epicenter for a brisk competition among participating countries to produce the most creative and technologically advanced exhibitions.it was then,as now,a time of unusual inventiveness.the fairs were humming with booths,tables,exhibits,and displays all designed to show off new technologies and create a buzz about new products.some of those products succeeded spectacularly a far larger number cratered.the point is simply that manufacturers should be able to take into account the time it takes,after the initial hype,for an invention to become one of practical and marketable utility that would not expose consumers to injury or manufacturers to liability.the majority,however,takes no cognizance of lag time,which not only exists,as it always has,in product development but in the most highly touted medical discoveries.yet consciousness of lag time is something no prudent business is wit
