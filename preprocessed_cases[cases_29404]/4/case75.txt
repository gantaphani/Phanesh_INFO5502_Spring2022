apple appeals from orders of the united states district court for the southern district of new york cote,which imposed an external compliance monitor through a permanent injunction,allegedly modified that injunction to expand the role of the monitor,and denied apple motion to disqualify the appointed monitor,michael bromwich.see united states apple,d.in separate appeals that are not before this panel,apple challenges the district court finding as to liability,and apple and other defendants challenge the district court final judgment and permanent injunction.see united states apple.this opinion does not impact those appeals.
this appeal touches upon the scope of a district court power under federal rule of civil procedure to create and modify a monitorship over the objection of the monitored party the professional and structural constraints on that monitor activities and the remedy available to the monitored party when it believes that the monitor has overreached.these largely procedural questions have considerable resonance because the fairness and integrity of the courts can be compromised by inadequate constraint on a monitor aggressive use of judicial power.
while some of apple allegations against the monitor give pause,we are limited by both the record and our appellate jurisdiction.in view of those limitations,we review only the district court denial of the motion to disqualify the appointed monitor,and modifications of the injunction.we affirm,on the grounds that on the record then before the district court,it did not abuse discretion in declining to disqualify the monitor,and in light of this court intervening interpretation of the injunction,the terms of the injunction are not currently affected by modifications if any made by the district court.
background 
following a bench trial,the district court found apple liable for a violation of section of the sherman antitrust act.see united states apple,d.specifically,the district court found that five of the six largest publishers in the united states had entered a horizontal conspir acy with each other to eliminate retail price competition in order to raise prices,and that apple,which was considering entry as a retailer,violated section by facilitating and executing that conspiracy.id.at.that ruling is currently on appeal before another panel of this court.
on september,the district court entered an omnibus order,styled plaintiff united states final judgment and plaintiff states order entering permanent injunction the injunction.two sections of the injunction are relevant to this appeal apple is required to adopt policies and training to promote its compliance with the antitrust laws deferred appendix and an external compliance monitor is to be appointed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,to review and evaluate apple adoption of the required policies and training d.in addition,the injunction granted apple leave to file with the district court written objections to the monitor conduct and to his recommendations,provided that apple first raised these objections with the plaintiffs.
the injunction specified that the plaintiffs the department of justice,states,the district of columbia,and the commonwealth of puerto rico would recommend monitor candidates to the district court.apple,meanwhile,was not permitted to recommend a candidate without the agreement of the plaintiffs though apple had an opportunity to object to the plaintiffs recommendations.the plaintiffs recommended michael bromwich as monitor,and the district court appointed him on october.
the relationship between bromwich and apple,which got off to a contentious start,raises three salient issues 
apple argues that bromwich opened inquiries prematurely.the injunction called upon the monitor to assess whether apple internal antitrust compliance policies and procedures,as they exist days after his or her appointment,are reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the antitrust laws.apple interpreted this provision as restricting bromwich role during the first days of his appointment,until january,when the policies subject to his scrutiny were yet to be formulated.bromwich responded that he understood from his ex parte conversations with the district judge that he was to get off to a fast start,and that he gave that impression far more weight than the aspects of the district court record on which apple relied.thus,bromwich began his inquiries within six days after his appointment four business days,requesting interviews with members of apple board of directors.
he encountered from apple counsel as to the timing and scope of the inquiries,and by the sixteenth calendar day after his appointment,bromwich began to accuse apple of fail ing to provide any of the materials it had promised and stalling in the scheduling of brief preliminary interviews with officers and directors.
the friction between bromwich and apple counsel prompted bromwich to complain of,and induced him to write directly to apple officers,proposing that they communicate with bromwich directly,without the protection of counsel.apple argues that the complaints were unfounded especially given the day period allowed for formulating the policy that bromwich was to monitor and that the effort to peel away counsel was improper for an agent of the court.
this is what happened.on november,bromwich wrote a letter to apple chief executive officer,timothy cook,and to its senior vice president and general counsel,bruce sewell,proposing to establish a line of communication with the senior managers.as bromwich later explained,he wrote the letter because he already had become concerned that the company was using its outside counsel as a shield.id.on november,bromwich wrote directly to cook and the members of apple board of directors,decrying the confrontational and obstructionist approach apple has adopted in the first month of our relationship,and urging them to p romote a positive,direct relationship between the company liaisons and the monitoring team that is unfiltered through outside counsel.the effort to exclude counsel continued as bromwich began interviewing apple directors on december,bromwich told a director that his role as monitor required him to crawl into a company and that apple must take down barriers to his access.he urged the same director to maintain direct contact with the monitorship team,referencing the fact that his past monitorships had not involved outside counsel at all.id.as even the plaintiffs concede,bromwich was expecting from apple the level of submissiveness that he had found in past monitorship engagements,which had all resulted from consent decrees rather than from adverse judgments.bromwich was thus unprepared for the formal and adversarial context of a monitorship imposed over the objection of the monitored party 
apple also took issue with bromwich fees.the injunction requires apple to pay the monitor fees on such terms and conditions as the plaintiffs approve.thus the fee paid to an agent of the court was effectively set by a plaintiff for payment by the defendant.apple did not raise a specific objection to this arrangement when it was originally proposed.at the same time,the arrangement put considerable stress on the adversarial system,and consequences ensued.
bromwich proposed to bill apple per hour plus a fifteen percent administrative fee.he proposed lesser rates for other members of what he was assembling as his team,including per hour for an antitrust lawyer to supply an expertise that the antitrust monitor lacked.id.
in an exchange of letters in november,apple called the fee unreasonable and.bromwich defended the reasonableness of the fee and disputed whether apple had standing to register the objection in the first place the fees and expenses to be paid to the monitor and his team are not set by apple they are set by the monitor,with approval reserved for the doj and the plaintiff states.within the first two weeks after his appointment,bromwich had billed,fueling apple allegation that bromwich had jumped the gun to maximize a commercial opportunity.
these disputes culminated in a series of filings in the period november through january.the district court proposed on november to amend the injunction by,among other things,providing for ex parte briefings between the monitor and the district judge at least once a month.apple objected,and raised some additional objections related to the monitorship,including that the court lacked jurisdiction to modify the injunction while apple appeal of the final judgment was pending that the proposed modifications exceeded the district court appointment power under rule that the proposed modifications would contravene the constitutional separation of powers by allowing ex parte communications between bromwich and the plaintiffs at the same time as allowing ex parte communications between bromwich and the district court that the district court should not receive ex parte communications from bromwich while it continued to preside over related antitrust litigation against apple that bromwich fees were excessive,perverted bromwich incentives,and deprived apple of a disinterested monitor and that bromwich had exceeded the authority he was given in the injunction.
following apple objections,the district court agreed to forgo ex parte communications with the monitor.as to apple other grievances,the district court generally note d that the injunction provides that the monitor shall serve on such terms and conditions as the department of justice,after consultation with the plaintiff states,approves and explained that t he monitor compensation is to be on reasonable and customary terms.the district court also reminded apple that it had available a process for objecting to the monitor actions,namely filing written objections with the court after consultation with the plaintiffs.
on december,apple moved the district court by order to show cause for a stay of the injunction pending appeal.the plaintiffs opposition papers cited a declaration of bromwich,which was simultaneously filed with the court by the plaintiffs.apple then requested that the district court disqualify bromwich from serving as monitor,based on what apple called h is wholly inappropriate declaration in an adversarial proceeding.on january,the district court denied both the stay motion and the disqualification motion.see united states apple,d.in doing so,however,the district court attempted to resolve some of apple underlying grievances,such as by noting that the injunction explicitly permits apple officers,employees or agents to have counsel present during any interviews.id.at.
this appeal followed.apple notice of appeal explains its intention to challenge the january order as well as modifications to the injunction.
the present appeal was the predicate for apple motion in this court for a stay pending appeal.a prior panel denied the stay on february,relying on concessions that the plaintiffs had made in connection with the stay motion.the plaintiffs had explicitly stated that the district court order should be interpreted narrowly.motion order,at.no stay was deemed necessary because there was by then no dispute that the extent of the monitor responsibility is to assess the appropriateness of the compliance programs adopted by apple and the means used to communicate those programs to its personnel,and that the injunction would not allow the monitor to investigate whether such personnel were in fact complying with the antitrust or other laws.id.accordingly,the monitor was empowered to demand only documents relevant to his authorized responsibility as so defined,and to interview apple directors,officers,and employees only on subjects relevant to that responsibility.id.
the panel relied on that narrow interpretation of the injunction,tak ing plaintiffs counsel statement as a formal representation that plaintiffs also accept that interpretation,and that the monitor will conduct his activities within the bounds so delimited.id.this narrow interpretation of the injunction is now the law of the case.
apple also moved this court to supplement the appellate record with documents concerning the monitor activities,including his billing records.this motion was denied.
discussion 
consideration of this appeal is circumscribed by our limited jurisdiction.in cases involving a protracted remedial phase,we may review substantive orders.united states yonkers bd.of,cir per curiam citing firestone tire rubber risjord,milliken bradley.we also have jurisdiction over i nterlocutory orders continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.a.however,when the challenge is to an implicit rather than explicit modification,we have jurisdiction only i f we conclude that such a modification has occurred,and that the order of the district court might have a serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.eeoc local,int l ass of bridge,structural ornamental iron workers,cir quoting carson am.brands.we therefore have appellate jurisdiction to review i the denial of apple motion to disqualify michael bromwich as monitor and ii any implicit modification of the injunction having serious consequences.the notice of appeal that gave rise to this appeal expressed apple intent to challenge only the rulings in the district court january,order and modifications to the injunction so we lack jurisdiction in this appeal to review the facial legality of the injunction as it was entered by the district court.see new phone city of new york,cir o ur jurisdiction is limited by the wording of the notice of appeal.
as an appointee of the court pursuant to rule,the monitor is subject to the same grounds for disqualification as would require disqualification of a judge under.a.disqualification is necessary when among other situations his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,a he has a personal bias or prejudice,id.b or he has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy,id.b.
a district court denial of a motion to disqualify is reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re basciano,cir.given this deferential standard,and the limited record before the district court at the time it denied apple motion to disqualify bromwich,we can not conclude that the denial was error.
apple principal arguments for bromwich disqualification are based on his ex parte communications and collaboration with the plaintiffs the record reflects one significant instance of such collaboration bromwich coordinated with the plaintiffs in their opposition to apple stay motion in the district court,and submitted an affidavit as an integral part of the opposition papers.the plaintiffs brief in opposition,filed on the same day as the declaration,cites to it.the district court found that the declaration was bromwich opportunity to respond after apple made factual assertions that were critical of bromwich work,and was not evidence of bias or prejudice against apple.
it is certainly remarkable that an arm of the court would litigate on the side of a party in connection with an application to the court he serves.the commentary on rule discourages any ex parte communication between a court appointee and a party,noting that i n most settings,ex parte communications with the parties should be discouraged or prohibited by the district court.b advisory committee notes to the amendment.moreover,bromwich submission in conjunction with a litigant brief was the opposite of best practice for a monitor.a judicial officer should prefer to file documents independently when such an option is available,and not through one party or another.nevertheless,our concerns regarding bromwich declaration are procedural rather than substantive.apple does not argue that a problem would have arisen if he had filed the same declaration either on his own behalf or at the invitation of the district court and without coordinating with the plaintiffs.
the manner in which the declaration was filed,and the fact that it was preceded by at least some ex parte communications with the plaintiffs,however,may raise an appearance of partiality and an appearance of impropriety,liljeberg health serv.acquisition.at the same time,rule expressly contemplates the possibility of ex parte communications with a monitor and here,the injunction its
