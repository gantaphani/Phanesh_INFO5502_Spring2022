appellants people choice wireless,and cellular depot,sued respondent verizon wireless verizon for unfair competition pursuant to business and professions code section on behalf of themselves and similarly situated independent dealers of cellular telephones collectively,the independent dealers.in their first amended complaint the complaint,the independent dealers alleged that verizon engaged in unfair competition by refusing to sell popular new cellular telephone models to the independent dealers during an extended holdback period and selling cellular telephones to customers below cost in certain circumstances when the independent dealers could not afford to compete.according to the independent dealers,the trial court erred when it sustained verizon demurrer without leave to amend.we have reviewed the complaint and the law and find no error.
the complaint 
the independent dealers alleged 
because cellular telephones are expensive,service providers such as verizon sell them below cost if a consumer agrees to purchase telephone service for a set period of time,usually one to three years.similarly,service providers often subsidize the cost if a customer wishes to upgrade to a new cellular telephone.verizon sells cellular telephones through its wholly owned retail stores and retail stores operated by the independent dealers.
at verizon request,companies such as motorola,nokia and sony manufacture cellular telephone models that are solely compatible with verizon telephone network.the manufacturers agree to sell new models to verizon on an exclusive basis for a specified period of time,normally three to six months the exclusive period.during the exclusive period,the independent dealers can not purchase new models from the manufacturers,but they can purchase new models directly from verizon.most consumer sales occur within the exclusive period during the first one to two months of when a new model is released.
the independent dealers match the prices being charged for cellular telephones in the verizon stores.above and beyond that,the independent dealers provide customers who purchase a cellular telephone with several useful accessories,such as headsets or carrying cases,at no additional cost.if a customer wanted to purchase these same accessories at a verizon store,the customer would have to pay extra.by providing free accessories to their customers,the independent dealers undercut verizon prices and create price competition.
in the past,within the exclusive period,verizon imposed a holdback period on its most popular new cellular telephones models.during this holdback period,verizon released its most popular new models to verizon retail stores but not to the independent dealers.as a result,the independent dealers could not sell the most popular new models of verizon cellular telephones for the first two weeks of their release.then,when the motorola was released for sale,verizon extended the holdback period to two months.for the blackberry,verizon extended the holdback for a period of time that exceeded four months and was continuing as of the date the complaint was filed.verizon claims that the holdback period is necessary for quality control.the true purpose is to ensure that verizon retail stores obtain the majority of sales for popular new models.verizon heavily advertises the availability of popular new models during the holdback period.once the holdback period ends,verizon advertising ceases almost entirely.the independent dealers depend on new model sales for a majority of their income and are adversely impacted by the holdback period.moreover,if they were given access to the models subject to the holdback period on the same terms as the verizon stores,they would match verizon prices,offer free accessories and undercut verizon prices.as a practical matter,the holdback period prevents price competition and is therefore violative of section et.
until recently,verizon commission structure placed the independent dealers on an equal footing with verizon wholly owned retail stores.verizon subsidized the cost of new cellular telephones only for those customers who had fulfilled at least one year of their service contract.on a parallel basis,verizon authorized wholesale distributors paid a commission to the independent dealers whenever they obtained service contract renewals from customers who had fulfilled at least one year of their existing service contract.the independent dealers were able to use their service contract renewal commissions to partially offset the cost of new cellular telephones and then price those new models to match the prices being charged for the same models in verizon stores.in december,verizon began subsidizing all new cellular telephone sales,even sales to customers who had not fulfilled a least one year of their service contract.verizon did not,however,change its commission structure for the independent dealers.without commissions on sales to customers who fulfilled less than one year of their service contracts,the independent dealers can not subsidize the cost of new cellular telephones to those customers.verizon commission structure reduces intrabrand competition,discriminates against the independent dealers,and amounts to unfair competition.
the demurrer and this appeal 
verizon demurred to the complaint on the grounds,inter alia,that the allegations did not satisfy the test set forth by communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and the independent dealers noticed this appeal.because there was no judgment,the clerk of the court of appeal informed the independent dealers that the court of appeal lacked jurisdiction.thereafter,in order to perfect appellate jurisdiction,the parties stipulated that the action was dismissed and judgment entered in favor of verizon.the stipulation was filed and the trial court ordered that it be given legal effect.
standard of review 
when a complaint has been disposed of via demurrer,our review is de novo.in other words,w e treat a demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.
discussion 
the holdback period.
according to the independent dealers,the allegations in count i of the complaint satisfy two of the three possible grounds for finding conduct between competitors to be considered unfair pursuant to our supreme court opinion in.we are unable to concur with this assessment.as we shall discuss below,the allegations fail to demonstrate either that verizon conduct violates the policy or spirit of the antitrust laws because the effect of the conduct is comparable to or the same as a violation of the antitrust laws,or it otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition,supra,cal th at,d.while expediting our duties,we have kept the following principle uppermost in our reasoning.injury to a competitor is not equivalent to injury to competition only the latter is the proper focus of antitrust laws.citations,supra,cal th at,d.
violation of antitrust policies.
to kick off their argument,the independent dealers solicit a comparison of this case to a case,eastman kodak image technical services,d eastman kodak.verizon parries with the contention that,with few exceptions,a company owes no duty to help anyone and is free to deal or not deal with a competitive rival.
indeed,verizon is on target with the general rule.nearly a century ago,the supreme court recognized that,subject to antitrust laws such as the sherman act there is a long recognized right of a trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business,freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.united states colgate company.colgate.that theme has continued life.see dimidowich bell howell cir,stating that a manufacturer may choose those with whom it wishes to deal and unilaterally may refuse to deal with a distributor or customer for business reasons without running afoul of the antitrust laws.
recently,we were treated to the supreme court scholarship on the matter when it revisited colgate and the sherman act to once again place its intellectual brackets on our land antitrust law.see verizon communications law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d verizon communications.the supreme court explained that the opportunity to charge monopoly least for a short what attracts business acumen in the first place it induces risk taking that produces innovation and economic growth.id.at.diligent companies,of course,are in a position to gain monopoly power by building an infrastructure that allows them to excel in business.upon noting this market reality,the court segued into the following observation compelling such companies to share the source of their advantage is in some tension with the underlying purpose of antitrust law,since it may lessen the incentive for the monopolist,the rival,or both to invest in those economically beneficial facilities.enforced sharing also requires antitrust courts to act as central planners,identifying the proper price,quantity,and other terms of role for which they are.id.at.for this reason,the general rule expressed in colgate remains a major policy point.
by the same token,the verizon communications court explained that refusal to deal is not an unqualified right.verizon communications,supra,at.still,the court has been very cautious in recognizing exceptions to colgate,because of the uncertain virtue of forced sharing and the difficulty of identifying and remedying anticompetitive conduct by a single company.ibid.in the view of the supreme court,the leading case for liability based on refusal to deal is aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d aspen skiing,a cased cited in the independent dealers briefs.in aspen skiing,there was a ski locale comprised of four mountain areas.the defendant owned three of those areas,and the plaintiff owned one.for years,they cooperated by issuing joint,ski tickets.when the plaintiff refused to give the defendant a greater share of the proceeds,the defendant canceled the joint tickets.the plaintiff tried unsuccessfully to recreate the joint tickets,even offering to buy the defendant tickets at retail price.the supreme court upheld the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff,concluding that the jury may well have found that the defendant was more interested in reducing competition than obtaining the benefits of the joint tickets.verizon communications,supra,at.but the verizon communications court highlighted the fact that aspen skiing is at or near the outer boundary of title united states code section liability.verizon communications,supra,at.
now that we are done with our preliminaries,we bring eastman kodak to the fore.the book on that case goes like this.kodak was in the business of providing service and parts for its office equipment to its customers.it produced some of the parts itself,and the rest were made to order by independent manufacturers oems.in the early,independent service organizations isos started repairing and servicing kodak equipment.as well,they sold parts and reconditioned kodak machines.soon thereafter,kodak adopted a policy of limiting the availability of parts to the isos.it sold replacement parts for micrographic and copying machines only to buyers of kodak equipment who also purchased service from kodak for any repair of those machines.there were a variety of corollaries.kodak and the oems agreed that the oems would not sell parts to anyone but kodak.through pressure,kodak convinced kodak equipment owners and independent parts distributors to stop selling kodak parts to the isos.last,kodak implemented a plan to prevent others from obtaining used kodak machines.the intent behind kodak machinations regarding parts was to inhibit the isos ability to sell service for kodak machines.eastman kodak,supra,at.
the isos sued under the sherman act,claiming that kodak had unlawfully tied the sale of service for kodak machines to the sale of parts,in violation of title united states code section,and had unlawfully monopolized and attempted to monopolize the sale of service for kodak machines,in violation of title united states code section eastman kodak,supra,at.the district court granted summary judgment for kodak,and the matter was reversed on appeal.
because the independent dealers do not allege a tying agreement,we focus on the portion of eastman kodak that discusses section of the sherman act.in affirming the reversal,the supreme court noted that the offense of monopoly under section of the sherman act has two elements the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.citation.eastman kodak,supra,at.the fact that kodak controlled nearly percent of the parts market and percent to percent of the service market,with no readily available substitutes,was sufficient to suggest the existence of monopoly power.kodak complained that,as a matter of law,a single brand of a product or service can never be a relevant market under the sherman act.the court disagreed.the relevant market for antitrust purposes is determined by the choices available to kodak equipment owners.citation.because service and parts for kodak equipment are not interchangeable with other manufacturers service and parts,the relevant market from the kodak equipment owner perspective is composed of only those companies that service kodak machines citation.this court prior cases support the proposition that in some instances one brand of a product can constitute a separate market.citations.the proper market definition in this case can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the commercial realities faced by consumers.citation.eastman,supra,at,fns.omitted.in a footnote,the court explained that united states du pont,did not foreclose single brands from being a market.rather,it merely held that one brand does not necessarily constitute a relevant market if substitutes are available.citations.eastman kodak,supra,at,fn.
with respect to the second element,which required the use of monopoly power to foreclose competition,to gain a competitive advantage,or to destroy a competitor,the court stated that there was a triable issue if kodak adopted its parts and service policies as part of a scheme of willful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power.eastman kodak,supra,at.though kodak offered justifications for its exclusionary policy,the court found triable issues as to whether the justifications were valid and sufficient.id.at.
on remand,the jury found for the isos on the title united states code section claim.the ninth circuit affirmed in image tech.services,eastman kodak cir image tech.in doing so,the court detailed the substantial evidence that supported the jury finding that kodak used its monopoly over parts in order to gain a monopoly over the service of kodak equipment.id.at.the court elucidated the controlling law thusly section of the sherman act prohibits a monopolist unilateral action,like kodak refusal to deal,if that conduct harms the competitive process in the absence of a legitimate business justification.citations.image,supra,at.
jumping into the appellate fray,the independent dealers aver that the facts alleged in the complaint are strikingly similar to those in eastman kodak and image tech.because the isos were forced to purchase all of their replacement parts from kodak,and the independent dealers were forced to purchase new verizon cellular telephones from verizon and like kodak,which willingly sold replacement parts to the isos and then stopped,verizon always had a holdback period and then suddenly and unfairly lengthened that period.
to be frank,a skepticism was born with this forced analogy.the two cases are decidedly dissimilar.the relevant market in eastman kodak was defined by a single brand of service,it was composed of companies that serviced kodak machines because there were no available substitutes.kodak had a monopoly in the parts market and used it to monopolize the service market.in contrast,the relevant market here is comprised of all cellular telephones,and there is no allegation that verizon has monopolized that market,or any related market.customers change service providers,options,calling plans and cellular telephones on a regular basis.there are service providers other than verizon,such as and cingular,and there are manufacturers,such as motorola,nokia and sony,which all sell cellular telephones.moreover,the independent dealers do not claim that they,like the isos,have been permanently cut off from a whole brand of products,or that consumers will be forced to purchase cellular telephones only from verizon.rather,they merely contend that they are denied the ability to sell the most popular new verizon models,only two of which are identified by the complaint,for a finite period of time.it can be inferred from the complaint that their ability to sell other brands is unfettered,and consumers still have a wide variety of choices of what and where to buy.finally,whereas competition in the relevant market in eastman kodak was diminished,there is no equivalent allegation here.the independent dealers complain about the diminution of intrabrand price competition,rather than the diminution of market competition.in other words,all they can say is that there is less price competition for verizon cellular telephones,not that there is less price competition among all the different cellular telephone brands.given this,it can not be said that the effect of verizon conduct is comparable to or the same as a violation of the antitrust laws.in fact,a logical deduction from the complaint is that even though the independent dealers can not undercut verizon prices on popular new verizon cellular telephone models during the holdback period,they can still undercut verizon prices with respect to the competing brand models acquired from manufacturers and other service providers.
in essence,the independent dealers want to force verizon to immediately release its most popular new models and thereby share the source of its advantage.verizon communications,supra,at.but,unless there is an exception,the right to refuse to deal remains sacrosanct.because that is true,the mere refusal to deal does not violate the spirit or policy of antitrust law.in the absence of an abuse of monopoly power in a relevant market,this case involves nothing more than a permissible refusal to deal with the independent dealers.
boiled down,the independent dealers position is that the trial court failed to properly balance colgate against other antitrust policies.in their reply brief,the independent dealers advert to the following supreme court quote congress designed the sherman act as a consumer welfare prescription.citation.a restraint that has the effect of reducing the importance of consumer preference in setting price and output is not consistent with this fundamental goal of antitrust law.restrictions on price and output are the paradigmatic examples of restraints of trade that the sherman act was intended to prohibit.citation.ncaa board of regents of of,d,fn.omitted.using this language as a springboard,the independent dealers declare that price competition is the single most important public policy goal furthered by the antitrust laws.what the independent dealers fail to appreciate is that antitrust policy attempts to balance the benefits of protecting and fostering economic incentives for entrepreneurs to pursue business with the benefits procured for consumers when courts manage markets.in our view,the trial court found the right balance when it sustained verizon demurrer without leave to amend.because we are dealing with a limited time restriction on some cellular telephones of one of many brands in a vibrant,volatile market with many consumer options,we take special heed of the warning in verizon communications that we should be cautious before creating exceptions to the conduct allowed by colgate.
it is true,as the independent dealers take pains to stress,that does not require an antitrust violation in order to state a section claim.but we must still look at the alleged impact of the conduct,and we must consider any countervailing policies.the allegations here are simply too far removed from cognizable antitrust evils to warrant intervention by a california court.
significant threat or harm to competition.
the independent dealers argument regarding the threat or harm to competition is set forth in the following three sentences here,verizon conduct indisputably reduces both consumer choice and price competition.it reduces consumer choice by choking off one of the avenues of distribution of verizon products.more significantly,it prevents the independent dealers from selling cellular telephones at a discount.after parsing this argument,we find it lacking.
we do not perceive a threat or harm to competition which can be characterized as significant.as explained in part,ante,there may be a reduction in intrabrand competition regarding some verizon cellular telephones for short periods of time,but there is no reduction in interbrand competition.the continuing interbrand competition from manufacturers and other service providers offers consumers a healthy array of choices and the benefit of price competition.what shines through most clearly in the complaint is that verizon conduct has injured the independent dealers.but,as teaches,injury to competitors is not the same thing as injury to competition,and we may only consider the latter.
the commission structure.
count ii fails to state a claim under section.
in part,the problem is that the meaning of count ii is murky.in their prayer for relief in the complaint,the independent dealers requested an injunction prohibiting verizon from permitting customers to upgrade their cellular telephones at verizon owned stores if they have not fulfilled at least one year of their service contract,which injunction shall continue in force unless and until verizon adjusts its commission structure in such a manner as to permit the independent dealers to subsidize the cellular telephone purchases of those customers who have not fulfilled at least one year of their service contract.
essentially,the independent dealers paint the following picture.in the past,when a verizon customer wanted a new cellular telephone,verizon would sell that cellular telephone below cost if the customer had fulfilled a year of his or her existing service contract.the only way the independent dealers could compete was to get a customer who had fulfilled a year of his or her existing service contract to renew that contract and then use the commission from that renewal to offset the cost of the new cellular telephone.when verizon began selling all new cellular telephones below cost,the independent dealers were unable to compete in situations in which they did not receive a renewal commission.to remedy this situation,the independent dealers want a court to prohibit customers from upgrading their cellular telephones at verizon stores until after they fulfill at least a year of their service contracts.oddly,this would make it unlawful for verizon to sell cellular telephones to some of their own customers.also,it would mean that those customers could only get upgrades through the independent dealers or the manufacturers.according to the independent dealers,this injunction should last until such time as verizon devises a commission structure that allows the independent dealers to sell verizon cellular telephones below cost to all customers,not just those who have fulfilled a year of their service contracts.
the bottom line is the independent dealers want to prevent verizon from discounting in situations where they themselves can not discount.this means that if the independent dealers can not share in the wealth,they want a court to force certain verizon customers to pay higher prices.what antitrust policy would be at play here the independent dealers do not say,and
