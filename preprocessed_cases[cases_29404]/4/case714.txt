the medical board of california appeals from a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate commanding it to set aside a citation it issued to william steinsmith.we reverse.
steinsmith is a board licensed physician who performed disability evaluations of persons referred by the california department of social services at the bay view medical clinic clinic in san francisco beginning in.steinsmith was an independent contractor of the clinic and the sole physician working there.he was cited by the board in october for aiding the unlicensed practice of medicine in violation of business and professions code section the basis for the citation was that he worked at the clinic when he knew that it was partially owned by two individuals,constancio yu and mary downes,who did administrative work for the clinic and were not licensed physicians.
the prohibition against practicing medicine without a license extends to any person who advertises or holds himself or herself out as practicing medicine,which is defined broadly to include among other things the diagnosis of ailments,diseases,injuries,or the physical or mental condition of any person.medicine may be practiced in a partnership or group of physicians,but c orporations and other artificial legal entities have no professional rights,privileges,or powers,and a permit to operate a facility called a medical clinic can be issued only if the clinic is wholly owned by licensed physicians,subd.b.
steinsmith was fined and ordered to cease and desist from further violations of this nature.he appealed the citation and requested an administrative hearing.
at the hearing,board investigator charles mccort and consultant martha snider testified that steinsmith told them at a september conference on another matter that the clinic was owned by yu,a physician who was not licensed in this state.mccort said he told steinsmith that he believed steinsmith employment by unlicensed individuals was unlawful.mccort had a second meeting with steinsmith in december.at that time steinsmith said that the clinic was owned by yu and downes,who were unlicensed.
mccort discovered that adelo aquino,a physician who lived out of state,was listed as the clinic owner on its fictitious name permit.yu informed mccort that the business was owned percent by aquino,percent by yu,and percent by downes.in june and july,yu and aquino wrote mccort and stated that they were unaware before he contacted them that this ownership arrangement was unlawful,but had confirmed the illegality with counsel and were closing the clinic.their counsel advised mccort that the clinic had been sold.steinsmith testified that the clinic was sold in july to nazshakir,a licensed physician.
steinsmith said that he had worked with complete clinical autonomy at the clinic since,and that of the thousands of patients i examined and reported on,not in a single instance did i commit an irregularity or a bad faith act.he said that he was unaware before september of the requirement that medical practices be solely owned by california licensed physicians,and was shocked to receive that interpretation at the conference with mccort and snider.he said that,until september,the fictitious name permit on the clinic wall had given him a certain assurance that i was in the affection and embrace of the state government.
steinsmith testified that he continued working at the clinic after september because he questioned mccort and snider legal opinion and the public policy behind the law.he felt that this interpretation on their part was not an accurate one and was poor public policy,and that they were not attorneys,i was an attorney,and that i decided i would weather this out and risk a prosecution because i thought the continuation of my work there had a certain importance,and that,of course,has brought me to the present proceedings.he added i was convinced i was doing a good and important work.i was attempting to go draw a circle around the applicants who were really disabled and to ensure that they did get their benefits and so on.i did want that disrupted because of formalities or because i was cowering to a formal legal opinion which i did believe in,in the first place.
steinsmith public policy objections to the board position were illuminated in questions to mccort concerning correspondence mccort received from steinsmith during his investigation.mccort testified that three or four months before the investigation was concluded,steinsmith sent him a board action report indicating that it was illegal for licensed physicians to work for unlicensed people who owned medical clinics.on,steinsmith asked mccort if he had received a mailing from me where i editorialize on a statement in the action report of the medical board,which was published on october.steinsmith handed mccort two documents,a board action report of october explaining the board position that medical work for unlicensed individuals was illegal,along with a typewritten note on steinsmith letterhead,and asked mccort to confirm that he had received them.
the action report cited sections and previously quoted,and explained that the ban on corporate practice is intended to prevent interference with the relationship by a corporation or other unlicensed person and to ensure that medical decisions are made by a licensed physician.t he physician should not be forced to choose between the dictates of his or her employer and the best interests of the physician patients.it is this potential for divided loyalties that the bar against corporate practice is intended to prevent.
the action report continued in the last several years,the board has initiated disciplinary action against physicians who allowed their licenses to be used by lay individuals or corporations.a physician can be disciplined for aiding and abetting unlicensed persons to practice medicine section.this constitutes unprofessional conduct,which may result in the ultimate sanction license revocation.in one particular case which resulted in discipline against a physician license,the lay corporation which was ostensibly a management company owned and operated clinics.the physician contracted with the management company and obtained the fictitious name permits for the clinics.the physician saw patients and performed surgery at one of the clinics about once a week.the medical records were the property of the management company and not the physician.the management company paid the physician a set percentage of the patient fees.in other words,the management company was really practicing medicine without a license and the physician had aided and abetted that unlicensed practice of medicine.
steinsmith typewritten note read as follows once upon a time there existed a capitalist republic in which the brigands of high finance had corrupted and enslaved the physicians in a plot to coin superprofit from the healthcaresystem.following a decade of wholesale engulfment by this conspiracy of the province of california,its cockamamie medical board was heard to snivel anent the transgressions of a handful of marginal sic with nary a peep about the multibillion hmos which were devouring the ethical profession 
mccort could not specifically remember these two documents but did not deny receiving them.he said he received numerous documents from steinsmith during his investigation.
mccort acknowledged seeing a valid fictitious name permit on the wall of the clinic in december.the administrative law judge alj asked the board counsel about the significance of the fictitious name permits that had been issued to the clinic.counsel indicated that when a physician like aquino states under penalty of perjury in the application for the permit that he is sole owner of the practice,the board generally accepts the representation and does no further inquiry apart from verifying the physician license.in this case,the ownership interests of the unlicensed individuals did not come to light until steinsmith disclosed them.counsel advised that aquino had been cited and fined for the violation.
in closing arguments at the hearing the board counsel acknowledged that steinsmith violation was de minimis in na
