respondent national football league nfl is an unincorporated association of separately owned professional football teams,also respondents here.the teams,each of which owns its own name,colors,logo,trademarks,and related intellectual property,formed respondent national football league properties nflp to develop,license,and market that property.at first,nflp granted nonexclusive licenses to petitioner and other vendors to manufacture and sell apparel.in december,however,the teams authorized nflp to grant exclusive licenses.nflp granted an exclusive license to respondent reebok international to produce and sell trademarked headwear for all teams.when petitioner license was not renewed,it filed this action alleging that the agreements between respondents violated the sherman act,of which makes e very contract,combination or,conspiracy,in restraint of trade illegal.respondents answered that they were incapable of conspiring within meaning because the nfl and its teams are,in antitrust law jargon,a single entity with respect to the conduct challenged.the district court granted respondents summary judgment,and the seventh circuit affirmed.
held the alleged conduct related to licensing of intellectual property constitutes concerted action that is not categorically beyond coverage.
a the meaning of contract,combination,or,conspiracy in of the sherman act is informed by the act basic distinction between concerted and independent action.copperweld independence tube.section treat s concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior,at,because,unlike independent action,c oncerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk insofar as it deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands,at.and because concerted action is discrete and distinct,a limit on such activity leaves untouched a vast amount of business conduct.that creates less risk of deterring a firm necessary conduct and leaves courts to examine only discrete agreements.an arrangement must therefore embody concerted action in order to be a contract,combination or,conspiracy under.
b in determining whether there is concerted action under,the court has eschewed formalistic distinctions,such as whether the alleged conspirators are legally distinct entities,in favor of a functional consideration of how they actually operate.the court has repeatedly found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and served,in essence,as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity.see,united states sealy.conversely,the court has found that although the entities may be separate for purposes of incorporation or formal title,if they are controlled by a single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation of economic power,an agreement between them does not constitute a contract,combination or,conspiracy.copperweld,at.
c the relevant inquiry is therefore one of substance,not form,which does not turn on whether the alleged parties to contract,combination,or conspiracy are part of a legally single entity or seem like one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense.the inquiry is whether the agreement in question joins together separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,copperweld,at,such that it deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,at,and therefore of diversity of entrepreneurial interests and thus of actual or potential competition.if it does,then there is concerted action covered by,and the court must decide whether the restraint of trade is unreasonable and therefore illegal.
d the nfl teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic of independent action.each of them is a substantial,independently owned,independently managed business,whose general corporate actions are guided or determined by separate corporate consciousnesses,and whose objectives are not common.copperweld,at.they compete with one another,not only on the playing field,but to attract fans,for gate receipts,and for contracts with managerial and playing personnel.see,brown pro football.directly relevant here,the teams are potentially competing suppliers in the market for intellectual property.when teams license such property,they are not pursuing the common interests of the whole league,but,instead,the interests of each corporation itself.copperweld,at.it is not dispositive,as respondents argue,that,by forming nflp,they have formed a single entity,akin to a merger,and market their nfl brands through a single outlet.although the nfl respondents may be similar in some sense to a single enterprise,they are not similar in the relevant functional sense.while teams have common interests such as promoting the nfl brand,they are still separate,entities,and their interests in licensing team trademarks are not necessarily aligned.nor does it matter that the teams may find the alleged cooperation necessary to compete against other forms of entertainment.although decisions made by nflp are not as easily classified as concerted activity,the nflp decisions about licensing the teams separately owned intellectual property are concerted activity and thus covered by for the same reason that decisions made directly by the teams are covered by.in making the relevant licensing decisions,nflp is an instrumentality of the teams.sealy,at.
e football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by antitrust law.the fact that the nfl teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable,and that they must cooperate to produce games,provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions.because some of these restraints on competition are necessary to produce the nfl product,the rule of reason generally should apply,and teams cooperation is likely to be permissible.and depending upon the activity in question,the rule of reason can at times be applied without detailed analysis.but the activity at issue in this case is still concerted activity covered for purposes.
reversed and remanded.
stevens,delivered the opinion for a unanimous court.
american needle,petitioner national football league et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice stevens delivered the opinion of the court.
every contract,combination in the form of a trust or otherwise,or,conspiracy,in restraint of trade is made illegal by of the sherman act,ch,stat,as amended.the question whether an arrangement is a contract,combination,or conspiracy is different from and antecedent to the question whether it unreasonably restrains trade.this case raises that antecedent question about the business of the teams in the national football league nfl and a corporate entity that they formed to manage their intellectual property.we conclude that the nfl licensing activities constitute concerted action that is not categorically beyond the coverage of.the legality of that concerted action must be judged under the rule of reason.
originally organized in,the nfl is an unincorporated association that now includes separately owned professional football teams each team has its own name,colors,and logo,and owns related intellectual property.like each of the other teams in the league,the new orleans saints and the indianapolis colts,for example,have their own distinctive names,colors,and marks that are well known to millions of sports fans.
prior to,the teams made their own arrangements for licensing their intellectual property and marketing trademarked items such as caps and jerseys.in,the teams formed national football league properties nflp to develop,license,and market their intellectual property.most,but not all,of the substantial revenues generated by nflp have either been given to charity or shared equally among the teams.however,the teams are able to and have at times sought to withdraw from this arrangement.
between and,nflp granted nonexclusive licenses to a number of vendors,permitting them to manufacture and sell apparel bearing team insignias.petitioner,american needle,was one of those licensees.in december,the teams voted to authorize nflp to grant exclusive licenses,and nflp granted reebok international an exclusive license to manufacture and sell trademarked headwear for all teams.it thereafter declined to renew american needle nonexclusive license.
american needle filed this action in the northern district of illinois,alleging that the agreements between the nfl,its teams,nflp,and reebok violated and of the sherman act.in their answer to the complaint,the defendants averred that the teams,nfl,and nflp were incapable of conspiring within the meaning of because they are a single economic enterprise,at least with respect to the conduct challenged.app.after limited discovery,the district court granted summary judgment on the question whether,with regard to the facet of their operations respecting exploitation of intellectual property rights,the nfl and its teams are,in the jargon of antitrust law,acting as a single entity.american needle,new orleans.saints,supp.the court concluded that in that facet of their operations they have so integrated their operations that they should be deemed a single entity rather than joint ventures cooperating for a common purpose.ibid.
the court of appeals for the seventh circuit affirmed.the panel observed that in some contexts,a league seems more aptly described as a single entity immune from antitrust scrutiny,while in others a league appears to be a joint venture between independently owned teams that is subject to review under.relying on circuit precedent,the court limited its inquiry to the particular conduct at issue,licensing of teams intellectual property.the panel agreed with petitioner that when making a determination,courts must examine whether the conduct in question deprives the marketplace of the independent sources of economic control that competition assumes.at.the court,however,discounted the significance of potential competition among the teams regarding the use of their intellectual property because the teams can function only as one source of economic power when collectively producing nfl football.at.the court noted that football itself can only be carried out jointly.see ibid.asserting that a single football team could produce a football game is a zen riddle who wins when a football team plays itself moreover,nfl teams share a vital economic interest in collectively promoting nfl football to compet e with other forms of entertainment.ibid.it thus follows,the court found,that only one source of economic power controls the promotion of nfl football,and it makes little sense to assert that each individual team has the authority,if not the responsibility,to promote the jointly produced nfl football.ibid.recognizing that nfl teams have license d their intellectual property collectively since,the court held that did not apply,at.
we granted certiorari.
as the case comes to us,we have only a narrow issue to decide whether the nfl respondents are capable of engaging in a contract,combination,or conspiracy as defined by of the sherman act,or,as we have sometimes phrased it,whether the alleged activity by the nfl respondents must be viewed as that of a single enterprise for purposes of.copperweld independence tube.
taken literally,the applicability of to every contract,combination or conspiracy could be understood to cover every conceivable agreement,whether it be a group of competing firms fixing prices or a single firm chief executive telling her subordinate how to price their company product.but even though,read literally,would address the entire body of private contract,that is not what the statute means.national soc.of professional engineers united states,see also texaco dagher,this court has not taken a literal approach to this language board of trade of chicago united states,reasoning that the term restraint of trade in can not possibly refer to any restraint on competition because e very agreement concerning trade,every regulation of trade,restrains.to bind,to restrain,is of their very essence not every instance of cooperation between two people is a potential contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade.
the meaning of the term contract,combination or conspiracy is informed by the basic distinction in the sherman act between concerted and independent action that distinguishes of the sherman act from.copperweld,at quoting monsanto service.section applies only to concerted action that restrains trade.section,by contrast,covers both concerted and independent action,but only if that action monopolize s,or threatens actual monopolization,copperweld,at,a category that is narrower than restraint of trade.monopoly power may be equally harmful whether it is the product of joint action or individual action.
congress used this distinction between concerted and independent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and compensate its victims,without chilling vigorous competition through ordinary business operations.the distinction also avoids judicial scrutiny of routine,internal business decisions.
thus,in congress treated concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior.at.this is so because unlike independent action,c oncerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk insofar as it deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.at.and because concerted action is discrete and distinct,a limit on such activity leaves untouched a vast amount of business conduct.as a result,there is less risk of deterring a firm necessary conduct courts need only examine discrete agreements and such conduct may be remedied simply through prohibition see areeda hovenkamp,at.concerted activity is thus judged more sternly than unilateral activity under,copperweld,at.for these reasons,prohibits any concerted action in restraint of trade or commerce,even if the action does not threate n monopolization,ibid.and therefore,an arrangement must embody concerted action in order to be a contract,combination or conspiracy under.
we have long held that concerted action under does not turn simply on whether the parties involved are legally distinct entities.instead,we have eschewed such formalistic distinctions in favor of a functional consideration of how the parties involved in the alleged anticompetitive conduct actually operate.
as a result,we have repeatedly found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and served,in essence,as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity.in united states sealy,for example,a group of mattress manufacturers operated and controlled sealy,a company that licensed the sealy trademark to the manufacturers,and dictated that each operate within a specific geographic area,at.the government alleged that the licensees and sealy were conspiring in violation of,and we agreed,at.we explained that w e seek the central substance of the situation and therefore we are moved by the identity of the persons who act,rather than the label of their hats.at.we thus held that sealy was not a separate entity,but an instrumentality of the individual manufacturers.at.in similar circumstances,we have found other formally distinct business organizations covered by.see,northwest wholesale stationers,pacific stationery printing,national collegiate athletic board of regents of of,ncaa united states topco associates,associated press united states,at frankfurter,concurring united states terminal railroad of louis,see also rock,corporate law through an antitrust lens,colum,discussing cases.we have similarly looked past the form of a legally single entity when competitors were part of professional or trade groups 
conversely,there is not necessarily concerted action simply because more than one legally distinct entity is involved.although,under a doctrine known as the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine,we once treated cooperation between legally separate entities as necessarily covered by,we now embark on a more functional analysis.
the roots of this functional analysis can be found in the very decision that established the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine.in united states yellow cab,we observed that corporate interrelationships are not determinitive of the applicability of the sherman act because the act is aimed at substance rather than form.at.we nonetheless held that cooperation between legally separate entities was necessarily covered by because an unreasonable restraint of trade may result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.see also joseph seagram sons.
the decline of the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine began in sunkist growers,winckler smith citrus products.in that case,several agricultural cooperatives that were owned by the same farmers were sued for violations of of the sherman act,at.applying a specific immunity provision for agricultural cooperatives,we held that the three cooperatives were in practical effect one organization,even though the controlling farmers have formally organized themselves into three separate legal entities.at.to hold otherwise,we explained,would be to impose grave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions that are of de minimis meaning and effect insofar as use of separate corporations had no economic significance.ibid.
next,in united states citizens southern nat.bank,a large bank,citizens and southern,formed a holding company that operated de facto suburban branch banks in the atlanta area through ownership of the maximum amount of stock in each local branch that was allowed by law,ownership of much of the remaining stock by parties friendly to,use by the suburban banks of the logogram and all of banking services,and close oversight of the operation and governance of the suburban banks.at footnote omitted.the government challenged the cooperation between the banks.in our analysis,we observed that corporate interrelationships are not determinative,at,looked to economic substance,and observed that because the sponsored banks were not set up to be competitors,did not compel them to compete.areeda hovenkamp,at see also citizens southern,at areeda,intraenterprise conspiracy in decline,harv.
we finally reexamined the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine in copperweld independence tube,and concluded that it was inconsistent with the basic distinction between concerted and independent action.at.considering it perfectly plain that an internal agreement to implement a single,unitary firm policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that was designed to police,at,we held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are incapable of conspiring with each other for purposes of of the sherman act,at.we explained that although a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are separate for the purposes of incorporation or formal title,they are controlled by a single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation of economic power.joint conduct by two such entities does not depriv e the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,at,and as a result,an agreement between them does not constitute a contract,combination or conspiracy for the purposes of 
as copperweld exemplifies,substance,not form,should determine whether a n entity is capable of conspiring under.at.this inquiry is sometimes described as asking whether the alleged conspirators are a single entity.that is perhaps a misdescription,however,because the question is not whether the defendant is a legally single entity or has a single name nor is the question whether the parties involved seem like one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense.the key is whether the alleged contract,combination,or conspiracy is concerted action that is,whether it joins together separate decisionmakers.the relevant inquiry,therefore,is whether there is a contract,combination or conspiracy amongst separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,at,such that the agreement deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,and therefore of diversity of entrepreneurial interests,fraser major league soccer,boudin,and thus of actual or potential competition,see freeman san diego of realtors,kozinski,rothery storage van atlas van line,cadc bork,see also areeda hovenkamp,at noting that the central evil addressed by sherman act is the elimin ation of competition that would otherwise exist 
thus,while the president and a vice president of a firm could and regularly do act in combination,their joint action generally is not the sort of combination that is intended to cover.such agreements might be described as really unilateral behavior flowing from decisions of a single enterprise.copperweld,at.nor,for this reason,does cover internally coordinated conduct of a corporation and one of its unincorporated divisions,at,because a division within a corporate structure pursues the common interests of the whole,and therefore coordination between a corporation and its division does not represent a sudden joining of two independent sources of economic power previously pursuing separate interests,at.nor,for the same reasons,is the coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary covered.see,at.they have a complete unity of interest and thus w ith or without a formal agreement,the subsidiary acts for the benefit of the parent,its sole shareholder.ibid.
because the inquiry is one of competitive reality,it is not determinative that two parties to an alleged violation are legally distinct entities.nor,however,is it determinative that two legally distinct entities have organized themselves under a single umbrella or into a structured joint venture.the question is whether the agreement joins together independent centers of decisionmaking.at.if it does,the entities are capable of conspiring under,and the court must decide whether the restraint of trade is an unreasonable and therefore illegal one.
the nfl teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic of independent action.each of the teams is a substantial,independently owned,and independently managed business.t heir general corporate actions are guided or determined by separate corporate consciousnesses,and t heir objectives are not common.copperweld,at see also north american soccer league nfl,discussing ways that the financial performance of each team,while related to that of the others,does not necessarily rise and fall with that of the others the teams compete with one another,not only on the playing field,but to attract fans,for gate receipts and for contracts with managerial and playing personnel.see brown pro football,sullivan nfl,grizzlies nfl,ncaa,at.
directly relevant to this case,the teams compete in the market for intellectual property.to a firm making hats,the saints and the colts are two potentially competing suppliers of valuable trademarks.when each nfl team licenses its intellectual property,it is not pursuing the common interests of the whole league but is instead pursuing interests of each corporation itself,copperweld,at teams are acting as separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,and each team therefore is a potential independent cente r of decisionmaking,at.decisions by nfl teams to license their separately owned trademarks collectively and to only one vendor are decisions that depriv e the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,and therefore of actual or potential competition.see ncaa,at,observing a possible violation if two separately owned companies sold their separate products through a single selling agent areeda hovenkamp,at obviously,the most significant competitive threats arise when joint venture participants are actual or potential competitors 
in defense,respondents argue that by forming nflp,they have formed a single entity,akin to a merger,and market their nfl brands through a single outlet.but it is not dispositive that the teams have organized and own a legally separate entity that centralizes the management of their intellectual property.an ongoing violation can not eva
