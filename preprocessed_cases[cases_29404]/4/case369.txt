nitro distributing,west palm convention services,netco,schmitz associates,and,collectively,appellants,appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment to alticor,amway corporation,and quixtar,collectively,amway dismissal of appellants racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico claims and various adverse discovery rulings.we affirm.
appellants were each distributors of amway marketing materials.in an earlier decision involving these parties,we explained amway unique business model.
amway,a multinational company with sales in excess of billion,sells a wide variety of products ranging from kitchen cleaner to jewelry to,in some countries,coffee and milk amway distributes its products via a network marketing method.under this method,a potential distributor must be sponsored into the company before he or she may sell amway products.the sponsor,the sponsor sponsor,and so on,are the upline for the new distributor.amway encourages distributors to establish a downline by sponsoring other distributors,and it awards bonuses based on the volume of both the distributors sales and the sales of their downline.amway calls this system the products business.
sponsors use motivational tools like tapes,lectures,and rallies,or business support materials bsms,to recruit new distributors and to encourage their downlines to sell as many products as possible.the tools business arose to meet the demand for motivational tools.
nitro,alticor,cir.the tools business operates in largely the same manner as the products business in that there are lines of sponsorship and each distributor develops a downline.in both businesses,sponsors are not to solicit another sponsor downline a sponsor typically sells products to his own downline,and downlines generally buy their sponsor products.additionally many of the companies in the tools business are owned by individuals in the products business.
until,dexter yager headed the largest line of sponsorship in the tools business.dexter yager had long been one of amway largest distributors,and he also owns internet,the exclusive supplier of bsms to all distributors in his downline.his son,jeff yager,is president of internet.in,four members of dexter yager gooch,bill childers,tim foley,and steve woods the founders decided they wanted to break away from internet and form their own bsm distribution system,which would become pro net.ken stewart,the owner of appellants nitro and west palm,chose to join this breakaway and pro net.global support services global became pro net exclusive supplier of bsms.appellants were downline distributors in the founders and dexter yager lines of sponsorship.
the founders contacted amway to discuss their desire to separate from internet.amway is accustomed to such separations and says that it often offers advice to assure a smooth transition and avoid disruption of its products business.sharon grider,amway counsel,and bob kerkstra,amway manager of distributor relations,expressed concern to the founders that the breakaway would be contentious.grider agreed to provide assistance to the founders,which included model bsm contracts and the amway antitrust primer.the primer warned that c ompeting bsm sellers,including those involved in customer disputes,must not agree to divide up customers and revenue,but that it may be appropriate to agree on how to separate bsm lines of sponsorship to resolve a dispute.the primer also recommended that the founders seek independent legal advice.
unattributed handwritten notes suggest that an amway steering committee was formed to manage the breakaway according to these notes,committee members included kerkstra,doug devos,other amway executives,and bill zeoli,who had previously worked as an outside consultant on amway behalf.the notes indicate that amway would not take sides and that its primary concerns were to.protect the little guy.maintain tool income for those who depend,and.make sure that amway revenue will not suffer.these notes and the record as a whole suggest that amway primary focus was on avoiding a negative impact on its products distribution business.
the founders asked zeoli for his assistance in negotiating the breakaway and considered him to be a neutral mediator.in july,zeoli left a voice message for the founders to report on the responsibility assignment you have given me.zeoli explained in the message that devos would not be involved in these negotiations,but that kerkstra would be involved because he was the authority over the rules and regulations.the purpose of the message was to notify the founders that jeff yager was willing to have a meeting with them.zeoli also suggested that the founders pay dexter yager a percentage of each tape sold by pro net,assuming that neither group downlines were raided by the other.
early in,the parties had many meetings to facilitate the breakaway.kerkstra remembers attending several meetings with both dexter and jeff yager and the founders to avoid injuring as many distributors involved as possible.kerkstra also acknowledged that if pricing was discussed at the meetings,he would have been there to hear it,but stated that amway would not discuss specific pricing regarding a product,such as internet and pro net bsms.gooch also remembered that bsm pricing and a payment to dexter yager were discussed at these meetings,but offered no further specifics 
during this period of negotiation,the founders sought and received confidential pin level and line of sponsorship information from amway.pin levels are a means of distinguishing top earners within a line of sponsorship.the founders requested this information to create a compensation plan for pro net that accurately reflected the productivity of each distributor within their lines of sponsorship.
a sticking point between the parties was the tools created by internet that featured founders,such as motivational audio tapes on which a founder was the primary speaker.the founders argued that these tapes were their property and should be given to them upon breaking away from internet.internet,and thereby jeff and dexter yager,insisted,however,that i t has been the understanding of the entire organization that in exchange for internet recording,editing,marketing,manufacturing,and distributing the tapes in single quantities that we own and supply this material.the parties eventually agreed that internet would supply the master versions of the tapes on condition that pro net pay a royalty fee of per tape to internet.additionally,each side agreed not to solicit the other downlines.the royalty payments continued through and totaled just over million.
the formation of pro net had negative consequences for appellants.though the parties disagree as to the direct cause,appellants experienced decreased sales and market share,and,in some cases,the failure of their business after pro net formation.appellants filed suit against amway,alleging that amway and pro net,and at times,internet,were involved in an antitrust conspiracy.appellants asserted that pro net was a sham corporation organized to allow amway to gain greater control over the bsm market.according to appellants,amway and pro net conspired to allocate customers and fix prices within the tools business in violation of the sherman antitrust act.appellants also alleged injurious falsehood,tortious interference,and violations of rico.
the district court granted summary judgment to amway,dismissing appellants claims of antitrust conspiracy,injurious falsehood,and tortious interference.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,amerinet,xerox,cir,and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.flegel christian hosp,cir.to survive a motion for summary judgment,appellants must establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact such that their claim should proceed to trial.matsushita indus,zenith radio,d.this standard requires more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.id.at.where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue for trial.id.
appellants argue that the district court misunderstood the nature and scope of the conspiracy when it granted summary judgment to amway on appellants antitrust claims.section provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is hereby declared to be illegal.see also,blomkest fertilizer,potash of saskatchewan,cir en banc section prohibits concerted action by two or more parties in the restraint of trade.i t was intended to prohibit only unreasonable restraints of trade.bus.elecs.sharp,d citing collegiate athletic ass bd.of regents of of oklahoma,d.appellants claims of and customer allocation agreements are among the most elementary violations.hammes aamco transmissions,cir,and are generally subject to a per se analysis.id.citing palmer brg of georgia,d.if an alleged restraint falls within the category of restraints subject to per se analysis,a plaintiff need not prove its anticompetitive effects.flegel,at emphasis added.
we conclude that appellants claims of antitrust conspiracy were appropriately dismissed.the record shows that appellants failed to exclude the possibility of independent action,have attempted to characterize vertical constraints as a horizontal restraint conspiracy,and have set forth factual allegations that do not demonstrate the existence of any unlawful restraint of trade.
even in per se cases,antitrust law limits the range of permissible inference from ambiguous evidence in a case.matsushita,at.thus,a party seeking damages for a violation must present evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action by the alleged.monsanto serv,d.independent action is not proscribed.id.at.this means that conduct that is as consistent with permissible activity as with illegal conspiracy does not,standing alone,support an inference of antitrust conspiracy.blomkest fertilizers,at citing matsushita,d.
appellants argue that they are not required to disprove independent action because they have provided direct evidence of amway involvement in an unlawful conspiracy.they contend that the requirement that independent action be excluded is limited to cases in which the plaintiff relies solely on circumstantial evidence.rossi standard roofing,cir under our jurisprudence,the matsushita standard only applies when the plaintiff has failed to put forth direct evidence of conspiracy.williamson oil philip morris usa,cir appearing to single out circumstantial evidence for the requirement that independent action be excluded as a possibility.
we apply monsanto and matsushita broadly,blomkest,at,and have not made such a distinction we require a showing of independent action,whether it be by circumstantial or direct evidence.see craftsmen limousine,ford motor,cir although it may be in the form of circumstantial evidence,a plaintiff must present some evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the alleged coconspirators acted independently.monsanto recognizes that either direct or circumstantial evidence may satisfy this requirement.at.although the presentation of direct evidence of an unlawful conspiracy will likely preclude a lawful explanation,it does not follow that the possibility of independent action need not be excluded when direct evidence is provided.
despite appellants claims of direct evidence of a conspiracy,the record suggests independent action by amway.as the district court found,amway was likely involved in the breakaway for the primary purpose of protecting its products business and perhaps secondarily as a means of limiting dexter yager influence over its products of which are admittedly lawful aims.much of the evidence presented by appellants as support for their conspiracy theory in fact supports amway independent role.the antitrust primer,legal assistance,model contracts,and suggestions that pro net seek outside counsel which it did all imply that amway was interested in pro net setting up a legitimate and sustainable enterprise.although appellants attempt to attach a sinister motive to kerkstra involvement,it appears that he was involved to ensure that amway rules were followed.that amway was interested in keeping the peace or,as appellants stress,avoiding a war,does not necessitate the finding of the use of unlawful means.if pro net was involved in unlawful activities or was even an unlawful enterprise in itself,no evidence presented suggests that amway was aware of this illegality,let alone acting with pro net to this end.
appellants acknowledge that amway was motivated by its desire to protect its products business and weaken dexter yager control,but they argue that amway motivation to join the conspiracy should not be confused with the focus of the conspiracy itself,which was to maintain control over the segment of the bsm industry in the pro net founders line of affiliation.appellants theory,however,requires the court to assume the existence of an illegal conspiracy and to then view the facts in light of this understanding,an impermissible procedural gambit on appellants part.blomkest,at.a more natural reading of the facts is that amway was not only motivated by the desire to protect its products business,but that peaceful resolution of a contentious breakaway was in fact the end amway sought.
more importantly,the role amway played in this separation was not as a horizontal competitor,but as a vertical company interested in the survival of its primary business.restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints,and those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints.bus.elecs,at.for appellants to succeed in their claims of per se antitrust violations,they must show that amway was in direct competition with pro net and internet and that it was taking steps with its to restrain trade.see es dev.rwm,cir the classic form of a per se sherman act violation is a combination,conspiracy or agreement between competitors at the same level of the market to restrain competition the horizontal restraint of trade.
in an attempt to establish the existence of a horizontal relationship,appellants put significant weight on our earlier decision that recognized that amway has its own tool business.see nitro,alticor,at.amway tool business,however,is limited to books written by amway creators,general marketing material,and free conventions for amway distributors.it is a small fraction of amway overall business and does not meaningfully compete with companies like internet and pro net,and appellants evidence does nothing to suggest otherwise.similarly,appellants provide no factual support for their assertion that pro net was organized as a sham corporation through which amway could sell bsms.once again,appellants theories are cognizable only if a conspiracy is assumed.without this assumption,amway motivations and actions are all company and distributor,not horizontal competitors.vertical nonprice restraints are not per se illegal.bus.elecs,at.quoting cont l,gte sylvania,d.
stripping appellants argument of the assumptions necessary for its support further reveals that appellants evidence does not connect amway with any unlawful restraint of trade.although appellants have shown that amway was involved in the breakaway,there is no evidence that the breakaway itself was unlawful.appellants ascribe three unlawful components to the breakaway a tied to a customer allocation agreement,and inherent illegality.we address each of these in turn.
what appellants have labeled a is described throughout the record as a royalty fee from to internet for use and reproduction of the tapes originally produced by internet.other than substituting for royalty fee,appellants have provided no basis for assuming that this payment was anything other than what it purported to be.that the royalty fee was suggested by zeoli in connection with a agreement does not transform it into an unlawful bribe the parties were involved in contentious negotiations,and making lawful concessions to maintain peaceful business relations does not violate antitrust laws.
