this case involves the nature of permissible competitive practices in the airline industry under the antitrust laws of this country,centered around the system of american airlines.the united states brought this suit against amr corporation,american airlines,and american eagle holding corporation american,alleging monopolization and attempted monopolization through predatory pricing in violation of of the sherman act.in essence,the government alleges that american engaged in multiple episodes of price predation in four airline markets,all connected to american hub at worth international airport dfw,with the ultimate purpose of using the reputation for predatory pricing it earned in those four markets to defend a monopoly at its dfw hub at its root,the government complaint alleges that american priced its product on the routes in question below cost and intended to recoup these losses by charging supracompetitive prices either on the four core routes themselves,or on those routes where it stands to exclude competition by means of its reputation for predation.finding that the government failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to either of these allegations,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of american,from which the government now appeals.because we agree that the record is void of evidence that rises to the level of a material conflict,we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a and,and affirm.
airlines are predominantly organized in a system,with traffic routed such that passengers leave their origin city for an intermediate hub airport.passengers traveling to a concentrated hub tend to pay higher average fares than those traveling on comparable routes that do not include a concentrated hub as an endpoint.this is known as the hub premium and a major airline hub is often an important profit center.entry of low cost carriers lccs into a hub market tends to drive down the fares charged by major carriers.consequently,major carriers generally enjoy higher margins on routes where they do not face lcc competition.
both american and delta airlines delta maintain hubs at dfw,though delta presence is considerably smaller than american.as of may,american share of passengers boarded at dfw was,delta share was roughly,and lcc share was.as of,there were seven airlines serving dfw.in the period between to,five new airlines entered dfw american trans air,frontier,national,sun country,and ozark.dfw has more airlines than any other hub airport and the number of passengers carried by airlines increased by over from may to may.nevertheless,lccs have a significantly higher market share in some other major hubs 
lccs generally enjoy the advantage of having lower costs than major carriers,allowing them to offer lower fares than their competitors during the period between and,a number of lccs,including vanguard,western pacific,and sunjet,began to take advantage of these lower costs by entering certain routes serving dfw and charging lower fares than american.the instant case primarily involves city,springs,and beach.
american responded to lower lcc fares on these routes with changes in pricing matching lcc prices capacity adding flights or switching to larger planes and yield management making more seats available at the new,lower prices.by increasing capacity,american overrode its own internal models for each route,which had previously indicated that such increases would be unprofitable.in each instance,american response produced the same result the competing lcc failed to establish a presence,moved its operations,or ceased its separate existence entirely.once the lcc ceased or moved its operations,american generally resumed its prior marketing strategy,reducing flights and raising prices to levels roughly comparable to those prior to the period of competition.capacity was reduced after lcc exit,but usually remained higher than prior to the alleged episode of predatory activity 
the government filed suit on may,alleging that american participated in a scheme of predatory pricing in violation of of the sherman act.in the government view,american combined response of lowering prices,increasing capacity,and altering yield management in response to lcc competition constituted an unlawful,anticompetitive response.after reviewing a voluminous record and receiving extensive briefs the district court granted american motion for summary judgment on all antitrust claims,concluding that the government failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether american had priced below cost and whether american had a dangerous probability of recouping its alleged investment in prices.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court under.c,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.applied genetics int l,first affiliated,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if american can show the absence of genuine issues of material fact and its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.although no special burden is imposed on a plaintiff opposing summary judgment in an antitrust case,see eastman kodak image technical,d,in order to establish a genuine issue that entitles it to reach trial on its attempted monopolization claim premised on predatory pricing,the government must present more than a scintilla of evidence that the alleged predatory conduct makes economic sense,advo,phila.newspapers,cir.american need not disprove the government claim it need only establish that the proffered facts have no legal significance.dayton hudson macerich real estate,cir.
monopolization claims under of the sherman act require proof that a firm has monopoly power in a properly defined relevant market and that it willfully acquired or maintained this power by means of anticompetitive conduct.tv communications network,turner network television,cir.this is to be distinguished from a business that acquired monopoly power by greater skill,efficiency,or by building a better mousetrap.claims of attempted monopolization under of the sherman act require four elements of proof a relevant geographic and product market specific intent to monopolize the market anticompetitive conduct in furtherance of the attempt and a dangerous probability that the firm will succeed in the attempt.multistate legal studies,harcourt brace jovanovich legal and prof l publ ns,cir.
in the instant case,the anticompetitive conduct at issue is predatory pricing.the crux of the government argument is that the incremental revenues and costs specifically associated with american capacity additions show a loss.because american spent more to add capacity than the revenues generated by the capacity additions,such capacity additions made no economic sense unless american intended to drive lccs out of the market.under the government theory,american attempted to monopolize the four routes in question in order to develop a reputation as an exceedingly aggressive competitor and set an example to all potential competitors.fearing american predatory response,the theory goes,future potential competitors will decline to enter other dfw market routes and compete.if american succeeds in preventing or at least forestalling the formation of an lcc hub at dfw,it will then be able to charge higher prices on other dfw routes and thereby recoup the losses it incurred from its capacity dumping on the four core routes.
scholars from the chicago school of economic thought have long labeled predatory pricing as implausible and irrational.frank easterbrook,a leader of the chicago school,once concluded that there is no sufficient reason for antitrust law or the courts to take predation seriously.frank easterbrook,predatory strategies counterstrategies,chi.chicago scholars argued that lowering prices could only be and any prohibition on such conduct could ultimately deter firms from engaging in conduct that is socially beneficial.richard pierce,is ready for the courtroom a response to professor brennan,geo.commentators viewed pricing as irrational largely because of the uncertainty of recouping losses through later price increases.in order for a predatory pricing scheme to be successful,two future events had to take place first,the victim of the alleged predation would have to exit and second,the predator would have to generate profits in excess of its initial losses.jonathan baker,predatory pricing after brooke group an economic perspective,antitrust.
in two seminal antitrust opinions,the supreme court adopted the skepticism of chicago scholars,observing that there is a consensus among commentators that predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried,and even more rarely successful.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d.implausibility of predatory pricing schemes was said to flow from the fact that their success is inherently uncertain.matsushita,at.while the loss is definite the gain depends on successfully neutralizing the competition.id.moreover,t he success of any predatory scheme depends on maintaining monopoly power for long enough both to recoup the predator losses and to harvest some additional gain.id.
furthermore,caution in predatory pricing cases is the watchword as the costs of an erroneous finding are high.brooke group,at.because the mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory the same mechanism by which a firm stimulates competition,mistaken inferences may deter the very conduct the antitrust laws were created to protect.cargill monfort of,d quotation omitted.
recent scholarship has challenged the notion that predatory pricing schemes are implausible and irrational.see,patrick bolton et,predatory pricing strategic theory and legal policy,geo,modern economic analysis has developed coherent theories of predation that contravene earlier economic writing claiming that predatory pricing conduct is irrational.economists have theorized that price predation is not only plausible,but profitable,especially in a context where predation can occur in one market and recoupment can occur rapidly in other markets.see baker,supra,at.
although this court approaches the matter with caution,we do not do so with the incredulity that once prevailed.
the supreme court has formulated two prerequisites to recovery on a predatory pricing claim,conditions that are not easy to establish.brooke group,at.first,the government must prove that the prices complained of are below an appropriate measure of american costs.id.at.while the first element is crucial,t hat pricing may impose painful losses on its target is of no moment to the antitrust laws if competition is not injured.id.at.thus,the second prerequisite to recovery on a predatory pricing claim,a demonstration that american had a dangerous probability of recouping its investment in prices,must also be met.id.at.without a dangerous probability of recoupment,competition remains unharmed even if individual competitors suffer.as frequently noted,the antitrust laws were passed for the protection of competition,not competitors.id.citing brown shoe united states,d.
speaking to the first prerequisite to recovery,the supreme court stated that p redatory pricing means pricing below some appropriate measure of cost.matsushita,at.quotation omitted despite a great deal of debate on the subject,no consensus has emerged as to what the most appropriate measure of cost is in predatory pricing cases.costs can generally be divided into those that are fixed and do not vary with the level of output management expenses,interest on bonded debt,property taxes,depreciation,and other irreducible overhead and those that are variable and do vary with the level of output materials,fuel,labor used to produce the product.marginal cost,the cost that results from producing an additional increment of output,is primarily a function of variable cost because fixed costs,as the name would imply,are largely unaffected by changes in output.see rebel oil,atl.richfield,cir.for predatory pricing cases,especially those involving allegedly predatory production increases,the ideal measure of cost would be marginal cost because a s long as a firm prices exceed its marginal cost,each additional sale decreases losses or increases profits.advo,at.however,marginal cost,an economic abstraction,is notoriously difficult to measure and can not be determined from conventional accounting methods.northeastern,cir pac.eng g prod.of,cir.economists,therefore,must resort to proxies for marginal cost.a commonly accepted proxy for marginal cost in predatory pricing cases is average variable cost avc,the average of those costs that vary with the level of output see,stearns airport equip.fmc,cir advo,at arthur langenderfer,johnson,cir northeastern,at.
the supreme court has declined to state which of the various cost measures is definitive.in brooke group,the court accepted for the purposes of the case the parties agreement that the appropriate measure of cost was avc,but declined to resolve the conflict among the lower courts over the appropriate measure of cost.at.in this circuit,we have spoken of both avc and other marginal cost measures as relevant.see,multistate legal studies,at observing that evidence of marginal cost or average variable cost is extremely beneficial in establishing a case of monopolization through predatory pricing emphasis added pac.eng g,at.because there may be times when courts need the flexibility to examine both avc as well as other proxies for marginal cost in order to evaluate an alleged predatory pricing scheme,we again decline to dictate a definitive cost measure for all cases.sole reliance on avc as the appropriate measure of cost may obscure the nature of a particular predatory scheme and,thus,contrary to what is suggested by the district court,we do not favor avc to the exclusion of other proxies for marginal cost.whatever the proxy used to measure marginal cost,it must be accurate and reliable in the specific circumstances of the case at bar.
conceding that avc is a good proxy for marginal cost in most cases,the government nevertheless argues that there may be times when looking only to a avc test will disguise the nature of the predatory conduct at issue.where there is a challenge to incremental conduct,and where incremental costs may be directly and confidently measured utilizing alternative proxies to avc,argues the government,the avc test is inappropriate.
considering this to be the situation in the instant case,the government proffers four tests that purport to measure reliably incremental precise costs associated with the capacity additions at issue.rather than creating independent measures of the costs associated with american capacity additions,the government experts rely on cost measures used in aaimspan,american internal system accounting measures that are used for internal decision making,not financial reporting.the government notes that a range of tests are necessary to rule out false positives and assure confidence in the results.thus,the tests operate as to each other to avoid misleading indications of predation due to similarities among the four tests,the district court grouped them as tests two and three,and tests one and four for purposes of analysis.we proceed to consider each test to determine whether it is valid as a matter of law.
two of the tests grouped together by the district court,tests two and three,purport to measure incremental cost by looking to whether certain of american internal measures became negative following the allegedly predatory capacity additions.both tests rely on an internal accounting measure known as faudnc,or fully allocated earnings plus contribution net of costs.united states amr,d.as the name would imply,faudnc is a fully allocated earnings measure,meaning that general operating expenses are arbitrarily allocated by american decision accounting system to the flight or route level,and do not necessarily represent the exact costs associated with a particular flight or route.faudnc reflects of american total costs,which include fixed costs not affected by the capacity additions at issue.thus,while faudnc includes some costs directly caused by a particular flight or operations on a particular route such as fuel and landing fees,i
