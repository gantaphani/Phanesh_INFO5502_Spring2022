the meaning of the term prime rate lies at the heart of this appeal.plaintiffs,hing lum,his wife debra,and gary oriani have borrowed money from defendant banks pursuant to lending agreements with prime plus interest rates.plaintiffs claim in their amended complaint that the defendant banks,in setting prime plus interest rates,have violated the sherman antitrust act,and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c,d.the banks allegedly violated the sherman act by agreeing to misrepresent that prime rate is the lowest rate available to their most creditworthy borrowers,when in fact they have offered some large borrowers financing at interest rates below prime rate they allegedly gave false information about their prime rate both to consumers who were seeking credit and to leading financial publications,such as the new york times and the wall street journal,which publish independent indices of the prime rate.the banks allegedly violated rico by making these misrepresentations about prime rate through the mails and over interstate wires.plaintiffs claim that the fraudulently inflated prime rate has resulted in their being charged higher interest than permitted by the terms of the prime plus loan agreements.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs rico claim because it lacked the specificity in pleading fraud that is required under.b.it dismissed the antitrust claim for failure to meet the minimum standards for pleading an antitrust conspiracy.lum bank of america,wl,slip op.at,
we agree that the rico claim was properly dismissed.because it is predicated on mail and wire fraud,federal rule of civil procedure b requires that the fraud be pled with specificity.it was not.moreover,the antitrust claim is also based on misrepresentations in the information given to consumers and on misrepresentations in the information given to the independent financial publications.although antitrust claims generally are not subject to the heightened pleading requirement of rule b,fraud must be pled with particularity in all claims based on fraud in all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.b emphasis added.fraud is the basis for the antitrust violation alleged here.in paragraph of the amended complaint,plaintiffs aver that the banks fraudulently and artificially inflate d the prime rate published in the outside indexes by falsely reporting the bank individual prime rates to the various publications the prime rate published by the outside indexes remained artificially high and the prime plus interest rates on the consumer credit instruments were fraudulently inflated.emphasis added.because,as in the rico claim,plaintiffs allegations of fraud did not comply with rule b,the antitrust claim would properly have been dismissed on these grounds 
finally,we agree with the district court denial of leave to amend.plaintiffs statements at oral argument and their briefs both before the district court and before us make it clear that granting leave to amend would be futile.we will,therefore,affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
on january,hing and debra lum filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of themselves and of a purported class of similarly situated individuals who borrowed money from the defendant banks from april,to the present.the purported class was not certified prior to dismissal of the complaint.the defendants in the suit are twelve of the country largest banks and one hundred unnamed individuals.on april,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding gary oriani as a plaintiff.the amended complaint alleges that defendants violated rico,the sherman antitrust act,and new jersey law by the manner in which they fixed the prime plus interest rate.prime plus interest rates are tied to the prime rate as it is defined by the lender or by an outside index reported in a major financial publication.these publications in turn develop their indices from the prime rates reported by leading financial institutions,including defendant banks.at the heart of the amended complaint are the following allegations 
at some point in time prior to the class period,the bank defendants formulated and carried out a plan,scheme and conspiracy to fix and control the prime rate published by the outside indexes.because these prime rate indexes had been incorporated into thousands of existing financial instruments as well as into new financial instruments written by the banks,control of the prime rate published in the outside indexes would enable the banks to effectively raise interest rates unilaterally on these credit instruments,and in so doing increase their income and profits by millions,if not billions of dollars on an annual basis.
during the class period,while maintaining an appearance of following a prime rate set by neutral forces,the banks entered into a plan,scheme,conspiracy and course of conduct designed to fraudulently and artificially inflate the prime rate published in the outside indexes by falsely reporting the bank individual prime rates to the various publications.to effectuate this scheme,the banks reported as their prime rates,rates far in excess of the rates the banks actually charged to their largest and most creditworthy customers.as a result of this plan,scheme,conspiracy and course of conduct,the prime rate published by the outside indexes remained artificially high and the prime plus interest rates on the consumer credit instruments were fraudulently inflated.
emphasis added.
the amended complaint then identifies three financial transactions pursuant to which the named plaintiffs obtained financing at a prime plus interest rate.the plaintiffs did not attach the agreements documenting these three transactions,but the defendants provided copies of the agreements in support of their motion to dismiss first,hing and debra lum obtained a home equity loan from morris county savings bank,now first union national bank,in april.this loan required the plaintiffs to pay interest at a rate of two percentage points above the prime rate,as reported in the new york times.second,plaintiff debra lum received credit cards from defendant bank of america in and from chase manhattan bank in.these cards have interest rates tied to the prime rate reported in the wall street journal.the bank of america agreement defines this prime rate as the base rate on corporate loans at large money center commercial banks.the chase manhattan agreement states that 
for purposes of this agreement,the prime rate as published in money rates table of the wall street journal or any other newspaper of national circulation selected by us is merely a pricing index.it is not,and should not be considered by you to represent,the lowest or the best interest rate available to a borrower at any particular bank at any given time.
in connection with all three of these transactions,the defendant banks have sent to plaintiffs,through the mail,monthly statements regarding the prime rate.
on may,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.in their opposition to the motion,plaintiffs submitted a detailed rico case statement pursuant to the local rules of the district of new jersey.on november,following oral argument,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.

iii.discussion 
in considering a motion to dismiss,a court must accept as true all of the factual allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of the plaintiffs.moore tartler,cir.a court may dismiss the complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.hishon king spalding,d.in the present case,even accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and drawing every reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiffs,they have failed to adequately plead either a rico or an antitrust cause of action.
the plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead a rico cause of action predicated on mail and wire fraud because their general allegations of fraud do not comply with rule b and their specific allegations regarding particular transactions do not amount to fraud.the rico statute provides that 
it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
c.it is also unlawful for anyone to conspire to violate c.see d.in order to plead a violation of rico,plaintiffs must allege conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.see sedima,imrex.a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering.see.these predicate acts of racketeering may include,inter alia,federal mail fraud under or federal wire fraud under.see saporito combustion eng g,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.
the federal mail and wire fraud statutes prohibit the use of the mail or interstate wires for purposes of carrying out any scheme or artifice to defraud.see.a scheme or artifice to defraud need not be fraudulent on its face,but must involve some sort of fraudulent misrepresentation or omission reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.brokerage concepts,healthcare,cir quoting kehr packages,fidelcor,cir.
where,as here,plaintiffs rely on mail and wire fraud as a basis for a rico violation,the allegations of fraud must comply with federal rule of civil procedure b,which requires that allegations of fraud be pled with specificity.see saporito,at.in order to satisfy rule b,plaintiffs must plead with particularity the circumstances of the alleged fraud in order to place the defendants on notice of the precise misconduct with which they are charged,and to safeguard defendants against spurious charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior.seville indus.mach.southmost mach,cir.plaintiffs may satisfy this requirement by pleading the date,place or time of the fraud,or through alternative means of injecting precision and some measure of substantiation into their allegations of fraud.id.holding that a plaintiff satisfied rule b by pleading which machines were the subject of alleged fraudulent transactions and the nature and subject of the alleged misrepresentations.plaintiffs also must allege who made a misrepresentation to whom and the general content of the misrepresentation.see saporito,at rolo city investing.liquidating trust,cir klein general nutrition,cir.
in the present case,the rico cause of action consists of the following allegation of mail and wire fraud 
during the class period,within the meaning of c,the defendants conducted and participated,directly and indirectly,in the conduct of the enterprises through the pattern of racketeering activity 
a during the class period,defendants used the mails interstate wire facilities in connection with accomplishing the fraudulent scheme described in this complaint.each such use of the mails or interstate wire facilities was for the purpose of executing and furthering the fraudulent scheme or conspiracy described in this complaint.each month during the class period,defendants mailed thousands of bank statements,advertisements for credit cards,contracts and promotional materials containing the fraudulent stated and artificially inflated interest rates to plaintiffs and the class in furtherance of their fraudulent scheme.each such act constituted a violation of.
b during the class period defendants transmitted or caused to be transmitted by means of wire communications in interstate or foreign commerce,writings,signs,signals,pictures or sounds for the purpose of executing a scheme or artifice to defraud the plaintiffs,or for obtaining money or property of the plaintiffs and the class by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations or promises as set forth in this complaint in the allegations set forth above.examples include interstate telephone calls facsimile transmissions by prospective borrowers,seeking to promote borrowing allegedly tied to the prime rate,or to collect interest charges and loan payments allegedly due in connection with borrowing on the financial and credit instruments tied to the prime rate,as well as interstate telephone or wire transmissions of the bank prime rate to the publishers of the outside indexes.each of these acts constitutes a violation of.
the fraudulent scheme described in the complaint refers to paragraphs and of the amended complaint which we have set out above in part 
the district court properly ruled that these conclusory allegations do not satisfy rule b.they do not indicate the date,time,or place of any misrepresentation nor do they provide an alternative means of injecting precision and some measure of substantiation into the fraud allegations because they do not identify particular fraudulent financial transactions.see seville,at.nor do these allegations indicate which defendant s made misrepresentations to which plaintiff s.see saporito,at rolo,at klein,at.
plaintiffs contend,however,that the district court failed to address explicitly the fact that the factual background section of the amended complaint and the rico case statement identify three specific allegedly fraudulent mortgage with first union,and the credit card transactions with bank of america and chase manhattan,the dates of these transactions,and the names of the defendants who made alleged misrepresentations to particular plaintiffs plaintiffs,citing michaels building ameritrust,cir,and haroco,american bank and trust of chicago,cir,aff,d,argue that these allegations are sufficient to plead a rico cause of action.in michaels and haroco,the courts of appeals for the sixth and seventh circuits,respectively,held that complaints adequately pled rico causes of action predicated on mail and wire fraud when they alleged that banks misrepresented in particular loan agreements that the prime rate is the interest rate charged by the banks to their most creditworthy commercial borrowers,although in fact the banks charged lower rates to some commercial borrowers.see michaels,at haroco,at.
in the present case,however,the amended complaint fails to allege fraud in relation to the three identified transactions because,unlike michaels or haroco,the plaintiffs do not,and can not,allege that any of the three purportedly fraudulent credit agreements define the term prime rate as the lowest interest rate available to a bank most creditworthy borrowers.see id.
in addition,plaintiffs make general claims that defendants misrepresented that the prime rate is the lowest rate charged to their most creditworthy customers.however,these allegations do not satisfy rule b because they do not indicate the date,time,or place of the alleged misrepresentations,the financial transactions in connection with which these misrepresentations were made,or who made the misrepresentation to whom.see seville,at saporito,at rolo,at klein,at.plaintiffs also allege that,on february,and march,citibank and first union represented to the class that the prime rate was the rate charged to their most creditworthy commercial customers.however,plaintiffs do not allege that these representations were made to a named plaintiff,or that any particular individual entered into a financial transaction with this term.see rolo,at holding that,until a class is certified,a rico action is one between the named plaintiffs and defendants,and the adequacy of the pleading must be analyzed with regard to the specificity of the fraud allegations relating to the named plaintiffs.
in order to counter their failure to cite specific instances of active misrepresentation that the prime rate is the lowest rate available to a bank most creditworthy borrowers,the plaintiffs focus on omissions by defendants.they argue that the term prime rate is so generally understood to mean the lowest rate available to a bank most creditworthy borrowers that the failure to disclose that some borrowers obtain loans with interest rates below the prime rate constitutes fraud.
we conclude to the contrary.even drawing every reasonable inference in favor of plaintiffs,the meaning of the term prime rate is sufficiently indefinite that it is reasonable for the parties to have different understandings of its meaning.for example,more than twenty years ago,a congressional committee,in a staff report,described prime rate as a murky,term that rarely reflects the lowest rates available to corporate customers.see staff of house comm.on banking,finance and urban affairs,an analysis of prime rate lending practices of the ten largest united states banks comm.print.this lack of precision in the term prime rate has also been recognized by the courts.see,blount fin.serv.walter heller and,cir the fact that the parties take different positions under the contract as to the appropriate prime rate,or the fact that the defendant charged too high a prime rate and thereby concealed or refused to disclose what the plaintiff considers the true prime rate called for under the contract,does not give rise to a valid claim for fraud.wilcox first interstate bank of oregon,cir opining that prime rate indicates the average cost of a loan because most loans are negotiated at interest rates above or below prime center cadillac,bank leumi trust of new york,aff,cir holding that a lender does not commit the predicate act of mail fraud by omitting a definition of prime rate and charging some borrowers below the prime rate because a decision to charge certain customers lower rates than common occurrence in the banking reflects the bank greater confidence in the financial stability of those customers.it is therefore unreasonable to infer that defendants use of the equivocal term prime rate was reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension into believing that no borrower obtained an interest rate below the prime rate.plaintiffs claim boils down to a disagreement about the meaning of the term prime rate.this disagreement does not rise to the level of fraud at most,it alleges a contract dispute.see blount,at.
moreover,the requirement of rule b that we draw every reasonable inference in favor of plaintiffs does not preclude us from reaching this result.plaintiffs do not ask us just to infer that the term prime rate means the lowest rate available to defendants most creditworthy borrowers.they ask us to conclude that this meaning is so universally accepted that it is the only possible meaning and that a reasonable person could not understand the term to mean anything else.in light of wilcox and blount,this is not a reasonable inference.see blount,at wilcox,at.we conclude that the term prime rate,in the context in which it was used here,is imprecise.
furthermore,even if we were to have held it to be fraudulent to use the term prime rate without disclosing that some borrowers obtain financing below the prime rate,the defendants in this case clearly did disclose that some borrowers obtained financing below the prime rate.the credit card agreement between defendant chase manhattan and plaintiff debra lum states 
for purposes of this agreement,the prime rate as published in money rates table of the wall street journal or any other newspaper of national circulation selected by us is merely a pricing index.it is not,and should not be considered by you to represent,the lowest or the best interest rate available to a borrower at any particular bank at any given time.
emphasis added.plaintiffs argue that the term it in the last sentence of the chase manhattan agreement refers to the term index in the preceding sentence,not the term prime rate.this distinction is meaningless,however,because,according to the terms of the contract,the prime rate for purposes of the credit card agreement is the prime rate reported in the wall street journal.thus,the caveat applies equally to both rates.
given the fact that one member of the rico alleged by plaintiffs to be the defendant banks plus the reuters news service,dow jones,the new york times,and the wall street journal expressly stated in one of the three allegedly fraudulent credit agreements,relied upon by the plaintiffs,that the prime rate is not the lowest rate offered to the bank most creditworthy customer,it would be difficult to conclude,as plaintiffs allege,that the defendants conducted an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity by making misrepresentations or omissions that were reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.
plaintiffs,however,point to a representation in another of the three agreements,the credit card agreement between debra lum and bank of america,in support of their fraud claim.they argue that the representation in this the prime rate is the base rate on corporate loans at large money center commercial banks is tantamount to defining the prime rate as the lowest rate available to a bank most creditworthy borrowers.however,as with the term prime rate,a person of ordinary prudence and comprehension would not conclude from this statement that no commercial borrowers obtain an interest rate below the base rate because nothing in the term base rate excludes the possibility of discounts for some customers.indeed,as plaintiffs acknowledge in their opening brief,citing black law dictionary ed,base rate is effectively equivalent to prime rate.see also form fr,fed.res.board,prime rate supp.to survey of terms of business lending.as with the term prime rate,because of the possibility of discounts,the term base rate may not mean the lowest possible rate.
we conclude,therefore,that plaintiffs have failed to plead fraud with particularity in their rico claim so that the district court properly dismissed it 
sherman antitrust act 
similarly,since the amended complaint alleges that defendants carried out their antitrust conspiracy through fraud,plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action under section of the sherman antitrust act because of the defects in the fraud allegations discussed above.generally,the pleading standard for section claims is the short and concise statement standard of rule a.in poller columbia broad,the supreme court cautioned that summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles,the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators,and hostile witnesses thicken the plot,d see also hospital.trustees,d i n antitrust cases,dismissal prior to giving the plaintiff ample opportunity for discovery should be granted very sparingly.likewise,in knuth dairy coop,this court stated that we should be extremely liberal in construing antitrust complaints,cir.
we have,however,recognized that while antitrust complaints are not subject to especially stringent pleadings,see knuth,supra,neither are they exempt from the federal rules.commonwealth of pennsylvania pepsico,cir quoting sims mack truck.
because plaintiffs allege that the defendants accomplished the goal of their conspiracy through fraud,the amended complaint is subject to rule b.see.b in all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.emphasis added.plaintiffs,nevertheless,pointing to paragraph of the amended complaint,argue that their antitrust claim merely alleges that defendants conspired to set an artificially high floor on interest rates by agreeing to raise the prime rate,and that allegations of misrepresentations regarding the prime rate only go to their rico claim.in paragraph,the amended complaint alleges that defendants formulated and carried out a plan,scheme and conspiracy to fix and control the
