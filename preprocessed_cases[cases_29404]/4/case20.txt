three generic drug companies,ranbaxy teva and collectively,the generic defendants,sought to market generic forms of nexium.astrazeneca sued these generic companies for infringement of some of the nexium patents.astrazeneca eventually settled with each generic manufacturer.under the settlement agreements,astrazeneca paid the generic defendants significant sums in the form of cash or debt forgiveness reverse payments in exchange for not challenging the validity of the nexium patents and for delaying the launch of their respective generic products until the two main patents covering the drug product itself expired on may,as of the date of this opinion,no generic substitute has been launched.
the named plaintiffs are union health and welfare funds that reimburse plan members for prescription drugs including nexium.plaintiffs alleged that the nexium patents are invalid because they would have been obvious in light of earlier astrazeneca patents and other references.the european patent office and the canadian courts have held that the european and canadian nexium patents are invalid.
plaintiffs alleged that the settlement agreements between astrazeneca and the generic defendants collectively,the defendants constituted unlawful agreements not to compete because of the likely invalidity of the nexium patents,the size of astrazeneca payments to the generic defendants,and the fact that generic defendants provided nothing to astrazeneca other than an agreement not to compete.plaintiffs contend that but for defendants conduct,a generic version of nexium would have been available as early as april,thereby lowering the price through competition.they asserted that astrazeneca overcharged for nexium from april,to at least may,the class period.they claim damages under the antitrust and consumer protection laws of states and the district of columbia the plaintiffs sought class certification for a class of payors tpps,insurance plans,such as the named plaintiffs,and individual consumers 
on november,the district court certified a class consisting of 
all persons or entities in the united states and its territories who purchased or paid for some or all of the purchase price for nexium or its generic equivalents in capsule form,for consumption by themselves,their families,or their members,employees,insureds,participants or beneficiaries,during the period april,through and until the anticompetitive effects of defendants unlawful conduct cease.
add.the certified class also included certain exceptions discussed below.the defendants sought to appeal the class certification.we granted this interlocutory appeal under federal rule of civil procedure f to review the class certification 
we conclude that class certification is permissible even if the class includes a de minimis number of uninjured parties.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by certifying the class here and determining that at the certification stage,it had not been shown that future proceedings would not be manageable consistent with defendants seventh amendment and due process rights.
both the supreme court in ftc actavis,and the district court below,in re nexium esomeprazole antitrust litigation,d,have discussed extensively the regulatory and patent framework of this suit.we discuss it briefly here.
the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca requires drug manufacturers to secure approval from the food and drug administration fda to market a new drug.b,d.to obtain approval,a new drug application nda must include scientific data showing that the drug is safe and effective for its proposed purpose,requiring that the manufacturer conduct long and costly clinical trials.caraco pharm,novo nordisk.
the hatch waxman introduced two mechanisms to the fdca to enable early marketing of generic substitutes.first,to market a generic drug,the manufacturer need only file an abbreviated new drug application anda showing that the generic product has the same active ingredients as,and is biologically equivalent to,the brand name drug.id.second,hatch waxman protects the original by barring fda approval of an anda that is alleged to infringe a patent until the patent cases have been resolved or months have elapsed and provides a means for early resolution of patent disputes.eli lilly medtronic.
to this end,the must list the number and expiration date of any patent which claims the drug that is the subject of the nda or a method of manufacture or use of that drug in the fda orange book.upon filing,the anda applicant must notify the if it is asserting that some or all of these listed and unexpired patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use or sale of the generic drug known as a paragraph iv certification.j a vii iv.a paragraph iv certification is treated as an act of infringement,and the branded drug manufacturer may immediately sue the generic manufacturer for infringement based on this certification.e a.if the branded drug manufacturer sues,the fda may not approve the anda until months pass or an appellate court finds the patent invalid or not infringed.j b iii.
on december,astrazeneca filed an nda to market nexium.the fda approved astrazeneca nda in,and astrazeneca listed fourteen patents in the orange book.four years later,generic manufacturer ranbaxy filed an anda and filed a paragraph iv certification with its anda that the listed astrazeneca patents were not infringed or were invalid.astrazeneca sued ranbaxy,alleging that ranbaxy product would infringe six of its patents,including the patents covering the drug product itself.in the next few years,teva and drl also filed andas and paragraph iv certifications,and were sued in separate actions by astrazeneca for infringement of many of the same nexium patents,including the drug product patents.
for ranbaxy,the month period triggered by astrazeneca suit expired on april.as a result,ranbaxy could have begun marketing its product on april,if it launched,before the court ruled on patent invalidity or infringement.however,on the date that ranbaxy could have launched a nexium substitute,ranbaxy and astrazeneca settled their patent litigation,and the district court entered a consent judgment.ranbaxy admitted the validity of astrazeneca asserted patents,admitted that its generic product infringed those patents,and agreed to delay the launch of its generic product until may,the date that the main drug product patents expired.in exchange,astrazeneca agreed to pay ranbaxy over a billion dollars.subsequently,astrazeneca entered into separate settlement agreements with teva and drl.the provisions of these agreements were similar to astrazeneca agreement with ranbaxy,and both teva and drl also agreed to delay their respective generic product launches until may,in exchange for substantial monetary consideration these agreements raised antitrust concerns because they were agreements between competitors not to compete.
the agreements between astrazeneca and the generic defendants are known as reverse payment settlements.unlike traditional settlements,where a party with a claim for damages receives a sum equal to or less than the value of its claim,i n reverse payment settlements a party with no claim for damages walks away with money simply so it will stay away from the patentee market.actavis.at.the supreme court in actavis concluded that reverse payment settlements are properly evaluated under the antitrust laws using a rule of reason analysis.id.at.actavis specified particular factors indicating that an agreement was an unreasonable restraint of trade,including whether the reverse payment was large and unjustified,measured by its size,its scale in relation to the payor anticipated future litigation costs,its independence from other services for which it might represent payment,and the lack of any other convincing justification.id.at.
plaintiffs here alleged that the nexium patents were likely invalid or not infringed by the generic defendants products,and the payments were not made in exchange for any services performed by the generic defendants.as a result,defendants agreements constituted an unlawful horizontal conspiracy to foreclose generic competition.plaintiffs claimed that because drug prices fall significantly with generic entry,the prices of generic nexium in the would have been lower than the branded nexium prices during the class period absent generic entry.in addition,in the early period,purchasers of branded nexium would have paid supracompetitive prices as well.as a result,the class members were injured by defendants overcharges.
the merits of plaintiffs antitrust challenge are not before us the issue is whether the district court properly certified plaintiffs rule b damages class.
the district court below concluded that plaintiffs ha d sufficiently demonstrated a showing of adequacy of representation and predominance of common questions to the class to meet the requirements of class certification under rules a and b.add.specifically,the district court decided that plaintiffs had adequately shown that prices for esomeprazole during the class period continued to be artificially high as a result of the defendants reverse payment agreements,and that all class members have been exposed to purchasing or paying for esomeprazole magnesium at a supracompetitive price.add.the district court determined that some members of the class did not suffer injury,perhaps including more than a de minimis number of tpps and consumers.add.but despite the presence of uninjured class members,the court determined that defendants expert failed reliably to quantify the prevalence of his alleged problematic subgroups and thus fail ed to establish that they are sufficiently extensive to undermine plaintiffs expert conclusion that the vast majority of class members were injured.add.finally,in keeping with the supreme court admonition that class certification ought not turn into a merits inquir y through unnecessary demands for exact calculations of damages,the district court concluded that a t this stage in class certification the incidence of uninjured consumers and tpps are insufficient to overcome a showing of common antitrust impact to the putative class,but the court preserves the defendants right to challenge individual damage claims at trial.add.citing amgen,connecticut ret.plans trust funds,add.

defendants contend that the class certification is improper because the class includes members who were not injured by generic foreclosure for example,individual consumers who would have continued to purchase branded nexium for the same price after generic entry.understanding the defendants challenge requires description of the standards for class certification,only one of which is at issue on appeal.
to certify a b class,the district court must undertake a rigorous analysis to determine whether plaintiffs met the four threshold requirements of rule a numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation and rule b two additional prerequisites.comcast behrend,wal mart stores,dukes,see also.of sw.falcon.defendants do not dispute that the four rule a requirements were met here.in addition,rule b permits certification only if 
the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy 
to meet the predominance requirement,the party seeking certification must show that the fact of antitrust impact can be established through common proof and that any resulting damages would likewise be established by sufficiently common proof.new motor vehicles,at emphasis added.the party also bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrat ing his compliance with the rule requirements.comcast.at.the district court concluded that plaintiffs had done so here,despite finding that the certified class included some number of uninjured class members.on appeal,defendants ask us to reverse the decision,relying on two related arguments.first,defendants contend that the presence of any uninjured class members even a de minimis number defeats the b predominance requirement because the existence of uninjured class members precludes the use of common proof at trial.second,defendants contend that even if a de minimis number of potentially uninjured class members would not defeat class certification,more than a de minimis number of class members were uninjured here.
relevant to the question of whether a class can include uninjured members,three principles are established.first,a class action is improper unless the theory of liability is limited to the injury caused by the defendants.in other words,the defendants can not be held liable for damages beyond the injury they caused.the supreme court emphasized this principle in comcast.the plaintiffs in that case had initially relied on four theories of liability and had calculated aggregate damages based on all four theories.at.but the district court certified the class based on only one theory,and plaintiffs did not provide a damages calculation for that one theory standing alone.id.because the plaintiffs relied on a methodology that identifies damages that are not the result of the wrong,they did not establish that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis,failing to meet the rule b requirement.id.at,here,in contrast,the plaintiffs theory of liability is appropriately limited.as defendants concede,the plaintiffs theory and model for damages would only require that the defendants pay aggregate damages equivalent to the injury that they caused.
second,the definition of the class must be definite,that is,the standards must allow the class members to be ascertainable.see william rubenstein,newberg on class actions,ed explaining that an implied requirement for certification is that a putative class is ascertainable with reference to objective criteria matamoros starbucks,cir holding that a class was not unascertainable and overbroad where it was defined in terms of an objective criterion carrera bayer,cir as an essential prerequisite of a class action,plaintiffs must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the class is currently and readily ascertainable based on objective criteria.citing marcus bmw of north america,llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the class definition here satisfies these standards by being defined in terms of purchasers of nexium during the class period with some exceptions that also satisfy objective standards.
third,where an individual claims process is conducted at the liability and damages stage of the litigation,the payout of the amount for which the defendants were held liable must be limited to injured parties at the class certification stage,the court must be satisfied that,prior to judgment,it will be possible to establish a mechanism for distinguishing the injured from the uninjured class members.the court may proceed with certification so long as this mechanism will be administratively feasible,see carrera,at,and protective of defendants seventh amendment and due process rights,see american law institute,principles of the law aggregate litigation,a,d cmt.j indicating that the court should exercise discretion to authorize aggregate treatment only if it would not compromise the fairness of procedures for resolving any remaining issues presented by such claims and that due process in aggregation extend s to persons opposing the aggregate group litigating related claims on an aggregate basis.
the defendants here dispute the plaintiffs compliance with the third set of requirements primarily because the class includes some number of consumers who would continue to purchase branded nexium even when a generic becomes available.defendants argue that the issue presents problems that plaintiffs can not overcome,for plaintiffs have no methodology to identify at a later stage of litigation those consumers who would have switched to a generic version.appellant br.defendants assert that the plaintiffs expert admitted that her damages model did not limit recovery to injured parties.
while it is true that a proper mechanism for exclusion of consumers has not yet been proposed,plaintiffs expert made no concession that such a mechanism could not be developed,nor did defendants expert say that it could not be developed.
in order to address whether an appropriate mechanism can be developed,it is useful to consider how injury would be established outside of the class action context that is,in an individual consumer suit for antitrust damages.in that situation,as here,by definition there are no records concerning generic purchases during the class period since no generic was on the market.under these circumstances there appear to be at least two ways that the consumer could establish injury.the first would be to argue for a presumption that consumers would purchase the generic if it were available,a presumption that economically rational consumers faced with two identical products would purchase the less expensive alternative.this presumption would be similar to the presumption of reliance in securities class actions and would be subject to rebuttal by the defendant.see halliburton erica john fund,presumption of reliance in basic,levinson,applies to class action,but is subject to rebuttal by defendants.we do not decide whether applying such a presumption would be appropriate.
but even if a presumption were determined not to be appropriate,another approach exists.this other approach would be to establish injury through testimony by the consumer that,given the choice,he or she would have purchased the generic.such testimony,if unrebutted,would be sufficient to establish injury in an individual action.and if such consumer testimony would be sufficient to establish injury in an individual suit,it follows that similar testimony in the form of an affidavit or declaration would be sufficient in a class action.there can not be a more stringent burden of proof in class actions than in individual actions.rigorous analysis,falcon,at,of rule requirements does not require raising the bar for plaintiffs higher than they would have to meet in individual suits 
thus,we have confidence that a mechanism would exist for establishing injury at the liability stage of this case,compliant with the requirements of the seventh amendment and due process.see madison chalmette refining,llc,cir approving,in the context of class certification,consideration of possible case management tools,including narrowing the claims and potential plaintiffs through summary judgment or facilitating the disposition of the remaining plaintiffs claims through issuance of a lone pine order requiring affidavits from plaintiffs.
defendants have merely speculated that a mechanism for exclusion can not be developed later.this is not enough to overcome plaintiffs case for having met the requirements of rule.see smilow,at decertification unnecessary where existence of individualized issues is a matter of conjecture gunnells healthplan,cir defeating adequacy requirement of rule requires a conflict that is more than merely speculative or hypothetical.
defendants also assert that any mechanism of exclusion that requires determination of the individual circumstances of class members is improper.but the supreme court in amgen and the circuits in other cases have made clear that the need for some individualized determinations at the liability and damages stage does not defeat class certification.rule b does not require a plaintiff seeking class certification to prove that each element of her claim is susceptible to classwide proof.amgen.at alterations and citations omitted.rather,the question is whether there is reason to think that individualized questions will overwhelm common ones and render class certification inappropriate halliburton.at emphasis added.for example,damages will not be uniform across the class.but it is that t he individuation of damages in consumer class actions is rarely determinative under rule b.where common questions predominate regarding liability,then courts generally find the predominance requirement to be satisfied even if individual damages issues remain.smilow,at newberg,supra,it is a black letter rule that individual damage calculations generally do not defeat a finding that common issues predominate.
even in cases where the issue of not just damages calculation presents individual questions,it does not necessarily follow that they predominate over common ones and that class action treatment is therefore unwarranted.cordes.fin,edwards sons,cir emphasis added.we do not think the need for individual determinations or inquiry for a de minimis number of uninjured members at later stages of the litigation defeats class certification.as contemplated by halliburton,the district court also explicitly recognized the need to preserv e the defendants right to challenge individual damage claims at trial.add.
in light of these three requirements ensuring the class is definite,limiting aggregate recovery to the amount of the injury,and ensuring recovery by only injured parties it is difficult to understand why the presence of uninjured class members at the preliminary stage should defeat class certification.ultimately,the defendants will not pay,and the class members will not recover,amounts attributable to uninjured class members,and judgment will not be entered in favor of such members.some number of uninjured members will receive a class notice,but the district court can easily assure that defendants will not pay for notice to uninjured members at worst the inclusion of some uninjured class members is inefficient,but this is counterbalanced by the overall efficiency of the class action mechanism.moreover,excluding all uninjured class members at the certification stage is almost impossible in many cases,given the inappropriateness of certifying what is known as a class a class defined in terms of the legal injury 
in certifying a b class there is an almost inevitable tension between excluding all parties from the defined class and including all injured parties in the defined class.ideally,that tension should be resolved by adopting a class definition that includes no uninjured parties and excludes no injured parties.see messner northshore.healthsystem,cir defining a class so as to avoid,on one hand,being and,on the other hand,the problem is more of an art than a science.we doubt that this will be feasible in many cases.without the benefit of further proceedings,it is simply not possible to entirely separate the injured from the uninjured at the class certification stage.and as the supreme court noted in amgen,rule grants courts no license to engage in merits inquiries at the certification stage.at.
finally,defendants objections to certifying a class including uninjured members run counter to fundamental class action policies.as the supreme court has repeatedly recognized,while t he class action device was designed as an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only,it is nonetheless peculiarly appropriate when the issues involved are common to the class as a whole.falcon,at citing califano,at internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,when amending rule to include section b,the advisory committee sought to cover cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated.amchem,windsor,citing comm.notes,internal quotation marks omitted.in amchem,the supreme court recognized what types of cases were best adjudicated under this amended section w hile the text of rule b does not exclude from certification cases in which individual damages run high,the advisory committee had dominantly in mind vindication of the rights of groups of people who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents to court at all.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiff class members in this case appear to be the very group that rule b was intended to protect.as we discuss later in this opinion,the actual overcharge to each class member was generally a small amount per prescription and too small to warrant individual litigation.see carnegie household int l,cir the realistic alternative to a class action is not million individual suits,but zero individual suits,as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for.as this court noted in new motor vehicles,at,an erroneous failure to certify a class where individual claims are small may deprive plaintiffs of the only realistic mechanism to vindicate meritorious claims.
despite the obvious utility of allowing the inclusion of some uninjured class members in the certified class and the lack of harm in doing so,the defendants rely on authority from the supreme court and from this court for the proposition that plaintiffs must nonetheless prove that every putative class member suffered injury to prevail on class certification.but the authority cited by the defendants do not impose any such requirement.
the defendants cite wal mart,where the supreme court reversed the class certification because plaintiffs could not show wal mart had a common policy of discriminating against women.s.at.as a result,plaintiffs did not meet the rule a commonality requirement.id.but the wal mart court nowhere stated that at the class certification stage,every member of the class must establish that he,she or it was in fact injured by the common policy of discrimination.id.at.
defendants reliance on comcast is equally misdirected.as we explained above,comcast did not require that plaintiffs show that all members of the putative class had suffered injury at the class certification stage simply that at class certification,the damages calculation must reflect the liability theory.at.
the supreme court also addressed the treatment of potentially uninjured class members last term in halliburton.in securities cases like halliburton,investors can recover damages only if they can prove that they relied on the defendant misrepresentation in deciding to buy or sell a company stock.at.under basic,levinson,a plaintiff securities class can satisfy the reliance requirement at class certification by invoking a presumption of reliance,rather than proving direct reliance on defendant misrepresentation for each individual class member.halliburton.at.basic permits defendants to rebut this presumption using individualized evidence showing that the class member did not rely on the integrity of the market price in trading stock.id.at.the halliburton court concluded that w hile the rebuttal has the effect of leaving individualized questions of reliance in the case,there is no reason to think that these questions will overwhelm common ones and render class certification inappropriate under rule b.id.internal quotation marks omitted.even if the defendant might attempt to pick off the occasional class member here or there through individualized rebuttal individual questions did not predominate over common questions.id.thus,the halliburton court contemplated that a class with uninjured members could be certified if the presence of a de minimis number of uninjured members did not overwhelm the common issues for the class.
the law in this circuit is not to the contrary.defendants argue that this court in new motor vehicles held that to obtain class certification,plaintiffs must establish at class certification that each class member was harmed by the defendants practice.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.to the extent that new motor vehicles is read to impose such a requirement,it has been overruled by the supreme court halliburton decision.but,in fact,new motor vehicles imposes no such requirement.in that case,plaintiffs alleged that defendant automobile manufacturers illegally colluded to restrict the flow of canadian cars into the united states to maintain higher prices in the united states.id.at.this court was concerned that even if plaintiffs showed that defendants conduct increased the vehicle list price in the united states,plaintiffs did not have evidence showing that the list price was actually paid by the class members.id.at.new motor vehicles recognized that plaintiffs theory must include some means of determining that each member of the class was in fact injured,and that at the liability stage,there must be a showing that class members were injured at the consumer level.id.at.there was no basis for concluding that the plaintiffs there could separate the injured from the uninjured at the liability stage.
but new motor vehicles did not impose a requirement that the injury determination must be completed by the stage only that the district court have enough information to evaluate preliminarily whether the proposed model will be able to establish which consumers were impacted by the alleged antitrust violation and which were not.id.emphasis added.uninjured members of the putative class would be identified in the liability proceedings later in the case,as halliburton contemplates 
numerous courts have certified plaintiff classes even though the plaintiffs have not been able to use common evidence to show harm to all class members.davis et,the puzzle of class actions with uninjured members,may.in addition to halliburton,cases from our sister and this hold that the presence of a de minimis number of uninjured class members is permissible at class certification.in fact,as one court has recognized at certification,a class will often include persons who have not been injured by the defendant conduct indeed,this is almost inevitable because at the outset of the case many of the members of the class may be unknown,or if they are known still the facts bearing on their claims may be unknown.kohen,at.such a possibility or indeed inevitability does not preclude class certification.id.citing alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions,ed.
we think that a certified class may include a de minimis number of potentially uninjured parties.we need not decide whether it is ever permissible to define a proper class including more than a de minimis number of uninjured parties since we conclude that it has not been shown that the class here includes more than a de minimis number of uninjured parties.
defendants alternative argument is that more than a de minimis number of class members were uninjured here,barring class certification.in addressing this argument,we conduct a detailed inquiry into the parties and experts economic analyses,keeping in mind that this is an indirect purchaser action.the supreme court in illinois brick,in holding that indirect purchasers may not bring suit for damages under the clayton act,noted the uncertainties and difficulties in analyzing price and output decisions in the real economic world rather than an economist hypothetical model and reasoned that actions by indirect purchasers would often result in long and complicated proceedings when such purchasers attempted to prove that a price increase was passed on to them.at.
states eventually disagreed,creating private causes of action for indirect purchasers under state antitrust laws.that such actions are thus allowed under those laws does not eliminate the real economic and litigation complexities identified by the supreme court.it should therefore not be surprising that determining whether and when certification of indirect purchaser class actions may bear the added complexity entails considerable thought and effort.
here,a class member suffered antitrust injury if that individual or entity was overcharged for nexium during the class period.there is no serious dispute that the majority of class members were injured.it is undisputed that the price that would have been paid by class members for generic nexium defendants conduct price is lower than the actual price paid by class members during the class period for branded nexium class period price.for those class members who were reimbursed for their purchases by an insurance plan and paid only a copayment,it is similarly undisputed that the generic copayment is almost always lower than the copayment.the dispute here focuses on various purchasers who were atypical and allegedly uninjured.
in proving injury,plaintiffs relied on the expert testimony of professor meredith rosenthal,professor of health economics and policy at the harvard school of public health and an academic affiliate of greylock mckinnon associates,a consulting and litigation support firm.rosenthal assumed that plaintiffs had proven defendants conduct and offered an opinion on the antitrust impact of the alleged generic foreclosure.to calculate the class period price the actual prices paid by class members for branded nexium during the class period,rosenthal used data from the ims national prescription audit.however,because no generic forms of nexium were on the market,there was no data to show firsthand the prices of branded and generic nexium after generic entry.to calculate the prices,rosenthal relied on the yardstick approach which approximates the market by using data from similar markets.
because nexium is a inhibitor,rosenthal examined other drugs in that therapeutic class for their suitability as a yardstick.she selected prevacid lansoprazole because it was launched closest in time to nexium november,and had a similar profile of generic entrants as nexium in terms of number and size.rosenthal corroborated her calculations of the prices using defendants documents,which contained estimates of nexium prices after generic entry.rosenthal calculations showed that nearly all class members suffered an antitrust injury as a result of defendants conduct.
defendants argued that even though injured class members comprise a majority of the putative class,more than a de minimis number of class members were not injured,identifying five groups of class members that likely suffered no injury.defendants arguments were based on the expert testimony of professor james hughes,thomas sowell professor of economics at bates college.
plaintiffs bear the burden of an initial showing that a proposed class satisfies the rule requirements.smilow,at accord messner,at in re hydrogen peroxide,at.but plaintiffs need not make that showing to a degree of absolute certainty.it is sufficient if each disputed requirement has been proven by a preponderance of evidence.messner,at citing teamsters local freight div.pension fund bombardier,cir accord alaska pension fund flowserve,cir.once plaintiffs have made their initial showing,defendants have the burden of producing sufficient evidence to rebut the plaintiff showing.
here,it is difficult to determine exactly what findings the district court made with respect to each of the five allegedly uninjured groups presented by the defendants.however,the district court generally credited rosenthal calculations.it pointed out that rosenthal figures showed approximately percent of all class prescriptions were attributable to brand transactions with no overcharge.add.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.neither the parties nor the district court presented a precise estimate of the number or percentage of uninjured class members,but on balance,the district court found defendants challenges did not suffice to overcome predominance.
we consider here defendants contentions with respect to the five allegedly uninjured groups and the record materials.we conclude that defendants argument that no class can be certified stems in large part from four errors in their analysis of the uninjured groups.
first,defendants incorrectly assume that class members are shielded from injury by plan arrangements that the district court found did not exist.
second,defendants incorrectly assume that a class member who is injured for only a part of the class period did not suffer injury,even though they have now conceded that an injury for part of the class period is sufficient to establish injury.paying an overcharge caused by the alleged anticompetitive conduct on a single purchase suffices to show as a legal and factual matter impact or fact of damage.davis cramer,antitrust,class certification,and the politics of procedure,geo.mason,internal quotation marks omitted citing paper,nippon paper indus,cir.
third,defendants incorrectly assume that if a class member offsets an overcharge through later savings attributable to the same or related transaction,there is no injury.but antitrust injury occurs the moment the purchaser incurs an overcharge,whether or not that injury is later offset.see adams mills,in contemplation of law the claim for damages arose at the time the extra charge was paid.neither the fact of subsequent reimbursement by the plaintiffs from funds of the shippers nor the disposition which may hereafter be made of the damages recovered is of any concern to the wrongdoers.citations omitted see also hawaii standard oil of,c ourts will not go beyond the fact of this injury to determine whether the victim of the overcharge has partially recouped.here,if a class member is overcharged,there is an injury,even if that class member suffers no damages.
fourth,defendants incorrectly treat individual prescriptions of nexium as a proxy for individual consumers.for example,defendants mistakenly cite the district court findings that only approximately percent of all class prescriptions had no overcharge and that nexium coupons were only used in percent of prescriptions,add.emphases added,to support the conclusion that at least to of the consumers more than consumers in all suffered no injury.appellant br.emphasis added.however,there is no necessary relationship between the percentage of prescriptions and the percentage of consumers since a class member may fill one prescription with an overcharge and another with no overcharge.
in light of the correct standards,we discuss each of the five allegedly uninjured groups in turn groups to.the question in each instance is whether the price absent generic foreclosure would have been lower than the actual class period price of nexium.
group.this group consists of tpps that would have allegedly paid a higher price for generic nexium than they actually paid for branded nexium during the class period.defendants contend that they were not injured because they benefitted from rebates that reduced the actual class period price for branded nexium defendants argue that group members were not injured because with the rebates,the actual class period nexium price was lower than the generic price.however,defendants have not shown that this is the case.using hughes calculations,after accounting for the rebates,the average actual class period branded nexium price was,while the generic price would have been therefore,group tpps who would have purchased generic nexium during the class period were injured.
group.tpps usually pay for the prescription drug directly and then charge plan members a copayment a flat payment or a coinsurance a percentage of the drug price.sometimes tpps incentivize generic drug purchases by plan members by charging a lower copayment for a generic drug than for its counterpart.defendants allege that under such plan arrangements,the decrease in the is more than the total net price drop,add.citing def.mem.opp.class certification,the difference between the actual branded nexium price paid for by the tpp during the class period absent generic entry and the generic price is less than the difference between the branded nexium copayment absent generic entry and the generic copayment.as a result,defendants argue that group members tpps that offered such plan arrangements suffered no injury because the decreased revenue from copayments offset the increased savings from the lower generic price.but as discussed above,that erroneous inference assumes that the decrease in copayment revenue should offset the increased actual savings in determining injury when it should not.
in any event,defendants have presented no evidence to support this prediction.rosenthal projections show that the price difference between the branded nexium price absent generic entry and the generic price would have been at the beginning of the class period and at the end.plaintiffs deposition testimony and other evidence established that a typical plan offered by tpps has only a or spread between the generic and copayments.the defendants provided no evidence of any plans with a greater spread.the record shows that there are likely no group members who were uninjured by defendants conduct.
group.some tpps,according to hughes,had fixed price agreements to pay pbms the same amount for every drug in a given therapeutic class,regardless of the actual drug price as a result,defendants claim that group tpps suffered no injury because they would have paid the same for generic nexium in the world as they actually paid for branded nexium during the class period.but the defendants did not provide any evidence that such agreements existed.rosenthal stated that she has never encountered such an agreement in her research.the district court found that hughes does not establish the actual existence of such uninjured tpp groups.add.the district court did not err in finding insufficient evidence that group actually exists.
group.this group comprises consumers who used coupons that reduced the copayment that they paid for branded nexium during the class period.the assumption is that the coupons would not have been available in the world and that the consumers would have switched to generic nexium.these coupons were offered by astrazeneca starting in august.eligible patients could use a nexium savings card to pay only an copayment for their prescription with a maximum discount of.defendants assert that group members were not injured because with coupons,the actual branded nexium copayment during the class period was lower than the generic copayment would have been.but the average branded nexium copayment with the coupon was before generic entry,while the average generic copayment would have been only.thus these consumers were likely injured as well.
group.this group comprises consumers who would continue to purchase only nexium even after generic entry,known as.there are group members who paid the actual cost of the drug,uninsured consumers or a percentage thereof,consumers with a coinsurance plan.defendants argue that these class members would have suffered no injury because,after generic entry,the price of branded nexium would have increased over the class period.defendants also contend that some plans charged a higher copayment for branded drugs than for their generic substitutes with the result that members of such plans would suffer no injury from the foreclosure of generic entry in other plans,the copayment for the branded drug increased with generic entry.as a result,defendants contend that group consumers are not injured because they would pay more with generic entry.
we agree that some group consumers were likely not injured by defendants conduct.the question is whether that is more than a de minimis number.the district court found,based on rosenthal projections,that of all prescriptions during the entire class period would have been for branded nexium.defendants argue that this shows that of the consumers were uninjured.appellant br.this does not follow for at least the following reasons 
first,the number of prescriptions is not a necessary surrogate for the number of consumers.
second,consumers who purchased nexium using cash or a coinsurance at the beginning of the class period were injured even if they made later purchases that did not reflect injury because in the early period the branded nexium price would have been lower than the actual branded nexium price in the early period.
third,a consumer was injured if he or she would have purchased generic nexium even once during the class period.because nexium is a maintenance drug,there is a high likelihood that a generic purchase would occur.indeed,only of prescriptions three years after generic entry would have been for branded nexium.significantly,state laws allow pharmacists to substitute generic products some mandate substitution unless a physician prevents substitution.
as rosenthal explained,defendants are relying on the mere hope that there is a likelihood of there being a substantial number of consumers whose only purchases during the entire class period were brand purchases.while on this record it is impossible to precisely quantify the uninjured members in group,we conclude that plaintiffs have provided more than enough evidence to meet their rule burden.
what counts as a de minimis deviation from a prescribed standard must,of course,be determined with reference to the purpose of the standard.wisconsin of revenue william wrigley.we thus define de minimis in functional terms.here,if common issues truly predominate over individualized issues in a lawsuit,then the addition or subtraction of any of the plaintiffs to or from the class should not have a substantial effect on the substance or quantity of evidence offered.vega t mobile usa,cir alteration in original,citation omitted.upon examination of the record,we see no basis for overturning the district court ultimate conclusion that the number of uninjured members here is not so large as to render the class impractical or improper,or to cause issues to predominate.nor do we see a basis for concluding the number of uninjured class members here is so large as to violate defendants amendment or due process rights,in light of the fact that uninjured members can be excluded and the district court expressly preserve d the defendants rights to challenge individual damage claims at trial.add.
plaintiffs evidence has shown that the vast majority of class members were probably injured.rigorous analysis of the evidence does not show that the number of uninjured class members is more than de minimis.the district court was well within its discretion to have found that the plaintiffs rebuttal to defendants challenges was persuasive and sufficient for a showing of common antitrust impact to the putative class.add.the defendants speculation can not defeat the plaintiffs showing.see in re urethane,at no abuse of discretion in not decertifying where plaintiffs had evidence of artificially inflated baseline for price negotiations,and defendants alleged plaintiffs could have avoided the announced price increases,such as by negotiating for a lower price or switching to a substitute emphasis added messner,at once plaintiffs had shown broad antitrust impact,certification could not be denied just because defendants pointed to a class of uninjured members but gave no indication how many such individuals actually exist kohen,at where evidence did not show great many uninjured persons,defendants pointing to possibility that unidentified number of class members were uninjured is insufficient to defeat certification,especially since defendants could depose a random sample of class members to determine how many were uninjured and could urge the district court to revisit its decision to certify see also in re whirlpool.front loading washer products liability,cir commonality not defeated simply because,though plaintiffs evidence showed washer models were nearly identical,defendants merely contended the class included owners who are pleased with the performance of their machines and are thus dissimilar to consumers who complained of a mold problem,cert.denied whirlpool glazer.
in the context of the plaintiffs having shown that the class does not consist largely of members who are ultimately shown to have suffered no harm,messner,at,the number of uninjured members here seems comparable to the percent decrease in the size of the class due to removal of uninjured members that the seventh circuit concluded was certainly not significant enough to justify denial of certification.id.at emphasis added.
defendants also raise the separate but related argument that because each putative class member has not suffered injury,the class does not have standing.
article iii standing is an indispensable part of any case that must be present at every stage of the case.see lujan defenders of wildlife,noting that standing must be supported at the successive stages of litigation.injury is a prerequisite to standing,and named plaintiffs need to satisfy this standing requirement throughout the stages of the litigation.see stearns ticketmaster,cir at least one named plaintiff must satisfy the actual injury component of standing in order to seek relief on behalf of himself or the class,cert.denied.kohen,at a s long as one member of a certified class has a plausible claim to have suffered damages,the requirement of standing is satisfied.see also dg ex rel.stricklin,at in re prudential ins.am.sales practices litig.agent actions,cir.it is undisputed that the named plaintiffs have shown that they were overcharged for at least one nexium transaction during the class period,establishing standing.see baker carr.the named plaintiffs thus have standing to sue for their injuries and to request,under rule b,that the court allow them to represent and secure a judgment on behalf of a class.
to the extent that it is necessary that each and every member of the class who secures a recovery also has standing the requirement will be satisfied only injured class members will recover 
in summary,we conclude that plaintiffs have met their burden in showing that the b requirements are met with respect to the tpps in the certified class because all tpps would have suffered injury.we also conclude that defendants have not established that more than a de minimis number of uninjured consumers are included in the certified class.
in large part,the remaining difference between plaintiffs and defendants is that the defendants would require a determination at the class certification stage as to which parties were injured and which not,whereas the plaintiffs would leave to later stages of litigation such sorting of injured and uninjured parties.we conclude that so long as it is established that such a mechanism can be identified,the presence of a de minimis number of uninjured members at the class certification stage does not defeat a class action.we conclude that such a mechanism can be identified here.the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class.
costs to appellees.
the chief difficulty we confront in this case arises from the fact that some of the members of the class have not suffered the antitrust injury upon which this entire case is predicated.this percentage,while small,could constitute as many as who would have no valid claim against the defendants under the state antitrust laws even if the named plaintiffs win on the merits.
the majority correctly recognizes that certification of a class that includes uninjured consumers hinges on there being a method of identifying and removing those consumers prior to entry of judgment,and that any such method must be both administratively feasible and protective of the defendants seventh amendment and due process rights.slip op.at.the majority also correctly recognizes that the district court has not less rigorously method for identifying and excluding these thousands of consumers prior to entry of judgment.slip op.at.rather,the district court certified the class because it considered the rule predominance inquiry satisfied by the fact that the vast majority of consumers in the class had been injured.as for the uninjured,the court simply kicked the can down the road by noting that the court preserve d the defendants right to challenge individual damage claims at trial.in re nexium esomeprazole antitrust.
the path thus marked for our court is clear.we should vacate the order certifying a class that includes uninjured consumers,and remand to the district court to proceed in accordance with the principles set forth in the majority opinion.to the extent that certification remains relevant,given the posture of the case,the possibility would remain that the plaintiffs might yet propose and the district court approve some method of culling uninjured consumers from the class in an administratively feasible manner that protects defendants rights.instead,the majority dons the hats of both plaintiffs counsel and the district court by first proposing,sua sponte,a culling method that no party has proposed limiting recovery to consumers who file affidavits and then announcing itself quite satisfied with that method.slip op.at.i therefore respectfully dissent.by upholding the district court on the basis of a culling method that it itself has fashioned,the majority errs both on the merits and as a matter of appellate procedure.
first,on the merits of the majority proposed culling method,at least one sister circuit has twice noted the limitations of using affidavits in the manner proposed by the majority.see carrera bayer,cir remanding an order certifying a class of all purchasers of a supplement in florida where documentary proof of purchase was unlikely and noting that the method of ascertaining whether someone is in the class must be administratively feasible and that affidavits of purchase are not sufficient marcus bmw of,llc,cir remanding a class certification order on the grounds that a class of original purchasers of bmws with tires during the class period was not readily ascertainable via a reliable,administratively feasible method,and cautioning against including class members based on mere affidavits that their tires had gone flat.
the majority response to the persuasive force of this precedent is fashioned out of a vacuum.the majority cites madison chalmette refining,llc,cir,a case that both makes no mention of affidavits and actually reverses a class certification order because the district court failed to analyze in detail how individual issues would be resolved at trial,and instead took a approach.at quoting robinson texas auto.dealers ass n,cir.
but regardless of whether or not affidavits may have a role to play in this or any class action,the larger issue is that a court of appeals should not assume that rule has been satisfied on the basis of a culling method that it itself has proposed.many circuit court judges have little to no substantial experience with the nuts and bolts of class litigation,so fashioning litigation management devices is not in our institutional wheelhouse.many of the facts relevant to assessing whether a certain management procedure will achieve a certain objective will not be discernible by a court until one party proposes it,and the other has a chance to critique it.at that point,the district court would usually weigh the pros and cons of the procedure and make a decision,employing the fair amount of discretion assigned to it.we,in turn,come along at or near the end of the process.and we are pretty good at explaining the principles that cabin the district court exercise of discretion,and at analyzing what by that point have usually become stationary targets presented in competing briefs.
the majority opinion,in contrast,skips all that.it simply assumes that the question of how uninjured consumers can be identified and excluded can be answered with affidavits untested by the adversary system,unexamined by any trial judge,and fashioned without awareness of its fit to the parties needs and goals,the majority method raises more questions than it answers.will it require two forms of notice to class to tpps and one to consumers what happens to those consumers who do not return an affidavit of whom there may be many,given the low dollar amount of any potential recovery will they be deemed to have opted out of the class or will they be deemed to have remained in,but lost their claims due to lack of injury even more daunting,what happens if tens or hundreds of thousands of nexium purchasers file affidavits how exactly will defendants exercise their acknowledged right to challenge individual damage claims at trial will the defendants seek to depose everyone who has returned an affidavit,effectively challenging plaintiffs counsel to a discovery game of chicken the majority simply hedges on these questions by assuming without any basis at all,and likely unreasonably that the affidavits will be unrefuted.
throwing up an idea to see if it might stick is just not what courts of appeals do best.rather,it is only after the adversaries have gone to the mat and the dust has settled that we can fairly review a district court assessment of whether a proposed method would be feasible.for this reason,if the district court does not identify a culling method to ensure that the class,by judgment,includes only members who were actually injured,this court has no business simply hoping that one will work.see.of the sw.falcon,noting that actual,not presumed,conformance with the rule is indispensable in re new motor vehicles can.exp.antitrust,cir requiring the district court to evaluate a proposed model for proving fact of injury prior to certification.in this important respect,any attempt to reconcile the majority holding with the approach taken by our circuit in new motor vehicles will result in hopeless confusion unless one concludes that the dissent in new motor vehicles has become the law without en banc review.
on a related note,i must also part company with the majority dalliance with a rule inspired by the seventh circuit decision in messner northshore university healthsystem,cir.the majority quite rightly says that the test for determining whether the inclusion of uninjured class members should defeat class certification is functional.slip op.at.but then it backslides it notes that a decrease in the size of the class due to the removal of uninjured members was not so large as to defeat certification in messner,at,and concludes that the number of uninjured members here seems comparable to the number in messner.slip op.at.
if is okay,why not or any number under the percentage tells one almost nothing about the functional sufficiency of the method.the relevant inquiry for a court considering certifying a class that includes uninjured members is whether the court will be able to feasibly cull out those members before entry of judgment.it may be relatively easy to cull out of a class of.culling out of million is almost certainly not.here,just is likely to be at least people.moreover,nobody knows who the are.so the culling process may need to review individually all the affidavits of class members who return them.how this is feasible,the majority does not explain 
i also take issue with the majority suggestion that when a proposed class includes some uninjured members who will have to be removed,it is the defendants who bear the burden of demonstrating that it can not be done.the supreme court has been clear that the party seeking certification bears the burden of demonstrating that the requirements of rule are satisfied.wal mart stores,dukes.so,too,has this circuit.smilow sw.bell mobile systems,inc,cir.
the majority acknowledges this,slip op.at,and yet goes on to suggest the opposite defendants have merely speculated that a mechanism for exclusion can not be developed later.this is not enough to overcome plaintiffs case for having met the requirements of rule.slip op.at.but plaintiffs have not met their burden because,as the majority acknowledges,the proposed class includes some number of uninjured members,slip op.at,and the plaintiffs have not explained how they will be removed before judgment,slip op.at.it is also notable that the majority felt compelled to propose a culling method sua sponte if the plaintiffs had indeed met their burden,this step would not be necessary.when the plaintiffs have only shown that the number of uninjured members is relatively small,the class still can not satisfy rule unless there exists a method for excluding those uninjured members prior to judgment.in such a context,it is no more the defendants burden to prove that this can not be done than it is this court job to come up with a way that it can.wallace roderick revocable living trust xto energy,cir vacating a certification order in part because the district court appeared to shift the burden to the defendant to prove lack of commonality.
finally,it bears noting that in the time that this interlocutory appeal was pending,the district court tried most of the liability issues in this case,leaving the end payors for a future proceeding.that trial concluded with a defense verdict just as these opinions were about to issue.the district court solicited no affidavits from consumers,nor does it appear that there was a plan to do so.so even if the majority proposed culling method were tenable,we know that the district court did not employ it.in short,the majority affirms a certification order based entirely on a fiction that we know to be false.and unless intervention is allowed,but see am.pipe constr.utah,discussing the history and application of the intervention rule,it is likely too late to let class members after taking a peek at the verdict.
these changing facts on the ground warrant caution before affirming a class certification order based on a possibility that the district court might do something that it did not do,and which it is likely that it could not do.will there be an appeal from the verdict that will succeed is there any plan to send notice is the basis for interlocutory review now eliminated although i agree entirely with the key principle that serves as the predicate for the majority opinion that certification of a class that includes uninjured members is possible if the district court identifies a feasible method for culling those members prior to entry of judgment in a way that protects defendants rights i do not believe that the majority has properly applied that principle in this case.i respectfully dissent.
