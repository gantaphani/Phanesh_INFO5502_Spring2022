this appeal challenges the district court dismissal,under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for failure to state a valid claim for relief,of a complaint alleging that the defendant monopolized two product markets by enforcing a patent that had been obtained by fraud on the patent and trademark office,infringed a different patent that the appellant owns,and breached a contract between the parties.we reverse the dismissal of the antitrust and patent claims,vacate the dismissal of the state law claim,and remand for further proceedings.
industry background.according to the second amended complaint,the appellants hydril company and hydril collectively hydril manufacture threaded connections for interlocking lengths of drill pipe used in drilling oil and gas wells.pls.am.compl.hydril does not itself make drill pipe,but outside the united states it sometimes sells finished drill pipe that uses its connections and pipe manufactured by someone else.id.the appellee grant prideco,grant prideco manufactures and sells both drill pipe and its own line of connections.id.
hydril generally sells its connections to drill pipe distributors who are assembling finished drill pipe for an,id,which typically is a drilling contractor or a major oil company.id.finished drill pipe is usually specially manufactured to meet an order from the.id.this case involves drill pipe whose diameter is product that,hydril alleges,has unique characteristics for certain types of drilling.id.
b.the antitrust claim.this claim involves grant prideco united states patent the patent,which covers a combination of raw pipe with specified diameters and connections that fit such pipe.id.
paragraph of the complaint encapsulates the antitrust claim as follows 
under the theory of walker process equipment,food machinery chemical,d,grant prideco has violated section of the sherman act by obtaining and maintaining market power in the relevant markets by use of threats to enforce a patent that grant prideco knew was procured by fraud.
the alleged fraud was that d uring the application process for the patent,grant prideco failed to disclose to the uspto material prior art of which grant prideco was aware.id.the complaint referred to various items of prior art that grant prideco failed to disclose,id,and stated 
the patent as issued would not have been granted to grant prideco had grant prideco not omitted from its disclosures such known information on the prior art,including its own prior sales of covered technology.
the complaint further stated that grant prideco concealment of prior art from the uspto continued even after the patent issued and that grant prideco filing for reissue with disclosure of only selective prior art was also an attempt to practice fraud on the uspto.id.
the complaint described the relevant product markets as the market for connections used with inch outer diameter pipe and the market for finished inch drill pipe.id.it stated that the relevant geographic markets for both products were worldwide.id.
the complaint alleged that 
grant prideco has obtained and maintained its market power in the relevant markets by wrongfully threatening to enforce the patent against other market participants,including connections manufacturers,drill pipe distributors,and.grant prideco has obtained a dominant position in the sale of connections of all sizes for use with inch drill pipe,making a substantial portion of all sales of connections for such use.similarly,grant prideco dominates the inch drill pipe market grant prideco makes a substantial portion of all sales of finished inch drill pipe worldwide.
finally,the alleged use of threats to enforce a fraudulently procured patent was that 
grant prideco has widely publicized the existence of the patent to the industry in general,and also has directed communications to particular industry participants suggesting that grant prideco would act aggressively to challenge activities that it saw as potentially infringing.for example,on january,grant prideco outside patent counsel wrote a letter to omsco,a drill pipe distributor that holds license rights to manufacture hydril wedge thread tool joints.the letter asserted that certain orders from omsco customers for inch pipe with tool joints may violate the patent.the orders referenced were presumably from the drilling contractor atwood oceanics,which was copied on letter.the letter suggested that omsco take action to ensure that grant prideco patent rights are being respected in connection with omsco sales of drill pipe.grant prideco letter was intended and understood to be a threat to omsco to refrain from sales of inch drill pipe.on information and belief,grant prideco also communicated a similar message asserting its patent to others in the pipe and drilling industries,including diamond offshore,tuboscope,and riteco.
c.the breach of contract and patent infringement claims.these claims arise out of the following allegations in the complaint grant prideco has breached a technology licensing agreement with hydril and violated hydril patent rights over wedge thread technology,which is a technology developed by hydril for making connections between neighboring pieces of pipe,tubing,or conduit.id.hydril united states patent reissue the patent covers some of that technology.id.
in the late,former hydril employees with extensive knowledge of hydril wedge thread technology left the company and founded xls holding,and xl systems,collectively,xls.after xls began marketing wedge thread connections without a license to use hydril intellectual property,hydril sued xls for misappropriation of trade secrets and,and for patent infringement.that lawsuit settled in on confidential terms,with hydril receiving an equity stake in xls.following,and as part of the settlement,xls focused its wedge technology activities on connections inches and over,and hydril focused its wedge technology activities on connections less than inches.id.
in august,the owners of xls including hydril sold the equity of the company to an affiliate of grant prideco.merger agreement.grant prideco and its other affiliates had never before offered wedge thread technology.accordingly,in connection with the transaction,hydril,grant prideco,and various related entities executed a license sharing agreement known as the wedge thread license agreement wedge agreement,id,which the record shows was an exhibit to the merger agreement and which both hydril and grant prideco signed.
under the wedge agreement,hydril granted grant prideco the exclusive right to use hydril existing intellectual property,including the protected and trade secrets,on wedge technology to make connections,thus allowing grant prideco to essentially continue xls business.
in exchange,grant prideco granted hydril the exclusive license to use xls wedge thread patents,trade secrets,and to make connections.
under the exclusivity provisions of the wedge agreement,grant prideco is restricted from using the licensed intellectual property and from its business to develop connections.similarly,hydril is restricted from using the licensed intellectual property or from its business to develop connections.
under those provisions either party could develop products in the other field,so long as it did so completely independently of the intellectual property and of its existing business.id.
grant prideco has materially breached its obligations under the wedge agreement by improperly disclosing intellectual property and by improperly using intellectual property it agreed would be used only for connections as part of grant prideco development of connections.id.the complaint described various actions by grant prideco that constituted the alleged breaches of the confidentiality provisions of the wedge agreement.id.
according to the complaint,the foregoing activities by grant prideco constituted a material breach of the wedge agreement and ended grant prideco license to hydril patents,trade secrets,and.id.thus,hydril alleges,as a result of the termination of the wedge agreement,grant prideco actions infringed hydril patent.id.
d.the district court decision.in two separate opinions,the district court dismissed the antitrust and patent claims for failure to state a valid claim for relief,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
in dismissing the antitrust claim,the district court held that b ecause hydril has failed to allege enforcement activity by grant prideco which would create an objectively reasonable apprehension that grant prideco intended to enforce the patent against hydril,plaintiffs have failed to allege the minimum level of enforcement necessary to state a walker process claim against grant prideco.hydril,grant prideco,d,hydril ii.the court stated that neither plaintiff alleges enforcement activity by grant prideco which would create an objectively reasonable apprehension that grant prideco might sue hydril for patent infringement and that the january letter to omsco does not contain an explicit threat or other language which,under the totality of the circumstances,could create a reasonable apprehension on hydril part that grant prideco might sue it for patent infringement.there is no allegation that any similar letters sent by grant prideco or its counsel to others in the pipe and drilling industry were more explicit or otherwise indicated grant prideco intention to enforce the patent against hydril or others.id.at.
the district court dismissed the patent claim on the ground that,in a provision of the merger agreement between hydril and grant prideco section,discussed in part iii below,the parties waived the right to sue for patent infringement relating to this agreement and provided only a breach of contract remedy for such claims.hydril,grant prideco,no,wl,at.june,hydril i.it concluded that hydril agreed in a of the merger agreement to waive its right to enforce its statutory rights in the patent against grant prideco.id.at 
finally,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law breach of contract claim,which it denied without prejudice to the plaintiffs refiling it in state court.hydril ii at.
a.in walker process,the supreme court concluded that the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the patent office may be violative of of the sherman act provided the other elements necessary to a case are present.at.it stated that walker process alleged that food machinery obtained the patent by knowingly and willfully misrepresenting facts to the patent office.proof of this assertion would be sufficient to strip food machinery of its exemption from the antitrust laws that the patent provided.id.at.the court pointed out that t o establish monopolization or attempt to monopolize under of the sherman act,it would then be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal patent claim in terms of the relevant market for the product involved.id.
this court has consistently explained that walker process fraud is a variant of common law fraud,and that the elements of common law fraud include a representation of a material fact,the falsity of that representation,and the intent to deceive or,at least,a state of mind so reckless as to the consequences that it is held to be the equivalent of intent scienter.unitherm food,citations omitted,rev on other grounds,d.
as noted,hydril complaint alleged that grant prideco had fraudulently obtained its patent by fail ing to disclose to the uspto material prior art of which it was aware which the complaint described and that t he patent as issued would not have been granted to grant prideco had grant prideco not omitted from its disclosures such known information on the prior art.if hydril can prove these allegations,they would ground a claim of monopolization in violation of of the sherman act because they would be sufficient to strip grant prideco of its exemption from the antitrust laws its patent would otherwise provide.walker process,at.footnote omitted.
the complaint alleges that grant prideco obtained its patent by knowingly and deliberately concealing from the patent office prior art that it knew would have resulted in a denial of its application.since neither the patent application nor the prosecution history is before us,we can not tell whether it is contended that in obtaining the patent grant prideco made affirmative misstatements to the patent office about the prior art.walker process,where the complaint alleged fraud on the basis that food machinery had sworn before the patent office that it neither knew nor believed that its invention had been in public use in the united states for more than one year prior to filing its patent application when,in fact,food machinery was a party to prior use within such time.at.in any event,the complaint allegations here go far beyond a simple failure to disclose to the patent office prior art that the examiner would have deemed material.
under our precedent,the conduct alleged in hydril complaint would constitute walker process fraud.nobelpharma ab implant innovations,we agree that if the evidence shows that the asserted patent was acquired by means of either a fraudulent misrepresentation or a fraudulent omission and that the party asserting the patent was aware of the fraud when bringing suit,such conduct can expose a patentee to liability under the antitrust laws.we arrive at this conclusion because a fraudulent omission can be just as reprehensible as a fraudulent misrepresentation.
b.the district court dismissed the antitrust claim because hydril failed to allege the minimum level of enforcement necessary to state a walker process claim against grant prideco,since it did not allege enforcement activity by grant prideco which would create an objectively reasonable apprehension that grant prideco intended to enforce the patent against hydril.hydril ii at.it is unclear whether the defect the court discerned in hydril complaint was a failure to allege sufficient enforcement activity by grant prideco,such as would create a reasonable expectation that grant prideco would file patent infringement litigation,or a failure to threaten such activity against hydril itself rather than against hydril customers.neither ground,however,justifies dismissal of the complaint at what the district court described as the very early stages of the case.id.
in relying on the enforcement ground,the district court noted our statement in unitherm that as a matter of federal circuit antitrust law,the standards that we have developed for determining jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action of patent invalidity also define the minimum level of enforcement necessary to expose the patentee to a walker process claim for attempted monopolization.id.citing unitherm,at.to the extent the district court ruling may have been based on hydril failure to allege threatened enforcement action against hydril rather than against its customers,a valid walker process claim may be based upon enforcement activity directed against the plaintiff customers.threats of patent litigation against customers,based on a patent,with a reasonable likelihood that such threats will cause the customers to cease dealing with their supplier,is the kind of economic coercion that the antitrust laws are intended to prevent.a supplier may be equally injured if it loses its share of the market because its customers stop dealing with it than if its competitor directs its monopolistic endeavors against the supplier itself.without customers,a supplier has no business.
our recent decision in microchip technology v.the chamberlain group,does not require a different conclusion.there we held that a district court did not have jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act to entertain a suit raising various patent issues,because the threats of enforcement litigation directed against the patentee customers failed to satisfy the first part of our test for declaratory judgment the declaratory plaintiff must establish a reasonable apprehension that it will face a patent infringement suit if it commences or continues the activity at issue.id.at.for the reasons previously given,we decline to extend that ruling to invalidate a walker process claim alleging threats of infringement litigation directed against a supplier customers by the holder
