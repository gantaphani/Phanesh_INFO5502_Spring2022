this appeal involves the extent to which the united states antitrust laws apply to conduct directed at foreign markets.the plaintiffs have filed a class action against the two largest auction houses in the international plc christie and sotheby holdings,sotheby and a number of their local subsidiaries,directors and officers.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants entered into an agreement to fix the prices they charged their clients for their services as auctioneers.the plaintiffs all made purchases or sold goods in auctions held outside the united states and claim that they were injured because they paid inflated commissions to the defendants.the defendants have already reached a settlement with a class of plaintiffs who made purchases or sold goods in domestic auctions.
prior to,the law in this circuit was that in order for conduct directed at foreign markets to be the basis of an antitrust action in federal court,it must have the effect of injuries to united states commerce which reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation national bank of canada interbank card,cir.that year congress passed the foreign trade antitrust improvements act of,stat.codified at the ftaia,which the defendants contend exempts their alleged conduct from scrutiny under the antitrust laws.the plaintiffs claim that the ftaia does not apply to this case and would not bar their antitrust suit against the defendants even if it were to apply.
the issue raised by this appeal,which is one of first impression in this circuit,is the degree to which the ftaia alters prior law,in our circuit the national bank of canada rule,with respect to the effect that anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets must have on domestic commerce to be actionable under the antitrust laws.in dismissing the plaintiffs case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the district court concluded that the ftaia permits suit,insofar as is relevant here,only where the conduct complained of had direct,substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects in the united states and the effects giving rise to jurisdiction also are the basis for the alleged injury.kruman christie int l plc,d.under this interpretation,the requisite domestic effect must cause the injury suffered by the plaintiff bringing the suit.we hold that this interpretation of the ftaia can not be reconciled with the unambiguous text of the statute.the ftaia does not alter the national bank of canada rule,under which anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets is only regulated by the sherman act if it has the effect of causing injury to domestic commerce by reducing the competitiveness of a domestic market or making possible anticompetitive conduct directed at domestic commerce.we conclude that the defendants alleged conduct qualifies under either prong of this test.
we affirm the district court ruling that the ftaia is applicable to the defendants alleged conduct.however,because the plaintiffs complaint describes conduct that has the requisite effect on domestic commerce under the ftaia to be regulated by the sherman act,we vacate the district court judgment granting the defendants motion to dismiss and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on an appeal from a district court dismissal of a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see filetech france telecom,cir.while a district court may resolve disputed jurisdictional issues of fact through reference to evidence outside of the pleadings,see id.at,the district court in this case assumed that all of the facts alleged by the plaintiffs were true and based its dismissal solely on legal grounds.thus,we also assume for the purposes of this appeal that the plaintiffs factual allegations are true.
i.the allegations of price fixing 
christie,a united kingdom corporation,and sotheby,a michigan corporation,are respectively the world first and second largest auctioneers of fine art,antiques,collectibles,and other items,together controlling of the market.christie and sotheby conduct auctions at various locations around the world,including london and new york city.at these auctions,in return for the auctioneer services,the purchaser of an auctioned item pays the auctioneer a buyer premium,while the seller of the auctioned item pays the auctioneer a seller commission.these fees are calculated as a percentage of the purchase price of the auctioned item.
from late until at least february,the defendants agreed to set the buyer premiums charged by christie and sotheby at identical levels.on november,sotheby announced it would increase its buyer premiums from to for the first of the purchase price.on december,christie declared an identical increase in its buyer premiums.the defendants allegedly agreed not to reduce these premiums.
the defendants allegedly agreed not to reduce these premiums.the defendants also agreed to set their seller commissions at identical levels.prior to march,the defendants would permit clients to negotiate smaller seller commissions.on or about march,christie announced it would implement a fixed schedule of seller commissions ranging between and depending on the value of the item to be sold.on april,sotheby stated it would implement a fixed schedule of seller commissions substantially identical to the schedule set by christie.
moreover,the defendants allegedly conspired to coordinate their policies and procedures in other areas.they agreed to restrict the ability of sellers to negotiate the terms of loans they received before the sale of their works,exchanged preferred client lists,and otherwise monitored each other businesses to prevent cheating.
after the justice department initiated an antitrust investigation in,on january,christie admitted it had uncovered information relevant to the investigation and disclosed that it had been granted conditional amnesty by the justice department in exchange for its cooperation with federal authorities.
ii.the plaintiffs action and its dismissal by the district court 
soon after the announcement by christie,a number of litigants filed class action lawsuits alleging that christie and sotheby had violated the antitrust laws through.these lawsuits were consolidated into one action in the southern district of new york and on april,the district court certified a class the domestic class consisting of all persons who purchased from or sold through defendants items offered at or sold through defendants auctions held in the united states between january,and february.in re auction houses antitrust.in may,the district court selected lead counsel for the domestic class.see in re auction houses antitrust.
beginning in august,a number of individuals who purchased goods at auctions conducted outside the united states filed three actions against the defendants alleging claims under the antitrust laws and customary international law.these individuals sought class certification for a class the foreign class consisting of all persons who a purchased any items at an auction excluding internet transactions conducted outside of the united states by christie or sotheby between january,and february,and paid to christie or sotheby a buyer premium b sold any items through an auction excluding internet transactions conducted outside of the united states by christie or sotheby between september,and february,and paid a seller commission to christie or sotheby.the actions brought by the foreign class were consolidated with the class action brought by the domestic class although lead counsel for the domestic class was not lead counsel for the foreign class.
on september,the parties to the domestic class action informed the district court that they had reached an agreement in principle to settle the case.see in re auction houses antitrust,civ,wl,at.on october,the district court set a schedule for the foreign class action,requiring the plaintiffs to file their consolidated amended complaint by october,the defendants to answer or file any responsive motions by november,the plaintiffs to respond to the defendants motions by december,and the defendants to reply by december.
the foreign class plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint on october.there are eight foreign class plaintiffs,four from the united states and four from foreign nations.they bring an action pursuant to sections and of the clayton act,alleging that the defendants violated sections and of the sherman act,by agreeing to fix their buyer premiums and seller commissions.the plaintiffs also alleged that this conduct violated customary international law the plaintiffs seek damages,including treble damages,and injunctive relief.
on november,the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on a number of grounds including lack of subject matter jurisdiction,lack of standing,and improper venue.in response,the plaintiffs submitted an affidavit from an economist stating that the defendants market is worldwide and the prices of their services in the united states and abroad are linked by the same laws of supply and demand.kruman,d at.on january,the district court granted the defendants motion based on the first ground,lack of subject matter jurisdiction id.at.
in its thoughtful opinion discussing its reasons for dismissing the plaintiffs case,the district court framed the issue as whether a transnational price fixing conspiracy that affects commerce both in the united states and in other countries inevitably gives persons injured abroad in transactions otherwise unconnected with the united states a remedy under our antitrust laws.kruman,d at.the district court answered its question in the negative based on its reading of the ftaia and its legislative history.after citing portions of the house judiciary committee report,the district court concluded that the ftaia permits suit,insofar as is relevant here,only where the conduct complained of had direct,substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects in the united states and the effects giving rise to jurisdiction also are the basis for the alleged injury.id.at.
the district court determined that while there were many ways to define the word conduct,for purposes of the ftaia it means t he precise acts that caused injury,in this case,the imposition of charges for auction services at levels determined or affected by the illicit agreement.kruman,d at.because the plaintiffs in the foreign class only complained of paying inflated prices at foreign auctions,the district court continued,they suffered no domestic injury.thus,the conduct that was the basis of their complaint did not have direct,substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects domestically that caused the injuries to be remedied.id.at.put another way,while the imposition of high prices may have had an effect on the united states,this domestic effect did not give rise to the plaintiffs injury,which was suffered in another country.hence,according to the district court,only plaintiffs who suffer injury arising from anticompetitive conduct that affects a domestic market can bring an antitrust claim.
the district court noted that its conclusion was an application of the principle of prescriptive jurisdiction,which limits the power of the united states to regulate conduct without a substantial effect within its territory.kruman,d at.the district court also rejected the plaintiffs argument that the ftaia did not apply because part of the conduct occurred domestically,finding that the relevant conduct occurred overseas.id.furthermore,the court found unpersuasive the plaintiff argument that their allegations involved import commerce,to which the ftaia does not apply.id.lastly,the district court dismissed the claim arising under customary international law because there is no substantial support for the proposition that there is an international consensus proscribing price fixing that fairly might be characterized as customary international law id.at.
after the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration.the district court denied the motion.the plaintiffs then moved to file an affidavit and exhibits with the district court.the district court denied the motion and observed that the materials would not have altered its decision to dismiss the case.kruman christie int l plc,civ,wl,at march.
the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and this appeal ensued.
discussion 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants entered into an agreement to fix the prices they charged for their services as auctioneers.part of the agreement was directed at fixing the prices in foreign auctions.section of the sherman act proscribes e very contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations.a agreement is unlawful per se under the sherman act,meaning that it is illegal regardless of whether it affects prices or reduces competition in a market.see united states oil.before turning to the ftaia,we find it helpful to begin with a discussion of the application of the antitrust laws to conduct directed at foreign markets.
application of the antitrust laws to conduct directed at foreign markets 
the antitrust laws strive to foster competition in our domestic markets.see phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law the general goal of the antitrust laws is to promote competition.while the antitrust laws do not extend to conduct that exclusively affects foreign markets,see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d american antitrust laws do not regulate the competitive conditions of other nations economies.citations omitted,anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets can also directly affect the competitiveness of our domestic markets.there is a distinction between anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets that only affects the competitiveness of foreign markets and anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets that directly affects the competitiveness of domestic markets.the antitrust laws apply to the latter sort of conduct and not the former.our markets benefit when antitrust suits stop or deter any conduct that reduces competition in our markets regardless of where it occurs and whether it is also directed at foreign markets.on the other hand,our markets do not benefit when antitrust suits stop or deter anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets without an effect on our markets.
ever since judge learned hand seminal opinion in united states aluminum of america,cir alcoa,it has been clear that the focus in determining whether the antitrust laws govern conduct is the conduct effect on the domestic market rather than the situs of the conduct itself.under what was called the effects test,foreign conduct was actionable under our antitrust laws if it was intended to affect domestic commerce and actually did so.see id.at.in contrast,w e should not impute to congress an intent to punish all whom its courts can catch,for conduct which has no consequences within the united states.id.at citations omitted.the supreme court recently reaffirmed these fundamental principles when it stated that it is well established by now that the sherman act applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the united states.hartford fire ins.california,d citations omitted.
in this circuit,though,we have recognized that an unmodified effects test is too broad in its regulation of conduct.if conduct affecting foreign markets has a substantial but beneficial effect on our markets,such conduct does not implicate the concerns of the antitrust laws,which are meant to protect our markets from negative effects.thus,just prior to the passage of the ftaia,we modified the effects test by giving the term effect a specific and narrower meaning than its common usage.in national bank of canada,we held that we only have jurisdiction to hear an antitrust claim arising out of conduct directed at foreign markets if the conduct had the effect of injuries to united states commerce which reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation national bank of canada,at.in other words,under national bank of canada,the antitrust laws apply to anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets only if such conduct injures domestic commerce by either reducing the competitiveness of a domestic market or making possible anticompetitive conduct directed at domestic commerce.
the first prong of the national bank of canada test would clearly encompass a situation where anticompetitive conduct is directed at both foreign and domestic markets and actually reduces the competitiveness of the domestic market.the mere fact that such conduct targets a foreign market in addition to a domestic market does not mean that it should be exempt from our antitrust laws.if such a course of conduct is successful and reduces the competitiveness of our markets,it would certainly fall within our antitrust laws.the second prong of the national bank of canada test encompasses a situation where anticompetitive conduct is directed only at a foreign market,but has the effect of allowing a separate course of conduct that directly affects the competitiveness of our domestic markets.again,because such conduct affects the competitiveness of our domestic markets,the antitrust laws apply.
ii.the ftaia 
the district court dismissed the plaintiffs action based on its reading of the ftaia,which provides 
sections to of this title shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce other than import trade or import commerce with foreign nations unless 
such conduct has a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect 
a on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations,or on import trade or import commerce with foreign nations or 
b on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations,of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the united states and 
such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections to of this title,other than this section.
if sections to of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph b,then sections to of this title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the united states.
the ftaia was intended to exempt from the sherman act export transactions that did not injure the united states economy,hartford fire ins,at.citing,at,code cong.admin.news at,and also enacted a single,objective direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect test that will serve as a simple and straightforward clarification of existing american law,at,code cong.admin.news at emphasis added.the issue on this appeal is whether the ftaia amends existing law or merely codifies it.hartford fire ins,at.the supreme court has not addressed this issue and it is one of first impression in this circuit.
applicability of the ftaia 
initially,the plaintiffs contend that the ftaia does not apply because some of the meetings concerning the agreement to fix prices occurred in the united states.but this interpretation of the ftaia would mean that an agreement to fix prices in an overseas foreign market that had no effect on domestic commerce could be the basis of an antitrust suit as long as some of the meetings negotiating the agreement occurred in the united states.this would alter the longstanding rule articulated in alcoa and reaffirmed in hartford fire ins.that it is the effect and not the location of the conduct that determines whether the antitrust laws apply,and that the antitrust laws do not regulate conduct without a substantial effect on domestic markets.as the house judiciary committee report accompanying the ftaia legislation stated approvingly since judge learned hand opinion in united states aluminum of america,cir,it has been relatively clear that it is the situs of the effects,as opposed to the conduct,that determines whether united states antitrust law applies,at,code cong.admin.news at.the application of the ftaia hinges on whether the conduct involves foreign trade or commerce.clearly,when there is conduct directed at reducing the competitiveness of a foreign market,as there was in this case,such conduct involves foreign trade or commerce,regardless of whether some of the conduct occurred in the united states.
the plaintiffs also claim that this is a case involving import trade or import commerce,to which the ftaia does not apply.the relevant inquiry is whether the conduct of the the import trade or commerce.see carpet group int l oriental rug importers ass n,cir.the plaintiffs did not describe conduct by the defendants that was directed at an import market.to the contrary,the defendants conspiracy appears to have been directed at controlling the prices they charged for their services in foreign auctions.as the district court aptly observed,t he commerce that is the focus of this case is the charging of fixed commissions on the purchase and sale of goods at foreign auctions,not the trade in and subsequent movement of the goods that were purchased and sold.kruman,d at.while some of the goods purchased in those auctions may ultimately have been imported by individuals in the united states,the object of the conspiracy was the price that the defendants charged for their auction services,not any import market for those goods.
we affirm the district court ruling that the ftaia applies to the plaintiffs allegations concerning the defendants conduct.
b.the meaning of the ftaia 
recall that prior to the ftaia,in this circuit,the antitrust laws only applied to anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets if it caused injury to domestic commerce either by reducing the competitiveness of a domestic market or making possible anticompetitive conduct directed at domestic commerce.the district court concluded that the ftaia added another requirement to this standard.it held that the ftaia permits suit,insofar as is relevant here,only where the conduct complained of had direct,substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects in the united states and the effects giving rise to jurisdiction also are the basis for the alleged injury.kruman,d at see also den norske stats oljeselskap as heeremac vof,cir,cert.denied,d.the district court interpreted the word conduct in the ftaia as meaning t he precise acts that caused injury,in this case,the imposition of charges for auction services at levels determined or affected by the illicit agreement.kruman,d at.
the defendants argue that the ftaia adds a new plaintiff injury element to prior law,specifically a requirement that defendants are only liable to plaintiffs who suffer injuries in domestic commerce.put another way,the defendants claim that the ftaia sets rules with respect to which plaintiffs can bring suit for anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets.under the defendants interpretation of the ftaia,such conduct must not only have a domestic effect that is anticompetitive,but only plaintiffs who suffer injury from that domestic effect are permitted to bring a clayton act suit for that conduct.the implication of this reading is that plaintiffs who are injured overseas by anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets are barred from bringing suit,even if such conduct has hurt the competitiveness of our markets.
we find that an interpretation centered on whether the plaintiff has suffered domestic injury can not be squared with the text of the ftaia.the statute only refers to the word injury once and does so in the context of conduct with an effect on export markets.the final sentence or proviso of the ftaia provides if sections to of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph b,in other words,only because the conduct affects export trade with foreign nations then sections to of this title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the united states.this injury element,on its face,applies only to a subset of the conduct covered by the ftaia.the defendants,though,would have us apply an injury requirement not only to that narrow category of conduct,but to all conduct within the ambit of the ftaia.however,if the main provisions of the ftaia were interpreted as the defendants allowing a remedy only for domestic injury caused by anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign the proviso would be superfluous.see,den norske stats oljeselskap,at higginbotham,dissenting.
by proposing that the ftaia contains a broader plaintiff injury requirement than can be supported by its text,the defendants assume that the ftaia,which is an amendment to the sherman act,see,at,code cong.admin.news at,determines which plaintiffs have the right to bring a private cause of action for antitrust injury caused by conduct directed at foreign markets.in doing so,they conflate the ftaia with the clayton act,which is the statute that determines whether a plaintiff may bring a private cause of action for a violation of the antitrust laws based on its actual or threatened injury.for example,section of the clayton act gives any person injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws,the right to a federal action for treble damages.see generally associated contractors california state council of carpenters,d deriving requirement that a plaintiff suffer antitrust injury from section of the clayton act i t is section of the clayton act that gives rise to the antitrust injury requirement,not sections or of the sherman act.indiana grocery,super valu stores,cir.
generally,in the antitrust context,the issue of whether a plaintiff has suffered an injury is only relevant to the clayton act.the sherman act primarily deals with defendants.it defines substantive standards that prohibit certain forms of anticompetitive conduct by defendants.the clayton act deals with plaintiffs.it sets forth the requirement that a plaintiff must suffer an injury or be threatened with an injury caused by a sherman act violation in order to bring suit.the conduct and injury requirements of the sherman and clayton acts operate independently.the existence of a sherman act violation does not depend on whether anyone has actually suffered an injury.conduct may violate the sherman act but not be actionable under section of the clayton act because it did not cause injury.see,indiana grocery,at the mere presence of a substantive sherman act section violation does not by itself bestow on any plaintiff a private right of action for damages.on the other hand,while actual injury is required to seek treble damages under section of the clayton act,a plaintiff may bring an antitrust action seeking prospective injunctive relief under section of the clayton act for conduct violating the sherman act without suffering an actual injury.see mclain real estate bd.of new orleans,d noting that an inability to establish injury for conduct violating the sherman act only confines the available remedy to injunctive relief zenith radio hazeltine research,d noting that remedy of injunctive relief is available under the clayton act even though the plaintiff has not yet suffered actual injury citation omitted.a plaintiff injury,whether actual or threatened,is relevant to the clayton act,which gives a plaintiff the right to bring suit,and not the sherman act,which sets forth substantive rules governing conduct.
finally,the sherman act contains its own enforcement provision that can be invoked by the united states even when no plaintiff has suffered an injury.under the sherman act,federal district courts are invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of sections to of this title and it shall be the duty of the several united states attorneys under the direction of the attorney general,to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations.this section allows the federal government to bring an equity action to enjoin a violation of the sherman act.actions brought for injuries pursuant to the clayton act are only one way in which the sherman act can be enforced.
the substantive provisions of the sherman act determine what conduct by the defendant is actionable.the clayton act determines what injury a plaintiff must suffer in order to bring suit.thus,when the defendants argue that the ftaia permits liability only for domestic injuries caused by anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets,they are asking us to amend the ftaia by incorporating a concept from the clayton act.
the ftaia exempts certain forms of anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets from antitrust scrutiny.the text of the ftaia clearly reveals that its focus is not on the plaintiff injury but on the defendant conduct,which is regulated by the sherman act.the ftaia does not regulate which plaintiffs can bring suit under the clayton act,and it would be inappropriate to import the element of injury from the clayton act and graft it onto the ftaia.the ftaia mandates s ections to of this title shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce other than import trade or import commerce with foreign nations.the ftaia is an amendment to the sherman act,see,at,code cong.admin.news at,so when the ftaia refers to s ections to of this title,it is referencing the sherman act thus,the word conduct refers to any conduct that would violate sections to of the sherman act absent the ftaia.such conduct necessarily focuses on the acts of the defendant,not the injury to the plaintiff needed to bring a clayton act action.
the district court interpreted the word conduct to mean t he precise acts that caused injury,which in this case was the imposition of charges for auction services at levels determined or affected by the illicit agreement.kruman,d at.but as discussed earlier,conduct only refers to acts that are illegal under the sherman act.the illegal act in this case was not the imposition of high prices but the formation of the agreement to fix prices.under the sherman act,such a horizontal price agreement is in itself illegal regardless of its effect or purpose.see united states national of real estate.oil,at.alcoa,at.the essence of the section violation alleged by the plaintiffs is the illegal agreement than the overt acts performed in furtherance of it summit health,pinhas,d.the fact that the defendants charged these particular plaintiffs prices determined by an illicit agreement is only relevant to whether they have an action under the clayton act and has no bearing on the issue of whether the sherman act was violated by the defendants.the defendants agreement to fix prices would be conduct that violates the sherman act regardless of whether they charged the plaintiffs high prices or whether the plaintiffs suffered injury.in sum,the conduct in this case was not the imposition of high prices pursuant to an illicit agreement,but the alleged agreement by the defendants to fix prices in foreign auction markets.
effect that gives rise to a claim 
in this case,the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the agreement to fix prices in foreign auction markets had an effect on domestic commerce as discussed earlier,prior to the passage of the ftaia,we defined in national bank of canada the meaning of the word effect as applied in the antitrust context.under national bank of canada,anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets has the requisite effect on domestic commerce needed for the sherman act to apply if it caused injury to domestic commerce by reducing the competitiveness of a domestic market or making possible anticompetitive conduct directed at domestic commerce.now,however,the word effect is defined by subsection of the ftaia,which only allows an antitrust action based on anticompetitive conduct directed at foreign markets whose domestic effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections to of this title.
we do not agree that subsection of the ftaia changed the national bank of canada test to require that the effect on domestic commerce be the basis for the alleged injury suffered by a plaintiff.the defendants argue that the requirement that the effect on domestic commerce give rise to a claim under the provisions of sections to of this title,means that a plaintiff injury that would give it the right to bring an action must result from the conduct effect on domestic commerce.again,such an interpretation imports the concept of the injury a plaintiff must suffer to bring a clayton act action when th
