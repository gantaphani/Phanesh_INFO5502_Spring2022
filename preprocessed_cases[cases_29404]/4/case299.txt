background 
procedural history 
on april,conwood filed an complaint against ustc alleging the following causes of action unlawful monopolization,in violation of of the sherman act violations of a of the lanham act tortious interference with contract tortious interference with prospective advantage violations of the kentucky revised statute,product defamation unjust enrichment and.ustc filed counterclaims for conversion and violations of the lanham act and sherman act.
in november,ustc moved for summary judgment as to conwood federal claims and dismissal without prejudice as to the pendent state law claims.ustc also filed a motion in limine to exclude the testimony of conwood expert witness,richard leftwich,and moved separately to exclude leftwich damages study and future testimony during trial.the district court denied ustc summary judgment motion on february.on february,the district court also denied ustc motions with respect to leftwich.
in february,the case proceeded to trial.before the case went to the jury,conwood agreed to dismiss the state law claims and both parties agreed to dismiss their respective lanham act claims asserted against one another.the jury deliberated for four hours,returning a million verdict in favor of conwood.the district court entered judgment on march,and therein trebled the amount of the award to billion,pursuant to a.the jury also ruled in favor of conwood on ustc conversion and sherman act claims.
conwood moved for a permanent injunction,pursuant to,to prevent ustc from,among other things,removing or eliminating any competitors advertising material in retail stores,without the prior consent of the retailer.the district court granted the motion on august.ustc moved for judgment as a matter of law,or for a new trial or reduction in damages,arguing that its conduct was not exclusionary,competition was not harmed and that conwood had not established causation and damages.the district court denied the motion on august.on september,ustc filed this timely notice of appeal challenging the district court february,denial of its motion for summary judgment february,order denying its motion to exclude the damages study and testimony of leftwich march,judgment on the jury verdict august,order denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative for a new trial or reduction of damages and august,order granting conwood motion for permanent injunctive relief.
both conwood and ustc are manufacturers of moist snuff,a finely chopped smokeless tobacco that the user consumes by placing a small amount between the gum and cheek.the product is sold in small round cans,at a price of between and.ustc produces the industry staples skoal and copenhagen.conwood brands include kodiak and cougar.
ustc predecessor,duke trust,started the moist snuff industry in,with its copenhagen brand.in,a judicial decree broke up the duke trust monopoly,which spawned three companies american snuff company conwood predecessor ustc and helme which is now known as swisher international group,hereinafter,swisher.american snuff company changed its name to conwood sometime during the.conwood and swisher were involved for many years in the dry snuff market.for sixty years,ustc was the sole manufacturer of moist snuff.swisher and conwood entered the moist snuff market in the late.the only other competitor in the moist snuff market is swedish match swedish.thus,there are only four competitors in the moist snuff market in the united states.
after conwood,swisher,and swedish entered the market,ustc market share,which at one point was virtually percent,declined.by,the four manufacturers sold different brands of moist snuff and ustc market share was approximately percent.during the,market growth accelerated in the moist snuff industry,and ustc market share continued to drop.at trial,one of conwood expert witnesses,morton kamien,a professor at northwestern university kellogg graduate school of business,testified that ustc currently controls percent of the moist snuff market conwood controls approximately percent of the market and swedish and swisher comprise approximately percent and percent of the market,respectively.
in,total moist snuff sales amounted to billion.also,in,ustc earned approximately million in revenues before taxes,interest and amortization.the company has the highest profit margin of any public company in the country.kamien testified that because ustc is one of the most profitable companies in the country,and because of the amount of profit at stake in the moist snuff market,it would be a ripe opportunity for other firms to come in and try to get into the market however,there have been no new entrants in the market since.in addition,although ustc declined in market share about percent per year between and,kamien testified that had there been true competition in the moist snuff industry,the decline would have gone much faster.he found it remarkable that while ustc market share decreased,the company raised its prices.testimony revealed that ustc had raised its prices approximately to percent per year between and.
the importance of advertising 
moist snuff is generally sold from racks.the racks have gravity fed slots or facings,from which consumers may select a can of the product.each facing is filled with cans of a single brand of moist snuff.in addition to dispensing cans,the racks also provide point of sale pos advertising,generally carried out by a header card a cardboard sign attached to the front of the rack.the header card may contain such information as the name of the brand of moist snuff,any promotions running with the product,and a picture of the product.
the parties agree that pos advertising is critical in the moist snuff industry because unlike with other products,such as soft drinks or snacks,tobacco advertising is restricted.tobacco products can not be advertised on tv or radio,and some places have restrictions on other forms of advertising outside of a retail store,such as on billboards.further,the number of people who use smokeless tobacco products is relatively small in relation to those who consume other tobacco products.thus,according to harold price,swedish vice president of sales and marketing,the point at which the buyer makes his purchase decision is the optimal time to convince the buyer to purchase a particular brand of moist snuff.price testified that the single most important tool for advertising is the merchandise rack,because that where we have the greatest opportunity and the last point to reach the consumer before the consumer makes his or her purchase decision.
exclusive racks,category management and cap 
conwood showed at trial that beginning in,ustc pursued strategies,emanating from management,to exclude competition in the moist snuff market.
according to trial testimony,ustc had been able to convince a number of major retailers to allow it to have exclusive racks in their stores.an exclusive rack refers to one manufacturer supplying a rack to display its moist snuff products and those of all other manufacturers.kroger steven luckett testified that while his store permits each moist snuff company to have its own rack,an advantage of allowing only one rack to store all similar products is uniformity.it also allows retailers to stack products in a manner that looks more attractive and neat.according to alan hart,a former ustc salesman,less than percent of stores carried ustc racks exclusively,and of those that did most all of them did so because the store authorized it.several retailers testified that they requested exclusive racks.in fact,mary stevens,who managed a kiwi store in billings,montana,testified that she used only a conwood rack 
during the,many retailers adopted the practice of category management.this practice varies from store to store,and involves managing product groups and business units and customizing them on a basis to satisfy customer demands.the process can determine the quantity of items a store sells.for instance,it allows retailers,based on such data as sales volume,to determine which items should be allocated more shelf space.manufacturers support the efforts of retailers by presenting to them products or a combination of products that are more profitable and describing how,and which,products should be displayed.at,swedish and ustc were involved with category management,which entailed suggesting which items should be on the racks.swisher at one point was also involved in the process.
as part of the category management process,retailers review information provided by the manufacturer and compare the products they suggest be sold to the retailer own independent analysis.the process is designed to ensure the best selling products are included in the.larry luckett,who decides which moist snuff products will be sold at kroger company,testified that any supplier trying to use category management practices to control competition,in his store anyway,would be committing suicide.ustc points out that no retailer testified that the company required shelf space allocations equal to its market share.apparently,rejected such a request from ustc.
however,according to conwood,around,ustc perceived it as a threat in the moist snuff market and took steps to eliminate it as a competitor and to reject competition on the merits.ustc president,vincent gierer,testified that around that time his company was losing market share and conwood volume was increasing.in the conwood and swedish introduced price value or brands of moist snuff.to show that ustc believed that such price valued products would erode its profits,conwood points to a internal ustc report in which the company stated that one of its goals was to m inimze the growth in price value we have been experiencing over the past five years to the point where ustc can still grow the market and achieve desired growth for ustc.the report stated that ustc would need to be more aggressive where price value has a higher share of the segment and will actively pursue strategies to limit the growth of the price value market segment.
conwood also claims that ustc,in its role as category manager,deliberately provided false information to stores to exclude competitors from the market.for instance,david waller,a wholesale distributor,testified that ustc has provided skewed national sales figures to retailers that do not always represent local product movement in stores.a report drafted by a division manager in houston also shows that ustc sometimes provided false information to retailers to get them to maintain ustc poor selling items while dropping competitors products.conwood employees also testified that ustc provided false information to retailers,such as by inflating actual sales data.
according to conwood expert witness robert blattberg,an expert on category management and a professor of retailing at northwestern kellogg graduate business school,many retailers consider moist snuff a small category and give it little attention.by small,blattberg explained that it is only consumed by about seven percent of the population,almost all male.however,it is a highly profitable item on a linear foot basis because it takes up so little space.he testified that no store,not even,according to him the largest retailer in the world,has anyone solely devoted to the management of moist snuff.from reviewing ustc documents,he testified that ustc employees understood that retail category managers did not know as much as ustc did about pricing,product knowledge and profitability of the products.he stated that manufacturers often have access to data that retailers do not,such as nielsen data,which tracks product movement.he stated that because of their time constraints,retailers are most likely to delegate the task of category management with respect to such items as moist snuff.he testified that when a retailer does delegate category management responsibilities to a manufacturer,the latter has significant responsibility.the retailer will look to the manufacturer to provide such information as assortment recommendations for which items to stock,consumer information,sales,and which stores are stocking what items.he further testified that a retailer will rely on a large manufacturer to be its category captain because if a manufacturer controls or percent of the market many retailers will assume that the manufacturer will and can devote the resources to the category to help build it.for instance,blattberg pointed to documents in which a ustc representative stated that most retailers want the top dog running things because the dominant share of market customers will look to us for leadership.
swedish mcclure also testified that t here only one category manager in the moist snuff business ustc.he also stated that while he would like to compete for the job of category manager,his company does not have shelf presence,consumer base or money.he also testified that ustc had not used its position fairly,had used its power to keep swedish products off the shelf,and once it there to get rid of it 
terry williams,conwood national sales manager,testified that in he was informed by one retailer that in order to obtain extra facings or a facing for a new item,the retailer first would have to consult with ustc.he also testified that before,conwood market share in was approximately percent,but by the time of trial it was percent.he explained that ustc exclusive racks and its restrictions on conwood distribution began in around.
there is also documentary evidence that ustc sought to use its position as category manager to control and limit the number of price value products introduced in stores and to control the merchandising and pos placements in stores.in one report,a ustc regional vice president stated that i t is imperative that we continue with this category management action plan to eliminate competitive products.in another document,a letter to david untiedt,ustc national accounts director,a ustc employee stated that his biggest competitive concern with several stores in the washington state area was the availability of swedish timberwolf brand and price differential between that product and ustc.the letter went on to state that a lthough we control the merchandising and the pos placements,which will make the consumer awareness of the price differential difficult,some of the circle k shoppers are always looking for a bargain.after reviewing this document,blattberg testified that ustc apparently realized that customers were looking for a bargain,and that limiting the amount of pos and information makes it more difficult for the consumer to find price value brands.in yet another document blattberg discussed,a ustc chain accounts manager in north carolina wrote our objective with exclusive vending rights with this and other chains is to control expanded competitive distribution and competitive pos we will continue to focus on merchandising rights to promote the growth of our product line and inhibit competitive growth to the best of our ability.blattberg testified that the obvious objective in having exclusive vending rights,according to the letter,is to reduce the amount of competitive items that can be offered.
according to blattberg,documentary evidence showed that ustc intended to use its position as category captain to control the number of price value product introductions.blattberg testified that after reviewing numerous documents drafted by ustc staff,he saw instances where ustc provided misleading information to retailers,including falsely reporting that some of their products were selling better than their competitors in an effort to thwart competition.he testified that by limiting the availability of the price value brands,ustc limits the choices for consumers.he also testified that it limits the ability of competitors to enter the market because it limits what the consumer can see.he stated that ustc practices were inconsistent with the concept of category management.
kamien also testified that ustc conduct harmed consumers by limiting variety and raising prices.he produced a chart showing that for every percent increase in ustc facings,retail prices for moist snuff rose by.a manager testified that after ustc eliminated competitors pos and facings,the number of other moist snuff items available to the store customers declined.
conwood introduced numerous documents drafted over several years by various ustc personnel,including chain accounts managers and others,that indicate ustc may have used its exclusive vending rights to hurt competition.see,at objective with exclusive vending rights with this and other chains is to control expanded competitive distribution and competitive department we will continue to focus on merchandising rights to inhibit competitive growth to the best of our ability at we stressed in our department meeting the importance of cutting competitive distribution.in many stores,especially supermarkets,distribution of competitive brands is much too high at even though conwood does not like the fact that we sometimes house their product in our vending,i have encountered more and more retailers that are surprised when i include the comp etitions products.i feel it is better for them to be lost in our vending th a n to have their own and no point of sale on the vendor.at our objective is to control the smokeless home,provide facings for competitive,control facings and positioning,and make our presence larger via at with arrogance and grace,i have taken a personal vendetta against the conwood in my areas.i am devoting an extra effort toward eliminating as many laggard conwood brands at retail as possible since i am offering a cash counter payment for exclusive ust vending on our displays,i am giving kodiak a conwood brand one facing.
in,ustc introduced its consumer alliance program cap,which entails granting retailers a maximum discount of for providing ustc with sales data,and participating in ustc promotion programs,giving the best placement to ustc racks and pos.according to conwood,however,cap is another means by which ustc excludes competition.for example,in a monthly competitive letter dated march,a ustc employee stated that the cap has become a great incentive in securing space for our vendors and for the elimination of competition products.
there was testimony that the cap can be used to exclude competitive pos advertising,and that ustc was extremely successful in signing up retailers to enter into these agreements.in the first couple of months of the program,ustc was able to sign retailers to the cap,which represents percent of its overall volume in moist snuff sales.
unauthorized removal of conwood racks 
according to conwood,when ustc sales representatives restocked or rearranged their own displays,they would routinely discard hundreds of thousands of conwood racks and their accompanying pos.william rosson,conwood chairman,testified that after,conwood spent a month on replacement racks.rosson testified that the company had monumental problems keeping their moist snuff on the shelf.a conwood sales representative testified that when displays were removed,conwood was successful in restoring them about percent of the time.rosson testified that about percent of sales representative staff time was spent repairing racks destroyed by ustc representatives.because two to three months would sometimes pass before a sales representative could return to the same store,conwood lost sales even when it was able to restore racks.
conwood also asserts that ustc would remove its pos and racks under the guise that retailers had given it permission to do so.conwood argues that any permission to remove its products was done under a ruse of organizing or straightening stores.it argues that ustc supervisors trained their staff to take advantage of inattentive store clerks,apparently so that they could destroy conwood racks and headers in retail stores.for instance,shawn ulizio,a former ustc employee testified that most clerks did not understand or care that there were different manufacturers of snuff products.another former ustc sales representative testified that after he got permission from a store manager,he would remove conwood racks and put conwood products in ustc racks.former ustc representative lawrence borrowdale testified that he was instructed,apparently by his supervisor,that if a competitor rack was in the way,he should remove it.borrowdale testified that on occasion he would remove competitors racks and bag up their fresh products and place them under a counter.several other former ustc employees gave similar testimony.kamien testified that the documentary evidence showed that the problem of ustc removing competitors racks was widespread over a period of time.
one conwood employee testified that except for moist snuff,he never encountered problems with his displays regarding any conwood product.he testified that he would place moist snuff racks in stores only to return later to have the displays gone and any remaining conwood brands stuffed in ustc rack.another conwood employee gave similar testimony.he also stated that once the ustc representative in his area told him that he intended to bury him.later,he witnessed that same representative breaking down his rack one day,while ustc regional vice president,then a ustc department manager,observed.conwood did not encounter this problem with its displays of smokeless tobacco products in markets in which ustc did not compete.
gayleen rusk,who manages an amoco pronto express,testified that she had experienced a ustc sales representative removing conwood racks and putting the products in the ustc rack.she testified that when she first started working at the store and did not know any better,she would allow it.upon learning that the ustc representative was not supposed to bother competitors racks,she would tell him not to do so when he visited the store.she stated that he would then come when she was not on duty and remove conwood rack anyway.regarding the effect of not having conwood brands in her store,amoco manager rusk stated that when customers request the items,they do not have them to sell.according to conwood representative brett jeffery,when he told the ustc representative to stop removing his racks,conwood sales dramatically increased.one former ustc representative,who witnessed the removal and destruction of conwood pos and racks stated that it had an effect on sales.according to him,no exposure meant no sale.three other store witnesses also testified that they had seen or experienced ustc representatives removing conwood racks.
according to ustc,however,retailers rely on manufacturers and wholesaler representatives to perform certain merchandising tasks for them,such as cleaning and rearranging items where a retailer may require more space to add or expand a section.ustc claims that during the,its more than sales personnel visited to retail stores per day,totaling more than million sales calls.these visits may involve,among other things,removing a competitor products,racks,or pos,but only at the retailer direction.ustc also points out that three of the former ustc employees that said that they removed conwood racks displays at the direction of their supervisors testified that they did so with the retailer permission.further,one had not worked for ustc since,before the challenged conduct began.ustc concedes,however,that four witnesses testified that they removed racks and pos materials without retailer authorization.further,conwood sales representatives testified that their ustc counterparts told them they had orders from their supervisors to eliminate conwood racks or facings,and in some cases,their compensation or bonuses depended on such rack destruction.
rosson testified that had conwood not been subjected to ustc tactics,it would have had a national market share of approximately to percent.rosson testified that he had carefully tracked conwood market share over the past years.conwood actual market share in its first years in the moist snuff industry was percent.in the next decade,starting from,that figure increased by roughly percent.rosson testified that the lack of growth that occurred during the second decade largely resulted from ustc tactics.he testified that his numbers are based on his studying markets where the company had a foothold and those in which it did not.in places where the company had a foothold,a relatively high market share in a given area,it saw its market share increase during the to a market share above percent.rosson testified that each additional point one percent of market share translates into approximately million in annual profits.
williams testified concerning conwood market share with respect to the ten retail locations for which ustc offered evidence at trial.in those locations where ustc did not have rack exclusivity,conwood moist brands market share was well above its national average.for those locations where ustc had rack exclusivity,conwood market share was below its national average.conwood argues that from these figures,a jury could have concluded that in unimpeded competition,conwood market share would have been approximately percent instead of percent nationally.
finally,to prove damages,conwood relied on the expert testimony of professor richard leftwich of the university of chicago graduate school of business,who is recognized as an expert on business valuation and lost profits.leftwich apparently tested rosson hypothesis that conwood market share increased in areas in which it did not face ustc exclusivity.
using a regression analysis,leftwich found a statistically significant difference between states in which conwood had a foothold and those in which it did not.under leftwich model,in states where conwood had a market share in of percent or more,the market share grew on average an additional percent from to.in states where conwood market share in was at least percent,it grew an additional percent.in states below these thresholds,conwood growth was considerably lower.as the district court noted 
leftwich applied a regression analysis to test conwood hypotheses.he determined that conwood share in a state in is statistically related to the change in conwood market share between and.the regression model predicts that where conwood had a higher market share in,conwood market share grew during the period to.in contrast,in states where conwood had a lower market share,the regression predicts that its share would grow very little.
leftwich then determined that conwood low market growth was due to ustc behavior.leftwich model also found that increases in ustc exclusionary behavior in a state reduced conwood share of sales by a statistically significant amount.he found that conwood damages as a result of ustc actions amounted to a figure between million and million,depending on whether conwood market share would have grown by percent or percent.the jury awarded damages of million.

ustc argues that the evidence presented at trial amounted to no more than insignificant tortious behavior and acts of ordinary marketing services.it contends that tortious activity can not form the basis for liability under the sherman act unless that activity is pervasive and accompanied by other conduct.ustc also argues that conwood failed to show that it was foreclosed from the market,was unable to compete for shelf space,that competition among moist snuff suppliers was injured,or,generally,that any harm alleged was caused by anything other than competition itself.it contends that its category management services and promotional programs are common marketing practices.these services,among other things,enhance demand for ustc products and help to ensure that retailers use shelf space efficiently,build consumer loyalty,and improve presentation of the products.ustc states that trial testimony showed that,during the relevant period,retailers retained control of shelf space allocation,and which racks and pos materials were used.further,during the relevant period,it argues that market output increased,its competitors market shares doubled,and conwood sales and profits grew.
conwood argues that the evidence in this case was sufficient to support the jury verdict.conwood contends that the jury heard and rejected ustc argument that its conduct was ordinary demand enhancing business behavior.it argues that the evidence showed an orchestrated ustc campaign to eliminate rival distribution and promotion with no competitive justification.conwood argues that while ustc points to increased sales in the moist snuff market,it ignores the fact that in the but for world of unimpeded competition,consumers and conwood would have done substantially better.we agree with conwood,and despite ustc arguments in support of its position,we believe there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.
a claim under of the sherman act requires proof of two elements the possession of monopoly power in a relevant market and the willful acquisition,maintenance,or use of that power by or exclusionary means as opposed to growth or development resulting from a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d int l,realty one,cir citing united states grinnell,d.to establish the offense of monopolization a plaintiff must demonstrate that a defendant either unfairly attained or maintained monopoly power.potters med.ctr.city hosp.ass n,cir citation omitted beverage,bottling.monopoly power consists of the power to control prices or exclude competition.potters,at citing grinnell,at.an attempted monopolization under occurs when a competitor,with a dangerous probability of success,engages in practices the specific design of which are,to build a monopoly or exclude or destroy competition.smith michigan,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in a case,only a thorough analysis of each fact situation will reveal whether the monopolist conduct is unreasonably and thus unlawful.byars bluff city news,cir citations omitted see also eastman kodak image technical,d this court has preferred to resolve antitrust claims on a basis,focusing on the particular facts disclosed by the record.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,in order for a completed monopolization claim to succeed,the plaintiff must prove a general intent on the part of the monopolist to exclude while by contrast,to prevail on a mere attempt claim,the plaintiff must prove a specific intent to destroy competition or build a monopoly.tops markets,quality markets,cir.however,no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing.aspen,at.thus,i mproper exclusion exclusion not the result of superior efficiency is always deliberately intended.id.at.citation omitted.
the first step in any action brought under of the sherman act is for the plaintiff to define the relevant product and geographic markets in which it competes with the alleged monopolizer,and with respect to the monopolization claim,to show that the defendant,in fact,possesses monopoly power.berkey photo,eastman kodak,cir.a geographic market is defined as an area of effective competition,at citation omitted.i t is the locale in which consumers of a product or service can turn for alternative sources of supply.id.
in the instant case,ustc does not challenge that it has monopoly power nor is there an issue as to the relevant product moist snuff and geographic markets nationwide on appeal,ustc contends that conwood has failed to establish whether ustc power was acquired or maintained by exclusionary practices as opposed to its legitimate business practices,and a superior product.aspen,at.in determining whether conduct may be characterized as exclusionary,it is relevant to consider its impact on consumers and whether it has impaired competition in an unnecessarily restrictive way.aspen,at.if a firm has been attempting to exclude rivals on some basis other than efficiency,it is fair to characterize its behavior as predatory or exclusionary.id.however,merely because an entity has monopoly power,does not bar it from taking advantage of its scale of economies because of its size.id.at.such advantages are a consequence of size and not the exercise of monopoly power.id.
ustc contends that none of the practices conwood complains of amount to antitrust violations,but are no more than isolated sporadic torts.we disagree.conwood presented evidence that beginning in ustc began a systematic effort to exclude competition from the moist snuff market.conwood presented sufficient evidence that ustc sought to achieve its goals of excluding competition and competitors products by numerous avenues.conwood principally complains that ustc removed racks from stores without the permission of store management and discarded destroyed these racks,while placing conwood products in ustc racks in an effort to bury conwood products and reduce their facings trained their operatives to take advantage of inattentive store clerks with various ruses such as obtaining nominal permission to reorganize or neaten the moist snuff section,in an effort to destroy conwood racks misused its position as category manager by providing misleading information to retailers in an effort to dupe retailers into believing,among other things,that ustc products were better selling so that retailers would carry ustc products and discontinue carrying conwood products and entered into exclusive agreements with retailers in an effort to exclude rivals products.
isolated tortious activity alone does not constitute exclusionary conduct for purposes of a violation,absent a significant and more than a temporary effect on competition,and not merely on a competitor or customer.see areeda turner,antitrust law,a,at.business torts will be violative of only in rare gross cases.id.as ustc recognizes,however,this is not to say that tortious conduct may never violate the antitrust laws.see,byars,at holding that acts by defendant,a wholesale periodical distributor,against a smaller company attempting to compete against it,may be deemed exclusionary,including removing plaintiff periodicals from sales racks at various retail outlets,covering up plaintiff periodicals on racks so that prospective buyers could not see them,and disparaging plaintiff,his financial condition and the magazine financial condition areeda turner,supra,a at.moreover,merely because a particular practice might be actionable under tort law does not preclude an action under the antitrust laws as well.id.at.anticompetitive conduct can come in too many different forms,and is too dependent upon context,for any court or commentator ever to have enumerated all the varieties.caribbean broad.cable wireless plc,reversing district court dismissal of complaint and holding that radio station owner stated sherman act claim where defendants conduct consisted of making misrepresentations to advertisers and the government in order to protect their monopoly.
ustc contends that the rack and pos removal activity was isolated and sporadic.it contends that the record identifies a de minimis number of improper incidents.ustc points out that it has sales personnel which made approximately to million sales calls during the.it argues that the district court disregarded the fact that conduct and circumstances differed greatly from chain to chain and store to store.see in re airport car rental antitrust.holding that rental car company would be required to prove damages on airport by airport basis for each airport for which plaintiff sought damages by reason of its exclusion.
in the instant case,the district court rejected ustc argument,essentially describing it as impractical.at issue in this case are separate retail establishments across the country.we believe the district court correctly determined that to have required the parties to investigate activity at specific retail establishments would have been so costly as to have effectively ended this suit,despite substantial evidence of activity.in addition,in an action for damages for violation of the antitrust laws plaintiff is not limited to recover only for specific items of damage which he can prove with reasonable certainty.on the contrary,the trier of the facts may make a just and reasonable estimate based on relevant data and may act upon probable and inferential proof.broad.lorain journal,cir citation omitted.
it is undisputed that pos advertising and a manufacturer ability to sell its moist snuff from its own racks are critical to success in the moist snuff market.see byars,at explaining that only a analysis of each fact situation will determine whether the monopolist conduct is.because of restrictions on advertising in the tobacco industry,and the critical nature of pos advertising in the relevant market,efforts by ustc,a conceded monopolist,to exclude conwood racks and pos advertising from retail locations through any means other than legitimate competition could certainly support conwood sherman act claim.see aspen,at.conwood presented evidence that ustc sales representatives continuously removed and discarded conwood pos and racks after without store authorization.while the number of witnesses who actually testified was limited,the acts testified to were widespread.douglas hyaneck,a conwood district manager,testified that when he served as a sales representative,he had trouble with rack removals in his stores in the northern michigan area.he also stated that from the time he became a district manager until,to percent of his sales staff time was spent replacing racks.gary ryan,another conwood sales representative in the sikeston,missouri area,says that about of his racks were removed.he stated that the problem continued even after a new ustc sales representative was hired in his area.both men testified that their racks were removed by ustc sales representatives.john falevsky,a conwood sales representative in the milwaukee,wisconsin and southeastern wisconsin area,and sales representative jeffrey dring also testified about rampant incidents of rack removal by ustc representatives in their areas.falevsky testified that he once approached his ustc counterpart about the matter and was told that the latter bonus depended on how many conwood racks he could get out of the stores.there is no indication that any of these acts were authorized by the stores at which they occurred.morever,rosson,conwood chairman,testified that he would receive estimates that as much as percent of his employees time was being spent on repairing damaged or discarded racks.he stated that some months,beginning in,conwood was spending as much as a month to replace racks,which constituted as many as racks a month being replaced.ustc did not challenge any of this evidence at trial.construing the evidence in the light most favorable to conwood,these incidents were neither sporadic nor isolated.abcor am int l,cir holding that sporadic activity identified by the plaintiffs does not amount to an antitrust violation.
in terms of retailer testimony,gayleen rusk,who manages an amoco pronto express,testified that she had experienced a ustc sales representative removing conwood racks and putting its products in the ustc rack.she testified that she allowed it to happen when she first started working at the store because she did not know any better.upon learning that the ustc representative was not supposed to bother competitors racks,she would tell him not to do so when he visited the store.she stated that he would then come when she was not on duty and remove conwood rack.three other store witnesses also testified that they had seen or experienced ustc representatives removing conwood racks.
conwood also alleged that ustc used its role as category captain manager to exclude competition.ustc points out that retailers testified that they alone,not ustc,determined and controlled what racks and pos were used in their stores.conwood rosson admitted that he could not name one store that gives final power over its snuff section to his company competitors.other retailers verified this assertion.kroger luckett testified that ustc did not receive all the facings in the that it requested and that kroger retains ultimate authority about product placement.retailer paul mcguire also testified that he welcomed input from suppliers but retained final authority about product placement.
however,there was other evidence,which ustc ignores,that ustc used its position as category manager to exclude competition by suggesting that retailers carry fewer products,particularly competitor products by attempting to control the number of price value brands introduced in stores and by suggesting that stores carry its slower moving products instead of better selling competitor products.much of the evidence conwood highlights was documentary,interpreted by experts.however,that evidence is nevertheless probative of ustc intent to exclude competition 
in one such instance,blattberg opined that an sent by a ustc regional vice president and ustc director of national accounts showed that the company abused its position of category manager.the stated that ustc believed it could continue to be the category captain in certain stores in the texas area,and we may be able to control the number of price value product introductions and their pursuit of a private label brand.at.blattberg testified that the significance of this document is that it shows that ustc planned to control competition.it shows ustc intended to control the number of price value brands and other products,which he stated meant that if ustc could convince retailers not to stock those items,the result would be to prevent rapidly growing or lower priced items from entering the marketplace.he testified that this is not consistent with the concept of category management,which is based on trust.
as for other abuses,blattberg noted that the weekly activity report from a ustc division manager in houston to a department manager stated that the company was receiving pressure from retailers to drop flavor packs in accounts where ustc was discontinuing competitive brands due to slow movement.at.the report states 
last week at fiesta supermarkets,i was able to get them to drop all competitive brands total and keep only redwood and kodiak.the buyer argued with me that we should be dropping flavor packs too because fp are selling less than most of the products we discontinued despite our counter displays.we were able to maintain our counter display and the product,but he makes a very valid point that we are not being total sic honest with our partners when we sell them on share for space concept if we do include our poor selling brands in the mix.i am afraid that we are using up our partnerships and good will when we talk about partnerships and sell our concept only to turn right around and ask them to go against what we just convinced them was in their best interest just to keep flavor packs in account.
id.blattberg testified that this document shows that ustc tried to gerrymander the data to this retailer.at.again,he opined that such practices violate the trust central to a category management relationship.further,such evidence counters ustc argument that only retailers controlled facing decisions.
conwood does not appear to challenge ustc role as category manager per se,but rather the manner in which it used its position as a monopolist providing category management services,to exclude it from competition.see aspen,at.explaining that excluding rivals on a basis other than efficiency may be characterized as predatory or see also eastman kodak,at.holding that under the power prong,defendant liability in sherman antitrust claim turned on whether defendant could present a valid business reason for its exclusionary conduct as explained above,conwood presented evidence that the category management program was used to place ustc racks exclusively in retail stores and hide competitor products in its racks.see,at even though conwood does not like the fact that we sometimes house their product in our vending,i have encountered more and more retailers that are surprised when i include the competition products.i feel it is better for them to be lost in our vending then to have their own and no point of sale on the vendor.
ustc chairman gierer testified that if his company goal was to go into a store and reduce competitive facings,then that should have happened.that not a legitimate goal.yet,gierer later admitted that his company had endorsed a strategy of eliminating competitive distribution.at.despite ustc claims that its actions amounted to no more than competition and that everybody does it,gierer admitted that he was embarrassed by some of the testimony presented at trial,especially the testimony of untiedt,ustc director of national accounts,who apparently could not answer whether it was appropriate to mislead retailers.gierer further testified that as a result of the evidence presented at trial,he was going to conduct an investigation into his company practices.gierer essentially admitted that the activities about which conwood complains,particularly the misrepresentations to retailers to obtain exclusive vending,was not competitive conduct spurred by efficiency.moreover,ustc has failed to offer any valid business reason for its representatives pervasive destruction of conwood racks.instead,it merely has chosen to argue that such destruction can never form the basis for an antitrust claim.
the evidence conwood presented in this case regarding ustc exclusionary conduct must be considered in the context of conwood theory.see caribbean broad,at.the theory conwood advanced at trial is that ustc engaged in a concerted effort,directed from the highest levels of a national monopoly,to shut conwood out from effective competition through the elimination of its racks and pos advertising,all in the unusual moist snuff market,where pos is the central marketplace battleground.see,reynolds tobacco philip morris,d granting preliminary injunction barring cigarette manufacturer in action from implementing program with retailers that would allow its product to hold most visible position in sales racks and noting that in cigarette market product visibility and advertising at the point of purchase are essential to remaining competitive.there was ample documentary and testimonial evidence supporting this theory.the jury could have found,and apparently did find,that ustc pervasive practice of destroying conwood racks and pos materials and reducing the number of conwood facings through exclusive agreements with and misrepresentations to retailers was exclusionary conduct without a sufficient justification,and that ustc maintained its monopoly power by engaging in such conduct.therefore,the district court did not err in holding that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find willful maintenance of monopoly power.
ustc argues that conwood has failed to show that it or competition was harmed in the national moist snuff sales market.it argues that there was no injury to competition because the number of moist snuff brands actually increased during the,including the products.it also argues that no injury to competition in the moist snuff market is shown because during the same period,other tobacco products decreased.ustc argues that where the market has actually expanded,there can be no showing of injury to competition.further,ustc argues that conwood has failed to show injury.it argues that during the relevant period,conwood market share actually increased.it also argues that there were other factors in the market,such as retailers choices not to display conwood racks and pos,that caused conwood injury.
conwood counters that it produced expert testimony showing that ustc exclusion of rivals pos racks and facings caused an increase in prices,reduced sales and limited choice.it also claims that but for ustc actions,the market would have grown more.finally,it argues that the fact that its own profits increased during the relevant period is not dispositive of the issue of injury.
the antitrust laws are intended to protect competition,not competitors.see andrx pharmaceuticals,biovail,citation omitted tennessean truckstop,nts,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.to prevail,a p laintiff must prove antitrust injury,which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants acts unlawful.valley prods,landmark,a division of hospitality franchise,cir citation omitted.specifically,to recover damages,an antitrust plaintiff must show that the alleged violation tends to reduce competition in some market and that the plaintiff injury would result from a decrease in that competition rather than from some other consequence of the defendant actions.id.an antitrust plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the alleged violation was a material cause of its injury,a substantial factor in the occurrence of damage or that the violation was the proximate cause of the damage.see ezzo,royal beauty supply,cir.as this court stated,
a lthough a plaintiff need not show that the defendant wrongful actions were the sole proximate cause of his injuries,the causal link must be provided as a matter of fact and with a fair degree of certainty.to be one of several causes is not enough.the evidence linking the violation to the injury must be more precise than that needed to establish the amount of damages.
ustc first argues that conwood failed to show harm to competition in the market because output increased and new products were introduced into the market.there was evidence at trial that total market output increased in the moist snuff industry during the relevant period.between and,overall sales volume of moist snuff increased million pounds.also,during this period,new products entered the market,and by,there were brands of moist snuff,of which came from ustc competitors.at.in omega,gilbarco,cir,the ninth circuit held that antitrust plaintiffs had failed to produce credible evidence to support their contention that the defendant actions had deterred entry into this market,because during the relevant period industry output in the relevant market had substantially expanded.id.at see also campus ctr.discount den,miami,wl,at cir.may,holding that convenience store plaintiff failed to state a claim under the antitrust laws because it failed to show that any alleged conduct on behalf of the defendant reduced overall demand for convenience store market.
conwood,however,argues that the issue is whether the market would have grown more absent ustc antitrust violation.in brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d,the evidence showed that following the defendant alleged predation,output in the relevant market and market shares for others grew.id.at.the court stated,however,that the fact that the defendant entry in the market did not restrict output was not dispositive.id.at.one could speculate that the rate of growth would have tripled,instead of doubled absent the alleged predation.id.at.however,the court stated that there was no evidence that this was so.id.
in the instant case,kamien,conwood expert,testified that as a result of ustc exclusionary conduct,the consumer suffered by having to pay higher prices,and that there was less variety in the market.at.the district court noted that much of the evidence regarding injury to competition was based,in part,on kamien testimony,which the jury obviously believed.thus,although output in the moist snuff market grew,there was evidence showing that ustc actions caused higher prices and reduced consumer choice,both of which are harmful to competition.see brooke group,at.conwood market share did grow slightly between and however,growth during that period,which was about percent,stands in stark contrast to the growth in market share of approximately percent that conwood experienced in the ten years prior to.in addition,swedish chairman also testified that ustc activity restricted its growth.he testified that ustc used its power to keep swedish products off the shelf,and once it there to get rid of it thus,there was sufficient evidence that during the relevant period,the growth of two of the three other manufacturers of moist snuff aside from ustc slowed,and that the restricted growth resulted from ustc conduct.in addition,kamien testified that since,no new firm had entered the moist snuff market,which he found odd because of the high amount of potential profit at stake in that market and the fact that ustc was the most profitable company in the country.he further testified that had there been true competition in the moist snuff market,ustc market share,which dropped approximately percent per year between and,would have fallen much faster.we believe that construing the evidence in the light most favorable to conwood,as we must,it was sufficient to show that competition suffered during the relevant period.williams,at.
ustc also argues that its conduct was not the necessary predicate of any injury conwood suffered,and thus conwood can not recover under the antitrust laws.ustc argues that any injury conwood suffered was the result of retailers decisions to enter into contracts with it and others to serve as category managers.for support,ustc primarily relies on valley products.in that case,a plaintiff who made and sold soap for use in hotels and motels under franchises granted by defendants brought suit under the clayton act,when plaintiff was denied permission to continue using on its items logos owned by the defendants.id.at.the defendants had ended their agreement with plaintiff after it granted two other manufacturers preferred supplier status,which meant they alone could place the trademarks owned by one of the defendants on their amenities.id.this court affirmed the district court,which found that the plaintiff had not shown an antitrust injury.id.at.this court noted that to show antitrust injury,the plaintiff must show more than economic injury.id.at.the court stated that an analysis of the the directness or indirectness of the injury was appropriate.id.at.the court noted that an injury does not exist for purposes of antitrust suits if it does not flow directly from the antitrust violation.id.the court found no injury because the violation alleged was not the necessary predicate of the plaintiff injury.id.at.the injury did not flow directly from the defendants actions,but rather,the plaintiff loss of sales resulted from the cancellation of the agreement to use the trademarks,which defendants had a right to do,and not from any activity.
ustc argues in this case that conwood injury flowed from the retail agreements that granted exclusive rights to ustc and to others at the expense of conwood.this argument is unconvincing because there was evidence that conwood injury flowed directly from ustc unauthorized removal and destruction of its racks and pos.conwood rosson also testified that ustc activity restricted its growth.there was evidence that ustc and not retailers controlled facing decisions and that in making those decisions,ustc sales representatives purposely attempted to bury conwood products in ustc racks.see,at.further,there was evidence that ustc misrepresented the sales activity of its own products to retailers in order to increase the number of facings of its slower moving products despite the fact that other brands by its competitors,including those of conwood,were better selling.such activity encompasses the acts about which conwood complains.thus,there was sufficient evidence showing that conwood injury did flow from ustc activity.valley products,at.further,while the link between the injury and violation must be proved as a matter of fact and with a fair degree of certainty,it need not be the sole proximate cause.see ezzo,at.in sum,there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that ustc activity harmed competition in the moist snuff market and conwood and ustc is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this ground.
ustc challenges the district court decision to allow leftwich to testify as to the damages sustained by ustc conduct.ustc argues that the district court made no findings regarding the admissibility of leftwich report under daubert merrell dow,d.ustc argues that leftwich methodology fails because it was constructed solely for this case.ustc also argues that leftwich study did not attempt to segregate the effects of other factors that could have contributed to conwood low sales in some states,and it made no attempt to test whether the slow growth in certain states was causally linked to any of ustc conduct.thus,ustc argues the study did not and could not fit the case at hand.
as a preliminary matter,conwood argues that ustc waived any challenge to leftwich testimony because after the district court ruled that leftwich testimony was admissible on a preliminary basis,the court explained that ustc could contest leftwich testimony at trial.conwood asserts that because ustc failed to object to leftwich testimony at trial,it has waived our review of the district court decision to allow leftwich to testify.we disagree 
ustc filed a motion in limine challenging the admissibility of leftwich testimony,and the district court correctly concluded that its admissibility was governed by the supreme court opinion in daubert.see nelson tennessee gas pipeline,cir.the district court considered ustc arguments regarding admissibility under,pertaining to the admissibility of expert witnesses,and found that leftwich testimony satisfies daubert.at.ustc also argued that leftwich testimony should be excluded under rule because it lacked probative value and would mislead the jury specifically,ustc challenged the factual assumptions that leftwich tested.the district court held that it could not at that time say that leftwich assumptions had no basis in fact,but that ustc might prove differently at trial.in united states brawner,cir,we held that where a trial court has made a definitive ruling on the record of the evidentiary issues to be decided,and has not indicated that the ruling is subject to other circumstances or evidence,then counsel need not renew the objection at the time the evidence is offered at trial to preserve the error for appeal.id.at see also.a holding that once a court makes a definitive ruling on the record to either admit or exclude evidence,at or before trial,a party need not renew an objection at trial to preserve any alleged error for appeal.in the instance case,the district court opinion unequivocally stated that leftwich testimony satisfies daubert.moreover,after conwood rested its case,ustc moved for judgment as a matter of law challenging the assumptions of leftwich damages theory.we therefore do not believe that ustc waived appellate review of leftwich damages theory 
ustc does not challenge leftwich qualifications as an expert,but only his testimony and damages study.pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence,i f scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.in daubert,the supreme court established a general gatekeeping or screening obligation for trial courts to exclude from trial expert testimony that is unreliable and irrelevant.hardyman norfolk ry,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court must determine whether the evidence both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.id.citation omitted.in assessing relevance and reliability,the district court must examine whether the expert is proposing to testify to scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.jahn equine,psc,cir citations omitted.this involves a preliminary inquiry as to whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.some of the factors that may be used in such an inquiry include whether the theory or technique has been tested and subjected to peer review and publication,whether the potential rate of error is known,and its general acceptance.hardyman,at.this inquiry is a flexible one,with an overarching goal of assessing the scientific validity and thus the evidentiary relevance and reliability of the principles and methodology underlying the proposed expert testimony.united states langan,cir citation omitted.a trial judge must have considerable leeway in deciding in a particular case how to go about determining whether particular expert testimony is reliable.kumho tire,carmichael,d see also jahn,at explaining that daubert made clear that rule relaxes the traditional barriers to admitting opinion testimony.
ustc presents no reasoned basis for us to find that the district court abused its discretion in determining that leftwich methodology was sufficiently reliable or relevant to survive a daubert challenge.ustc asserts two principal challenges to leftwich study and testimony.ustc claims that leftwich did not relate any of conwood loss to specific bad acts by ustc and failed to account for other factors that could have had a negative effect on conwood sales.leftwich used a regression analysis to test rosson hypothesis that conwood growth was suppressed most in states where it had only a small market share when ustc began its exclusionary practices.he also tested whether the intensity of ustc misconduct increased in or around.rosson testified that once his company reached a percent market share,ustc exclusive vending practices were not as effective.
leftwich employed three methods to test conwood claims regression analyses,a yardstick test and a test.all three are generally accepted methods for proving antitrust damages.see,petruzzi iga supermarkets,cir explaining that if performed properly multiple regression analysis is a reliable means by which economists may prove antitrust damages eleven line,north texas state soccer ass n,cir noting that the two most common methods of quantifying antitrust damages are the before and after and yardstick measures of lost profits 
leftwich found a statistically significant difference in conwood market share between those states in which conwood had a foothold and those in which it did not.in those states in which conwood enjoyed a market share of and percent or more,conwood grew in share,between and,on an average of percent and percent,respectively.he concluded that but for ustc exclusionary acts,plaintiff market share would have grown by these same amounts in states.contrary to ustc arguments,the record indicates that leftwich ruled out the possibility that the statistical relationship was caused by factors other than ustc conduct.we find particularly relevant the undisputed evidence that leftwich examined the possible explanations that ustc own expert suggested as possible explanations for conwood low market share.leftwich testified that he tested all plausible explanations for his results for which he had data.employing a regression analysis,leftwich analyzed whether the
