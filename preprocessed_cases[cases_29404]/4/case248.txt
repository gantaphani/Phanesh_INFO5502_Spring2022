facts and proceedings below 
in,bell atlantic bell brought suit under section of the clayton act against and its subsidiary lucent technologies,seeking treble damages and injunctive relief for alleged violations of the antitrust laws.according to bell,attempted to monopolize the market for service in violation of section of the sherman act when,for approximately four years beginning in,blocked the free passage of data over its network.shortly after bell brought suit,the named class plaintiffs,rochelle and adroit,intervened and moved to certify two classes of plaintiffs who allegedly suffered antitrust injury because of conduct during the class period,a period running between march,and november,
the decision to certify a class may often necessitate a highly factual inquiry,see alabama blue bird body,cir,and the propriety of class certification here hinges in part upon evidence introduced below concerning the nature and operation of caller id.
the record reflects that caller id is a service marketed and provided by local telephone companies that permits the display,on a device either attached to or incorporated into the telephone of the recipient of a call,of the telephone number,and occasionally the name,of the calling party.the service operates by transmitting data containing,at a minimum,a calling party telephone number cpn over the telephone networks until it ultimately reaches,and is displayed on,the call recipient display unit 
there is no dispute that access to caller id information may be of benefit to a number of businesses and may,for certain businesses,produce substantial efficiency gains and accompanying cost savings.businesses,for example,may use caller id data to return calls received after hours where the caller left an incomplete message or no message at all.and because the display units also are sometimes able to record information for later recall,the caller id display units may also be used to track call volume.in addition,businesses that maintain,telephone numbers benefit from caller id by using the calling party number to screen out unwanted calls,thereby reducing calling expenses.
at a more sophisticated level,the data transmitted to a call recipient may be linked,through the use of computer telephony integration cti equipment and software,to a business computerized database.cti equipment thus allows a business to use a caller id signal to rapidly retrieve information related to a particular caller,permitting a business,for example,to route a call to a specific employee,or to provide faster and more efficient service to a customer,resulting in reduced telephone bills and labor costs,and in some circumstances,increased customer goodwill 
a number of technological prerequisites,however,must be met before a call recipient can receive a caller id signal.chief among these is the need for each portion of the telephone network that the caller id signal must traverse to be connected to a telephone network known as the signaling system network thus,for any given call to carry a caller id signal to a call recipient over the network,the local telephone exchange networks of both the caller and call recipient must have capability,and the local telephone exchange networks of both caller and call recipient must be connected to network 
even where there was complete connectivity,however,a number of additional factors,other than conduct,may have prevented the unimpeded passage of a caller id signal during the class period.some states,concerned with the implications of caller id for privacy rights and existing wiretapping legislation,imposed regulations that blocked the transmission of cpn on all calls,both local and.in re rules and policies regarding calling number identification id,rcd.thus alleged,and the plaintiffs do not dispute,that texas prohibited the transmittal of cpn for a substantial portion of the class period,while california did not permit the passage of cpn at any time during the class period.pennsylvania did not amend its statutes to permit caller id service until december.see.a providing for caller id service and overruling barasch pennsylvania public utility commission,which held that caller id violated state wiretap laws.other states required,and still require,that telephone companies provide consumers with the option of blocking the display of their telephone numbers.see,cal.pub.a west requiring,with certain exceptions,that every telephone call identification service shall allow a caller to withhold display of the caller telephone number.a same.finally,beyond state regulations and connectivity,other technological barriers may have prevented the transmission of caller id data during the class period.thus,the record indicates that cpn does not accompany a call where the call is placed either from a pay phone or from a cellular phone.in addition,caller id service may be unavailable where either the calling party or the call recipient employs a private branch exchange pbx telephone system,a type of telephone system widely used by businesses during the class period.
assuming,however,that none of these various barriers would have impeded the receipt of caller id,there is no question but that caller id was unavailable on certain calls during the class period because of decision to block the free transmission of caller id signals over its network.moreover,for purposes of deciding class certification,we shall simply assume without deciding,as did the district court,that such conduct amounted to an attempt to monopolize the market for caller id service in violation of the sherman act.the only question remaining before this court,therefore,is the propriety of the district court denial of class certification.
class definitions 
the named plaintiffs,rochelle and adroit,initially sought to certify two classes of plaintiffs who they maintained suffered antitrust injury as a result of blocking of caller id data a reverse charge class comprising business and organizations who purchased service and a call recipient class comprising businesses and organizations that were actual or potential purchasers of service for calls 
after a hearing during which the district court received evidence concerning the operation of caller id service and the nature of the antitrust injury alleged,the plaintiffs moved to redefine the putative classes the plaintiffs amended motion for class certification,the denial of which is before us,removed certain problematic aspects of the initial definitions,and defined the reverse charge class as 
all businesses and organizations that,at any time between march,and november,were actual purchasers from of typically,long distance service,and were actual purchasers of service for the processing of incoming telephone calls.
the call recipient class,whose members who were not necessarily all subscribers,was defined as 
all business and organizations that,at any time between march,and november,a were actual purchasers of service for the processing of incoming telephone calls and b received at least one call carried over the signaling network each month during which such purchaser was a subscriber to the service.
in addition to defining the proposed classes,the plaintiffs motion for certification also included a formula for calculating the amount of damages to which the plaintiffs claimed the class members were entitled.specifically,the plaintiffs proposed to calculate damages for individual class members in both classes based upon the national average number of seconds saved per call both and local through the use of caller id,an average wage rate for the typical employee answering and processing telephone calls,and the total number of calls to class members made during the class period for the reverse charge class,the plaintiffs also proposed to adjust the damages calculus,using billing records,to include recovery of any charges assessed against class members that might have otherwise been avoided through the use of caller id.
opposed class certification arguing,inter alia,that the plaintiffs had failed to carry their burden of establishing predominance and numerosity.specifically,contended that the plaintiffs motion for certification failed the predominance bar on two grounds.first,maintained that the plaintiffs could not prove antitrust injury with regard to each class member absent an individualized inquiry into issues of causation.second,even assuming the plaintiffs could establish liability on a classwide basis,argued that the plaintiffs still could not clear the predominance hurdle since the variegated nature of the class member businesses and organizations precluded a formulaic calculation of damages.
the district court,after holding a second hearing on the issue,denied class certification.seizing on the first of two above objections and relying on alabama blue bird body,cir,the district court found that difficulties in establishing that had actually caused an antitrust injury to any given class member defeated predominance 
following the district court ruling,the plaintiffs petitioned for,and were granted leave to file this interlocutory appeal under rule f.because we also conclude that the plaintiffs clearly failed to surmount the predominance hurdle of rule b,albeit on different grounds from those relied upon by the district court,we affirm.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to certify a class for an abuse of discretion,see mcmanus fleetwood enterprises,cir,and note that the district court must conduct a rigorous analysis of the rule prerequisites before certifying a class.countrywide home loans,cir.we also note that in those cases where the plaintiff seeks to certify a class under rule b,the rules invite a close look at the case before it is accepted as a class action.amchem products,windsor,d quoting kaplan,continuing work of the civil committee amendments of the federal rules of criminal procedure i,harv.finally,we stress that it is the party seeking certification who bears the burden of establishing that the requirements of rule have been met,at.
class certification 
there are no hard and fast rules regarding the suitability of a particular type of antitrust case for class action treatment.alabama blue bird body,cir.rather,t he unique facts of each case will generally be the determining factor governing certification.id.
under rule a,a plaintiff seeking to certify a class must satisfy four threshold requirements numerosity a class so large that joinder of all members is impracticable commonality questions of law or fact common to the class typicality named parties claims or defenses are typical of the class and adequacy of representation representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.amchem products.at.
beyond these four prerequisites of rule a,rule b demands of a party seeking class certification yet two further requirements,namely the burden of demonstrating both that questions common to the class members predominate over questions affecting only individual members,and that class resolution is superior to alternative methods for adjudication of the controversy.id.at.by inquiring into predominance,rule b thus tests whether the proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.id.at.the standard for certification imposed by rule b is also more demanding than the commonality requirement of rule a,and as such,mandates caution,particularly where individual stakes are high and disparities among class members great.id.at see also.advisory committee note in the situations to which this subdivision rule b relates,treatment is not as clearly called for as in those described above,but it may nevertheless be convenient and desirable depending upon the particular facts.emphasis added.
determining whether the plaintiffs can clear the predominance hurdle set by rule b also requires us to consider how a trial on the merits would be conducted if a class were certified.sandwich chef of texas,reliance ins.indem,cir castano am.tobacco,cir.this,in turn,entails identifying the substantive issues that will control the outcome,assessing which issues will predominate,and then determining whether the issues are common to the class,a process that ultimately prevents the class from degenerating into a series of individual trials,at.
c.the antitrust violation 
the offense of attempted monopolization in violation of section of the sherman act has three elements,namely that the defendant engaged in predatory or exclusionary conduct,that the defendant possessed the specific intent to monopolize,and that there was a dangerous probability that the defendant would succeed in his attempt.taylor pub.jostens,cir.
proof of these elements will necessarily be identical for the members of both proposed classes,and under the facts of the instant case,these issues,therefore,create no bar to class certification.moreover,as indicated above,we assume,for purposes of addressing the issue of class certification,that alleged conduct constituted a violation of section.
the plaintiffs task,however,is not limited to establishing the elements of a completed offense under section of the sherman act.rather,to establish civil liability under the clayton act,a plaintiff must also establish that he has been injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.thus,where a plaintiff seeks a private civil remedy and treble damages for a violation of section,he must not only make out a violation of the antitrust laws,but also establish that it was the defendant conduct that actually caused injury to his business or property and provide some indication of the amount of damage.blue bird body,at.
establishing causation,or fact of damage,requires the plaintiff to demonstrate a causal connection between the specific antitrust violation at issue and an injury to the business or property of the antitrust plaintiff.id.this requirement is in no way lessened by reason of being raised in the context of a class action.rather,this court has held that the issue of fact of damage is a question unique to each particular plaintiff and one that must be proved with certainty.id.at.accordingly,we have repeatedly held that where fact of damage can not be established for every class member through proof common to the class,the need to establish antitrust liability for individual class members defeats rule b predominance.see nichols mobile board of realtors,cir.unit b alabama blue bird body,cir shumate national ass of secs.dealers,cir.
in addition to establishing fact of damage,section of the clayton act also requires a plaintiff to show some indication of the amount of damage suffered.see blue bird body,at.we have recognized,however,that the nature of an antitrust claim means that some plaintiffs can only hypothesize about what the state of their affairs would have been absent the wrong,equipment international harvester,cir,and we have,therefore,declined to hold antitrust plaintiffs to the same burden of proof of damages as demanded of plaintiffs in other civil cases.see eleven line,north texas state soccer ass n,cir.such leniency notwithstanding,an antitrust plaintiff may not merely rely on guesswork or speculation to establish damages.id.rather,our cases indicate that the plaintiff must provide a just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on relevant data.id.quoting bigelow rko radio pictures.see,kestenbaum falstaff brewing,cir when asserting injury from the imposition of price ceilings,the plaintiff must show when prices would have been raised,by what amount,and approximately what sales would have been at the higher price.and we have accordingly rejected claims where the plaintiff proposed method of calculating damages failed to reasonably approximate actual economic losses.see eleven line,at keener sizzler family steak houses,cir.
damages and predominance 
having thus identified fact of damage and the amount of damages as the two elements of the plaintiffs claim that would be at issue at trial were the two proposed classes to be certified,we now address whether,in light of those elements,individual issues would predominate at trial.
the district court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they could establish antitrust liability through common proof,and that individual issues concerning fact of damage,therefore,defeated predominance.the plaintiffs assign this finding as error and ask us to reverse.we demur,since even if we were to conclude that the district court decision as to fact of damage was in error,we find that the plaintiffs motion for certification nevertheless founders on the issue of the amount of damages 
as discussed above,see part i b supra,the plaintiffs proposed to calculate damages for the members of both classes according to a formula that utilized a nationwide average cost of labor and a nationwide average amount of time that the class members would have saved per call had caller id been available on calls during the class period.upon reviewing the record,however,we are not convinced that this proposed damages calculus represents an adequate approximation of any single class member damages,let alone a just and reasonable estimate of the damages of every class member included in the two putative classes.
the record indicates that rather than merely examining lost time and average labor costs,any adequate estimation of actual damages suffered would require consideration of the variegated nature of the businesses included in both the proposed classes,together with the range of uses,depending on the size and technological sophistication of any given business,to which caller id could be applied.in light of the need for such individualized inquiries,we can not conclude that the plaintiffs have established that the requirements of rule b can be satisfied in the present case.
in eleven line,north texas state soccer ass n,cir,we found inadequate an antitrust plaintiff damages formula that,based on an average of the rates of return of similar businesses,failed to account,among other things,for differences in location and size between the various businesses used to calculate the average.we also rejected the argument that to disallow the plaintiff damages formula would be to let anticompetitive conduct go unpunished because of mere uncertainty in the amount of loss inflicted,noting instead that the lenient standard for proving the amount of damages under the antitrust laws should not be stretched so far as to permit recovery where there was no evidence that competition had actually been eroded.id.at.
the plaintiffs formula in the case sub judice suffers from the same flaws that proved fatal to the plaintiff formula in eleven line,north texas state soccer ass numerous factors that would have affected the amount of damages,if any,suffered by any given class member denied caller id are not accounted for in the proposed formula.it is not contested that certain class member businesses were denied substantial efficiency gains because of their inability to receive caller id with every call.not every business included in the class,however,would have achieved the same per call savings,a fact that the plaintiffs conceded when during the second hearing on class certification,counsel for the class representatives agreed that while some class members may have a claim for substantial damages,others may not even get a dollar worth of damages they may get nothing.indeed,we fail to see,and the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate,how for some businesses within each class,the absence of caller id on a handful of calls would have had any effect whatever on those businesses bottom lines.
as has repeatedly pointed out,both before this court and before the district court,it is not difficult to conceive of a business that would fall within the definition of the call recipient class,but that would nevertheless not have suffered any economic injury by reason of being denied caller id on one call each month while a subscriber during the class period.thus posits the local business,that serves a local customer base,and that receives one call each month.such a business falls within the definition of the reverse charge class,yet it is unlikely that such a business would ever suffer any actual economic injury by being denied caller id data on a single call each month.even assuming that such a business utilized a supplier,before concluding that the business suffered any actual economic injury from the absence of caller id information on a call from the supplier,one would have to also make both of the following dubious and highly speculative assumptions about each such call,namely that had caller id been present,the employee answering the call would have saved some amount of time and that the employee time was otherwise fully utilized.the conclusion that such a local business would be actually economically injured from the absence of caller id information in such a situation,is therefore equally speculative 
according to the record,most labor and time savings would only have been realized by those businesses that possessed both cti equipment and software that would have enabled them to utilize caller id in conjunction with a customer database.the class definitions,however,do not seek to distinguish between those businesses that did,and those that did not,possess cti equipment.moreover,even among those businesses that did possess cti equipment,the amount of labor savings realized,if any,would have varied greatly.the record reveals that a wide variety of cti equipment,ranging in expense and performance,was available during the class period,the effectiveness of which apparently depended,to at least some extent,on the type of database software with which it was used,a factor that also varied among businesses.
not only does the plaintiffs proposed damages formula thus fail to account for disparities in potential labor savings among class members due to variations in,or the absence of,cti equipment,but it also fails to account for other differences among class members that would have affected the amount,if any,of actual economic damages suffered.the damages formula does not account for those businesses,included in the definitions of both classes,that employed pbx telephone systems or received calls only or primarily from other business that employed pbx systems and that,therefore,could never have received caller id data regardless of conduct.nor does the formula reflect that those businesses that served high volumes of repeat customers stood to gain more from caller id,both in terms of reduced labor costs and increased customer satisfaction,than businesses that served customer bases finally,neither the class definitions nor the damages formula purports to adjust for the reduced level of damages that would be due those businesses that may have served customers primarily residing in states that required that callers be given the option of blocking caller id signals from accompanying their calls.
where an antitrust plaintiff seeks to project lost profits by comparing like businesses,it is the plaintiff who must demonstrate the reasonable similarity of the business whose earning experience he would borrow.eleven line,at.similarly,where the injury alleged is measured in terms of an average of lost labor savings and an average amount of time saved per phone call,it is the plaintiff who must demonstrate the reasonable similarity of the businesses used to calculate those averages.this the plaintiffs have failed to do.the plaintiffs proposed damages formula instead attempts to project a measure of damages,for all the class members,that in no way accounts for the vast differences among those class members.any reasonable approximation of the damages actually suffered by the various class members would instead require a much tighter inquiry into the nature of the class member businesses.given the need for such individualized damages inquiries,we conclude that individual issues concerning damag
