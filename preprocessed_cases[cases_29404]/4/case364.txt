plaintiffs are missouri beer consumers suing to enjoin the acquisition of companies,by inbev inbev on the ground that the transaction violated section of the clayton act.relying on the potential competition theories of liability,plaintiffs allege that the merger threatens to reduce competition and increase beer prices in the united states because it eliminates inbev,the largest brewer and seller of imported beers,as an actual and a perceived potential competitor in the market.having failed to obtain a preliminary injunction,plaintiffs now seek divestiture as equitable relief under section of the clayton act.the district granted defendants judgment on the pleadings.we affirm.
before the merger,based in louis,was the largest brewer in the united states,with a nearly market share,annual revenues of billion,and employees.inbev,created by the merger of interbrew of belgium and ambev of brazil,was the world largest brewer,with annual revenues of billion and employees.prior to acquiring,inbev primarily competed in the market by selling imported brands brewed in other countries.in addition,an inbev subsidiary labatt usa had exclusive rights to brew and distribute in the a popular canadian beer,labatt,that another inbev subsidiary had the exclusive rights to brew and distribute in canada.inbev had also owned a brewery in latrobe,pennsylvania,and one domestic brand,rolling rock,but it sold those assets in.in late,inbev and agreed to make the exclusive importer of several popular inbev brands.
inbev began its highly publicized efforts to acquire in june.when rejected the initial offer,inbev sued in delaware to remove the board of directors,and countered with a federal action in missouri alleging deceptive takeover conduct.the companies reached an accord in july and announced that inbev would purchase stock at a share,for a total purchase price of billion.as the subsequent procedural history is critical to an understanding of our decision,we summarize the significant events chronologically

in its november,order denying plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court concluded i that the substantial documentary record demonstrates that it is overwhelmingly likely that plaintiffs can not succeed on the merits because inbev actions demonstrate that it does not intend to enter the beer market de novo,and because inbev presence as a perceived potential competitor does not affect competitive behavior and ii that plaintiffs provided no support for their speculative claim of antitrust injury,namely,that the merger would result in increased beer prices even though it would not increase concentration in the market.
in its august,order that is the subject of this appeal,the district court granted judgment on the pleadings,concluding that plaintiffs complaint did not contain sufficient facts supporting their conclusory allegations that inbev intended to enter the market de novo,or that any rational market participant had tempered its pricing activities in the existing market because it viewed inbev as a potential de novo entrant,allegations at odds with inbev sale of its pennsylvania brewery and rolling rock assets,its agreement with for distribution of inbev imported brands,and its lack of assets and relationships needed for effective de novo entry.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that their lengthy complaint adequately pleaded claims under the actual and perceived potential competition theories of liability.
