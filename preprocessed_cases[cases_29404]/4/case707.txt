statement of the case and facts 
on january,appellant filed his first amended complaint for breach of contract,breach of mandatory duty and declaratory and injunctive relief against the state of california state,the office of real estate appraisers orea and individual defendants.in his cause of action for breach of contract,appellant alleged that on or about december,he entered into a confidential stipulation and waiver with the state and orea in settlement of an inquiry and investigation of appellant by the state and orea.under the settlement,appellant waived his right to contest any charges against him,without admitting them,and agreed to certain educational and other requirements,while the state and orea agreed that the complainants would be notified only of the outcome of the proceeding,not the results or findings of orea investigations or contents of the stipulation.appellant alleged that respondents represented the stipulation was a private reproval and entirely confidential.appellant further alleged that respondents breached the stipulation by publishing letters to complainants indicating that respondents had performed a complete investigation and relating confidential information concerning the investigation,findings,conclusions and action taken against appellant.appellant alleged that respondents understood the risk that complainants against appellant others would misuse confidential information about appellant to do him harm and that their breach of contract proximately caused appellant damage to his reputation and trade as a real estate appraiser in the amount of million or an amount to be proven at trial,plus attorneys fees incurred in defending the orea inquiry and in bringing the present action.
appellant second cause of action,for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and misrepresentation,alleged that respondents breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by making false and misleading representations that the agreement was confidential and that such confidentiality conformed with orea practice,and by failing to disclose orea practice or intent to disclose confidential information to the complainants or the public.the third cause of action alleged that respondents breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by publishing the confidential information and by publishing other confidential information relating to another investigation of appellant.the fourth cause of action,for trade libel,alleged that respondents breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by publishing false or misleading information about appellant trade,including representations that a complete investigation had been done and other confidential representations.
the fifth cause of action,for negligence,alleged that respondents had a mandatory duty to maintain the confidentiality of investigations,findings and actions taken against appellant under business and professions code sections and,california code of regulations,title,sections,and,and other law,which duty was breached by the publication of the confidential information.the sixth cause of action,for trade libel,alleged that respondents breached the above mandatory duty by publishing false and misleading information including representations that a complete investigation had been done and other confidential representations.the seventh cause of action,for declaratory and injunctive relief,alleged that the orea deprived appraisers of due process by interpreting the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice in a manner that resulted in its failure to consider,and base disciplinary actions upon,the totality of an appraiser opinion as delivered in judicial proceedings.
respondents filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint on march,maintaining that the entire complaint was barred by the immunity provided under government code sections and.appellant opposed the demurrer,arguing that the first four causes of action were viable because they arose from contract and,therefore,under section were not subject to immunity under the california tort claims act.appellant argued against the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action on the ground that respondents were liable under section for failing to discharge a mandatory duty.with respect to the seventh cause of action,appellant argued that the immunities cited by respondents did not apply to claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.
after a hearing on april,the trial court adopted its tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the first six causes of action without leave to amend and overruling it with respect to the seventh cause of action.respondents filed their answer on july.
on december,appellant dismissed the seventh cause of action and requested entry of judgment against him on the first six causes of action.judgment was entered on the same date.appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on january.
discussion 
the standard by which we review the trial court decision to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.citation.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,see dunkin boskey th,d.
appellant contends that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the first four causes of action because these claims are based on contract and the california tort claims act does not bar contract claims.he relies upon section,which provides nothing in this part affects liability based on contract or the right to obtain relief other than money or damages against a public entity or public employee.the legislative committee comment senate on this section was the doctrine of sovereign immunity has not protected public entities in california from liability arising out of contract.this section makes clear that this statute has no effect on the contractual liabilities of public entities or public employees.arthur sachs,city of oceanside d,italics omitted.thus,w hen the state makes a contract it is liable for a breach of its agreement and the doctrine of governmental immunity does not apply.citations.morrill state of california cal d,italics omitted.whether an action is based on contract or tort depends upon the nature of the right sued upon,not the form of the pleading or relief demanded.if based on breach of promise it is contractual if based on breach of a noncontractual duty it is tortious.citation.if unclear the action will be considered based on contract rather than tort.citation.arthur sachs,supra,at.
appellant relies on the general rule that settlement agreements are governed by contract principles nicholson barab d.in re frye d,as well as case law applying this rule to agreements settling disciplinary actions by california licensing agencies.frankel board of dental examiners th,d rich vision centers,board of medical examiners d.see department of industrial relations ui video stores,th,d.appellant complaint alleged a breach of the confidentiality provisions of his settlement agreement with respondents.accordingly,appellant reasons that,under section,his claims for breach of contract are viable.
respondents,here as in the trial court,rely on the immunity provisions of sections and.section provides a public employee is not liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment,even if he acts maliciously and without probable cause.section,subdivision b,provides except as otherwise provided by statute,a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability.respondents further maintain that section is inapplicable because appellant causes of action are not based on contract.according to respondents,the stipulation by which the disciplinary matter in this case was settled was not contractual but rather made pursuant to a statutory scheme of discipline.
the trial court resolved this matter primarily on the basis of a single case,kayfetz state of california d.kayfetz.in kayfetz,a physician sued over the publication of a disciplinary action report that he alleged was inaccurate and violated promised confidentiality concerning his participation in a drug rehabilitation program.the disciplinary action against the physician was resolved by a stipulation under which the physician admitted charges of theft and possession and of dangerous drugs and accepted a decision revoking his license,staying the revocation and placing the physician on probation for five years.the stipulation provided that if the physician applied for and was admitted into a designated rehabilitation program,the decision would be suspended and,upon successful completion of the rehabilitation program,dismissed.id.at.the physician ultimately completed the rehabilitation program,the decision was set aside and the accusation dismissed.id.at.meanwhile,however,the disciplinary board published the charges and disposition of the matter in an official quarterly report in which it was statutorily required to publish disciplinary action.id.at.
kayfetz held the physician action was barred by the immunity of section,because the publication of the official action report was part of the prosecution of a proceeding within the meaning of that statute.kayfetz,supra,d at.the court noted that publication of disciplinary action is part of the statutory scheme intended to protect the public and found no statute requiring confidentiality as to the fact of drug abuse.id.at.quoting citizens capital spohn d,kayfetz explained that immunity under section,even from wrongfully motivated action,is granted,as a matter of public policy,to avoid the risk of public officers avoiding their public duty for fear of the burden of trial and risk of its outcome.kayfetz,supra,d at.kayfetz has been viewed as suggesting an expansive interpretation of the prosecution process covered by section to include the period up to the service of the sentence or the execution of the penalty.cappuccio,harmon d.in cappuccio,section immunity was held to bar libel and slander claims against a state officer who gave erroneous information in a public announcement concerning the plaintiffs conviction for violations of the fish and game code and business and professions code although the statements were made after the plaintiffs were convicted,cappuccio viewed a report on the outcome of a prosecution as part of the prosecution process.id.at.
respondents maintain that under kayfetz,citizens capital and cappuccio,the complaint in the present case is barred by section immunity because respondents merely publicized the outcome of the disciplinary proceeding during the period before appellant penalty was executed.citizens capital and cappuccio are not of direct assistance in resolving the question presented here,however,as neither of these cases involved a settlement agreement or claimed breach thereof.while kayfetz applied section immunity in a case involving a settlement agreement,appellant correctly points out that kayfetz did not address section although kayfetz referred to the physician allegations that the publication violated promised confidentiality kayfetz,supra,d at,the opinion did not indicate whether the stipulation expressly contained a confidentiality provision,how the promise of confidentiality was alleged to have been made,or whether the complaint alleged any breach of contract claim.in the present case,by contrast,appellant has specifically alleged that the settlement agreement expressly provided that the complainants would be notified only of the outcome of the proceeding,not the results or findings of orea investigations or contents of the stipulation,that respondents represented the stipulation was a private reproval and entirely confidential,and that respondents allegedly breached the stipulation by publishing letters to complainants indicating that respondents had performed a complete investigation and relating confidential information concerning the investigation,findings,conclusions and action taken against appellant.
the allegations of an express confidentiality agreement and breach thereof make it difficult to view kayfetz as dispositive of the present case without further consideration.if appellant is correct that the stipulation in the present case is a standard settlement agreement subject to ordinary contract principles,this case pits the immunity granted by section directly against the liability provision of section.
as indicated above,respondents argue that the stipulation in the present case was not really contractual because it was entered pursuant to a statutory scheme of discipline.they note that frankel board of dental examiners,supra,th,d,the main case upon which appellant relies in arguing that the stipulation is governed by ordinary contract principles,actually stated absent a statutory framework governing enforcement of agreements to settle accusations brought by licensing agencies,the parties assert that their stipulation and settlement,like civil settlement agreements generally,is governed by contract principles.id.at,d,italics added.in frankel,the statutes which gave the board of dental examiners authority to investigate allegations of misconduct and institute disciplinary action did not expressly authorize settlement of disputes rather,case law afforded the board implied power to settle licensing disputes.ibid.in the present case,the governing statutes and regulations expressly give respondents the authority to settle disciplinary matters.bus,tit,subd.c.business and professions code section specifically provides that private reprovals or letters of warning are to remain confidential.the regulations further require the agency to develop a confidential investigative report on each complaint against a real estate appraiser,tit,subd.a and to notify the complainant that a confidential investigation has been commenced and of final action taken on the complaint,tit,subd.b.
respondents argument that the stipulation in the present case is not contractual is not well taken.the statutory scheme upon which respondents rely in making this argument simply authorizes the orea to settle disciplinary disputes it is silent as to the enforcement of such settlement agreements.the situation thus differs little from that in frankel board of dental examiners,supra,th,d.additionally,the regulations impose the same requirement of confidentiality that appellant alleges was expressly included in the stipulation at issue.it would be anomalous to allow the existence of a statutory scheme requiring confidentiality as to all but the outcome of a disciplinary action to justify a failure to abide by the terms of a settlement agreement requiring the same confidentiality.
indeed,to accept respondents argument would be to hold that a settlement agreement with the state is completely unenforceable.we recognize that a settlement agreement is necessarily entered into as a part of the prosecution of a judicial or administrative proceeding.a settlement agreement,however,is nevertheless a contract.the policy underlying the immunity provision of section,as indicated above,is to allow public officers to discharge their publ
