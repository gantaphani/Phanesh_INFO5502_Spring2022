plaintiffs flamingo industries and its owner arthur wah collectively flamingo brought suit in the northern district of california against the united states postal service.flamingo asserted a number of federal and state law claims stemming from the postal service termination of flamingo contract to produce mail sacks.the district court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue,and did not reach the merits of any of the claims.flamingo appeals.
according to the allegations of flamingo complaint,which we take as true for purposes of this appeal,the postal service terminated flamingo contract because it wanted to use cheaper mail sacks manufactured in mexico,sacks that fail to meet safety and quality regulations.to disguise this scheme,the postal service adopted outdated requirements for mail sacks that could not be met by the modern machines used by flamingo and other domestic manufactures,creating a pretext for canceling the domestic mail sack contracts.once those contracts were canceled,the service declared a fake emergency in the supply of mail sacks that allowed it to award future contracts to foreign manufactures on a basis.the service sought to hide the false nature of this emergency by failing to follow regulations requiring documentation of any emergency.
based on this alleged conduct,flamingo asserted five federal antitrust claims,alleging that the postal service,in collusion with mexican mail sack manufacturers,sought to suppress competition and create a monopoly in mail sack production in violation of federal antitrust laws.flamingo also asserted claims alleging that the postal service violated the postal service procurement manual,the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,california business and professions code,and.
the district court did not reach the merits of any of these claims.it dismissed the federal antitrust claims on the ground that the postal service was protected by sovereign immunity from antitrust liability.it determined that the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was a tort claim,and dismissed it for lack of exhaustion under the federal tort claims act.the court dismissed the remaining claims on the ground that venue did not lie in the northern district of california.
we have jurisdiction under.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.we conclude that flamingo may pursue claims against the postal service for alleged violations of federal antitrust laws because congress has withdrawn the cloak of sovereign immunity from the postal service and given it the status of a private corporation the district court had jurisdiction over flamingo procurement manual claim pursuant to b the court properly dismissed flamingo breach of implied covenant claim for failure to exhaust under the federal tort claims act although the district court had original jurisdiction over flamingo claim asserted under california business professions code,that claim was properly dismissed because it is preempted by federal law flamingo claim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and venue for the postal service procurement manual claim was properly laid in the northern district of california.
the federal antitrust law claims 
flamingo argues the district court erred in holding that sovereign immunity bars its suit against the postal service under federal antitrust laws flamingo contends the postal service lost its sovereign status pursuant to the postal reorganization act of,stat.codified as amended in title of the united states code,which provides in relevant part that the postal service shall have the power to sue and be sued in its official name.we agree.
in fdic meyer,d,the supreme court applied a inquiry in analyzing whether a federal instrumentality enjoys immunity from a particular substantive area of law.under this analysis,t he first inquiry is whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity.id.if there has been,the second inquiry is whether the source of substantive law upon which the claimant relies provides an avenue for relief.id.
following meyer,we first consider whether operates as a waiver of the postal service sovereign immunity.more precisely,our inquiry is whether the language of that section waives sovereign immunity as to the plaintiffs antitrust claims.
the supreme court established the breadth of the postal service sovereign immunity waiver in franchise tax board united states postal service,d.there,the issue was whether the postal service had to comply with a state tax board liens on postal service employees salaries.the court began its analysis by recognizing that the general presumption is that a clause should be liberally construed w hen congress establishes an agency,authorizes it to engage in commercial and business transactions with the public,and permits it to sue and be sued,it can not be lightly assumed that restrictions on that authority are to be implied.id.at quoting fha burr.to overcome this presumption it must be clearly shown that certain types of suits are not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme,that an implied restriction of the general authority is necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function,or that for other reasons it was plainly the purpose of congress to use the sue and be sued clause in a narrow sense.id.at quoting burr,at.
the postal service could not overcome the presumption.in doing away with the post office department and creating the postal service in the postal reorganization act,congress had indicated that it wished the postal service to be run more like a business than had its predecessor id.at.congress had launched the postal service into the commercial world hence under burr not only must we liberally construe the clause,but also we must presume that the service liability is the same as that of any other business.id.at brackets in original.
the court reaffirmed the breadth of the postal service waiver in loeffler frank,d.there,a mail carrier had successfully maintained a title vii action against the postal service and was seeking prejudgment interest on his award of damages.id.at.title vii allowed for actions against the federal government,see,but it did not contain a provision allowing for prejudgment interest against the government.indeed,just two years earlier,in library of congress shaw,d,the supreme court had held that sovereign immunity barred the payment of interest on an award under title vii against the library of congress.the court in loeffler,however,distinguished shaw because,unlike the library of congress,the postal service sovereign immunity had been waived.loeffler,at.
the court stressed the difference between a sovereign instrumentality,such as the library of congress,and a instrumentality,such as the postal service.the court stated that in shaw,the starting point for our analysis was the rule,which is to the effect that,absent express consent by congress,the united states is immune from interest awards the dispositive question was whether title vii contained an express waiver of the library of congress immunity from interest.loeffler,at citation omitted.it did not.however,t he rule is inapplicable where the government has cast off the cloak of sovereignty and assumed the status of a private commercial enterprise.id.quoting shaw,at.in creating the postal service,congress cast off the cloak of sovereignty,and therefore,the rule does not apply to it.id.
in,the court returned to the issue in meyer,d.there,the plaintiff prevailed at trial in a action against the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic,which was a federal instrumentality.after the fdic,the successor in interest to the fslic,appealed unsuccessfully,the supreme court granted certiorari.id.at.in rejecting the fdic argument that the fslic enjoyed sovereign immunity,the court reiterated that waivers are to be liberally construed notwithstanding the general rule that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be read narrowly in favor of the sovereign.id.at citation omitted.further,the fact that bivens actions were not generally available against private corporations was not controlling.w e have looked to the liability of a private enterprise as a floor below which a agency liability could not fall,not a ceiling that may not be exceeded.id.at emphasis omitted.thus,the waiver of the fslic immunity included federal constitutional torts.id.at.the court went on to hold,however,that bivens actions could not be filed against federal agencies,only against federal officers.id.at.
relying on franchise tax board,loeffler,and meyer,flamingo argues that the postal service waiver of immunity reaches federal antitrust actions.we agree.in franchise tax board,the court held that the general rule can be overcome only if the postal service makes a clear showing that the type of suit filed against it is not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme,an implied restriction is necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function,or congress plainly intended to use sue and be sued in a narrow sense.franchise tax,at quoting burr,at accord loeffler,at.here,the postal service does not attempt to make the clear showing of congressional purpose necessary to overcome the presumption that immunity from federal antitrust actions has been waived.meyer,at.further,it is doubtful the postal service could make that showing as was the case in loeffler,since congress expressly included several narrow and specific limitations on the operation of the postal service clause,see,none of which is applicable here,the natural inference is that it did not intend other limitations to be implied.loeffler,at footnote omitted.
having determined that congress has waived the postal service immunity,we turn to the second inquiry,whether the source of substantive law upon which the claimant relies provides an avenue for relief.meyer,at.the source of substantive law upon which flamingo relies is federal antitrust law.the postal service argues that a federal antitrust claim may not be pursued against it because it is not a person within the meaning of that law.we disagree.although a federal sovereign is not a person,the postal service is not a sovereign.
the rule that the federal government and its instrumentalities are not persons for federal antitrust law purposes dates back to united states cooper.in cooper,the federal government attempted to bring a civil suit under the sherman act.the court rejected the suit,holding that the sherman act only allowed persons to bring civil suits and the united states did not meet the definition of a person under the act.id.at.the court explained that,in common usage,the term person does not include the sovereign,and statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it.id.at.although there is no hard and fast rule of exclusion of the sovereign from the word person,id.at,the court was concerned because the sherman act used the word person to describe both who could bring suit and who could be sued.the court wanted to avoid interpreting person in a manner in which the united states could be sued.id.at.hence,the court reasoned that t he more natural inference is that the meaning of the word was in both uses limited to what are usually known as natural and artificial persons,that is,individuals and corporations.id.
later circuit court decisions extended cooper to exclude federal instrumentalities from the meaning of the word person in federal antitrust laws.in the seminal case of service,alaska railroad,ginsburg wrote for the court in holding that congress did not place the united states or its instrumentalities under the governance of the sherman act.the service opinion relied on cooper,and on congress decision after cooper to amend some of the federal antitrust laws to allow the united states to bring civil actions for single,but not treble,damages.id.at.this,the court reasoned,represented a congressional intent to leave the word persons as the cooper court had defined it.id.at.
in sakamoto duty free shoppers,cir,we applied service and held that federal instrumentalities are immune from antitrust liability.because the defendant government of guam was an instrumentality of the federal government,we held t here is no reason why guam should enjoy less immunity than the federal government itself.id.at citing jet courier,fed.reserve bank of atlanta,cir,and,at.
cooper,service,and sakamoto remain valid precedent,but they do not control our decision today.these holdings require or assume that the federal instrumentality at issue enjoys federal sovereignty.as the second circuit recently explained w hile the court holding that the sherman act does not expose federal agencies to legal or equitable liability for alleged antitrust violations is uncontroversial,such immunity was founded on the sovereign immunity of the united states,network solutions,cir citation omitted.here,the postal service does not enjoy federal sovereignty.
the postal service waiver of immunity has created a presumption that the cloak of sovereignty has been withdrawn and that the postal service should be treated as a private corporation.see franchise tax board,at w e must presume that the service liability is the same as that of any other business.accord loeffler,at congress has cast off the service cloak of sovereignty and given it the status of a private commercial enterprise.quoting shaw,at.see also meyer,at the court has looked to the liability of a private enterprise as a floor below which the agency liability could not fall.because the postal service is an entity with the status of a private commercial enterprise,it fits within the common meaning of the word person,just as does any other private corporation.see the word person,or persons,wherever used in title of the united states code shall be deemed to include corporations see also.agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d t he presumption with regard to corporations is just the opposite of the one governing sovereigns they are presumptively covered by the term person citing emphasis omitted.
we find support for our conclusion in global mail united states postal service,cir.there,the fourth circuit held that the postal service was a person that could be sued under the lanham act the court explained 
t he lanham act itself contains no waiver of sovereign immunity for the federal government,and the act definition of person as an organization capable of being sued falls short of the standard of explicitness required for such a waiver.but those agencies whose immunity has already been waived,and are capable of suing and being sued,fall squarely within the plain language of the lanham act definition of juristic persons.a governmental agency engaged in a commercial enterprise,as is usps,is indistinguishable in kind from a private firm or association.
id.at accord fed.express united states postal,cir united states q int l courier,cir.this reasoning applies equally here,where federal antitrust law defines person as including any private corporation,see,and where supreme court precedent establishes that the postal service is to be treated as a private corporation.see loeffler,at.
the postal service cites several cases involving instrumentalities where such entities were held exempt from federal antitrust laws.see jet courier,at wiggins airways.port,cir webster county coal.valley.these cases predate the supreme court decisions in franchise tax board,loeffler,and meyer and are not persuasive authority in light of the court recent jurisprudence.
we hold that the postal service can be sued under federal antitrust laws because congress has stripped the postal service of its sovereign status by launching it into the commercial world as a entity akin to a private corporation.however,we add one significant caveat.two types of immunity from federal antitrust laws exist.our discussion has focused solely on the first kind of immunity immunity,see,at the parties only raise that type of immunity.a second type of immunity apply when an entity does not enjoy immunity,but acts at the direction of a federal sovereign.see id.at holding that a nonsovereign contractor enjoyed immunity from antitrust law where it was exercising
