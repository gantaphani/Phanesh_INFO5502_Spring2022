respondents,a group of manufacturers,hospitals,and other institutions that buy natural gas directly from interstate pipelines,sued petitioner interstate pipelines,claiming that the pipelines had engaged in behavior that violated state antitrust laws.in particular,respondents alleged that petitioners reported false information to the indices on which respondents contracts were based.the indices affected not only retail prices,but also wholesale prices.
after removing the cases to federal court,the petitioner pipelines sought summary judgment on the ground that the natural gas act respondents claims.that act gives the federal energy regulatory commission ferc the authority to determine whether rates charged by companies or practices affecting such rates are unreasonable.a.but it also limits ferc jurisdiction to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale,and companies engaged in such transportation or sale.b.the act leaves regulation of other portions of the industry such as retail sales to the states.ibid.
the district court granted petitioners motion for summary judgment,reasoning that because petitioners challenged practices directly affected wholesale as well as retail prices,they were by the act.the ninth circuit reversed.while acknowledging that the pipelines index manipulation increased wholesale prices as well as retail prices,it held that the claims were not because they were aimed at obtaining damages only for excessively high retail prices.
held respondents antitrust claims are not within the field of matters by the natural gas act.

schneidewind anr pipeline,is not to the contrary.that opinion explains that the act does not traditional state regulation,such as blue sky laws,at.antitrust laws,like blue sky laws,are not aimed at companies in particular,but rather all businesses in the marketplace.the broad applicability of state antitrust laws supports a finding of no here.
so,too,does the fact that states have long provided and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices,california arc america.as noted earlier,the act circumscribes ferc powers and preserves traditional areas of state authority.b.
b neither mississippi power light mississippi ex rel.moore,nor fpc louisiana power light,supports petitioners position.mississippi power is best read as a conflict case,not a field case.in any event,the state inquiry in mississippi power was because it was directed at jurisdictional sales in a way that respondents state antitrust suits are not.louisiana power is also a conflict case,and thus does not significantly help petitioners field argument.
c because the parties have not argued conflict,questions involving conflicts between state antitrust proceedings and the federal process are left for the lower courts to resolve in the first instance.
d while petitioners and the government argue that this court should defer to ferc determination that field bars respondents claims,they fail to point to a specific ferc determination that state antitrust claims fall within the field by the natural gas act.thus,this court need not consider what legal effect such a determination might have.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
in this case,a group of manufacturers,hospitals,and other institutions that buy natural gas directly from interstate pipelines sued the pipelines,claiming that they engaged in behavior that violated state antitrust laws.the pipelines behavior affected both federally regulated wholesale prices and nonfederally regulated retail prices.the question is whether the federal natural gas act these lawsuits.we have said that,in passing the act,congress occupied the field of matters relating to wholesale sales and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.schneidewind anr pipeline.nevertheless,for the reasons given below,we conclude that the act does not the antitrust suits at issue here.
the supremacy clause provides that the laws of the united states as well as treaties and the constitution itself shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.art.vi,cl.congress may consequently,invalidate,a state law through federal legislation.it may do so through express language in a statute.but even where,as here,a statute does not refer expressly to,congress may implicitly a state law,rule,or other state action.see sprietsma mercury marine.
it may do so either through field or conflict as to the former,congress may have intended to foreclose any state regulation in the area,irrespective of whether state law is consistent or inconsistent with federal standards.arizona united states,slip,at emphasis added.in such situations,congress has forbidden the state to take action in the field that the federal statute.
by contrast,conflict exists where compliance with both state and federal law is impossible,or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.california arc america.in either situation,federal law must prevail.
no one here claims that any relevant federal statute expressly state antitrust lawsuits.nor have the parties argued at any length that these state suits conflict with federal law.rather,the interstate pipeline companies petitioners here argue that congress implicitly occupied the field of matters relating to wholesale sales and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.brief for petitioners quoting schneidewind,supra,at emphasis added.and they contend that the state antitrust claims advanced by their customers respondents here fall within that field.the united states,supporting the pipelines,argues similarly.see brief for united states as amicus curiae.since the parties have argued this case almost exclusively in terms of field,we consider only the field question.
federal regulation of the industry began at a time when the industry was divided into three segments.see regulation of the natural gas industry mogel ed.hereinafter mogel general motors tracy.first,producers sunk wells in large oil and gas fields such as the permian basin in texas and new mexico.they gathered the gas,brought it to transportation points,and left it to interstate gas pipelines to transport the gas to distant markets.second,interstate pipelines shipped the gas from the field to cities and towns across the nation.third,local gas distributors bought the gas from the interstate pipelines and resold it to business and residential customers within their localities.
originally,the states regulated all three segments of the industry.see mogel.but in the early century,this court held that the commerce clause forbids the states to regulate the second part of the business,the interstate shipment and sale of gas to local distributors for resale.see,public util.comm of attleboro steam,missouri ex rel.barrett kansas natural gas.these holdings left a regulatory gap.congress enacted the natural gas act,stat,to fill it.see phillips petroleum wisconsin,citing.
the act,in a,gives authority to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,formerly the federal power commission fpc.that authority allows ferc to determine whether any rate,charge,or classification collected by any company in connection with any transportation or sale of natural gas,subject to the jurisdiction of ferc,or any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate,charge,or classification is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory,or preferential.a emphasis added.as the italicized words make clear,a limits the scope of ferc authority to activities in connection with any transportation or sale of natural gas,subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.ibid.emphasis added.and the act,in b,limits ferc jurisdiction to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale,and companies engaged in such transportation or sale.b.the act leaves regulation of other portions of the industry such as production,local distribution facilities,and direct sales to the states.see northwest central pipeline state corporation comm of,section b of the act expressly provides that states retain jurisdiction over intrastate transportation,local distribution,and distribution facilities,and over the production or gathering of natural gas 
to simplify our discussion,we shall describe the firms that engage in interstate transportation as jurisdictional sellers or interstate pipelines though various brokers and others may also fall within the act jurisdictional scope.similarly,we shall refer to the sales over which ferc has jurisdiction as jurisdictional sales or wholesale sales.
until the,regulation roughly tracked the industry model we described above.interstate pipelines would typically buy gas from field producers and resell it to local distribution companies for resale.see tracy,supra,at.ferc or fpc,acting under the authority of the natural gas act,would set interstate pipeline wholesale rates using classical ratemaking methods.see public serv.comm of gas.that is,ferc would determine a pipeline revenue requirement by calculating the costs of providing its services,including operating and maintenance expenses,depreciation expenses,taxes,and a reasonable profit.see ferc,rates manual june.ferc would then set wholesale rates at a level designed to meet the pipeline revenue requirement.
deregulation of the industry,however,brought about changes in ferc approach.in the,this court had held that the natural gas act required regulation of prices at the interstate pipelines buying end,the prices at which field producers sold natural gas to interstate pipelines.phillips petroleum,supra,at.by the,many in congress thought that such efforts to regulate field prices had jeopardized supplies in an industry already dependent on the caprice of nature.fpc hope natural gas,opinion of jackson,see,at recognizing that the wealth of midas and the wit of man can not produce a natural gas field hoping to avoid future shortages,congress enacted forms of field price deregulation designed to rely upon competition,rather than regulation,to keep field prices low.see,natural gas policy act of,stat,codified in part at et phasing out regulation of wellhead prices charged by producers of natural gas natural gas wellhead decontrol act of,stat.removing price controls on wellhead sales as of january.
ferc promulgated new regulations designed to further this process of deregulation.see,regulation of natural gas pipelines after partial wellhead decontrol,fed.reg.allowing open access to pipelines so that consumers could pay to ship their own gas.most important here,ferc adopted an approach that relied on the competitive marketplace,rather than classical regulatory,as the main mechanism for keeping wholesale rates at a reasonable level.order,issued in,allowed ferc to issue blanket certificates that permitted jurisdictional sellers typically interstate pipelines to charge rates for gas,provided that ferc had first determined that the sellers lacked market power.see fed.reg,at.
after the issuance of this order,ferc oversight of the market largely consisted of ex ante examinations of jurisdictional sellers market power,and the availability of a complaint process under a.see brief for united states as amicus curiae.the new system also led many large gas consumers such as industrial and commercial users to buy their own gas directly from gas producers,and to arrange and often pay separately for transportation from the field to the place of consumption.see tracy,at.insofar as interstate pipelines sold gas to such consumers,they sold it for direct consumption rather than resale.
the system for setting interstate pipeline rates turned out to be less than perfect.interstate pipelines,distributing companies,and many of the customers who bought directly from the pipelines found that they had to rely on privately published price indices to determine appropriate prices for their contracts.these indices listed the prices at which natural gas was being sold in different presumably competitive markets across the country.the information on which these indices were based was voluntarily reported by traders.
in,ferc found that the indices were inaccurate,in part because much of the information that traders reported had been false.see ferc,final report on price manipulation in western markets,app.ferc found that false reporting had involved inflating the volume of trades,omitting trades,and adjusting the price of trades.at.that is,sometimes those who reported information simply fabricated it.other times,the information reported reflected wash trades,prearranged pair s of trades of the same good between the same parties,involving no economic risk and no net change in beneficial ownership.at.ferc concluded that these efforts to manipulate price indices compiled by trade publications had helped raise to extraordinary levels the prices of both jurisdictional sales that is,interstate pipeline sales for resale and nonjurisdictional direct sales to ultimate consumers,at.
after issuing its final report on price manipulation in western markets,ferc issued a code of conduct.that code amended all blanket certificates to prohibit jurisdictional sellers from engaging in actions without a legitimate business purpose that manipulate or attempt to manipulate market conditions,including wash trades and collusion.fed.reg.the code also required jurisdictional companies,when they provided information to index publishers,to provide accurate and factual information,and not knowingly submit false or misleading information or omit material information to any such publisher.at.at the same time,ferc issued a policy statement setting forth minimum standards for creation and publication of any energy price index,and for reporting transaction data to index developers.price discovery in natural gas and markets,ferc.finally,ferc,after finding that certain jurisdictional sellers had engaged in wash trading that resulted in the manipulation of prices,terminated those sellers blanket marketing certificates.enron power marketing,ferc.
congress also took steps to address these problems.in particular,it passed the energy policy act of,stat,which gives ferc the authority to issue rules and regulations to prevent any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance by any entity in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of ferc.
we now turn to the cases before us.respondents,as we have said,bought large quantities of natural gas directly from interstate pipelines for their own consumption.they believe that they overpaid in these transactions due to the interstate pipelines manipulation of the indices.based on this belief,they filed antitrust suits against petitioners in state and federal courts.see app.alleging violations of.stat,see also app.same,at same,at alleging violations of kansas restraint of trade act.stat.ann.et app.alleging violations of missouri antitrust law.stat.the pipelines removed all the state cases to federal court,where they were consolidated and sent for pretrial proceedings to the federal district court for the district of nevada.see.
the pipelines then moved for summary judgment on the ground that the natural gas act respondents antitrust claims.the district court granted their motion.it concluded that the pipelines were jurisdictional sellers,natural gas companies engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.order in d,july.and it held that respondents claims,which were aimed at these sellers alleged practices of false price reporting,wash trades,and anticompetitive collusive behavior were because such practices,not only affected nonjurisdictional prices but also directly affect ed jurisdictional,wholesale rates,at.
the ninth circuit reversed.it emphasized that the of which respondents complained affected not only jurisdictional,wholesale sales,but also nonjurisdictional,retail sales.the court construed the natural gas act scope narrowly in light of congress intent manifested in b of the act to preserve for the states the authority to regulate nonjurisdictional sales.and it held that the act did not claims aimed at obtaining damages for excessively high retail prices stemming from interstate pipelines price manipulation,even if the manipulation raised wholesale rates as well.see in re western states wholesale natural gas antitrust litigation.
the pipelines sought certiorari.they asked us to resolve confusion in the lower courts as to whether the natural gas act retail customers state antitrust law challenges to practices that also affect wholesale rates.compare,at,with leggett duke energy.we granted the petition.
petitioners,supported by the united states,argue that their customers state antitrust lawsuits are within the field that the natural gas act.see brief for petitioners citing schneidewind,at brief for united states as amicus curiae same.they point out that respondents antitrust claims target anticompetitive activities that affected wholesale as well as retail rates.see brief for petitioners.they add that the natural gas act expressly grants ferc authority to keep wholesale rates at reasonable levels.see ibid.citing b,a.in exercising this authority,ferc has prohibited the very kind of anticompetitive conduct that the state actions attack.see part,supra.and,petitioners contend,letting these actions proceed will permit state antitrust courts to reach conclusions about that conduct that differ from those that ferc might reach or has already reached.accordingly,petitioners argue,respondents antitrust suits fall within the field.
petitioners arguments are forceful,but we can not accept their conclusion.as we have repeatedly stressed,the natural gas act was drawn with meticulous regard for the continued exercise of state power,not to handicap or dilute it in any way.panhandle eastern pipe line public serv.comm of,see also northwest central,at the legislative history of the act is replete with assurances that the act takes nothing from the state regulatory commissions quoting cong.rec.accordingly,where as here a state law can be applied to nonjurisdictional as well as jurisdictional sales,we must proceed cautiously,finding only where detailed examination convinces us that a matter falls within the field as defined by our precedents.see panhandle eastern,supra,at interstate natural gas fpc.
those precedents emphasize the importance of considering the target at which the state law aims in determining whether that law is.for example,in northern natural gas state corporation comm of,the court said that it had consistently recognized that the significant distinction for purposes of in the context is the distinction between measures aimed directly at interstate purchasers and wholesales for resale,and those aimed at subjects left to the states to regulate,at emphasis added.and,in northwest central,the court found that the natural gas act did not a state regulation concerning the timing of gas production from a gas field within the state,even though the regulation might have affected the costs of and the prices of interstate wholesale sales,jurisdictional sales,at.in reaching this conclusion,the court explained that the state regulation aimed primarily at protect ing producers rights a matter firmly on the states side of that dividing line.ibid.the court contrasted this state regulation with the state orders at issue in northern natural,which invalidly invade d the federal agency exclusive domain precisely because they were unmistakably and unambiguously directed at purchasers.at quoting northern natural,supra,at emphasis added.here,too,the lawsuits are directed at practices affecting retail are firmly on the states side of that dividing line.
petitioners argue that schneidewind constitutes contrary authority.in that case,the court found a state law that required public utilities,such as interstate pipelines crossing the state,to obtain state approval before issuing securities,at.but the court there thought that the state securities regulation was aimed directly at interstate pipelines.it wrote that the state law was designed to keep a natural gas company from raising its equity levels above a certain point in order to keep the company revenue requirement low,thereby ensuring lower wholesale rates,at.indeed,the court expressly said that the state law was because it was directed at the control of rates and facilities of natural gas companies,precisely the things over which ferc has comprehensive authority.at emphasis added.
the dissent rejects the notion that the proper test for purposes of in the natural gas context is whether the challenged measures are aimed directly at interstate purchasers and wholesales for resale or not.northern natural,supra,at.it argues that this approach is unprecedented,and that the court focus should be on what the state seeks to regulate,not why the state seeks to regulate it.post,at opinion of scalia.but the target to which our cases refer must mean more than just the physical activity that a state regulates.after all,a single physical action,such as reporting a price to a specialized journal,could be the subject of many different laws including tax laws,disclosure laws,and others.to repeat the point we made above,no one could claim that ferc regulation of this physical activity for purposes of wholesale rates forecloses every other form of state regulation that affects those rates.
indeed,although the dissent argues that schneidwind created a definitive test for in the natural gas context that turns on whether the matter on which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the federal act,post,at quoting,at,schneidewind could not mean this statement as an absolute test.it goes on to explain that the natural gas act does not traditional state regulation,such as state blue sky laws which,of course,raise wholesale as well as retail investment costs,at.
antitrust laws,like blue sky laws,are not aimed at companies in particular,but rather all businesses in the marketplace.see ibid.they are far broader in their application than,for example,the regulations at issue in northern natural,which applied only to entities buying gas from fields within the state.see,at,contra,post,at stating that northern natural concerned background market conditions this broad applicability of state antitrust law supports a finding of no here.
petitioners and the dissent argue that there is,or should be,a clear division between areas of state and federal authority in regulation.see brief for petitioners post,at.but that platonic ideal does not describe the natural gas regulatory world.suppose ferc,when setting wholesale rates in the former days,had denied cost recovery for pipelines failure to recycle.would that fact deny states the power to enact and apply recycling laws these state laws might well raise pipelines operating costs,and thus the costs of wholesale natural gas transportation.but in northwest central we said that t o find field of state regulation merely because purchasers costs and hence rates might be affected would be largely to nullify b.at.
the dissent barely mentions the limitations on ferc powers in b,but the enumeration of ferc powers in a is circumscribed by a reference back to the limitations in b.see post,at.as we explained above,see part,supra,those limits are key to understanding the careful balance between federal and state regulation that congress struck when it passed the natural gas act.that act was drawn with meticulous regard for the continued exercise of state power,not to handicap or dilute it in any way.panhandle eastern,at.contra,post,at.states have a long history of providing and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices.arc america,at see also watson buck,noting the states power to regulate combinations in restraint of trade respondents antitrust suits relied on this well established state power.
petitioners point to two other cases that they believe support their position.the first is mississippi power light mississippi ex rel.moore.there,the court held that the federal power act which gives ferc the authority to determine whether rates charged by public utilities in electric energy sales are just and reasonable,a a state inquiry into the reasonableness of prices for the sale of nuclear power to wholesalers of electricity which led to higher retail electricity rates,at.petitioners argue that this case shows that state regulation of similar sales here,by a pipeline to a direct consumer must also be.see reply brief.mississippi power,however,is best read as a conflict case,not a field case.see,at a state agency efforts to regulate commerce must fall when they conflict with or interfere with federal authority over the same activity quoting chicago north western transp.kalo brick tile.
regardless,the state inquiry in mississippi power was because it was directed at jurisdictional sales in a way that respondents state antitrust lawsuits are not.mississippi inquiry into the reasonableness of purchases was effectively an attempt to regulate in areas where ferc has properly exercised its jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale rates.at.by contrast,respondents state antitrust lawsuits do not seek to challenge the reasonableness of any rates expressly approved by ferc.rather,they seek to challenge the background marketplace conditions that affected both jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional rates.
petitioners additionally point to fpc louisiana power light.in that case,the court held that federal law gave fpc the authority to allocate natural gas during shortages by ordering interstate pipelines to curtail gas deliveries to all customers,including retail customers.this latter fact,the pipelines argue,shows that ferc has authority to regulate index manipulation insofar as that manipulation affects retail as well as wholesale sales.brief for petitioners.accordingly,they contend that state laws that aim at this same subject are.
this argument,however,makes too much of too little.the court finding of in louisiana power rested on its belief that the state laws in question con flicted with federal law.the court concluded that fpc has authority to effect orderly curtailment plans involving both direct sales and sales for resale,at,because otherwise there would be unavoidable conflict between state regulation of direct sales and the uniform federal regulation that the natural gas act foresees,at.conflict may,of course,invalidate a state law even though field does not.because petitioners have not argued this case as a conflict case,louisiana power does not offer them significant help.
to the extent any conflicts arise between state antitrust law proceedings and the federal process,the doctrine of conflict should prove sufficient to address them.but as we have noted,see part,supra,the parties have not argued conflict.see also,tr.of oral arg.solicitor general agrees that he has not analyzed this case under a conflict preemption regime we consequently leave conflict questions for the lower courts to resolve in the first instance.
we note that petitioners and the solicitor general have argued that we should defer to ferc determination that field bars the respondents claims.see brief for petitioners citing arlington fcc,slip,at brief for united states as amicus curiae same.but they have not pointed to a specific ferc determination that state antitrust claims fall within the field by the natural gas act.rather,they point only to the fact that ferc has promulgated detailed rules governing manipulation of price indices.because there is no determination by ferc that its regulation the field into which respondents antitrust suits fall,we need not consider what legal effect such a determination might have.and we conclude that the detailed federal regulations here do not offset the other considerations that weigh against a finding of in this context.
for these reasons,the judgment of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit is affirmed.

i agree with much of the majority application of our precedents governing under the natural gas act.i write separately to reiterate my view that implied doctrines that wander far from the statutory text are inconsistent with the constitution.wyeth levine,thomas,concurring in judgment.the supremacy clause of our constitution gives supreme status only to those federal laws that are made in pursuance of it,at quoting art.vi,cl.and to be made in pursuance of the constitution,a law must fall within one of congress enumerated powers and be promulgated in accordance with the lawmaking procedures set forth in that document,at.the supremacy clause thus requires that effect be given only to those federal standards and policies that are set forth in,or necessarily follow from,the statutory text that was produced through the constitutionally required bicameral and presentment procedures.at.
in light of this constitutional requirement,i have doubts about the legitimacy of this court precedents concerning the scope of the natural gas act,see,northern natural gas state corporation comm of,defining the field in light of the objective s of the act.neither party,however,has asked us to overrule these longstanding precedents or to overcome the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to them.kurns railroad friction products,slip,at.and even under these precedents,the challenged state antitrust laws fall outside the field.because the court today avoids extending its earlier questionable precedents,i concur in its judgment and join all but part of its opinion.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia,with whom the chief justice joins,dissenting.
the natural gas act divides responsibility over trade in natural gas between federal and state regulators.the act and our cases interpreting it draw a firm line between national and local authority over this trade if the federal government may regulate a subject,the states may not.today the court smudges this line.it holds that states may use their antitrust laws to regulate practices already regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission whenever other considerations weigh against a finding of.ante,at.the court approach to preemption has no basis in the act,contradicts our cases,and will prove unworkable in practice.
trade in natural gas consists of three parts.a drilling company collects gas from the earth a pipeline company then carries the gas to its destination and sells it at wholesale to a local distributor and the local distributor sells the gas at retail to industries and households.see ante,at.the natural gas act empowers the commission to regulate the middl
