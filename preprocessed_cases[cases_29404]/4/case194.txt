opinion of the court 
sloviter,circuit judge,with whom becker,chief judge,nygaard,mckee,ambro,fuentes,and smith,circuit judges,join 
minnesota mining and manufacturing company appeals from the district court order entered march,declining to overturn the jury verdict for lepage in its suit against under section of the sherman act.raises various objections to the trial court decision but essentially its position is a legal one it contends that a plaintiff can not succeed in a monopolization case unless it shows that the conceded monopolist sold its product below cost.because we conclude that exclusionary conduct,such as the exclusive dealing and bundled rebates proven here,can sustain a verdict under against a monopolist and because we find no other reversible error,we will affirm.
factual background 
which manufactures scotch tape for home and office use,dominated the united states transparent tape market with a market share above until the early.it has conceded that it has a monopoly in that market.lepage founded in,has sold a variety of office products and,around,decided to sell second brand and private label transparent tape,tape sold under the retailer name rather than under the name of the manufacturer.by,lepage sold of private label tape sales in the united states,which represented but a small portion of the transparent tape market.private label tape sold at a lower price to the retailer and the customer than branded tape.
distribution patterns and consumer acceptance accounted for a shift of some tape sales from branded tape to private label tape.with the rapid growth of office superstores,such as staples and office depot,and mass merchandisers,such as and kmart,distribution patterns for second brand and private label tape changed as many of the large retailers wanted to use their brand names to sell stationery products,including transparent tape.also entered the private label business during the early and sold its own second brand under the name highland.
lepage claims that,in response to the growth of this competitive market,engaged in a series of related,anticompetitive acts aimed at restricting the availability of transparent tape to consumers.it also claims that devised programs that prevented lepage and the other domestic company in the business,tesa tuck,from gaining or maintaining large volume sales and that maintained its monopoly by stifling growth of private label tape and by coordinating efforts aimed at large distributors to keep retail prices for scotch tape high lepage claims that it barely was surviving at the time of trial and that it suffered large operating losses from through.
lepage brought this antitrust action asserting that used its monopoly over its scotch tape brand to gain a competitive advantage in the private label tape portion of the transparent tape market in the united states through the use of bundled rebate structure,which offered higher rebates when customers purchased products in a number of different product lines.lepage also alleges that offered to some of lepage customers large cash payments,promotional allowances and other cash incentives to encourage them to enter into exclusive dealing arrangements with.
lepage asserted claims for unlawful agreements in restraint of trade under of the sherman act,monopolization and attempted monopolization under of the sherman act,and exclusive dealing under of the clayton act.after a nine week trial,the jury returned its verdict for lepage on both its monopolization and attempted monopolization claims under of the sherman act,and assessed damages of on each.it found in favor on lepage claims under of the sherman act and of the clayton act.filed its motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial,arguing that its rebate and discount programs and the other conduct of which lepage complained did not constitute the basis for a valid antitrust claim as a matter of law and that,in any event,the court charge to the jury was insufficiently specific and lepage damages proof was speculative the district court granted motion for judgment as a matter of law on lepage attempted maintenance of monopoly power claim but denied motion for judgment as a matter of law in all other respects and denied its motion for new trial.le page,no.civ,wl.the court subsequently entered a judgment for trebled damages of to which interest was to be added.lepage filed a cross appeal on the district court judgment dismissing its attempted maintenance of monopoly power claim.
on appeal,the panel of this court before which this case was originally argued reversed the district court judgment on lepage claim by a divided vote.lepage,and,wl cir.this court granted lepage motion for rehearing en banc and,pursuant to its practice,vacated the panel opinion.lepage,and cir,order vacating panel opinion.the appeal was then orally argued before the court en banc.

monopolization applicable legal principles 
section of the sherman act provides 
every person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,or combine or conspire with any other person or persons,to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,shall be deemed guilty of a felony,and,on conviction thereof,shall be punished by fine not exceeding if a corporation,or,if any other person,or by imprisonment not exceeding three years,or by both said punishments,in the discretion of the court.
a private party may sue for damages for violation of this provision and recover threefold the damages and counsel fees.id.
because this section is in sweeping language,suggesting the breadth of its coverage,we look to the supreme court decisions for elucidation of the standard to be used in cases alleging monopolization.elucidation came in united states grinnell,d,where the court declared that a defendant company which possesses monopoly power in the relevant market will be found in violation of of the sherman act if the defendant willfully acquired or maintained that power.id.at.
in this case,the parties agreed that the relevant product market is transparent tape and the relevant geographic market is the united states moreover,as to the issue of monopoly power,as we noted above,concedes it possesses monopoly power in the united states transparent tape market,with a market share.in fact,the evidence showed that the household penetration of tape is virtually.therefore we need not dwell on the issue of market power.see robert pitofsky,new definitions of relevant market and the assault on antitrust,colum,in monopoly enforcement under section of the sherman act,the pivotal inquiry is almost always whether the challenged party has substantial market power in its relevant market.
the sole remaining issue and our focus on this appeal is whether took steps to maintain that power in a manner that violated of the sherman act.a monopolist willfully acquires or maintains monopoly power when it competes on some basis other than the merits.see aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d.
lepage argues that willfully maintained its monopoly in the transparent tape market through exclusionary conduct,primarily by bundling its rebates and entering into contracts that expressly or effectively required dealing virtually exclusively with,which lepage characterizes as de facto exclusive.does not argue that it did not engage in this conduct.it agrees that it offered bundled rebates and entered into some exclusive dealing contracts,although it argues that only the few contracts that are expressly exclusive may be considered as such.instead,argues that its conduct was legal as a matter of law because it never priced its transparent tape below its cost 
this is the most significant legal issue in this case because it underlies argument.in its brief,states a pricing can not give rise to an antitrust offense as a matter of law,since it is the very conduct that the antitrust laws wish to promote in the interest of making consumers better off.appellant br.at.for this proposition it relies on the supreme court decision in brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d.it is an argument repeated frequently during its oral argument before the en banc court.counsel stated,if the big guy is selling above cost,it has done nothing which offends the sherman act tr.of oral argument,at.this was the theory upon which counsel responded to all the questions from the court.when asked whether its theory is that because no one contended that sold below its cost,that is the end of the story,its counsel responded,w ith the exception of the inconsequential express contract,absolutely.id.
it is therefore necessary for us,at the outset,to examine whether we must accept legal theory that after brooke group,no conduct by a monopolist who sells its product above cost no matter how exclusionary the conduct can constitute monopolization in violation of of the sherman act.the history of the interpretation of of the sherman act demonstrates the lack of foundation for premise.
although of the sherman act may have received less judicial and scholarly attention than several of the other more frequently invoked antitrust provisions,the supreme court,in a series of decisions,has made clear the type of conduct that will be held to constitute monopolization in violation of.
the modern era begins with the decision by judge learned hand in united states aluminum of america,cir alcoa.because four members of the supreme court were disqualified,the supreme court was required to apply the provision of the expediting act,section of title,currently,to certify the case to the three most senior judges of the relevant circuit under the statute,the decision of that court was final and conclusive,thus equating it to a decision of the supreme court.
at the time in question,alcoa was the sole domestic producer of aluminum and thus had a monopoly that the government sought to disband.in the opinion on liability,the court enunciated certain principles that remain fully applicable today.one such principle is that it does not follow that a company that has a monopoly has monopolized the market because it may not have achieved monopoly monopoly may have been thrust upon it.id.at.as the court explained,persons may unwittingly find themselves in possession of a monopoly,automatically so to say that is,without having intended either to put an end to existing competition,or to prevent competition from arising when none had existed they may become monopolists by force of accident.id.at.on the other hand,the court then quoted justice cardozo statement in united states swift,that size carries with it an opportunity for abuse that is not to be ignored when the opportunity is proved to have been utilized in the past.alcoa,at.
the court determined that alcoa,which controlled over of the aluminum market,had utilized its size for abuse.the court,noting that there had been at least one or two abortive attempts by others to enter the industry,concluded that alcoa effectively anticipated and forestalled all competition,and succeeded in holding the field alone.id.at.finding alcoa in violation of,the court continued 
nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field.it insists that it never excluded competitors but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened,and to face every newcomer with new capacity already geared into a great organization,having the advantage of experience,trade connections and the elite of personnel.
one year later,in american tobacco united states,the supreme court endorsed the alcoa decision when upholding a jury verdict finding a violation.the government brought a criminal action against various tobacco companies that between and accounted at all times for more than,and usually for more than,of the nation domestic cigarette production.defendants were convicted and fined after the jury found they had violated and of the sherman act by conspiring to control the price of leaf tobacco,to acquire less expensive supplies of tobacco they did not need in order to deprive rival manufacturers of cheaper brands,to control cigarette prices,and to force cigarette distributors to treat rival brands less favorably.
the court of appeals affirmed,finding the verdicts to be supported by sufficient evidence.the supreme court granted the tobacco companies petitions for certiorari only as to their claims,seeking to answer the specific question whether actual exclusion of competitors is necessary to the crime of monopolization under of the sherman act.id.at.answering that question in the negative,the court stated that n either proof of exertion of the power to exclude nor proof of actual exclusion of existing or potential competitors is essential to sustain a charge of monopolization under the sherman act.id.at.furthermore,and importantly,the court explicitly welcome d this opportunity to endorse certain passages from judge hand opinion.id.at.
of particular relevance,the american tobacco court endorsed judge hand understanding of the sherman act,namely that the act contemplated the notion that unchallenged economic power deadens initiative and that immunity from competition is a narcotic,and rivalry is a stimulant,to industrial progress.id.quoting alcoa,at.it further quoted alcoa for the previously mentioned propositions that monopolies can be thrust upon entities rather than achieved and that specific intent under was not required for no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing.id.at.quoting alcoa,at.
section of the sherman act was next considered by the supreme court in lorain journal united states.the united states had brought a civil suit against the publisher of the lorain journal,the only business disseminating news and advertising in the town of lorain,ohio,alleging that it attempted to monopolize in violation of of the sherman act because it refused to sell advertising to persons that patronized the small radio station that was established in a nearby community.the supreme court held that although a trader has discretion as to the parties with whom he will deal i n the absence of any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly,id.at.quoting united states colgate,the action of the journal constituted a purposeful means of regaining its previous monopoly over the mass dissemination of news and advertising.id.because this was an attempt to monopolize in violation of,the court approved the entry of an injunction ordering the journal to print the advertisements of the customers of the radio station.
thereafter,in united states grinnell,d,the supreme court reiterated that monopoly power alone is not necessarily unlawful.the court summarized its prior cases,stating that of the sherman act required two elements the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.at.
in grinnell,the united states filed a civil suit against several companies that offered central station protective services,such as fire and burglary protective devices,alleging violations of and of the sherman act.referring to the test under,the court found that both prongs had been satisfied.not only did the companies have monopoly power of the accredited central station service business,but also they largely achieved this power through the aid of pricing practices,acquisitions of competitors,and noncompetition covenants,all of which were deemed to be unlawful and exclusionary practices.id.at.
the court later decision in aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d,is even more pertinent to the case before us.in aspen skiing,a case that also reached the court only on the violation,ski,the owner of three of the four major downhill skiing facilities in aspen,colorado,discontinued its prior practice of cooperating with the owner of the fourth facility by issuing an interchangeable pass that could be used on any of the four facilities.it replaced that pass with a,ticket featuring only its mountains.it offered the plaintiff,highlands,owner of the fourth facility,reinstatement of the ticket only if highlands would accept a fixed percentage of the revenue that was considerably below highlands historical average based on usage.ski took additional actions that made it extremely difficult for highlands to market its own multiarea package to replace the joint offering,and highlands share of the market declined along with its revenues from associated skiing services.the jury found that ski possessed monopoly power and awarded highlands a substantial money judgment as treble damages.the court of appeals affirmed,holding there was sufficient basis in ski actions to demonstrate an abuse of its monopoly power.
in the supreme court,ski argued that even a firm with monopoly power has no duty to engage in joint marketing with a competitor,that a violation of can not be established without evidence of substantial exclusionary conduct,and that none of its activities can be characterized as exclusionary.aspen skiing,at.the supreme court agreed with the legal proposition,but referred to its earlier opinion in lorain journal where it held that a monopolist right to refuse to deal was not unqualified.id.at.after reviewing all the circumstances,it affirmed the judgment for highlands in a unanimous opinion.it held that the jury had ample basis to reject ski business justification defense and noted that ski failed to offer any efficiency justification whatever for its pattern of conduct.id.at.the court stated,a lthough ski pattern of conduct may not have been as bold,relentless,and predatory as the publisher actions in lorain journal,the record in this case comfortably supports an inference that the monopolist made a deliberate effort to discourage its customers from doing business with its smaller rival.id.at.quoting lorain journal,at.citation omitted.
in a significant passage about the conduct that constitutes monopolization in violation of,the court stated that when the issue is monopolization rather than an attempt to monopolize,evidence of intent is merely relevant to the question whether the challenged conduct is fairly characterized as exclusionary or anticompetitive to use the words in the trial court instructions or predatory,to use a word that scholars seem to favor.id.at.the court continued,w hichever label is used,there is agreement on the proposition that no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing.id.quoting alcoa,at.
in eastman kodak image technical,d,independent service organizations iso that serviced kodak copying and micrographic equipment brought an antitrust action against kodak for its policies that sought to limit the availability of kodak parts to iso.they alleged kodak policies were unlawful under both and of the sherman act.the supreme court considered the issues under the two provisions separately.in its analysis under,the court first held that kodak control of nearly of the parts market and to of the service market was sufficient to support a claim of monopoly power an issue that is conceded here.as to the issue whether kodak adopted its parts and service policies as part of a scheme of willful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power,the court stated that there was evidence that kodak took exclusionary action to maintain its parts monopoly and used its control over parts to strengthen its monopoly share of the kodak service market.id.at.thus,kodak could escape liability under only if it could explain its actions on the basis of valid business reasons,an issue as to which there were factual questions which made the district court grant of summary judgment for kodak inappropriate.id.
this extensive review of the supreme court decisions is set forth to provide the background under which we must evaluate contention that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of the decision in brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d,a decision that was primarily concerned with the act,not of the sherman act.in brooke group,liggett,a cigarette manufacturer responsible for the innovative development of generic cigarettes,claimed that brown williamson,which introduced its own line of generic cigarettes,cut prices on generic cigarettes below cost and offered discriminatory volume rebates to wholesalers to force liggett to raise its own generic cigarette prices and introduce oligopoly pricing in the economy segment of the national cigarette market.brooke group,at.it filed a action on the basis of these allegations.brown williamson deep price discounts or rebates were concededly discriminatory,not cost justified,and resulted in substantial loss to it.the supreme court majority held that the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because there was no evidence of injury to competition.id.at.the court also held that the evidence did not show that brown williamson alleged scheme was likely to result in oligopolistic price coordination and sustained supracompetitive pricing in the generic segment of the national cigarette market.without this,brown williamson had no reasonable prospect of recouping its predatory losses and could not inflict the injury to competition the antitrust laws prohibit.id 
unlike,brown williamson was part of an oligopoly,six manufacturers whose prices for cigarettes increased in lockstep and who reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive level.id.at.brown williamson had of the oligopolistic market.its conduct and pricing were at all times necessarily constrained by the presence of competitors who could,and did,react to its conduct by undertaking similar price cuts or pricing behavior 
assuming arguendo that brooke group should be read for the proposition that a company pricing action is legal if its prices are not below its costs,nothing in the decision suggests that its discussion of the issue is applicable to a monopolist with its unconstrained market power.moreover,lepage,unlike the plaintiff in brooke group,does not make a predatory pricing claim.is a monopolist a monopolist is not free to take certain actions that a company in a competitive or even oligopolistic market may take,because there is no market constraint on a monopolist behavior.see,aspen skiing,at.
nothing in any of the supreme court opinions in the decade since the brooke group decision suggested that the opinion overturned decades of supreme court precedent that evaluated a monopolist liability under by examining its exclusionary,predatory,conduct.brooke group has been cited only four times by the supreme court,three times in cases that were not even antitrust cases for propositions patently inapplicable here in the only antitrust case of the four,nynex discon,d,the court considered whether the per se rule applicable to group boycotts under of the sherman act should be applied where a single buyer favors one seller over another,albeit for an improper reason.id.at.holding that the rule of reason applies,the court quoted brooke group for the proposition that e ven an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not,without more,state a claim under the federal laws.id.at.quoting brooke group,at.the opinion does not discuss,much less adopt,the proposition that a monopolist does not violate unless it sells below cost.thus,nothing that the supreme court has written since brooke group dilutes the court consistent holdings that a monopolist will be found to violate of the sherman act if it engages in exclusionary or predatory conduct without a valid business justification.
monopolization exclusionary cases 
before turning to consider lepage allegation that engaged in exclusionary or anticompetitive conduct and the evidence it produced,we consider the type of conduct encompasses.
as one court of appeals has stated anticompetitive conduct can come in too many different forms,and is too dependent upon context,for any court or commentator ever to have enumerated all the varieties.caribbean broad,cable wireless plc,reversing in part the district court dismissal of complaint and holding that radio station claim that defendants made misrepresentations to advertisers and the government in order to protect its monopoly stated sherman act claim.
numerous cases hold that the enforcement of the legal monopoly provided by a patent procured through fraud may violate.walker process,food mach.chem,d see also medtronic ave,boston scientific,no.civ,wl,patentee could have violated by bringing infringement action on patent procured by fraud.predatory pricing by a monopolist can provide a basis for liability.see philips windmere,reversing district court directed verdict and ordering new trial on claims due to evidence that company had of rotary electric shaver market,existence of substantial entry barriers,and company had drastically reduced prices to eliminate potential competitors.a monopolist denial to competitors of access to its essential goods,services or resources has been held to violate.see otter tail power united states,d finding violation where monopolist utility company refused to sell wholesale to municipalities and refused to transfer competitors power over its lines see also fishman estate of wirtz,cir finding corporation liable under for refusing to lease chicago stadium to plaintiff,a potential buyer of the chicago bulls basketball team,after determining stadium to be essential to professional basketball in chicago area.an arbitrary refusal to deal by a monopolist may constitute a violation.see byars bluff city news,cir remanding case to district court for to determine whether defendant possessed monopoly power and unlawfully refused to deal in violation of.even unfair tortious conduct unrelated to a monopolist pricing policies has been held to violate.see int l travel arrangers,western airlines,cir upholding treble damages antitrust award against airline with monopoly power after finding sufficient evidence that airline placed false,deceptive,and misleading advertisements discouraging public patronage of travel group charters.
a recent decision of the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit,conwood,tobacco,cir,cert.denied,d,presents a good illustration of the type of exclusionary conduct that will support a violation.that court upheld the jury award to plaintiff conwood of million,which trebled was billion,against united states tobacco company ustc because of ustc monopolization.ustc was the sole manufacturer of moist snuff until the when conwood,swisher,and swedish match,other moist snuff manufacturers,entered the moist snuff market.not unexpectedly,ustc market share declined and it took the action that formed the basis of conwood complaint against ustc alleging,inter alia,unlawful monopolization in violation of of the sherman act.
the evidence that the district court and the court of appeals held proved that ustc systematically tried to exclude competition from the moist snuff market included the following ustc removed and destroyed or discarded racks that displayed moist snuff products in the stores while placing conwood products in ustc racks in an attempt to bury conwood products trained its operatives to take advantage of inattentive store clerks with various ruses such as obtaining nominal permission to reorganize or neaten the moist snuff section in an effort to destroy conwood racks misused its position as category manager manages product groups and business units and customizes them on a store by store basis by providing misleading information to retailers in an effort to dupe them into carrying ustc products and to discontinue carrying conwood products and entered into exclusive agreements with retailers in an effort to exclude rivals products.id.at.
on appeal,ustc like did not challenge that it had monopoly power and agreed that the relevant product was moist snuff and the geographic market was nationwide.id.at.instead,ustc contended that conwood had failed to establish that ustc power was acquired or maintained by exclusionary practices rather than by its legitimate business practices and superior product.id.at.both the district court and the court of appeals rejected ustc argument,finding that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find willful maintenance by ustc of monopoly power by engaging in exclusionary practices in violation of of the sherman act.id.at.
similarly,sought to meet the competition that lepage threatened by exclusionary conduct that consisted of rebate programs and exclusive dealing arrangements designed to drive lepage and any other viable competitor from the transparent tape market.
bundled rebates 
in considering lepage conduct that led to the jury ultimate verdict,we note that the jury had before it evidence of the full panoply of exclusionary conduct,including both the exclusive dealing arrangements and the bundled rebates which could reasonably have been viewed as effectuating exclusive dealing arrangements because of the way in which they were structured.
through a program denominated executive growth fund egf and thereafter partnership growth fund pgf,offered many of lepage major customers substantial rebates to induce them to eliminate or reduce their purchases of tape from lepage.rather than competing by offering volume discounts which are concededly legal and often reflect cost savings,rebate programs offered discounts to certain customers conditioned on purchases spanning six of diverse product lines.the product lines covered by the rebate program were health care products,home care products,home improvement products,stationery products including transparent tape,retail auto products,and leisure time.sealed app.at.in addition to bundling the rebates,both of rebate programs set target growth rates in each product line.the size of the rebate was linked to the number of product lines in which targets were met,and the number of targets met by the buyer determined the rebate it would receive on all of its purchases.if a customer failed to meet the target for any one product,its failure would cause it to lose the rebate across the line.this created a substantial incentive for each customer to meet the targets across all product lines to maximize its rebates.
the rebates were considerable,not modest as states.appellant br.at.for example,kmart,which had constituted of lepage business,received in,sealed app.at,and in received more than million,sam club received,and target received.sealed app.at.just as significant as the amounts received is the powerful incentive they provided to customers to purchase tape rather than lepage in order not to forego the maximum rebate offered.the penalty would have been for sam club,for kmart,and to for american stores.
does not deny that it offered these programs although it gives different reasons for the discounts to each customer.instead it argues that they were no more exclusive than procompetitive lawful discount programs.and,as it responds to each of lepage allegations,it returns to its central premise that it is not unlawful to lower one prices so long as they remain above cost.appellant br.at citing brooke group,at.
however,one of the leading treatises discussing the inherent anticompetitive effect of bundled rebates,even if they are priced above cost,notes that the great majority of bundled rebate programs yield aggregate prices above cost.rather than analogizing them to predatory pricing,they are best compared with tying,whose foreclosure effects are similar.indeed,the package discount is often a close analogy.phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at supp.
the treatise then discusses the anticompetitive effect as follows 
the anticompetitive feature of package discounting is the strong incentive it gives buyers to take increasing amounts or even all of a product in order to take advantage of a discount aggregated across multiple products.in the anticompetitive case,which we presume is in the minority,the defendant rewards the customer for buying its product b rather than the plaintiff b,not because defendant b is better or even cheaper.rather,the customer buys the defendant b in order to receive a greater discount on a,which the plaintiff does not produce.in that case the rival can compete in b only by giving the customer a price that compensates it for the foregone a discount.
the authors then conclude 
depending on the number of products that are aggregated and the customer relative purchases of each,even an equally efficient rival may find it impossible to compensate for lost discounts on products that it does not produce.
the principal anticompetitive effect of bundled rebates as offered by is that when offered by a monopolist they may foreclose portions of the market to a potential competitor who does not manufacture an equally diverse group of products and who therefore can not make a comparable offer.we recognized this in our decision in smithkline eli lilly,cir,where we held that conduct substantially identical to was anticompetitive and sustained the finding of a violation of.smithkline is of interest not because the panel decision is binding on the en banc court but because the reasoning regarding the practice of bundled rebates is equally applicable here.the defendant in smithkline,eli lilly company,the pharmaceutical manufacturer,sold three of its cephalosporins to hospitals under the trade names kefzol,keflin and keflex.cephalosporins are broad spectrum antibiotics that were at that time indispensable to hospital pharmacies.lilly had a monopoly on both keflin and keflex because of its patents.however,those drugs faced competition from the generic drug cefazolin which lilly sold under the trade name kefzol and which plaintiff smithkline sold under the trade name ancef.
lilly profits on the patented keflin were far higher than those it received from its sales of kefzol where its pricing was constrained by the existence of smithkline.to preserve its market position in keflin and discourage sales of ancef and even of its own kefzol,id.at,lilly instituted a rebate program that provided a bonus rebate for hospitals that purchased specified quantities of any three of lilly five cephalosporins.smithkline brought a monopolization claim,alleging that lilly used these volume rebates to maintain its monopoly over the hospital market for cephalosporins.
the district court judge leon higginbotham,later a member of this court found that lilly pricing policy violated.smithkline eli lilly.we affirmed by a unanimous decision.although customers were not forced to select which cephalosporins they purchased from lilly,we recognized that the effect of the rebate program was to induce hospitals to conjoin their purchases of kefzol with keflin and keflex,lilly leading sellers.smithkline,at.as we stated,a lthough eligibility for the bonus rebate was based on the purchase of specified quantities of any three of lilly cephalosporins,in reality it meant the combined purchases of kefzol and the leading sellers,keflin and keflex.id.the gravamen of lilly violation was that lilly linked a product on which it faced competition with products on which it faced no competition.id.at.
the effect of the bundled rebate was magnified by the volume of lilly products sold,so that in order to offer a rebate of the same net dollar amount as lilly,smithkline had to offer purchasers of ancef rebates of some to hospitals of average size,and to larger volume hospitals.id.at.lilly rebate structure combining kefzol with keflin and keflex insulat ed kefzol from true price competition with its competitor ancef.id.at.
lepage and tapes are,as kefzol and ancef were in relation to keflin,less expensive but otherwise of similar quality to tape.indeed,before instituted its rebate program,lepage had begun to enjoy a small but rapidly expanding toehold in the transparent tape market.incentive was thus the same as lilly in smithkline to preserve the market position of tape by discouraging widespread acceptance of the cheaper,but substantially similar,tape produced by lepage.
bundled its rebates for tape with other products it sold in much the same way that lilly bundled its rebates for kefzol with keflin and keflex.in both cases,the bundled rebates reflected an exploitation of the seller monopoly power.just as cephalosporins were carried in virtually every general hospital in the country,smithkline,at,the evidence in this case shows that tape is indispensable to any retailer in the transparent tape market.
our analysis of of the sherman act in smithkline is instructive here where the facts are comparable.speaking through judge aldisert,we said 
with lilly cephalosporins subject to no serious price competition from other sellers,with the barriers to entering the market substantial,and with the prospects of new competition extremely uncertain,we are confronted with a factual complex in which lilly has the awesome power of a monopolist.although it enjoyed the status of a legal monopolist when it was engaged in the manufacture and sale of its original patented products,that status changed when it instituted its bundled rebate program.the goal of that plan was to associate lilly legal monopolistic practices with an illegal activity that directly affected the price,supply,and demand of kefzol and ancef.were it not for the bundled rebate program,the price,supply,and demand of kefzol and ancef would have been determined by the economic laws of a competitive market.lilly bundled rebate program blatantly revised those economic laws and made lilly a transgressor under of the sherman act.
the effect of rebates were even more powerfully magnified than those in smithkline because rebates required purchases bridging extensive product lines.in some cases,these magnified rebates to a particular customer were as much as half of lepage entire prior tape sales to that customer.for example,lepage sales to sam club in totaled,while rebate to sam club was.similarly,lepage sales to kmart were rebate to kmart was.the jury could reasonably find that used its monopoly in transparent tape,backed by its considerable catalog of products,to squeeze out lepage.conduct was at least as anticompetitive as the conduct which this court held violated in smithkline.
exclusive dealing 
the second prong of lepage claim of exclusionary conduct by was its actions in entering into exclusive dealing contracts with large customers.acknowledges only the expressly exclusive dealing contracts with venture and pamida which conditioned discounts on exclusivity.it minimizes these because they represent only a small portion of the market.however,lepage claims that made payments to many of the larger customers that were designed to achieve supplier status.
argues that because the jury found for it on lepage claims under of the sherman act and of the clayton act,these payments should not be relevant to the analysis.the law is to the contrary even though exclusivity arrangements are often analyzed under,such exclusionary conduct may also be an element in a claim.healthcare,healthsource,cir observing that exclusivity may also play a role as an element in attempted or actual monopolization.
also disclaims as exclusive dealing any arrangement that contained no express exclusivity requirement.once again the law is to the contrary.no less an authority than the united states supreme court has so stated.in tampa nashville coal,d,a case that dealt with of the clayton act rather than of the sherman act,the court took cognizance of arrangements which,albeit not expressly exclusive,effectively foreclosed the business of competitors 
lepage introduced powerful evidence that could have led the jury to believe that rebates and discounts to kmart,staples,sam club,national office buyers and udi were designed to induce them to award business to to the exclusion of lepage.many of lepage former customers refused even to meet with lepage sales representatives.a buyer for kmart,lepage largest customer which accounted for of its business,told lepage i ca talk to you about tape products for the next three years and do bring me anything makes.app.at.kmart switched to following offer of a million growth reward which the jury could have understood to require that be its sole supplier.similarly,staples was offered an extra bonus rebate if it gave lepage business to.argues that lepage did not try hard enough to retain kmart,its customer for years,but there was evidence to the contrary in any event,the purpose and effect of payments to the retailers were issues for the jury which,by its verdict,rejected arguments.
the foreclosure of markets through exclusive dealing contracts is of concern under the antitrust laws.as one of the leading treatises states 
unilaterally imposed quantity discounts can foreclose the opportunities of rivals when a dealer can obtain its best discount only by dealing exclusively with the dominant firm.for example,discounts might be cumulated over lengthy periods of time,such as a calendar year,when no obvious economies result.
phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed see also herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at quantity discounts may foreclose a substantial portion of the market.discounts conditioned on exclusivity are problematic when the defendant is a dominant firm in a position to force manufacturers to make an choice.id.at citing lepage,wl.
the court of appeals for the district of columbia relied on the evidence of foreclosure of markets in reaching its decision on liability in united states microsoft.in that case,the court of appeals concluded that microsoft,a monopolist in the operating system market,foreclosed rivals in the browser market from a substantial percentage of the available opportunities for browser distribution through the use of exclusive contracts with key distributors.id.at.microsoft kept usage of its competitor browser below the critical level necessary for its rival to pose a real threat to microsoft monopoly.id.at.the microsoft opinion does not specify what percentage of the browser market microsoft locked up merely that,in one of the two primary distribution channels for browsers,microsoft had exclusive arrangements with most of the top distributors.id.at.significantly,the microsoft court observed that microsoft exclusionary conduct violated even though the contracts foreclose less than the roughly or share usually required in order to establish a violation.id.at.
one noted antitrust scholar has written 
we might thus interpret the microsoft holding as follows conduct that intentionally,significantly,and without business justification excludes a potential competitor from outlets even though not in the relevant market,where access to those outlets is a necessary though not sufficient condition to waging a challenge to a monopolist and fear of the challenge prompts the conduct,is anticompetitive.
eleanor fox,what is harm to competition exclusionary practices and anticompetitive effect,antitrust.
lepage produced evidence that the foreclosure caused by exclusive dealing practices was magnified by discount practices,as some of rebates were discounts,leading customers to maximize their discounts by dealing exclusively with the dominant market player,to avoid being severely penalized financially for failing to meet their quota in a single product line.only by dealing exclusively with in as many product lines as possible could customers enjoy the substantial discounts.accordingly,the jury could reasonably find that exclusionary conduct violated.
anticompetitive effect 
it has been lepage position in pursuing its claim that exclusionary tactics foreclosed the competitive process by preventing rivals from competing to gain or maintain a presence in the market.appellee br.at.when a monopolist actions are designed to prevent one or more new or potential competitors from gaining a foothold in the market by exclusionary,predatory,conduct,its success in that goal is not only injurious to the potential competitor but also to competition in general.it has been recognized,albeit in a somewhat different context,that even the foreclosure of one significant competitor from the market may lead to higher prices and reduced output.roland mach.dresser,cir.
the microsoft court treated exclusionary conduct by a monopolist as more likely to be anticompetitive than ordinary exclusionary conduct.the inquiry in microsoft was whether the monopolist conduct excluded a competitor netscape from the essential facilities that would permit it to achieve the efficiencies of scale necessary to threaten the monopoly.at in microsoft,the court of appeals determined that microsoft had foreclosed enough distribution links to undermine the survival of netscape as a viable competitor.id.at.
similarly,in this case,the jury could have reasonably found that exclusionary conduct cut lepage off from key retail pipelines necessary to permit it to compete profitably it was only after lepage entry into the market that introduced the bundled rebates programs.if were successful in eliminating competition from lepage or tape,could exercise its monopoly power unchallenged,as tesa tuck was no longer in the market.
the district court,recognizing that this case presents a unique bundled rebate program that the jury found had an effect,le page,wl,at,denied motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol,stating 
plaintiff introduced evidence that scotch is a monopoly product,and that bundled rebate programs caused distributors to displace le page entirely,or in some cases,drastically reduce purchases from le page.tr.vol.at vol.at.under rebate programs,set overall growth targets for unrelated product lines.in the distributors view,set these targets in a manner which forced the distributor to either drop any products,or lose the maximum rebate.px at.thus,in order to qualify for the maximum rebate under the programs,the record shows that most customers diverted private label business to at suggestion.tr.vol.at.similarly,under the newer brand mix rebate program,set higher rebates for tape sales which produced a shift from private label tape to branded tape.tr.vol.at.px at.
furthermore,plaintiff introduced evidence of customized rebate programs that similarly caused distributors to forego purchasing from le page if they wished to obtain rebates on products.specifically,the trial record establishes that offered kmart a customized growth rebate and market development funds payment.in order to reach the million sales target and qualify for the million rebate,however,kmart had to increase its consumer stationary purchases by million.kmart substantially achieved this growth by dropping le page and another private label manufacturer,tesa.px at,px at.likewise,customized a program with staples that provided for an extra bonus rebate on scotch tape sales if le page business is given to.px at.finally,provided a similar discount on scotch tape to venture stores based on the contingency of venture dropping private label.px at.thus,the jury could have reasonably concluded that customers were forced to forego purchasing le page private label tape in order to obtain the rebates on scotch tape.
id.emphasis added.
in the same opinion,the district court found that lepage introduced substantial evidence that the anticompetitive effects of rebate programs caused le page losses.id.at.the jury was capable of calculating from the evidence the amount of rebate a customer of would lose if it failed to meet quota of sales in even one of the bundled products.the discount that lepage would have had to provide to match the discounts offered by through its bundled rebates can be measured by the discounts gave or offered.for example,lepage points out that in sam club would have stood to lose,sealed app.at,and kmart for failure to meet one of growth targets in a single product line.sealed app.at.moreover,the effect of rebates on lepage earnings,if lepage had attempted to match discounts,can be calculated by comparing the discount that lepage would have been required to provide.that amount would represent the impact of bundled rebates on lepage ability to compete,and that is what is relevant under of the sherman act.
the impact of discounts was apparent from the chart introduced by lepage showing that lepage earnings as a percentage of sales plummeted to below negative during rebate program.app.at see also app.at documenting lepage healthy operating income from to,rapidly declining operating income from to,and large operating losses suffered from through.demand for lepage tape,especially its tape,decreased significantly following the introduction of rebates.although claims that customers participating in its rebate programs continued to purchase tape from lepage,the evidence does not support this contention.many distributors dropped lepage entirely.
prior to the introduction of rebate program,lepage sales had been skyrocketing.its sales to staples increased by from to.following the introduction of rebate program which bundled its tape with its other products,tape sales increased from to lepage in turn lost a proportional amount of sales.it lost key large volume customers,such as kmart,staples,american drugstores,office max,and sam club.other large customers,like,drastically cut back their purchases.
as a result,lepage manufacturing process became less efficient and its profit margins declined.in transparent tape manufacturing,large volume customers are essential to achieving efficiencies of scale.as concedes,large customers were extremely important to lepage,to everyone.large volumes permitted long runs,making the manufacturing process more economical and predictable.appellant br.at quoting trial testimony of les baggett,lepage former president and ceo citation omitted.
there was a comparable effect on lepage share of the transparent tape market.in the agreed upon relevant market for transparent tape in the united states,lepage market share dropped from to.in,lepage net sales constituted of the total transparent tape market.by,lepage sales had fallen to.sealed app.at.finally,in march of,lepage was forced to close one of its two plants.that same year,the only other domestic transparent tape manufacturer,tesa tuck,bowed out of the transparent tape business entirely in the united states.had continued with its program it could have eventually forced lepage out of the market.
the relevant inquiry is the anticompetitive effect of exclusionary practices considered together.as the supreme court recognized in cont l ore union carbide carbon,d,the courts must look to the monopolist conduct taken as a whole rather than considering each aspect in isolation.the court stated,in a case like the one before us alleging and violations,the duty of the jury was to look at the whole picture and not merely at the individual figures in it.id.citation omitted.see also city of anaheim cal.edison,cir i t would not be proper to focus on specific individual acts of an accused monopolist while refusing to consider their overall combined effect we are dealing with what has been called the synergistic effect of the mixture of the elements.emphasis added.this court,when considering the anticompetitive effect of a defendant conduct under the sherman act,has looked to the increase in the defendant market share,the effects of foreclosure on the market,benefits to customers and the defendant,and the extent to which customers felt they were precluded from dealing with other manufacturers.barr,at.
the effect of conduct in strengthening its monopoly position by destroying competition by lepage in tape is most apparent when various activities are considered as a whole.the anticompetitive effect of exclusive dealing arrangements,whether explicit or inferred,can not be separated from the effect of its bundled rebates.bundling of its products via its rebate programs reinforced the exclusionary effect of those programs.
exclusionary conduct not only impeded lepage ability to compete,but also it harmed competition itself,a sine qua non for a violation.lepage presented powerful evidence that competition itself was harmed by actions.the district court recognized this in its opinion,when it said 
the jury could reasonably infer that planned elimination of the lower priced private label tape,as well as the lower priced highland brand,would channel consumer selection to the higher priced scotch brand and lead to higher profits for.indeed,defendant concedes that could later recoup the profits it has forsaken on scotch tape and private label tape by selling more higher priced scotch tape if there would be no competition by others in the private label tape segment when abandoned that part of the market to sell only scotch tape.
le page,wl,at.
could effectuate such a plan because there was no ease of entry.see advo,phila.newspapers,cir commenting that ease of entry would prevent monopolist predatory pricing scheme from succeeding see also edward snyder thomas kauper,misuses of the antitrust laws the competitor plaintiff,finding barriers to entry to be one of two necessary conditions for exclusionary conduct,the other being market power.
the district court found that there was substantial evidence at trial that significant entry barriers prevent competitors from entering the tape market in the united states.thus,this case presents a situation in which a monopolist remains unchecked in the market.le page,wl,at.in the time period at issue here,there has never been a competitor that has genuinely challenged monopoly and it never lost a significant transparent tape account to a foreign competitor.
there was evidence from which the jury could have determined that intended to force lepage from the market,and then cease or severely curtail its own and tape lines.for example,by,had begun to offer incentives to some customers to increase purchases of its higher priced tapes over its own brand.the supreme court has made clear that intent is relevant to proving monopolization,aspen skiing,at,and attempt to monopolize,lorain journal,at.
interest in raising prices is in the record.in internal memoranda introduced into evidence by lepage,executives boasted that the large retailers like office max and staples had no choice but to adhere to demands.see sealed app.at either they take the price increase or we hold orders see also sealed app.at directive when staples objected to price increase was orders will be held if pricing is not up to date on.lepage expert testified that the price of tape increased since,after instituted its rebate program.app.at.in its opinion,the district court cited the deposition testimony of a employee acknowledging that the payment of the rebates after the end of the year discouraged passing the rebate on to the ultimate customers.app.at.the district court thus observed,the record amply reflects that rebate programs did not benefit the ultimate consumer.le page,wl,at.
as the foregoing review of the evidence makes clear,there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude the effects of conduct were anticompetitive.we must therefore uphold its verdict on liability unless has shown adequate business justification for its practices.
business reasons justification 
it remains to consider whether defendant actions were carried out for valid business reasons,the only recognized justification for monopolizing.see,eastman kodak,at.however,a defendant assertion that it acted in furtherance of its economic interests does not constitute the type of business justification that is an acceptable defense to monopolization.paraphrasing one corporate executive well publicized statement,whatever is good for is not necessarily permissible under of the sherman act.as one court of appeals has explained 
in general,a business justification is valid if it relates directly or indirectly to the enhancement of consumer welfare.thus,pursuit of efficiency and quality control might be legitimate competitive reasons,while the desire to maintain a monopoly market share or thwart the entry of competitors would not.
data grumman.support,cir citing eastman kodak,at.aspen skiing,at.
it can be assumed that a monopolist seeks to further its economic interests and does so when it engages in exclusionary conduct.thus,for example,exclusionary practice has been defined as a method by which a firm trades a part of its monopoly profits,at least temporarily,for a larger market share,by making it unprofitable for other sellers to compete with it.richard posner,antitrust law an economic perspective.once a monopolist achieves its goal by excluding potential competitors,it can then increase the price of its product to the point at which it will maximize its profit.this price is invariably higher than the price determined in a competitive market.that is one of the principal reasons why monopolization violates the antitrust laws.the fact that acted to benefit its own economic interests is hardly a reason to overturn the jury finding that it violated of the sherman act.
the defendant bears the burden of persuad ing the jury that its conduct was justified by any normal business purpose.aspen skiing,at.although alludes to its customers desire to have single invoices and single shipments in defense of its bundled rebates,cites to no testimony or evidence in the volume appendix that would support any actual economic efficiencies in having single invoices single shipments.it is highly unlikely that shipped transparent tape along with retail auto products or home improvement products to customers such as staples or that,if it did,the savings stemming from the joint shipment approaches the millions of dollars returned to customers in bundled rebates.
there is considerable evidence in the record that entered the market only to kill it.see,sealed app.at statement by executive in internal memorandum that i do want private label products to be successful in the office supply business,its distribution or our users.that is precisely what of the sherman act prohibits by covering conduct that maintains a monopoly.maintaining a monopoly is not the type of valid business reason that will excuse exclusionary conduct.business justification defense was presented to the jury,and it rejected the claim.the jury verdict reflects its view that exclusionary conduct,which made it difficult for lepage to compete on the merits,had no legitimate business justification.
as an alternative to its argument that it is entitled to jmol on liability,claims that it is entitled to a new trial due to the district court error in sustaining lepage damages award.it gives two reasons.first,it contends that the damage theory proffered by terry musika,lepage damages expert,was based on improper assumptions and should have been excluded second,argues that musika theory failed to disaggregate the damages based on lawful versus unlawful conduct by.

to determine the amount of profits lepage lost between and due to antitrust violations,musika constructed a lost market share model.appellant br.at.musika first calculated the total united states transparent tape sales during the damages period,using actual financial data from to and projecting total sales from to.next,he determined how those sales would be divided between branded and parts of the market,projecting a shift each year from branded to tape sales.in arriving at,musika considered the actual growth in tape sales,the actual growth rate of all products not just tape,the growth rate of large customers,and internal projections.
after determining the size of both segments of the market,musika estimated lepage share of the market,predicting that lepage would have retained its share of the segment and its share of the segment.he opined that lepage share of the overall market for transparent tape would have increased from in to in but for unlawful conduct.finally,musika subtracted lepage actual sales from his projected sales to determine lepage lost sales due to unlawful conduct.he calculated lepage projected profit margin by looking at lepage actual profit margin for each year and adjusting it to show declining prices and lepage consequential decreasing efficiency due to decreasing sales.based on those adjustments,lepage profit margin decreased every year during the damages period.musika concluded that but for unlawful conduct,lepage would have earned an extra million dollars.
importantly,does not challenge musika basic approach to calculating damages,conceding that an expert may construct a reasonable world as a yardstick for measuring what,hypothetically,would have happened but for the defendant unlawful activities.appellant reply br.at citing callahan,cir rossi standard roofing,cir.
instead,motion for judgment as a matter of law attacked musika underlying assumptions,the primary assumption being that did not want to succeed in the segment as it did not want to harm its sales of scotch brand.the district court rejected objections to lepage damages claims,stating that the record demonstrates that musika assumptions were grounded in the past performances of scotch,highland and le page tapes,as well as own internal projections for future growth.le page,wl,at.
the credibility of lepage and experts was for the jury to determine.inter med.supplies,ebi med,cir.musika was extensively and presented testimony from its own damages expert who predicted more conservative losses to lepage.in the end,the jury found musika to be credible.disappointment as to the jury finding of credibility does not constitute an abuse of discretion by the district court in allowing musika testimony.
next argues that musika improperly failed to disaggregate damages,thereby providing the jury with no mechanism to discern damages arising from lawful conduct or other facts from damages arising from unlawful conduct.according to,this resulted in impermissible guesswork and speculation on the part of the jury.
in bonjorno kaiser aluminum chem,cir,this court stated that i n constructing a hypothetical world free of the defendants exclusionary activities,the plaintiffs are given some latitude in calculating damages,so long as their theory is not wholly speculative.id.once a jury has found that the unlawful activity caused the antitrust injury,the damages may be determined without strict proof of what act caused the injury,as long as the damages are not based on speculation or guesswork.id.at.the bonjorno court noted that it would be extremely difficult,if not impossible,to segregate and attribute a fixed amount of damages to any one act as the theory was not that any one act in itself was unlawful,but that all the acts taken together showed a violation.id.
similarly,actions,taken as a whole,were found to violate,thus making the disaggregation that speaks of to be unnecessary,if not impossible.in any event,we fail to see how the jury engaged in speculation or guesswork.the district court clearly charged the jury to disregard losses not caused by you may not calculate damages based only on speculation or guessing you may not award damages for injuries or losses caused by other factors.app.at.we find no evidence that the jury failed reasonably to follow these instructions.
for the foregoing reasons,we will not disturb the jury damages award to lepage.
jury instructions 
also argues that it should be awarded a new trial because of allegedly improper jury instructions.in the absence of a misstatement of law,jury instructions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.bhaya westinghouse electric,cir.because the district court provided the jury with meticulous instructions,methodically explaining this area of the law in a manner understandable to lay persons,we conclude that it did not abuse its discretion.
the district court,in instructing the jury on count i,which encompassed lepage claim of unlawful maintenance of monopoly power under,explained 
count i in this case is unlawful maintenance of monopoly power.
lepage alleges that it was injured by unlawful monopolization in the united states market for invisible and transparent tape for home and office use.
to win on their claim of monopolization,lepage must prove each of the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence.
first,that had monopoly power in the relevant market.
secondly,that willfully maintained that power through predatory or exclusionary conduct 
and thirdly,that lepage was injured in its business or property because of restrictive or exclusionary conduct.
complains that the district court failed to provide guidance that would instruct the jury how to distinguish between unlawful predation and lawful conduct.however,in explaining lepage maintenance of monopoly claim,the district court told the jury that in order to find for lepage,it would have to find by a preponderance of the evidence that willfully maintained its monopoly power through exclusionary or predatory conduct.app.at.it then summarized those of actions that lepage contended were unlawfully exclusionary or predatory,including rebate program,market development fund,its efforts to control,reduce or eliminate tape,and its efforts to raise the price consumers pay for scotch tape.thereafter,the judge provided the jury with the following factors to determine whether conduct was either exclusionary or predatory its effect on its competitors,such as lepage,its impact on consumers,and whether it has impaired competition,in an unnecessarily restrictive way.app.at.
relevant portions of the charge were as follows 
the law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive,even severely so,but rather against conduct which tends to destroy competition itself.
lepage must prove that willfully maintained monopoly power by predatory or exclusionary conduct,rather than by supplying better products or services,or by exercising superior business judgment,or just by chance.so willful maintenance of monopoly power,that an element lepage has to prove.
to prove that acted willfully,lepage must prove either that engaged in predatory or exclusionary acts or practices,with the conscious objective of furthering the dominance of in the relevant market,or that this was the necessary direct consequence of conduct or business arrangement.
i now giving you what lepage contentions are as to what did or did not do,that constituted predatory or exclusionary conduct.number one,rebate program,such as the egf,executive growth fund,or the pgf,the partnership growth fund,and the brand mix program.number two,market development fund called the mds in some of the testimony,and other payments to customers conditioned on customers achieving certain sales goals or growth targets.third,efforts to control,or reduce,or eliminate private label tape.four,efforts to switch customers to more expensive branded tape,and five,efforts to raise the price consumers pay for scotch tape.lepage claims that all of these things that i just gone through was predatory or exclusionary conduct.now,denies in every respect that these actions were predatory or exclusionary.contends that these actions were,in fact.
exclusionary conduct and predatory conduct comprehends,at the most,behavior that not only,one,tends to impair the opportunities of its rivals,but also,number two,either does not further competition on the merits,or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive way.if has been attempting to exclude rivals on some basis other than efficiency,you may characterize the behavior as predatory.
however,you may not find that a competent,willfully maintained monopoly power,if that company has maintained that power,solely through the exercise of superior foresight or skill in industry,or because of economic or technological efficiencies,or because of size,or because of changes in customer and consumer preferences,or simply because the market is so limited that it is impossible to efficiently produce the product,except by a plan large enough to supply the whole demand.
now with respect to count,unlawfully maintaining monopoly power,mere possession of monopoly power,if lawfully acquired,does not violate the antitrust laws.
in determining whether there has been an unlawful exercise of monopoly power,you must bear in mind that a company has not acted unlawfully simply because it has engaged in ordinary competitive behavior that would have been an effective means of competition if it were engaged in by a firm without monopoly power,or simply because it is a large company and a very efficient one.
the trial court further noted that if the jury found the evidence to be insufficient to prove any of the elements,it had to find for and against lepage.it was careful to note that intense business competition was not considered predatory or exclusionary,explaining 
the acts or practices that result in the maintenance of monopoly power must represent something other than the conduct of business that is part of the normal competitive process or even extraordinary commercial success.must represent conduct that has made it very difficult or impossible for competitors to engage in fair competition.
the district court closely followed the aba sample instructions when instructing the jury as to predatory and exclusionary conduct,including its instructions distinguishing between procompetitive and anticompetitive conduct.see aba,sample jury instructions in civil antitrust cases to ed.furthermore,the jury instructions were a modified version of those given in aspen skiing,which the supreme court did not find objectionable.at.
contends that the district court was obligated to take into account the decision in brooke group when crafting its jury instructions.as we have explained,brooke group involved claims of predatory pricing,a claim lepage never alleged against.it follows that the district court need not have,indeed should not have,instructed the jury as to claims not at issue in the case.
the jury was given the following questions on count i 
do you find that lepage has proven,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the relevant market is invisible and transparent tape for home and office use in the united states 
do you find that lepage has proven,by a preponderance of the evidence,that unlawfully maintained monopoly power as defined under the instructions for count i and 
do you find that lepage has proven,as a matter of fact and with a fair degree of certainty,that unlawful maintenance of monopoly power injured lepage business or property as defined in these instructions 
app.at.the jury answered yes to each of the three questions.it awarded lepage more than million before trebling.
the district court gave the jury a thorough,clear charge as to the claim.based on its sound instructions,the jury decided that lepage had met its evidentiary burden as to its claim.nothing in the jury charge constitutes reversible error.
cross appealattempted monopolization 
lepage cross appeals from the district court order granting judgment as a matter of law to on lepage claim that illegally attempted to maintain its monopoly.in overturning the jury verdict for lepage on this claim,the district court stated that an attempted maintenance of monopoly power is inherently illogical.le page,wl,at.
lepage argues that the courts and commentators have repeatedly found that defendants can be guilty of both monopolization and attempted monopolization claims arising out of the same conduct.see,am.tobacco,at.affirming judgment that defendants were guilty of monopolization and attempted monopolization earl kintner,federal antitrust law.it emphasizes that in lorain journal,the supreme court upheld a attempted monopolization judgment against the defendant newspaper,holding that a single newspaper,already enjoying a substantial monopoly in its area,violates the attempt to monopolize clause of when it uses its monopoly to destroy threatened competition.at.
we need not consider the correctness of the district court ruling on the attempted monopolization claim because we uphold its decision on the monopolization claim.the jury returned the same amount of damages on both claims and lepage concedes that under those circumstances discussion of the attempted monopolization is unnecessary.
conclusion 
section,the provision of the antitrust laws designed to curb the excesses of monopolists and,is the equivalent in our economic sphere of the guarantees of free and unhampered elections in the political sphere.just as democracy can thrive only in a free political system unhindered by outside forces,so also can market capitalism survive only if those with market power are kept in check.that is the goal of the antitrust laws.
the jury heard the evidence and the contentions of the parties,accepting some and rejecting others.there was ample evidence that used its market power over transparent tape,backed by its considerable catalog of products,to entrench its monopoly to the detriment of lepage,its only serious competitor,in violation of of the sherman act.we find no reversible error.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
i respectfully dissent as i would reverse the district court order denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law on the monopolization claim but affirm on lepage from the motion granting a judgment as a matter of law on the attempted maintenance of monopoly claim.while i recognize that the majority opinion describes the factual background of this case,i nevertheless also will set forth its background as i believe that a more specific exposition of the facts leads to a conclusion that lepage case should not have survived motion for a judgment as a matter of law.
as the majority indicates,dominated the united states transparent tape market with a market share above until the early.lepage around decided to sell second brand and private label tape,tape sold under the retailer,rather than the manufacturer name,an endeavor successful to the extent that lepage captured of private label tape sales in the united states by.moreover,growth of second brand and private label tape accounted for a shift of some tape sales from branded tape to private label tape so the size of the private label tape business expanded.in the circumstances,not surprisingly,during the early,also entered the private label tape business.
as the majority notes,lepage claims that,in response to the growth of this competitive market,engaged in a series of related,anticompetitive acts aimed at restricting the availability of transparent tape to consumers.in particular,it asserts that devised programs that prevented lepage and the other domestic company in the business,tesa tuck,from gaining or maintaining large volume sales and that maintained its monopoly by stifling growth of private label tape and by coordinating efforts aimed at large distributors to keep retail prices for scotch tape high.lepage barely was surviving at the time of trial and suffered large operating losses from through.
this case centers on rebate programs that,beginning in,involved offers by of package or bundled discounts for various items ranging from home care and leisure products to and stationery products.customers could earn rebates by purchasing,in addition to transparent tape,a variety of products sold by stationery division,such as notes and packaging products.there is no doubt but that these programs created incentives for retailers to purchase more products and enabled them to have single invoices,single shipments and uniform pricing programs for various products.linked the size of the rebates to the number of product lines in which the customers met the targets,an aggregate number that determined the rebate percentage the customer would receive on all of its purchases across all product lines.therefore,if customers failed to meet growth targets in multiple categories,they did not receive any rebate,and if they failed to meet the target in one product line,reduced their rebates substantially.these requirements are at the crux of the controversy here,as lepage claims that customers could not meet these growth targets without eliminating it as a supplier of transparent tape.
in practice,as rebate program evolved,it offered three different types of rebates executive growth fund,partnership growth fund and brand mix rebates.developed a test program called executive growth fund egf for a small number of retailers,in and in.under egf,negotiated volume and growth targets for each customer purchases from the six consumer product divisions involved in the egf program.a customer meeting the target in three or more divisions earned a volume rebate of between of total sales.
beginning in,undertook to end the egf test program and institute a rebate program called partnership growth fund pgf for the same six consumer products divisions.under this program,established uniform growth targets applicable to all participants.customers who increased their purchases from at least two divisions by and increased their total purchases by at least over the previous year qualified for the rebate,which ranged from to,depending on the number of divisions between two to five divisions in which the customer increased its purchases and the total volume of purchases.
in and,offered price incentives called brand mix rebates to two tape customers,office depot and staples,to increase purchases of scotch brand tapes.imposed a minimum purchase level for tape set at the level of office depot and staples purchases the previous year with growth factored in.to obtain a higher rebate,these two customers could increase their percentage of scotch purchases relative to certain orders.
the evidence at trial focused on the parties dealings with a limited number of customers and demonstrated that lepage problems were attributed to a number of factors,not merely rebate programs.thus,i describe this evidence at length.
before,bought private label tape only from lepage but,in august,decided to buy private label tape from as well.in response,lepage lowered its prices and increased its sales to.in,stopped buying private label tape but offered lepage branded tape as its second tier offering.in,however,told lepage that it was going to switch to a tape program from.lepage president then visited following which it changed its plans and retained lepage as a supplier.afterwards,designed a test comparing lepage brand against a scotch utility tape to determine who would win second tier tape business.lepage added more inches approximately more to its rolls of tape and won the test.continued,however,to sell scotch brand tapes to,and lepage saw its sales to decline to approximately annually by the time of trial.lepage claims that cut back on its tape purchases to qualify for bundled rebate of in.
kmart accounted for of lepage annual tape sales when lepage lost its business to in.kmart asked its suppliers,including,to provide a single bid on its entire private label tape business for the following year.lepage president believed,however,that kmart was too lazy to make a change,and that it would never put their eggs in one basket by giving all its business to.lepage offered the same price it had offered the previous year but also offered a volume rebate.offered a lower price and won the bid.kmart asked for rebates and market development funds as part of the private label tape bid process.offered for promotional activities and a volume rebate if kmart purchased of stationery division products.
lepage claims that offered kmart to eliminate lepage and tesa as suppliers and to make its sole tape supplier.lepage points to a document outlining goal for kmart to exceed in purchases with the reward being that kmart would receive in each of the first two quarters and in the last two quarters for promotional activities and would receive as a volume rebate if the sales exceeded.if the sales were less,would decrease the rebate accordingly,a rebate for of sales.lepage claims that,as a practical matter,kmart had to eliminate lepage and tesa to reach the growth required in order to qualify for the rebate.lepage asserts that,despite its efforts to regain the private label business from kmart,one kmart buyer told it that he could not talk to lepage about tape products for the next three years.
staples had been a lepage customer for several years.from to,lepage increased its sales to staples by,growing from to.in,staples considered reducing suppliers and asked lepage and for their best offers in.lepage assumed that if did make a good offer,lepage would have a chance to make a better proposal.lepage did not make its lowest offer,and won the account.when lepage went back to staples with a new price,it was told that the decision had been made.lepage claims that offered an extra bonus rebate on scotch products if staples eliminated lepage as a supplier a growth rebate that only could be met by converting all of staple private label business to.paid staples an advertising allowance in four payments totalling in and gave it in free merchandise delivered during staples fiscal year.refers to a million settlement with staples and refers to multiple payments for different purposes.lepage,however,implies that these payments bore some connection to staples award of its tape business to.
office max 
in,after a dispute between office max and lepage,office max accepted offer that matched but did not beat lepage price.lepage objected to matching whatever price lepage offered,and also objected to clout payment.office max required its suppliers to make payments to help advertise the office max name,and lepage had paid this clout payment in the years previous to when it refused to pay it because of its dispute with office max.nevertheless,the buyer for office max testified that its decision to give its business to was not related to its pricing and rebate program but rather to the consistency of its service.
walgreens had purchased private label tape from lepage from until,when it decided to import tape from taiwan.lepage chief executive officer acknowledged that lepage did not lose the account due to activities.
american stores 
until,lepage sales of private label tape to american stores exceeded annually.according to lepage,a month after american stores decided that it would try to maximize pgf rebate,it shifted its tape business to.in,american stores decided to stop buying lepage tape,principally because of quality concerns.in a letter to james kowieski,senior vice president of sales at lepage,kevin winsauer,the manager of the private label department at american,wrote after much deliberation comparing the pros and cons of lepage program and program,i have decided to award the business to.proposal was very competitive and i am sure lepage would meet their costs to retain the business.however,the decision to move to is primarily based on quality.sja emphasis in original.when american stores decided to purchase from,it was not participating in any rebate programs,and winsauer testified that he was not aware that there were rebate programs.he also testified that even without the volume incentive programs,price was still slightly lower than lepage.
dollar general,cvs,and sam club 
lepage lost dollar general private label business to a foreign supplier but later won the business back.according to lepage president,dollar general used the bid for imported tape to leverage a price reduction from lepage.bid on the cvs account,but lepage retained cvs as a customer by lowering its prices and increasing its rebate.at sam club,lepage tape had been selling well when its buyers were directed by senior management to maximize all purchases from to maximize the rebate.subsequently,sam club stopped purchasing from lepage.
other distributors and buying groups 
lepage claimed that pricing practices prevented or hindered it from selling private label tape to certain companies costco.costco,however,never has sold private label tape.office depot.office depot also never has sold private label tape.lepage tried to convince office depot to buy private label tape in or before implemented the rebate programs,but office depot decided to continue purchasing brand tape.pamida and venture stores.lepage claimed that offered these stores discounts conditioned on exclusivity,thereby preventing lepage from selling private label tape to them.lepage lost venture stores business in,five years before provided the discount at issue.office buying groups.offered an optional price discount to certain buying groups if they exclusively promoted certain products in their catalogs.if the buying group carried a lower value brand alternative to main brand its second line,then the group would receive a lower annual volume rebate.lepage viewed these kind of contract provisions as a penalty that coerced buying group members to purchase tape only from.for example,if a buying group promoted the products of a competitor,it lost rebates for purchases in three categories of products.argues that lepage could have offered its own discount or rebate but instead refused in one instance to pay the standard promotional fee charged suppliers for inclusion in a catalog.
notwithstanding the evidence which demonstrates that lepage lost business for reasons that could not possibly be attributable to any unlawful conduct by,it argues that willfully maintained its monopoly through a monopoly broth of anticompetitive and predatory conduct.i would reject lepage argument as i agree with that lepage simply did not establish that conduct was illegal,as lepage did not demonstrate that pricing was below cost a point that is not in dispute and,in the absence of such proof,the record does not supply any other basis on which we can uphold the judgment.
there are two elements of a monopolization claim under section of the sherman act the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.united states grinnell,d.willful maintenance involves using anticompetitive conduct to foreclose competition,to gain a competitive advantage,or to destroy a competitor.eastman kodak image technical,d internal quotation marks omitted.lepage contends that bundled rebates were anticompetitive and predatory.it also argues that other practices,such as exclusionary contracts and the timing of its rebates,were also anticompetitive and predatory.i discuss these claims in the order i have stated them.
lepage primarily complains of use of bundled rebates.while,as the majority recognizes,we have held that rebates on volume purchases are lawful,see advo,philadelphia newspapers,cir,lepage seeks to avoid that principle by pointing out that offered higher rebates if customers met their target growth rate in different product categories,in effect linking the sale of private label tape with the sale of other products,such as scotch tape,which customers had to buy from.thus,lepage explains 
understood that,as a practical matter,every retailer in the country had to carry tape it therefore decided to structure its rebates into bundles that linked that product with the product segment in which it did face competition from lepage tape to increase the leverage on the targeted segment,further linked rebates on transparent tape with those for many other products the rival would have to compensate the customer for the amount of rebate it would lose not only on the large volume of tape it had to buy,but also for rebates on many other products purchased from.
br.of appellee at.
in making its argument lepage relies in part on smithkline eli lilly,cir,which,as the majority notes,does not bind this en banc court but nevertheless can have precedential value.in smithkline,eli lilly had two products,keflin and keflex,on which it faced no competition,and one product,kefzol,on which it faced competition from smithkline product,ancef.see id.at.lilly offered a higher rebate of to companies that purchased specified quantities of any three which,practically speaking,meant combined purchases of kefzol,keflin and keflex of lilly cephalosporin products.see id.although hospitals were free to purchase smithkline ancef with their keflin and keflex orders with lilly,thus avoiding the penalties of a sale the practical effect of that decision would be to deny the ancef purchaser the bonus rebate on all its cephalosporin products.id.at internal footnote added.because of lilly volume advantage,to offer a rebate of the same net dollar amount as lilly,smithkline would have had to offer companies rebates ranging from for average size hospitals to for larger volume hospitals for their purchase of ancef.see id.at.
we concluded that lilly willfully acquired and maintained monopoly power by linking products on which it faced no competition keflin and keflex with a competitive product,resulting in the sale of all three products on a basis in what otherwise would have been a competitive market between ancef and kefzol.see id.at.moreover,this arrangement would force smithkline to pay rebates on one product equal to rebates paid by lilly based on sales volume of three products.see id.expert testimony and the evidence on pricing showed that in the circumstances smithkline prospects for continuing in the ancef market were poor.
lepage argues that it does not have to show that package discounts could prevent an equally efficient firm from matching or beating package discounts.in its brief,lepage contends that its expert economist explained that programs and cash payments have the same anticompetitive impact regardless of the cost structure of the rival suppliers or their efficiency relative to that of.see br.of appellee at.lepage alleges that the relative efficiency or cost structure of the competitor simply affects how long it would take to foreclose the rival from obtaining the volume of business necessary to survive.see id.competition is harmed just the same by the loss of the only existing competitive constraints on in a market with high entry barriers.id.the district court stated that lepage introduced substantial evidence that the anticompetitive effects of rebate program caused its losses.see lepage,no.civ,wl,at.the majority finds that conduct was at least as anticompetitive as the conduct which we held violated in smithkline.op.at.
i disagree with the majority use of smithkline.smithkline showed that it could not compete by explaining how much it would have had to lower prices for both small and big customers to do so.smithkline ascertained the rebates that lilly was giving to customers on all three products and calculated how much it would have had to lower the price of its product if the rebates were all attributed to the one competitive product.in contrast,lepage did not even attempt to show that it could not compete by calculating the discount that it would have had to provide in order to match the discounts offered by through its bundled rebates,and thus its brief does not point to evidence along such lines.
while i recognize that it is obvious from the size of rebates as compared to lepage sales that lepage would have had to make substantial reductions in prices to match the rebates paid to particular customers,lepage did not show the amount by which it lowered its prices in actual monetary figures or by percentage to compete with and how its profitability thus was decreased.rather,lepage merely maintains,through the use of an expert,that it would have had to cut its prices drastically to compete and thus would have gone out of business.furthermore,it is critically important to recognize that lepage had of the private label business at the time of the trial.thus,notwithstanding rebates,lepage was able to retain most of the private label business.in the circumstances,it is ironical that lepage complains of use of monopoly power as the undisputed fact is that lepage,not,was the dominant supplier of private label tape both before and after initiated its rebate programs.indeed,the record suggests that inasmuch as lepage could not make a profit with a share of the private label sales,it must have needed to be essentially the exclusive supplier of such tape for its business to be profitable as it in fact was when it had an share of the private label tape sales business.
although i am not evaluating the expert method of calculating damages as i would not reach the damages issue,i emphasize that simply pointing to an expert to support the contention that the company would have gone out of business,without providing even the most basic pricing information,is insufficient.expert testimony is useful as a guide to interpreting market facts,but it is not a substitute for them.brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d see also matsushita indus.zenith radio,d advo,at virgin atlantic airways british airways plc,d,a n expert opinion is not a substitute for a plaintiff obligation to provide evidence of facts that support the applicability of the expert opinion to the case,aff,cir.without such pricing information,it is difficult even to begin to estimate how much of the market share lepage lost was due to bundled rebates.in fact,the evidence that i described above conclusively demonstrates that lepage lost private sale tape business for reasons not related to rebates.furthermore,some experts have questioned the validity of attributing all the rebates to the one competitive product in situations such as these i do not need,however,to decide the validity of that method of calculation,as lepage does not even attempt to meet that less strict test by calculating how much it would have had to lower its prices to match the rebates,even if they all were aggregated and attributed to private label tape 
lepage also has not satisfied the stricter tests devised by other courts considering bundled rebates in situations such as that here.in a case brought by a manufacturer of products used in screening blood supply for viruses,ortho diagnostic systems,abbott laboratories,the district court held,inter alia,that the defendant discount pricing of products in packages did not violate the sherman act.the defendant,abbott laboratories,manufactured all five of the commonly used tests to screen the blood supply for viruses.ortho claimed that abbott violated sections and of the sherman act by contracting with the council of community blood centers to give those members advantageous pricing if they purchased a package of four or five tests from abbott,thereby using its monopoly position in some of the tests to foreclose or impair competition by ortho in the sale of those tests available from both companies.see id.at.the district court stated that to prevail on a monopolization claim in a case in which a monopolist faces competition on only part of a complementary group of products,offers the products both as a package and individually,and effectively forces its competitors to absorb the differential between the bundled and unbundled prices of the product in which the monopolist has market power,the plaintiff must allege and prove either that a the monopolist has priced below its average variable cost or b the plaintiff is at least as efficient a producer of the competitive product as the defendant,but that the defendant pricing makes it unprofitable for the plaintiff to continue to produce.id.at.
holding that the discount package pricing did not violate the sherman act,the ortho court explained that any other rule would involve too substantial a risk that the antitrust laws would be used to protect an inefficient competitor against price competition that would benefit consumers.see id.at the antitrust laws were not intended,and may not be used,to require businesses to price their products at unreasonably high prices which penalize the consumer so that less efficient competitors can stay in business.internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,as the majority acknowledges,lepage now does not contend that priced its products below average variable cost,an allegation which,if made,in any event would be difficult to prove.see advo,at.moreover,lepage economist conceded that lepage is not as efficient a tape producer as.thus,in this case section of the sherman act is being used to protect an inefficient producer from a competitor not using predatory pricing but rather selling above cost.while the majority contends that brooke group,a case on which heavily relies,is distinguishable as none of the defendants there had a monopoly in the market,the fact remains that the court in describing section of the sherman act said flat out in brooke group that a plaintiff seeking to establish competitive injury from a rival low prices must prove that the prices complained of are below an appropriate measure of its rival costs.brooke group,at.at.lepage simply did not do this.
i realize that the majority indicates that lepage unlike the plaintiff in brooke group,does not make a predatory pricing claim.op.at.but that circumstance weakens rather than strengthens lepage position as it merely confirms the lawfulness of conduct.furthermore,the circumstance that is not dealing in an oligopolistic market should not matter as the harm that lepage claims to have suffered from the bundled rebates would be no less if inflicted by multiple competitors.moreover,monopolist or not,even in the absence of lepage and tesa from the private label business,would not be the only supplier of private label tape for there are foreign suppliers as is demonstrated plainly by the evidence that both walgreens and dollar general dealt with such suppliers.
contrary to the majority view,this is not a situation in which there is no business justification for actions.this point is important inasmuch as it is difficult to distinguish legitimate competition from exclusionary conduct that harms competition,see united states microsoft,cert.denied,d,and some cases suggest that when a company acts against its economic interests and there is no valid business justification for its actions,then it is a good sign that its acts were intended to eliminate competition.
for example,aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d,discussed by the majority,sets forth the lack of a valid business reason as a basis for finding liability.in that case,the court affirmed a jury verdict for the plaintiff under section of the sherman act where the defendant monopolist had stopped cooperating with the plaintiff to offer a skiing package for aspen skiers.the court held that because the defendant had acted contrary to its economic interests,by losing business and customers,there was no other rationale for its conduct except that it wished to eliminate the plaintiff as a competitor.see id.at.at see also eastman kodak,at.at exclusionary conduct properly is condemned if valid business reasons do not justify conduct that tends to impair the opportunities of a monopolist rivals or if a valid asserted purpose would be served fully by less restrictive means.
on the other hand,in concord boat brunswick,cir,cert.denied,d,where boat builders brought an antitrust action against a stern drive engine manufacturer,the court held,inter alia,that the evidence was insufficient to find that the engine manufacturer discount programs restrained trade and monopolized the market.brunswick offered a higher percentage discount when boat builders bought a higher percentage of their engines from it,but there was no allegation that its pricing was below cost.see id.at.in concord boat the district court cited the district court opinion in this case when filed its motion to dismiss.see lepage,no.civ,wl.the concord boat district court agreed with the plaintiff that it was not the price above cost or not that was relevant but the strings attached to the price and that the district court here was correct to distinguish brooke group since there were no strings attached bundled rebates in brooke group.in concord boat,the strings attached were the exclusivity provisions.see concord boat brunswick,d.
the court of appeals for the eighth circuit,however,disagreed with the district court in concord boat.the court of appeals opinion reflected an application of brooke group strong stance favoring vigorous price competition and expressing skepticism of the ability of a court to separate anticompetitive from procompetitive actions when it comes to strategic pricing.see concord boat,at.more importantly,the court perceived that brooke group should be considered even with claims based on pricing with strings.see id.if a firm has discounted prices to a level that remains above the firm average variable cost,the plaintiff must overcome a strong presumption of legality by showing other factors indicating that the price charged is anticompetitive.id.citing morgan ponder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the court stated that a section defendant proffered business justification is the most important factor in determining whether its challenged conduct is not competition on the merits.see id.at.the court distinguished cases such as smithkline and ortho where products were bundled since they involved two markets.see id.of course,here we are dealing with a single market.
unlike the situation of the defendant in aspen,pricing structure and bundled rebates were not contrary to its economic interests,as they likely increased its sales.in fact,that is exactly what lepage is complaining about.furthermore,other than the obvious reasons such as increasing bulk sales,market share and customer loyalty,there are several other potential procompetitive or valid business reasons for pricing structure and bundled rebates efficiency in having single invoices,single shipments and uniform pricing programs for various products.moreover,the record demonstrates that,with the biggest customers,rebates were not eliminating the competitive process,as lepage still was able to retain some customers through negotiation,and even though it lost other customers,the losses were attributable to their switching to foreign suppliers or changing suppliers because of quality or service without regard to the rebates.furthermore,overall lepage was quite successful in holding its share of the private label sales as it had of the business at the time of the trial.
in sum,i conclude that as a matter of law did not violate section of the sherman act by reason of its bundled rebates even though its practices harmed its competitors.the majority decision which upholds the contrary verdict risks curtailing price competition and a method of pricing beneficial to customers because the bundled rebates effectively lowered their costs.i regard this result as a significant mistake which can not be justified by a fear that somehow will raise prices unreasonably later.in this regard i reiterate that in addition to lepage there are foreign suppliers of transparent tape so that with or without lepage there will be constraints on pricing.
lepage also claims that,through a variety of other allegedly anticompetitive actions,prevented lepage from competing.lepage asserts that foreclosed competition by directly purchasing status.there was some dispute as to whether the contracts were conditioned on being the sole supplier,and claims that there are only two customers for which there is any evidence of a sole supplier agreement.i recognize,however,that although most of contracts with customers were not conditioned on exclusivity,practically speaking some customers dropped lepage as a supplier to maximize the rebates that was offering.moreover,united shoe machinery united states,explained that a contract that does not contain specific agreements not to use the products of a competitor still will come within the clayton act as to exclusivity if its practical effect is to prevent such use.
even assuming,however,that did have exclusive contracts with some of the customers,lepage has not demonstrated that acted illegally,as exclusive contracts have been held to be reasonable and not unduly restrictive.see fed.trade comm motion picture adver.serv.holding that evidence sustained the commission finding that the distributor exclusive screening agreements with theater operators unreasonably restrained competition,but stating that the commission had found that the term of exclusive contracts had become a standard practice and would not be an undue restraint on competition.see also advo,at.in tampa electric nashville coal,d,the court stated that even if in practical application a contract is found to be an arrangement,it does not violate section of the clayton act unless the court believes it probable that performance of the co
