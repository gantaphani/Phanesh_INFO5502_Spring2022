plaintiff ezzo investments,ezzo and its owner ezzo ebeido ebeido sued matrix essentials,matrix,and other defendants not parties to this appeal,alleging a conspiracy to fix prices of beauty products in violation of section of the sherman act,the act,section of the clayton act as amended by the robinson patman price discrimination act,section of the clayton act,and tennessee code section.ezzo clayton and robinson patman act claims were dismissed by the district court for failure to state a claim.the state law claims were withdrawn,leaving only claims under the sherman act against matrix.
the district court granted matrix motion for partial summary judgment,holding that ezzo had not offered the requisite proof under a rule of reason analysis to show that a policy restriction on the distribution of matrix products rule,the rule,or the policy was an unjustified and unreasonable vertical suppression upon competition,or illegal per se under the act.at trial,after ezzo,the district court granted matrix rule motion for judgment as a matter of law on ezzo claim that matrix and royal beauty supply royal,matrix nashville area distributor,had conspired to fix prices in violation of the act.the district court also held that matrix was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on ezzo claim that the rule was a pretext for and had been selectively enforced to eliminate discounters of matrix products in violation of the act.we affirm.
background 
the facts of this case are stated in a light most favorable to ezzo because this appeal arises from the entry of a partial summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law dismissing the case.
ebeido owns a beauty salon in nashville,tennessee through ezzo investments.ebeido is the sole provider of hair care at the salon.the majority of gross sales at the salon are derived from the sale of beauty products.
in october,john fail and raymond jacobs,employees of royal,visited the salon and inquired as to whether ebeido would be interested in purchasing matrix products for resale.at the time,matrix sold professional salon products through its professional salons policy.the relevant portion of the policy for this case is a contractual restriction between matrix and its distributors allowing sales of matrix products only to salons that derive more than of their revenue from services rather than product sales.this policy has been labeled the rule in this litigation.
ebeido has never contended that his salon met the requirement of the rule at any time relevant to this case.he maintains that when fail and jacobs discussed the signing of a success club agreement with royal,he refused to do so because he did not want to be restricted by the rule.ebeido also contends that fail and jacobs waived the rule during their pitch of matrix sales in his salon.fail and jacobs maintain that ebeido agreed to add styling chairs to his salon in order to increase service revenues to reach compliance with the rule.ebeido denies this agreement was reached.nonetheless,ebeido purchased matrix products from royal and resold them from october through march.
in march,a customer of ezzo,mary hausman,told ebeido that the wife of alan snetman,another nashville salon owner and eventual defendant in this case,had informed her that ezzo is just a wholesale place,and we going to make sure he will not carry products,because he cutting our prices.
sometime thereafter,jill bauer,regional sales manager of matrix,told jacobs that she had received complaints from other nashville salons about ezzo being able to carry matrix products while in violation of the rule.she also told jacobs that ezzo discounting of matrix products was adding fuel to the fire.on march,after the bauer jacobs discussion,fail and jacobs met with ebeido in nashville for lunch.at this meeting,ebeido contends that fail told him that he would lose his right to buy matrix products from royal unless he began selling them at suggested retail price.
on march,bauer phoned ebeido and requested that they meet.ebeido responded by saying,i am not going to raise up prices on matrix products,if that what you want to talk about.bauer made no response concerning ezzo prices and the call ended.
on march,ebeido received a letter from jacobs that expressed appreciation for ezzo business with royal and followed up the discussions of the lunch meeting.in the letter,jacobs described the discussion as a small discrepancy over price structure and recounted marketing strategies by which ebeido could display his products with the suggested retail price and then discount them to the price he desired in order to satisfy all parties involved.ebeido objected to the method of pricing suggested by the letter,and opted for matrix products openly displayed with the discounted price.
in an appeal of a previous summary judgment in this case,we recognized that the letter was not a request by jacobs to ebeido to fix prices at the suggested retail price.ezzo,royal beauty supply,cir.the letter was thus in conflict with ebeido claim that he was asked in the meeting to fix prices.id.
after receipt of the letter ebeido made four additional purchases of matrix products from royal,the last one on may.after that date royal refused to sell matrix products to ezzo on the basis that it failed to comply with the rule.thereafter,royal terminated ezzo account.
ezzo filed suit against matrix,royal,three current or former employees of royal,and nashville salon owner alan snetman in.defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the sherman act claim.this motion was granted and ezzo appealed.this court reversed the district court summary judgment in ezzo,at,holding that the evidence in the case was sufficient to create a reasonable inference for the that royal and matrix conspired to fix prices and that matrix rule was a pretext for price fixing,selectively enforced to discriminate against discounters.
on remand,ezzo slightly altered or perhaps even added to its theory of recovery in its proposed final revised pretrial order,which stated 
i f the trier of fact should determine that plaintiffs account was in fact terminated as a result of noncompliance with the rule and that such rule was not used as a pretext for price fixing,it is plaintiff sic position that the contract between matrix and royal beauty supply to enforce the rule,a subpart of matrix professional salon policy,is an unreasonable vertical restraint that unlawfully and without reasonable justification suppresses competition.
matrix moved for partial summary judgment on ezzo claim that the rule was illegal per se in violation of the act and on ebeido individual claims.the district court granted the motion,thereby dismissing both claims,but leaving ezzo and selective enforcement claims for trial.on the same day,the district court granted ezzo motion to voluntarily dismiss snetman.the next day,the district court entered an order dismissing royal and the royal employees due to a settlement between them and ezzo,leaving matrix as the only defendant at trial.
in,the case went to trial on ezzo and selective enforcement claims.after ezzo,matrix moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted matrix motion,holding that even though conflicting testimony about whether matrix and royal had entered into a conspiracy to fix prices and selective enforcement of the rule created questions for the,those determinations were unnecessary because ezzo had not offered any evidence of causation of damages or offered a rational basis upon which any computation of damages could be made.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court applies a de novo standard when reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment.see soper hoben,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.the reviewing court must consider whether the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.see anderson liberty lobby,d.when reviewing whether the nonmoving party has met this burden,we must construe the evidence and draw all inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see anderson,at.
this court reviews de novo a district court decision to grant judgment as a matter of law.jackson quanex,cir.a district court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law i f during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.without weighing the evidence or assessing the credibility of the witnesses,and after drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff,an appeals court must determine whether the record contains evidence sufficient to have allowed jurors to find in favor of plaintiff.monday oullette,cir.in ruling on a rule motion,a trial court is not permitted to weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations,as these are jury functions.balance dynamics schmitt,cir quoting jackson quanex,at.
summary judgment 
applicability of the rule of reason.
the district court properly examined the rule under a rule of reason analysis because it is a vertical non price restraint without an agreement on price or price levels.ezzo failed to offer evidence that could show that the rule had an effect on interbrand competition.the essence of ezzo argument before the district court and on appeal is that the rule is a per se violation of of the sherman act because it throttles output and discourages or prevents price competition.ezzo also argues that matrix arbitrarily and selectively enforces its rule against matrix discounters.the latter argument is beyond the scope of the issue before the district court on the partial summary judgment motion.
the alleged restraint in this case,the rule,provides that 
matrix retail products are sold to professional salons with the sole intent that the salons resell such products only to their clients.these retail sales are based upon the professionals knowledge of their clients hair and beauty needs,as well as an appreciation of each client particular skin condition and requirements.it is understood that a professional salon is a salon whose greater percentage of gross sales comes from cosmetology services,not the sale of products.
ezzo concedes that this policy between matrix and its distributors is a vertical restraint.the rule does not have a pricing element.nonetheless,ezzo argues that scrutiny of the rule,which it contends was absent during the district court summary proceedings,will show that its true purpose is to limit output and prices.
when concerted action is challenged as an unlawful restraint on trade under section of the act,courts will normally examine the claim by applying the rule of reason.see business electronics sharp electronics,d.under the rule of reason the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.id.quoting continental,gte sylvania,d citations omitted.under the rule of reason,it is necessary to evaluate the restriction by analyzing the facts peculiar to the business,the history of the restraint,and the reasons it was imposed to form a judgment about the competitive significance of the restraint.lie joseph hosp.of mount clemens,cir quoting soc y of prof l eng rs united states,d.
in analyzing agreements that are not per se violations of the antitrust laws,the court is looking to whether the action complained of has the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition,and this analysis usually involves an inquiry into market definition and market power.
id.quoting ftc indiana fed of dentists,d quotation marks omitted.
conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive is illegal per se under the act and is not examined on a basis.id.quoting gte sylvania,at.conduct that is illegal per se under the act involves practices or agreements that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output.id.quoting northwest wholesale stationers,pacific stationery printing,d,in turn quoting broadcast music columbia broad,d.
trade restraining agreements scrutinized under the act can be categorized as horizontal agreements between competitors at the same level of market structure,or vertical combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure,such as manufacturers and distributors.bailey,windsor,cir quoting oreck whirlpool,cir,cert.denied,d,as quoted in crane shovel sales,cir.vertical restraints primarily affect intrabrand competition,while horizontal restraints primarily affect interbrand competition.
vertical restraints on trade are examined under a rule of reason analysis unless they include some agreement on price or price levels.business electronics,d.the rationale for different treatment of vertical restraints is that as long as interbrand brand competition existed,that would provide a significant check on any attempt to exploit intrabrand market power,because interbrand competition is the primary concern of antitrust law.id.at.quoting gte sylvania,at.
consistent with this rationale is the requirement that a plaintiff seeking redress under the act must show that the restraint of trade had an effect on competition at the interbrand level.see crane shovel sales,cir.
ezzo argues that the rule is a throttle on output and interbrand competition because it restricts and suppresses aggressive merchandising,including discounting and has the intended effect of coercing adherence to matrix suggested retail pricing structure.this argument characterizes the rule as a limit on sales,but the policy is neutral.any salon that has the ability to purchase matrix products through conformity with the rule may increase or decrease sales or service volume by making either increases or decreases in volume of sales or services or increases or decreases in the price of sales or services and conform to the rule.ezzo makes conclusory statements about the negative effect of the rule on interbrand competition or its hidden design to fix prices at the suggested retail level,but it presents no evidence which could support a finding consistent with these claims.
ezzo also contends that the district court ruling should be overturned because it failed to scrutinize the justification given by matrix for the policy.matrix stated justification for the rule is a desire that matrix products be sold with high levels of accompanying service.a manufacturer desire to insure high levels of service accompanying the sale of its products at the retail level was the example the court used in business electronics to illustrate why vertical agreements are not illegal per se unless they include an agreement on price.in explaining why holding vertical non price agreements illegal per se would discourage competitively useful conduct,the court stated 
a ny agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer to terminate another dealer who happens to have charged lower prices can be alleged to have been directed against the terminated dealer price cutting.in the vast majority of cases,it will be extremely difficult for the manufacturer to convince a jury that its motivation was to ensure adequate services,since price cutting and some measure of service cutting usually go hand in hand.accordingly,a manufacturer that agrees with one dealer to terminate another for failure to provide contractually obligated services,exposes itself to the highly plausible claim that its real motivation was to terminate a price cutter.
manufacturers are often motivated by a legitimate desire to have dealers provide services,combined with the reality that price cutting is frequently made possible by free riding on the services provided by other dealers.
business electronics,at.
in criticizing matrix justification for the rule,ezzo argues that the rule is a pretext for a motive and that the rule is selectively enforced or unenforced.again,these arguments go beyond the scope of the partial summary judgment sought and granted in this case and are not considered.
the district court relied heavily upon business electronics in analyzing the rule under a rule of reason.under business el
