the first of the named plaintiffs in this company financial services,cordes is the assignee of an antitrust claim against the defendants formerly asserted by western pacific airlines western pacific.the interests in this litigation of the second communications corporation equalnet are being pursued by the unsecured creditors trust creditors trust of a subsidiary of equalnet equalnet en.creditors trust acquired a stake in any proceeds equalnet obtains through this lawsuit.the plaintiffs allege in their consolidated class action complaint the complaint that the defendants,who are initial public offering ipo underwriters,violated section of the sherman act,by agreeing to charge all corporations conducting ipos who used their services a fee equal to seven percent of the proceeds of the offering.cordes and creditors trust sought class certification pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york lawrence mckenna,judge denied the motion for class certification because,it concluded,two rule adequacy requirement of rule a and the predominance requirement of rule b were not met.
rule a provides that it is a prerequisite to pursuit of an action as a class that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.the district court reasoned that because cordes and creditors trust are assignees of the entities that instituted this lawsuit and are not themselves members of the putative class,they are not qualified to act as representatives of the class.for reasons set forth below,we think that the fact that the do not themselves fall within the definition of the class as set forth in the complaint does not,ipso facto,foreclose their ability to act as class representatives in lieu of the entities that originally brought the claims,both of them members of the class.on remand,the district court should decide whether,on the facts presented in this case,cordes and creditors trust are each adequate representatives of the class.
rule b requires,inter alia,that for a lawsuit to be pursued as a class action,the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to establish that this litigation meets that requirement because they did not offer evidence to establish that antitrust of the elements of the antitrust claim alleged in the be proved by a method common to the class.
the antitrust injury element raises both factual questions related to whether the plaintiff has suffered harm and legal questions related to whether that harm is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick pueblo,d.we think that the district court should have distinguished between antitrust injury factual to which both parties offered its legal to which neither party offered evidence.we conclude,for reasons set forth below,that the legal questions raised by the antitrust injury element of this case are common to the class.on remand,the district court should therefore decide whether the factual questions are common to the class.and if the court determines that the factual questions relevant to antitrust injury here are individual to each class member,the court should then determine whether common questions nonetheless predominate,and whether certification of a part of the case would be appropriate even if certification of the whole would not be.
background 
cordes,the first,purchased the interest supporting its claim in this lawsuit from the bankruptcy estate of western pacific.in,western pacific engaged in an ipo of its capital stock,the proceeds of which were approximately million.two years later,western pacific filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of colorado.in,that proceeding was converted to a liquidation proceeding under chapter.in,the trustee of the estate in bankruptcy filed a complaint in this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the trustee alleged that beginning in the,the defendants,investment banks that had underwritten ipos,engaged in a horizontal scheme of which western pacific was a victim during the course of its ipo.in,the bankruptcy court entered an order permitting western pacific chapter trustee to sell by auction western pacific claim and interest in the antitrust litigation.the bankruptcy court required,inter alia,that the winning bidder be willing to act as a named class representative.cordes acquired western pacific claim and interest,with the approval of the bankruptcy court,for.the instrument memorializing western pacific assignment of its claim stated that cordes agreed to pursue the litigation in good faith as a named class representative.
in,equalnet,the second,held an ipo of its capital stock.it,too,subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter.the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas converted the chapter proceeding to chapter.en,equalnet subsidiary,also filed for bankruptcy,which resulted in the formation of creditors trust.creditors trust,which is pursuing equalnet former claims,acquired a interest in equalnet potential recovery in this case by foreclosing on security interests that en held in certain assets of equalnet.
the plaintiffs allege in the complaint that the defendants,ipo underwriters,fixed their underwriting fees at seven percent of the ipo proceeds for all corporations conducting,ipos generating between and in proceeds.they assert that the defendants thereby violated section of the sherman act,more than ninety percent of issuers of ipos since were,according to the complaint,charged such a fee in that amount.the plaintiffs further allege that ipos are managed by a syndicate of underwriters,each of which has a lead manager and several.because each defendant participated as lead manager for some ipos and as for others,each was allegedly able to monitor the fees charged by other defendant underwriters.the plaintiffs also submitted expert testimony to support their allegations that the defendants entered into a horizontal agreement and have been able to enforce it.
western pacific and equalnet brought the lawsuit 
pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,on their own behalf and as representatives of a class of all corporations and other entities excluding defendants and their respective parents,subsidiaries and affiliates and issuers of government securities who,during the period from at least january through the present,issued an initial public offering of securities with an aggregate value between million and million using the services of any defendant.
compl.after the assignment of western pacific and equalnet claims and interests in this litigation,cordes and creditors trust filed a motion to certify a class of plaintiffs pursuant to rule.
cordes and creditors trust submitted a declaration of their expert,gustavo bamberger,in an attempt to establish that they could prove the elements of their claim by common proof and that those elements are predominant,as required for certification under rule b.bamberger reported that he had been asked whether he could measure the damages suffered by each class member by the use of a formula common to all class members.bamberger decl.he responded in the affirmative.id.damages in this case were,he said,the difference between the fee actually paid and the fee the fee that would have been charged to the putative class members in connection with the ipo in the absence of the alleged conspiracy.id.at.bamberger asserted that he could devise a common formula for deriving the fee by establishing a benchmark fee from a set of prices paid in temporal or geographic isolation from the conspiracy,and applying a multiple regression analysis to isolate the explanatory variables that influence the benchmark fee.id.the fee for each class member could then be determined by substituting the appropriate values for the explanatory variables.id.
the defendants countered with an expert report prepared by robert willig the willig report.the defendants asked willig whether the plaintiffs allegations that members of the proposed issuer class have been injured by the alleged conspiracy are capable of being proved on a common basis for the purported class members.willig report at.willig asserted in response that in order to determine whether a class member was injured,one must first determine the gross spread that is,the fee that the underwriter would have charged but for the conspiracy.id.at.but,according to willig,calculating the gross spread requires an individualized,analysis of ten factors,including underwriter costs,price stabilization,and the risk of the offering.
the district court denied certification.the court first determined that neither cordes nor creditors trust satisfied the adequacy prerequisite of rule a.the court noted that a class representative must be a member of the class and that both cordes and creditors trust were assigned their interests in the litigation.in re pub.offering fee antitrust,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,the district court opinion,amended by wl,dist.lexis.assuming for purposes of its analysis that cordes and creditors trust met the other class certification qualifications,it ruled that they were not members of the proposed class and thus could not represent it.id.at,dist.lexis,at.treating class membership as a transferable asset could,in the words of the court,lead to a very serious problem indeed in the class action field.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court concluded further that rule b predominance requirement also had not been met.cordes and creditors trust argued that because their expert had provided a formula for assessing damages for all class members,they had also established that they would be able to prove antitrust impact by common proof.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court rejected this argument because the plaintiffs were ignoring the distinction between antitrust injury or impact,on the one hand,and damages,on the other.id.at,dist.lexis,at.each expert had been asked,and ha d answered,meaningfully different questions.id.at,dist.lexis,at.although the court a ccept ed both opinions as not fatally flawed and sufficiently reliable,only the defendants expert analysis,the court concluded,addresses the question before the is whether antitrust injury or impact can be proved by evidence common to the class.id.at,dist.lexis,at quoting in re visa antitrust,cir visa check the questions are different,the court continued,because there is considerabl y more leeway allowed in proving damages,once antitrust liability is established,than is permitted in proving antitrust liability.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
cordes and creditors trust,relying on visa check,also argued that certification was appropriate because common questions regarding the nature of the conspiracy in a case predominate over all other questions,including those regarding injury.the court concluded,however,that visa check supported only the proposition that the need for individualized inquiry into damages should not prevent certification of a class with common questions on liability based on its conclusion that cordes and creditors trust did not establish that in this case there are common questions on liability,the district court rejected this argument,too.
cordes and creditors trust petitioned this court,pursuant to.f,to hear an interlocutory appeal of the denial of class certification.on august,a panel of this court granted the petition.

ii.denial of class certification 
two questions are presented to us on this interlocutory appeal a whether the district court misconstrued rule a adequacy requirement,and b whether it misconstrued rule b predominance requirement,adversely in each case to cordes and creditors trust.
prerequisites to a class of representation 
rule a sets forth four p rerequisites to a c lass a ction 
numerosity a class so large that joinder of all members is impracticable commonality questions of law or fact common to the class typicality named parties claims or defenses are typical of the class and adequacy of representation representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
amchem,windsor,d quoting.a.the defendants do not contest that the first three prerequisites are met here.we therefore confine our consideration to the of representation.determination of adequacy typically entails inquiry as to whether plaintiff interests are antagonistic to the interest of other members of the class and plaintiff attorneys are qualified,experienced and able to conduct the litigation.baffa donaldson,lufkin jenrette sec,cir.this process serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.amchem,at.
the district court did not find it necessary to engage in either part of the typical inquiry.the court decided that,irrespective of whether cordes and creditors trust could satisfy the baffa factors,they can not be representatives of the class because they do not themselves fit within the definition of the class as set forth in the complaint.
it is plain that cordes and the creditors trust are not members of the proposed issuer class and that,as a assuming arguendo that they meet the other qualifications for class can not represent the issuer class.
plaintiffs in response cite the undisputed proposition that antitrust claims are assignable.that is beside the point.to allow cordes or the creditors trust to represent the proposed class would,in effect,treat class membership as a transferable asset,and that could plainly lead to very serious problems indeed in the class action field.
district court opinion,wl,at,dist.lexis,at footnote omitted.
the defendants urge us to adopt the district court conclusion,arguing that cordes and creditors trust are not themselves members of the defined class in light of the general principle that only a class member can adequately represent the class,cordes and creditors trust can not represent the class and to allow the class action device to become a mechanism for trafficking in litigation would fundamentally undermine the administration of justice in federal courts.def.br.at.we disagree.
the ability of assignees to serve as class representatives.to have standing to sue as a class representative it is essential that a plaintiff be a part of that class,that is,he must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury shared by all members of the class he represents.schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d citations omitted see also.of sw.falcon,d quoting schlesinger,at.when western pacific and equalnet brought this lawsuit as putative class representatives,see complaint,they were indisputably members of the class they sought to represent.we conclude that the subsequent assignment of their claims and interests in this litigation to cordes and creditors trust,respectively,did not deprive cordes and creditors trust of the ability,as assignees,to continue to seek recognition as representatives of the class.
cordes and creditors trust standing to pursue these claims as a class action.
the defendants do not contest the validity of the assignments of the bankrupts antitrust claims to cordes and creditors trust in this instance see def.br.at see also cities serv,cir antitrust claims have been held assignable.it is undisputed that cordes and creditors trust acquired through western pacific and equalnet bankruptcy proceedings all or a portion of whatever substantive rights western pacific and equalnet held at the time of their respective bankruptcies to recover for the injuries alleged in the complaint nevertheless,the defendants argue,because neither cordes nor creditors trust is itself a member of the class as pleaded,neither has standing to act as a class representative.
standing has both constitutional dimensions rooted in article iii case or controversy clause and prudential dimensions that are closely related to art.iii concerns but are essentially matters of judicial.warth seldin,d.the rule that a class representative must be part of the class,falcon,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted,is one of prudential standing,related to the broader principle that the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties,warth,at.see also allen wright,d recognizing the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights as one of several judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction.this principle requires in the class action setting that a n individual litigant seeking to maintain a class action meet the prerequisites of numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation specified in rule a.falcon,at.quoting.of,eeoc,d.these requirements effectively limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff claims.id.quoting.of,at.see also id.a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.quoting east.motor freight rodriguez,d quoting schlesinger,at.
we return,then,to the basic principle that t o have standing to sue as a class representative it is essential that a plaintiff must be a part of that class,that is,he must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury shared by all members of the class he represents.schlesinger,at.citations omitted see also.a providing that o ne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties only if the four prerequisites of subsection a are met.western pacific and equalnet were both members of the class.as a result of western pacific and equalnet assignments of their respective claims and interests in this litigation to cordes and creditors trust,cordes and creditors trust stood before the district court in the shoes of western pacific and equalnet,for the purposes of this litigation,as assimilated members of the class.by virtue of the assignments,they do,as western pacific and equalnet did,possess the same interest and thus may continue to assert a claim for the same injury shared by all members of the class.
the fundamental requirement,in other words,is that the class claims be fairly encompassed within the representative claims.falcon,at.the claims of cordes and creditors trust,premised as they are on the harms allegedly suffered by western pacific and equalnet,fairly encompass the claims of the class.reasons of efficiency and economy that permit claims to be pursued as part of a class action in the first place do not vanish as a result of the assignments.as assimilated class members by virtue of the assignments,cordes and creditors trust have standing to pursue the assigned claims as class representatives.
finally,we do not think that allowing cordes and creditors trust to serve as class representatives threatens the district court power under article iii to hear this dispute.the assignment of a claim from a person who suffered an injury to someone who did not does not make the claim any less a case or controversy which the courts have the constitutional capacity to resolve.it is indeed commonplace for an assignee to institute or continue an action of his or her assignor on an assigned claim even though he or she,apart from the assignment,is without standing,and the court,apart from the assignment,would be without power to decide the case.see.c providing that in the case of any transfer of interest,the action may be continued by or against the original party or,upon motion,by or against the transferee official comm.of unsecured creditors of color tile,coopers lybrand,llp,cir as assignee of the color tile bankruptcy estate,color tile committee stands in the shoes of color tile and has standing to bring any suit that color tile could have instituted had it not petitioned for bankruptcy.citation omitted.similarly,an assignment of a class claim by a person who purports to be a class representative does not render the claim less amenable to resolution as a class action,nor class action treatment less beneficial to the litigants,after the transfer of the asserted cause or causes of action than before.
b.the perils of permitting to represent the class.
the defendants argue that as assignees,cordes and creditors trust are not squarely aligned in interest with the represented group.def.br.at quoting benjamin kaplan,continuing work of the civil committee amendments of the federal rules of civil procedure i,harv,internal quotation marks omitted.they characterize cordes and creditors trust as textbook examples of the very serious problems referenced by the district court that would ensue if the ability to serve as a class representative could be treated as a transferrable asset.id.at quoting district court opinion,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.they explain in some detail why,in their view,cordes and creditors trust interests are antagonistic to interests of the class and why they are otherwise deficient as class representatives.id.at.irrespective of the extent to which cordes and creditors trust interests are or are not in fact antagonistic to the interests of other members of the class in this particular matter on which it is premature for us to express a do not think that they are necessarily antagonistic solely because cordes and creditors trust are assignees of western pacific and equalnet interests in the class action that they are pursuing.
the asserted unhappy consequences of allowing trafficking to use the defendants characterization in causes of action,thereby permitting one person who has suffered no injury to pursue actions in the stead of another solely to maximize his or her personal monetary return,are not fanciful.the aversion to such assignments,because of their potential use by intermeddle rs to stir up litigation for the purpose of making a profit,accrued fin,prime retail,cir,has been reflected from time immemorial in the laws of champerty and its kin see in re primus,d p ut simply,champerty is maintaining a suit in return for a financial interest in the outcome.
the purchasing of claims,whether before or after suit has been brought upon them,for the purpose of turning a profit is nonetheless not categorically forbidden.see advanced magnetics,bayfront partners,cir in general,claims or choses in action may be freely transferred or assigned to others.see also elliott,banco de la nacion,cir.to the contrary,such assignments are widely permitted,presumably in order to allow holders of claims to transfer the risk of loss to someone better able or more willing to pursue the claim or to undertake the risk.valid claims otherwise lost may thus be salvaged.
the defendants arguments and the district court conclusions as to the transferability of the ability to represent a class fail to account for the countervailing value of allowing an assignee to stand in the shoes of the assignor before a court.this case might be termed a textbook example of that value in the bankruptcy context inasmuch as the assignments pursuant to which cordes and creditors trust are litigating this case promoted the winding up of complicated estates in bankruptcy to the benefit of creditors.we see nothing about the perils of claim assignment in the context of class membership and class representation that is qualitatively different from similar dangers that inhere in permitting the pursuit of assigned legal claims generally,which,as we have noted,is allowed.
we conclude that cordes and creditors trust,pursuing their claims and interests as assignees of the claims brought by,and interests in this litigation of,purported members of the class seeking to act as class representatives,are not excluded,for that reason alone.
the determination of adequacy of representation.that is hardly the end of the matter.as with any class member seeking to act as a class representative,cordes and creditors trust must demonstrate that their interests are not antagonistic to the interest of other members of the class and their attorneys are qualified,experienced and able to conduct the litigation.baffa,at.in light of its categorical approach to rule a adequacy requirement,the district court has not addressed these questions.for some of the reasons advanced by the defendants in support of their assertion that assignees can never act as class representatives,cordes,creditors trust,or both,may in fact not be adequate class representatives here.if,for example,either is not sufficiently aligned in interest with the represented group,def.br.at citation omitted,see also id.at,or has insufficient knowledge or access to information,id.at,it may not qualify.but we are in no position,and therefore decline,to make that determination in the first instance.we mean to imply no views on the question.we leave the matter to the sound discretion of the district court on remand 
predominance 
if this lawsuit meets the prerequisites of a class action under rule a,it must then also qualif y under at least one of the categories provided in rule b before it may be certified as a class action.visa check,at.cordes and creditors trust assert that this action qualifies under the third rule b category,where,although class treatment is not necessary to avoid adjudications mandating inconsistent standards of conduct under.b,or to remedy discrimination under.b,class suit is nevertheless convenient and desirable,amchem,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
to qualify for class treatment,then,the proposed class must meet the requirement of is,that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and the requirement of is,that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b the predominance requirement on which we with the requirement of superiority,which has not been separately challenged on this that the class will be certified only when it would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.amchem,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court began with the notion that i n order to prevail on their claims,plaintiffs must demonstrate a violation of the antitrust laws by defendants some injury to plaintiffs business or property as a result of the violation causation or impact and the amount of damages sustained by the plaintiffs.district court opinion,wl,at,dist.lexis,at quoting in re indus.diamonds antitrust,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we have stated the point somewhat differently t he three required elements of an antitrust claim are a violation of antitrust law injury and causation and damages visa check,at.
there is no controversy here regarding the first visa check element.horizontal agreements are per se violations of the sherman act.see generally united states oil.cordes and creditors trust allegations of the existence of a conspiracy are susceptible to common proof and,if proven true,would satisfy the first element of the plaintiffs antitrust cause of action.
the second termed antitrust injury,causation or impact,or injury and causation is more complicated.
does antitrust injury pose common or individual questions section of the clayton act provides that any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor a.this has been read to require that to prevail in an antitrust suit,a plaintiff must prove that it has suffered antitrust injury,which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick pueblo,d emphasis added.
in brunswick,the defendant,brunswick,had purchased a nearly bankrupt bowling alley,thus keeping the purchased business alive.the plaintiffs,pueblo and other rival bowling alleys,sought to challenge the purchase because it kept their competitor in business.see id.at.plaintiffs doubtless suffered real had lost the income that would have accrued had the acquired centers gone bankrupt,id.at,but this was insufficient to meet the antitrust injury requirement.the damages recovered in such a case would have given pueblo and the other plaintiffs 
the profits they would have realized had competition been reduced.the antitrust laws,however,were enacted for the protection of competition not competitors,brown shoe united states,d.it is inimical to the purposes of these laws to award damages for the type of injury claimed here.
brunswick,at.
similarly,in atlantic richfield usa petroleum,d,independent gas stations could not recover from a gasoline producer that had allegedly fixed the maximum resale prices its affiliated gas stations could charge.the lower prices that resulted from the scheme had,not,effects in the markets in which the plaintiffs were engaged.see id.at.reasoning that price competition is with respect to other suppliers of the same goods or services id.at.noting that even though competitors could not show that they suffered antitrust injury because of their rival vertical scheme,consumers and the manufacturers own dealers may bring suit.
rule b requires that the district court determine what questions of law or fact are common to the members of the class.b emphasis added.insofar as rule b is concerned,and in light of brunswick and atlantic richfield,we think that the second element of an antitrust cause of action antitrust injury poses two distinct questions.one is the familiar factual question whether the plaintiff has indeed suffered harm,or.the other is the legal question whether any such injury is injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick,at.
rather than relying on the distinction between the legal and factual questions raised by the antitrust injury element of an antitrust suit,the district court focused on the distinction between antitrust injury and damages.see visa check,at.it accurately noted that the plaintiffs expert,bamberger,was asked to opine as to damages and the defendants expert,willig,as to injury.compare bamberger decl.stating that the plaintiffs expert was asked to determine whether it would be possible to measure damages suffered by members of the proposed class by the use of a formula common to all class members emphasis added,with willig report at stating that the defendants expert was asked to consider whether the plaintiffs allegations that members of the proposed issuer class have been injured by the alleged conspiracy are capable of being proved on a common basis for the purported class members emphasis added.reasoning that the plaintiffs and defendants experts have been asked meaningfully different questions,the district court accepted the testimony of the defendants expert,willig,because only he had addresse d the question before the is whether antitrust injury can be proved by evidence common to the class.district court opinion,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court therefore concluded that the antitrust injury element of cordes and creditors trust lawsuit presents questions individual to each class member.
we disagree.although the questions asked of the experts differed precisely as described by the district court,we think their answers were directed to the same question whether is susceptible to common proof in this case.neither expert offered any views on the legal question of whether common evidence could prove that the injury allegedly suffered was of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick,at.
the defendants expert,willig,was of the view 
that any determination of wh
