benny and wanda jacobs jacobs purchased a mattress from a tpx distributor in rome,georgia,at a price equal to or above the minimum price stated in the distributor agreement with tpx.after purchasing the mattress,jacobs brought this antitrust action in the northern district of georgia,rome division,against tpx under the sherman act,he claims that tpx created an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the act in two ways by enforcing the vertical retail price maintenance agreements with its distributors and by engaging with its distributors in horizontal price fixing.jacobs seeks treble damages against tpx on behalf of all who have purchased mattresses in the united states and an injunction against tpx further implementation of the retail price maintenance agreements 
the district court,on tpx motion,dismissed jacobs complaint for failure to state a claim for relief and entered a final judgment for tpx.the court then denied jacobs motions to alter or amend the judgment or,alternatively,for leave to amend the complaint jacobs now appeals all three rulings.we affirm.
we review the district court rulings in two parts.we first determine whether jacobs antitrust allegations were sufficient to withstand tpx motion to dismiss.we then consider whether the district court should have granted either of jacobs alternative motions.
we begin our assessment of the sufficiency of jacobs antitrust claims by setting out the standard for reviewing a motion to dismiss an antitrust claim.the review is de novo.spanish broad.of,clear channel commc ns,cir.as the supreme court instructed in bell atlantic twombly,in a case brought under of the sherman act,we must determine whether the complaint,in asserting a conspiracy or agreement in restraint of trade,contains allegations plausibly suggesting not merely consistent with a conspiracy or agreement,that is,whether the complaint possess es enough heft to show that the pleader is entitled to relief.id.at.at quotations and alteration omitted.plausibility is the key,as the allegations must nudge the claim across the line from conceivable to plausible.sinaltrainal,cir quoting twombly,at.at.and to nudge the claim across the line,the complaint must contain more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.twombly,at.at.t he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.ashcroft iqbal,
twombly,at.at.
in conducting de novo review,we engage in the same exercise a district court does in assessing the sufficiency of an antitrust complaint.it is a process 
a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that,because they are no more than conclusions,are not entitled to the assumption of truth.while legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint,they must be supported by factual allegations.when there are factual allegations,a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.
in this case,therefore,after determining whether the complaint averments are more than bare legal conclusions,we examine the complaint for a sufficient quantum of allegations to plausibly suggest that tpx agreed with its distributors to restrain trade in violation of the sherman act.we do this mindful that this is a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.id.
jacobs contends that the district court erred in two ways in dismissing the complaint.first,he argues that the complaint sufficiently alleged vertical resale price maintenance agreements between tpx and its distributors that were illegal under the rule of reason.second,he argues that the complaint provided facts sufficient to establish horizontal price fixing by tpx and its distributors under the per se rule.we address these arguments in order.
section of the sherman act makes unlawful e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.although the section language seems automatically to prohibit any kind of concerted restraint of trade,the supreme court interpretation of the act indicates that many forms of concerted action are to be evaluated under a flexible,standard the rule of reason.see standard oil united states,adopting the rule of reason.under the rule of reason,the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.cont l,gte sylvania,
by contrast,per se violations of of the sherman act are limited to a very small class of antitrust practices whose character is well understood and that almost always harm competition.texaco dagher,sylvania,at.at.examples of such per se illegality include horizontal price fixing among competitors,group boycotts,and horizontal market relationships that,in the courts experience,virtually always stifle competition.see,united states topco.
for many years,vertical resale price maintenance agreements,like the one alleged in jacobs complaint,were per se unlawful.miles med.john park sons,nor can the manufacturer by rule and notice,in the absence of contract or statutory right,even though the restriction be known to purchasers,fix prices for future sales,overruled by leegin creative leather,psks.even though miles reasoning rested on infirm economic rationales the supreme court implicitly upheld the per se illegality of vertical resale price maintenance agreements for nearly a century after miles came down.see,monsanto serv,sylvania,at.at the per se illegality of vertical price restrictions has been established firmly for many years bus.elecs.sharp elecs,e conomic analysis supports the view,and no precedent opposes it,that a vertical restraint is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement on price or price levels.
but even as the supreme court nominally upheld the per se illegality of vertical resale price minimums,it relaxed per se rules on other vertical restraints in favor of rule of reason analysis.the court,for example,declared maximum resale price maintenance agreements subject to the rule of reason.state oil khan,overruling albrecht herald.the court also declared vertical restraints inappropriate for per se condemnation,applying instead the rule of reason.sylvania,at.at,overruling united states arnold,schwinn.and the court also made clear that it evaluates a manufacturer termination of its agreement with an undesired discounting distributor under rule of reason analysis.bus,at.at.thus,by the time the court decided leegin,the jurisprudential foundations supporting the analysis of vertical resale price minimums under the per se rule were already substantially weakened.
in leegin,a manufacturer of leather goods refused to sell to retailers that discounted its goods below the manufacturer suggested prices.one retailer,to whom the manufacturer stopped selling after the retailer refused to cease discounting below the suggested prices,sued the manufacturer,alleging that it had entered into vertical minimum resale price agreements that were per se illegal under miles.leegin,at.at.the supreme court disagreed,expressly overruling miles because the reasons upon which miles relied do not justify a per se rule.id.at.at see also supra note.the court recognized that m inimum resale price maintenance can stimulate interbrand competition among manufacturers selling different brands of the same type of reducing intrabrand competition among retailers selling the same brand.id.at.at.it can do so because eliminating intrabrand competition frees retailers to invest in enhanced services that more effectively sell the manufacturer products relative to rival manufacturers products.additionally,customers receive more opportunities to choose among cheaper,brands and more expensive,brands.see also sylvania,at.at observing that interbrand competition provides a significant check on the exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product.furthermore,a bsent vertical price restraints,the retail services that enhance interbrand competition might be underprovided.this is because discounting retailers can free ride on retailers who furnish services and then capture some of the increased demand those services generate.id.citing sylvania,at.at the interests in reducing free riding and enhancing interbrand competition,reasoned the court,outweighed the stare decisis concern of overruling miles nearly precedent.after leegin,therefore,courts must evaluate vertical resale price maintenance agreements using the rule of reason.
under rule of reason analysis,a plaintiff may show either actual or potential harm to competition.levine cent.med.affiliates,cir.we address the sufficiency of jacobs allegations of harm to competition infra.regardless of whether the plaintiff alleges actual or potential harm to competition,however,he must identify the relevant market in which the harm occurs.see fed.trade comm.fed of dentists,reversing the court of appeals vacatur of a federal trade commission order because,inter alia,the commission identified a market even in the absence of elaborate market analysis levine,at rule of reason analysis requires the plaintiff to prove an anticompetitive effect of the defendant conduct on the relevant market.
jacobs argues that the district court erred by holding that the complaint failed to adequately plead a relevant market and thus did not show actual harm to competition.after reviewing the district court order,we agree that the complaint relevant market allegations fall short of what twombly requires.
section one plaintiffs must define both a geographic market and a product market.see rossi standard roofing,cir in the usual rule of reason case,to establish a violation of,plaintiffs must prove that the combination or conspiracy produced adverse,effects within the relevant product and geographic markets.although the parameters of a given market are questions of fact,thompson metro,cir,antitrust plaintiffs still must present enough information in their complaint to plausibly suggest the contours of the relevant geographic and product markets.since both the geographic and product market allegations are necessary for a plaintiff suing under of the sherman act to succeed,a court,in assessing the sufficiency of the complaint,may begin by analyzing either one.see newcal,ikon office solution,cir analyzing the product market where the defendant did not challenge the plaintiff assertion of the united states as a geographic market.we start with jacobs product market allegation as our analysis makes clear,jacobs has not sufficiently pled the relevant product market 
jacobs contends the district court improperly concluded that the foam mattresses sold by tpx are part of one larger market for mattresses generally.the district court reasoned that although foam mattresses may be very different from innerspring mattresses they are still a product on which people sleep.jacobs agrees,but insists that this is of no moment.rather,what is important is that foam mattresses are a distinct submarket within the larger mattress market and,as such,must be examined separately for purposes of the product market definition.
defining the relevant product market involves identifying producers that provide customers of a defendant firm or firms with alternative sources for the defendant product or services.levine,at.the market is composed of products that have reasonable interchangeability.id.quoting united states du pont de nemours cellophane.most importantly,we should look to the uses to which the product is put by consumers in general.maris distrib,cir quoting queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir.
a relevant product market can exist as a distinct subset of a larger product market.anchor,rule,cir.the supreme court has provided practical indicia that can determine the contours of the submarket,such as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity,the product peculiar characteristics and uses,unique production facilities,distinct customers,distinct prices,sensitivity to price changes,and specialized vendors.brown shoe united states,a court should pay particular attention to evidence of the of demand and reasonable substitutability of the products,because i f consumers view the products as substitutes,the products are part of the same market.rebel oil atl.richfield,cir.
the district court relied on cellophane in its product market analysis,holding that because foam mattresses and traditional innerspring mattresses are both product s on which people sleep,the two products are interchangeable parts of the larger mattress market,a market as to which jacobs did not allege any anticompetitive effects.jacobs correctly points out that unlike this case,cellophane was based on a voluminous record,detailed in several published appendices,from which the court could draw data on market share and substitutability of goods.here,because the district court dismissed his complaint based on its legal insufficiency,jacobs argues that he did not have the chance to add facts in discovery which would have established foam mattresses as a separate relevant product submarket.
we can not accept this argument,however,because it would absolve jacobs of the responsibility under twombly to plead facts plausibly suggesting the relevant submarket composition.jacobs skimpy allegations of the relevant submarket do not meet this obligation.the complaint alleges,without elaboration,that v foam mattresses comprise a relevant product market,or,separate and distinct from the market for mattresses generally,under the federal antitrust laws.this conclusional statement merely begs the question of what,exactly,makes foam mattresses comprise this submarket.the complaint provides no factual allegations of the of demand or other indications of price sensitivity that would indicate whether consumers treat foam mattresses differently than they do mattresses in general.consumer preferences for foam mattresses versus traditional innerspring mattresses,and the costs associated with their sale,may vary widely,may vary little,or may not vary at all.jacobs complaint,however,gives no indication of which of these is the case.the allegations that foam mattresses are more expensive than traditional innerspring mattresses and that foam mattresses have unique attributes are similarly of little help.they do not indicate the degree to which consumers prefer foam mattresses to traditional mattresses because of these unique attributes and differences in price.would,for example,a consumer whose innerspring mattress was due for replacement be more likely to purchase another innerspring mattress or substitute a foam model for it are foam mattresses put to different uses as luxury goods,such as in fine hotels and within higher income brackets than are traditional mattresses these types of questions,which our precedent makes clear are crucial to understanding whether a separate market exists,go unanswered in the complaint.
moreover,the broader economic significance of a submarket must be supported by demonstrable empirical evidence.anchor,at.while we acknowledge that jacobs did not have the chance to undertake extensive discovery because this case was dismissed on a rule b motion,he nevertheless had the obligation under twombly to indicate that he could provide evidence plausibly suggesting the definition of the alleged submarket.such an indication is conspicuously lacking here in its place is the unsupported assertion that foam mattresses constitute a distinct submarket of the larger mattress market.
for these reasons,the complaint allegations of the relevant product market are legally insufficient.the complaint insufficiency,however,is not limited to the relevant product market allegations.assuming for argument sake that the complaint defined that market,it failed to adequately allege actual or potential harm to competition.
actual harm is indicated by a factual connection between the alleged harmful conduct and its impact on competition in the market,spanish broad,at,and the plaintiff claiming it should point to the specific damage done to consumers in the market,id.citing full draw prods.easton sports,cir.the plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating damage to competition with specific factual allegations.id.at.actual anticompetitive effects include,but are not limited to,reduction of output,increase in price,or deterioration in quality.united states brown,cir.higher prices alone are not the epitome of anticompetitive harm as jacobs claims.rather,consumer welfare,understood in the sense of allocative efficiency,is the animating concern of the sherman act.see,brooke group brown williamson tobacco,noting the antitrust laws traditional concern for consumer welfare and price competition reiter sonotone,quoting robert bork,the antitrust paradox congress designed the sherman act as a consumer welfare prescription.by anticompetitive,the law means that a given practice both harms allocative efficiency and could raise the prices of goods above competitive levels or diminish their quality,rebel oil,at,in addition to other possible anticompetitive effects such as those above.in turn,the ability to raise prices above the competitive level corresponds to a firm market power.see.fed of dentists,at.at.here,beyond the bald statement that consumers lost hundreds of millions of dollars,there is nothing establishing the competitive level above which tpx allegedly anticompetitive conduct artificially raised prices.
because jacobs did not provide allegations plausibly suggesting actual harm to competition,his only avenue of relief was to sufficiently allege potential harm.to do so,jacobs had to define the relevant market and establish that the defendants possessed power in that market.levine,at.after those threshold requirements,jacobs then had to make specific allegations linking market power to harm to competition in that market.spanish broad,at see also id.quoting tops,quality,cir market power,while necessary to show adverse effect indirectly,alone is insufficient.here,in addition to having failed to allege the relevant product market as explained above,jacobs has failed to establish the connection between tpx power in the foam mattress market and harm to competition in that market.
we have held that m arket power is the ability to raise price significantly above the competitive level without losing all of one business,graphic prods,itek,cir citing valley liquors,renfield importers,cir posner,and that m arket share is frequently used in litigation as a surrogate for market power,id.jacobs complaint does allege that tpx has of sales in the foam mattress market,but beyond this fact,the complaint provides no direct evidence of the injurious exercise of market power such as evidence of restricted output and supracompetitive prices,rebel oil,at,beyond stating that these conditions exist.this is another fatal blow to jacobs case,because a showing of market power is necessary,but not sufficient,to establish potential harm to competition.spanish broad,at.the complaint here is bereft of the critical allegations linking tpx market power to harm to competition.
the extent of the complaint allegation that tpx harmed competition is the statement that the alleged resale price fixing agreements have unreasonably restrained,do unreasonably restrain,and will continue to unreasonably restrain trade and commerce in the mattress market by eliminating price competition.this sparse allegation is precisely the type of bare legal conclusion that was insufficient in twombly and iqbal.it provides no basis on which a court could determine how harm to competition results from tpx agreements with its distributors if such harm results at all.nor does the complaint allege that interbrand is,how competitors react to the allegedly higher prices of tpx been harmed by marketwide increased prices or reduced output.see leegin,at.at the promotion of interbrand competition is important because the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect this type of competition.quoting khan,at.at alteration in leegin.
just as firms in a perfectly competitive market are with respect to commodity prices,an appeals court is a when reviewing the district court dismissal of a claim as legally insufficient.with no record to go on,the court is limited to what appears on the face of the complaint.here,the complaint contains insufficient factual allegations to plead a plausible case that tpx retail price maintenance agreements with its distributors had anticompetitive effects on the mattress market.thus,the district court was correct to dismiss jacobs claim based on those agreements.
jacobs also argues that the district court improperly dismissed his claim for horizontal price fixing specifically,he contends that the dual distribution system tpx tpx sold mattresses both through its authorized distributors and through its own a horizontal conspiracy.tpx responds that the dual distribution system it used does not constitute a per se illegal horizontal conspiracy,and in fact is lawful under rule of reason analysis.the district court dismissed the horizontal price fixing claim because courts generally have viewed chains as vertical,not horizontal,in nature and jacobs did not allege a freestanding horizontal agreement solely among tpx,qua distributor,and its distributors.
we examine whether jacobs allegations of horizontal price fixing are plausible under twombly.jacobs allegations stated that tpx has entered into agreements with its distributors that allow tpx to set the prices at which a distributor must sell mattresses these agreements between tpx and its distributors result in there being virtually no price competition among 
retailers and dealers in the sales of mattresses.further,tpx sells its mattresses directly to consumers,and sells them at the same prices at which it has agreed with its distributors to charge.
reading these allegations as a whole,we can draw two possible inferences from the fact that tpx and its distributors charged the same minimum price.the first inference is that an arrangement existed whereby tpx,qua manufacturer,used the vertical minimum price agreements as a guise for horizontally setting uniform prices above the market equilibrium level when it acted as a distributor.in this scenario,a horizontal arrangement would exist between tpx,qua distributor,and its distributors by dint of the vertical price agreements.according to jacobs,this horizontal arrangement would represent tacit collusion by tpx and its distributors to set prices on mattresses if correct,such an inference would support jacobs theory of unlawful price fixing by tpx and its distributors.
the second inference is that tpx and its distributors set prices independently of each other that is,tpx and its distributors happened to set the same price because it made economic sense to do so.here is why the distributors would not set prices at any level other than the minimum.tpx website acts as an enforcement mechanism to prevent distributors from raising prices.if the distributors raised their prices above the minimum resale price set by tpx,and tpx,qua distributor,did not raise its price,consumers would start purchasing mattresses nearly exclusively from tpx website,eventually causing the distributors to lose significant amounts of business or to exit the market entirely.hence,it is in the distributors independent economic interest to maintain prices at minimums 
moreover,tpx would not undercut the minimum prices it imposes on its distributors.tpx,qua distributor,would not set its price under the minimum resale prices because doing so would drive the distributors out of business as consumers switched to purchasing mattresses from the website.this would be undesirable for tpx for economic reasons as well.tpx maintains the distributorship arrangement because its distributors provide showrooms where consumers can test out mattresses,have the mattresses unique attributes explained to them by knowledgeable salespeople,and make an informed comparison between mattresses and traditional innerspring if they later choose to purchase from tpx website.such information is critical to making a purchasing decision about an item on which consumers will spend of their lives,and tpx would be reluctant to forfeit that information by putting distributors out of business.accordingly,tpx keeps the prices for its web distributorship equal to the resale price minimums because it is economically advantageous for tpx as well.
we noted earlier that under the pleading standards of twombly and iqbal,plausibility is the key.given this standard,jacobs had the burden to present allegations showing why it is more plausible that tpx and its they are rational actors acting in their economic enter into an illegal agreement with the attendant costs of defending against the resulting investigation to reach the same result realized by purely rational behavior.put another way,the potential costs of fixing prices with its distributors would outweigh any benefits that tpx would realize by doing so,particularly where independent economic activity would yield the same benefits with none of the costs.
in fact,the pleading standard enunciated in twombly built upon the court rejection of an argument similar to the one jacobs makes.the twombly plaintiffs complaint against incumbent local exchange carriers did not survive a motion to dismiss because any actions those carriers took to resist incursion by upstart carriers was fully explained by their own interests in defending their individual territory.twombly,at.at quotations omitted approving the district court dismissal of the complaint because allegations of parallel business conduct,taken alone,do not state a claim under.the plaintiffs complaint led to competing inferences of conscious parallelism and independent business judgment,and the court held that more allegations were required at the motion to dismiss stage 
w e have previously hedged against false inferences from identical behavior at a number of points in the trial sequence.an antitrust conspiracy plaintiff with evidence showing nothing beyond parallel conduct is not entitled to a directed verdict proof of a conspiracy must include evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action and at the summary judgment stage a plaintiff offer of conspiracy evidence must tend to rule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently.
id.at.at citations omitted matsushita indus.zenith radio,i f the factual context renders the plaintiff claim the claim is one that simply makes no economic sense the plaintiffs must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than would otherwise be necessary.
here,like the twombly court,we fail to find in the complaint facts that are suggestive enough to render a conspiracy plausible,id.at.at,when the inference of conspiracy is juxtaposed with the inference of independent economic.see matsushita,at.at i f the defendants had no rational economic motive to conspire,and if their conduct is consistent with other,equally plausible explanations,the conduct does not give rise to an inference of conspiracy.moreover,even if tacit collusion were,in fact,the more plausible inference,tacit collusion is not in itself unlawful.brooke group,at.at.jacobs would have had to provide further allegations that,in addition to tacitly colluding,tpx and its authorized distributors somehow signaled each other on how and when to maintain or adjust prices.see id.at.at.the complaint contains no such allegations.there is no indication,for example,of dates on which distributors moved prices together,or the amounts by which the prices moved,if in fact they did.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court correctly dismissed jacobs claim for horizontal price fixing.
the district court denied jacobs alternative motions to alter or amend the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e and to amend his complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a jacobs argues that the rulings constituted an abuse of discretion the court should have reversed the judgment and required tpx to answer the complaint and,if not,it should have vacated the judgment and granted him leave to amend.
jacobs motion to alter or amend the judgment claimed that the court,in dismissing the complaint,erred in concluding that the complaint failed to sufficiently allege an anticompetitive effect of defendant conduct.according to jacobs motion,the complaint satisfactorily alleged actual harm to competition and a relevant product market and that the court misapplied the twombly standard in finding the allegations insufficient.particularly egregious was the court product market determination the disagreement between the parties as to the correct product market was a factual dispute that could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss.
in arthur king,we observed that 
t he only grounds for granting a rule motion are evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.in re kellogg,cir.a rule e motion can not be used to relitigate old matters,raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.michael linet,village of wellington,cir.
cir per curiam alterations in original.
having read jacobs motion,we conclude that it did nothing but ask the district court to reexamine an unfavorable ruling.reconsidering the merits of a judgment,absent a manifest error of law or fact,is not the purpose of rule.we find nothing in the district court order that would constitute a manifest error of law or fact.jacobs remedy,if he thought the district court ruling was wrong,was to appeal,a step he has taken.since we have concluded that the court did not err in dismissing jacobs complaint,it necessarily follows that it did not abuse its discretion in denying rule e relief.
jacobs based his alternative motion,which called for vacating the judgment and entering an order of dismissal with leave to amend the complaint,on the provisions of federal rule of civil procedure a.he first seized upon rule a,which states that a party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course before being served with a responsive pleading.a amended.noting that tpx had not filed a responsive pleading,but only a motion to dismiss,which is not considered a responsive pleading for purposes of rule a,jacobs motion stated that a plaintiff may amend the complaint once as a matter of right.since he had not previously exercised that right,jacobs contended,in effect,that an intervening judgment could not abolish the right.jacobs further asserted that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to allow an amendment under rule a,which directs the court to freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.
the problem with jacobs arguments is that rule a,by its plain language,governs amendment of pleadings before judgment is entered it has no application after judgment is entered.in united states ex rel.atkins mcinteer,we made this clear.
rule a has no application once the district court has dismissed the complaint and entered final judgment for the defendant.czeremcha int l ass of machinists and aerospace workers,cir.wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure,the plaintiff may seek leave to amend if he is granted relief under rule e or rule b.czeremcha,at ahmed dragovich,cir lindauer rogers,cir dussouy gulf coast inv,cir.

his complaint.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is 
ryskamp,district judge,dissenting 
this appeal requires examination of the nature of pleading in the era.prior to twombly,a complaint was held to the.a notice pleading standard,that is,a complaint needed to contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief such that the defendant received fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.conley gibson.twombly recast the standard for specificity in pleading,ruling that a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds for his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and that a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.courts must first separate factual allegations and legal conclusions and need only accept the factual allegations as true.iqbal.at.courts then apply a plausibility standard the complaint must contain only enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.twombly,at.at.determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.iqbal,at.at.
the majority goes too far in its application of twombly and essentially requires jacobs to prove his case in his complaint.i can not join the majority opinion in light of its misapplication of the twombly standard.
the majority finds jacobs vertical claim lacking in part because jacobs did not sufficiently plead the relevant product market.as the majority notes,the market is composed of products that have reasonable interchangeability.levine,at quoting du pont,at.at.such identification requires knowledge of producers that provide customers of the defendant firm or firms with alternative sources for the defendant products or services.levine,at quotation omitted.also according to the majority,actual evidence of of demand is another factor in evaluating the existence of the submarket.the majority even goes so far as to say that the broader economic significance of a submarket must be supported by demonstrable empirical evidence.anchor,at emphasis added.
product market analysis is detailed and complicated.that people sleep on both innerspring mattresses and mattresses does not necessarily mean that each of these mattresses belongs in the same product market.all building materials wood,stone,brick,steel,are not all in the same market simply because people use these materials to construct buildings.the relevant market simply can not be determined on a motion to dismiss.
the demand for empirical evidence at this stage of litigation is improper.requiring demonstrable empirical evidence in the complaint carries twombly too far.indeed,twombly itself states that a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations.at.no litigant could have any possibility of alleging a complaint under the majority demonstrable empirical evidence standard.evidence is presented at the summary judgment stage or at the trial stage of litigation,not in the pleadings.notably,cellophane,on which the district court relied in its product market analysis,was based on a voluminous record contained in several appendices.jacobs can not be expected to provide factual allegations of of demand,or other indications of price sensitivity,absent access to discovery.while twombly was a sea change in the standards governing pleading in federal court the majority goes too far when it interprets twombly to require a plaintiff to include actual evidence in the complaint.
jacobs alleges that the system by which tpx sold mattresses through authorized distributors and its own website constitutes a horizontal conspiracy in that all retailers charged the same price for the same product.the majority notes that two possible inferences derive from the fact that tpx and its distributors charged the same minimum price.the first inference is tacit collusion by tpx and its distributors to set prices.the second inference is that tpx and its distributors set prices independently of each other.dictionary defines plausible as appearing worthy of belief.synonyms for plausible include credible,creditable,likely,believable,presumptive and probable.my judicial experience and common sense leads me to conclude that it is entirely plausible that tpx and its distributors colluded to set prices.indeed,it is totally implausible that tpx and its distributors set prices independently of each other.horizontal is still a per se violation,and this allegation satisfies the plausibility pleading standard it is entirely plausible that this uniformity in pricing is the result of collusion rather than market forces.jacobs has a colorable horizontal price fixing claim,and his horizontal claim should have been allowed to proceed.
the majority judicial experience and common sense leads it to conclude otherwise it would require jacobs to provide allegations that tpx and its distributors signaled each other as to how and when to fix prices.when plausibility is based on a judge common sense and experience,different judges will have different opinions as to what is plausible,resulting in a totally subjective standard for determining the sufficiency of a complaint.i nconsistent rulings on virtually identical complaints may well be based on individual judges having quite different subjective views of what allegations are plausible.arthur miller,from conley to iqbal a double play of the federal rules of civil procedure,duke.see also rajiv mohan,a retreat from decision by rule in ashcroft iqbal.pub.pol y,basing the plausibility determination on judicial experience and common sense suggests that plausibility is not meant to be guided by clear principles,but instead by the wisdom of judges.speaker dep t of health and human services center for disease control and prevention,wl,illustrates this principle.the plaintiff alleged that the united states department of health and human services centers for disease control and prevention cdc disclosed his identity and other confidential medical information relating to the treatment of his tuberculosis.id.at.the district court granted the cdc motion to dismiss,but this court reversed and remanded,ruling that plaintiff complaint met the plausibility standard and noting that a plaintiff need not prove his case on the pleadings but merely needed to provide enough factual material to raise a reasonable inference,not a possible claim,that the cdc was the source of the disclosures at issue.id.at.the plausibility standard is a moving target two different courts can easily reach different conclusions based on a review of the same pleading.see also wells willow lake estates,wl,at cir,reversing district court dismissal of amended complaint,noting that amended complaint allegations are specific,factual,and plausible waters edge living,llc rsiu indem,cir finding that the complaint allow ed a reasonable inference regarding the existence of the settlement agreement and reversing the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim for relief.
yet if jacobs made the type of allegations the majority seeks and discovery later indicated that those allegations were untrue,jacobs would be vulnerable to rule sanctions.scholars write of information asymmetry,which often presents in claims hinging on the defendant state of mind or secret conduct.scott dodson,new pleading,new discovery.in such instances,the necessary information relating to issues such as fraud,conspiracy,and corporate governance can be found only in the defendant files and computers.miller,supra.see also dodson,supra,noting that plaintiffs who may have actually suffered cognizable harm will not necessarily be able to survive a motion to dismiss without formal discovery and will be unable to allege unknown facts in their pleadings without running afoul of the certification provision in rule.
i am concerned that the majority confuses the complaint factual allegations with legal conclusions.the complaint alleges that v foam mattresses comprise a relevant product market,or,separate and distinct from the market for mattresses generally,under the federal antitrust laws and that the alleged price fixing agreements have unreasonably restrained,do unreasonably restrain,and will continue to unreasonably restrain trade and commerce in the mattress market by eliminating price competition.these allegations could just as well be factual and suitable for trial by jury.see miller,supra,the conclusion category is being applied quite extensively,embracing allegations that one might reasonably classify factual and therefore potentially jury triable.
i am also troubled that the district court dismissed jacobs complaint with prejudice based on case law not yet decided at the time jacobs filed suit.the complaint was filed on january.twombly was decided on may,and leegin was decided on june.iqbal was not yet decided at the time of oral argument in this court.
leegin applied the rule of reason to vertical agreements,but jacobs filed his complaint when the per se rule governed.as the majority notes,evaluation of potential restraints of trade under the rule of reason entails the factfinder weigh ing all of the circumstances of the case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.cont l,at.at.the court is not a factfinder on a motion to dismiss,however.under the rule of reason,the uniform pricing could be indicative of an illegal price fixing agreement,but such is not discernable absent discovery.it was an abuse of discretion to deny jacobs leave to amend in light of the intervening leegin decision.
since twombly also jacobs complaint,jacobs could not be expected to conform his pleading to unarticulated standards.simply put,jacobs relied on the rule notice pleading standard when he filed his complaint.the appendix to the federal rules contains several forms that suffice under these rules and illustrate the simplicity and brevity that these rules contemplate.form,issued april,entitled complaint for negligence,provides that the following is sufficient to allege a claim for negligence

such a pleading would likely be considered scant under the twombly standard.although jacobs motion to amend came after issuance of the final judgment,denial of the motion was an abuse of discretion given that twombly was not decided when jacobs filed suit.i am puzzled that the district court would issue a final judgment prior to allowing jacobs leave to amend his complaint.the sua sponte allowance of leave to amend after dismissal of an initial complaint is standard practice in federal court.
furthermore,the district court never gave oral argument to the parties.by deciding this case on the pleadings and immediately the same day entering final judgment,the district court thwarted jacobs right to amend since no responsive pleading was filed.
i say nothing as to whether jacobs claims would survive a motion for summary judgment.i merely say that jacobs should have received leave to amend his complaint in light of twombly and leegin and that the majority overreads twombly as requiring the presentation of evidence at the pleadings stage.
