visa visa and mastercard international incorporated mastercard appeal from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,granting plaintiffs motion for class certification.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that plaintiffs had established that this action is maintainable as a class action under federal rule of civil procedure b.we therefore affirm.
background 
number of large and small merchants and three trade this antitrust class action against defendants visa and mastercard,alleging that defendants have created a tying arrangement in violation of of the sherman antitrust act,by means of their honor all cards policy,which requires stores that accept defendants credit cards to accept their debit cards as well.plaintiffs also allege that defendants have attempted and conspired to monopolize the debit card market in violation of of the sherman act.
the underlying facts are drawn from plaintiffs second amended consolidated class action complaint.although visa and mastercard are separate associations,their rules permit duality,which allows banks to be members of both associations and to issue both brands of credit cards.there is a percent overlap between visa and mastercard memberships,and virtually every retailer that accepts one of defendants credit cards also accepts the other credit cards.additionally,as a result of the duality policy,visa and mastercard coordinate many of their policies.
visa and mastercard,through member banks,issue different types of payment cards,including credit cards and debit cards.member banks,called institutions,rather than defendants themselves,issue payment cards to consumers and set the cardholders interest rates and fees.other member banks,called acquiring institutions,contract on behalf of visa and mastercard with retailers to accept their payment cards.when a cardholder makes a purchase with his or her visa or mastercard payment card at a merchant store,the acquiring institution reimburses the merchant the purchase price less a discount fee and the acquiring institution pays the institution an interchange fee.the interchange fee is set by visa and mastercard,and the discount fee is based largely on the interchange fee plaintiffs allege that,because of defendants policy of duality,there is a high degree of uniformity in both the interest rates and fees charged by defendants member banks to cardholders and in the discount rates charged by defendants member banks to merchants accepting visa and mastercard payment cards.
this action centers around a class of debit cards issued by visa and mastercard.a debit card is an access device which enables a cardholder,among other things,to withdraw cash from his or her bank account at an automated teller machine and to make purchases at a point of sale pos which are debited against the cardholder bank account.pos debit card transactions can either be or.in an debit card transaction,the cardholder enters his or her personal identification number pin into a pin pad and then,during the retail transaction,the institution verifies that there are sufficient funds in the cardholder account and electronically puts a hold on the funds needed for the transaction.within a day,the funds are moved from the cardholder account to the retailer account.in contrast,in an debit purchase,the cardholder signs a slip authorizing the purchase rather than entering a pin,the institution does not necessarily verify that there are sufficient funds or put a hold on those funds,and the funds take approximately one to seven days to be moved to the retailer account.plaintiffs contend that there is a higher incidence of fraud in pos debit transactions because they are authorized by signature,rather than by pin.visa offers an pos debit card called visa check and mastercard offers one called mastermoney,both of which are the subject of this litigation.
defendants have an honor all cards policy,which requires any merchant accepting any of their credit cards to accept all of their payment cards,including visa check and mastermoney.according to plaintiffs,retailers are even prohibited by the defendants honor all cards policy from asking customers whether they would mind using a different payment system.defendants have set the interchange fees for visa check and mastermoney at or near the same level as the interchange fees for their respective credit cards despite the fact that,according to plaintiffs,credit card rely on the extension of far more risk.the interchange fees for competing debit the risk of is substantially far lower.
plaintiffs contend that if visa check and mastermoney were not tied to defendants credit cards by the honor all cards rule,retailers would refuse to pay the high visa check and mastermoney fees,and as a result,defendants would have to lower those fees.plaintiffs also allege that defendants have undertaken measures to deceive retailers into accepting their debit cards.specifically,plaintiffs contend that defendants designed their debit cards to be indistinguishable from their credit cards by making them visually and electronically identical and by setting identical interchange fees for their credit and debit cards.
thus,plaintiffs allege that defendants have created an illegal tie between visa check and mastermoney and defendants credit cards and have attempted and conspired to monopolize the debit card market in violation of sections and of the sherman act.plaintiffs request both injunctive relief and money damages.
plaintiffs moved to certify a class pursuant to rule consisting of all persons and business entities who have accepted visa mastercard credit cards and therefore are required to accept visa check mastermoney debit cards under the challenged tying arrangements,during the fullest period permitted by the applicable statutes of limitations.in support of their motion for class certification,plaintiffs submitted an expert report from dennis carlton,in economics.carlton.defendants opposed the motion for class certification and moved to strike carlton report.defendants offered an expert report from richard schmalensee,in economics schmalensee,in opposition to plaintiffs motion for class certification and in support of their motion to strike.the district court issued a memorandum and order granting plaintiffs motion for class certification and denying defendants motion to strike carlton expert report.in re visa antitrust.this court granted defendants petition to appeal,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f the district court grant of plaintiffs motion for class certification on appeal,defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by finding that plaintiffs expert report was sufficient to support class certification common issues predominate over individual issues and that the case will be manageable as a class action,making certification under rule b appropriate and the class could also be certified under rule b even though plaintiffs request substantial monetary damages.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant or denial of a motion for class certification under a deferential standard.provided that the district court has applied the proper legal standards in deciding whether to certify a class,its decision may only be overturned if it constitutes an abuse of discretion.caridad commuter,cir,cert.denied sub nom commuter norris,d internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.standards for class certification 
to qualify for certification,plaintiffs must prove that the putative class action meets the four requirements set forth in federal rule of civil procedure a 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
a see also caridad,at.additionally,a class action may be maintained only if it qualifies under at least one of the categories provided in rule b.relevant to this action are rules b and b.rule b allows for the maintenance of a class action if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.b.rule b permits class certification if the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b.factors relevant to the superiority of a class action under rule b include 
a the interest of the members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum and d the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.
id.in determining the propriety of a class action,the question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits,but rather whether the requirements of rule are met.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.sufficiency of plaintiffs expert evidence 
a.the expert reports 
the district court set forth in detail the contents of plaintiffs and defendants expert reports.in re visa antitrust,at.the following is a brief summary of the contents of the expert reports.
based on the allegations in the complaint,plaintiffs expert,carlton,theorized that absent the tying arrangement,a large number of retailers would have refused to accept visa check and mastermoney and,as a result,defendants would have had to reduce their interchange fees in order to maintain merchant acceptance of those cards.carlton concluded,therefore,that all class members have been injured by paying higher interchange fees for visa check and mastermoney than they would have absent the tie.based on this theory,carlton stated that the following issues are subject to determination whether credit and debit cards have distinct characteristics whether visa and mastercard,individually jointly,have market power in credit cards and whether visa and mastercard tying policies injure all class members carlton also proffered the following formula for calculating each class member damages in the absence of the tying arrangement,the interchange rates for visa check and mastermoney would have been comparable to that of debit cards,and therefore,an individual class member damages could be calculated by measuring the overcharge it had paid on all of the visa check and mastermoney transactions it accepted.
defendants expert,schmalensee,maintained that carlton model of how the debit card market would operate absent the alleged tie did not adequately take into account the following consequences that would have accompanied the cessation of the tie there would be less usage of visa check and mastermoney if their interchange fees decreased because banks would issue fewer cards and defendants would spend less money advertising the cards credit card interchange fees would increase as debit card interchange fees decreased if credit cards were no longer tied in a package to debit cards and the existence and extent of each individual merchant injuries are not amenable to determination because damages depend on the merchant mix of credit and debit transactions.
in response to schmalensee assertion that the usage of debit cards would decrease absent the tie to credit cards,carlton pointed to two instances in which a reduction in interchange fees for a particular payment card led to an increase in its usage,rather than a decrease,as schmalensee model would predict usage of visa pos debit card increased after visa dramatically lowered its interchange fees in and usage of visa pos debit card significantly increased after visa cut its interchange fees for that card in.carlton also presented the following empirical evidence contradicting schmalensee theory that credit and debit cards are tied in a package where the interchange fees for credit cards would increase as that of pos debit cards decreased credit card interchange fees are not higher in canada,despite the fact that canadian banks do not issue pos debit cards and thus do not have a package of debit and credit cards and in the united states between and,interchange fees for debit transactions greatly increased while credit card interchange fees generally stayed the same or increased slightly,as opposed to decreasing as schmalensee model would predict.
defendants contend that the district court erroneously relied on carlton report in granting plaintiffs class certification motion because,according to defendants,the district court improperly limited its scrutiny of the report and carlton expert opinion failed to provide a credible basis for class certification.although a trial court must conduct a rigorous analysis to ensure that the prerequisites of rule have been satisfied before certifying a class,a motion for class certification is not an occasion for examination of the merits of the case.caridad,at internal quotation marks omitted.a district court must ensure that the basis of the expert opinion is not so flawed that it would be inadmissible as a matter of law.see cruz coach stores,civ,wl,at,disregarding expert report submitted in support of motion for class certification because the report was fatally flawed,aff in part,vacated in part on other grounds,cir plaintiff has not shown that the court abused its discretion in finding the report methodologically flawed.accord in re sumitomo copper,granting class certification upon finding that plaintiffs econometric methodologies have a reasonable probability of establishing plaintiffs claims by common proof in re disposable contact lens antitrust,granting class certification upon finding that plaintiffs have demonstrated at least a colorable method of proving common injury at trial in re potash antitrust,stating that in assessing whether to certify a class,the court inquiry is limited to whether or not the proposed methods are so insubstantial as to amount to no method at all.however,a district court may not weigh conflicting expert evidence or engage in statistical dueling of experts.caridad,at.the question for the district court at the class certification stage is whether plaintiffs expert evidence is sufficient to demonstrate common questions of fact warranting certification of the proposed class,not whether the evidence will ultimately be persuasive.id.at.
to the extent that defendants contention is that the court did not sufficiently examine whether carlton methodology was fatally flawed,and thus inadmissible even for class certification purposes,we reject this argument as meritless.the district court,in an almost fifty page opinion,thoroughly considered each of defendants criticisms of carlton theory and carlton response to each of those criticisms and concluded in each case that carlton response sufficiently addressed the criticism.the district court correctly noted that its function at the class certification stage was not to determine whether plaintiffs had stated a cause of action or whether they would prevail on the merits,but rather whether they had shown,based on methodology that was not fatally flawed,that the requirements of rule were met.in re visa antitrust,at.as for defendants claim that plaintiffs expert evidence failed to provide a reliable basis for class certification,the district court finding that carlton methodology was not fatally flawed,and therefore,was sufficiently reliable for class certification purposes,does not constitute an abuse of its discretion.bogosian gulf oil,cir vacating and remanding the district court denial of plaintiffs motion for class certification where plaintiffs could use an overcharge theory to prove their antitrust tying claims.
iv.rule b certification 
after finding that plaintiffs had shown that they met the requirements of rule a,the district court determined that the putative class is maintainable under rule b because plaintiffs had establish ed that the common questions of law and fact identified predominate over any individual questions and that a class action is superior to any other means of adjudication because w ithout class certification,there are likely to be numerous motions to intervene,and millions of small merchants will lose any practical means of obtaining damages for defendants allegedly illegal conduct.in re visa antitrust,at.defendants argue that the district court erred by certifying the class pursuant to rule b because individual questions predominate over the common issues and because the case will be unmanageable as a class action 
predominance 
the rule b predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.amchem prods.windsor,d.in order to meet the predominance requirement of rule b,a plaintiff must establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof,and thus applicable to the class as a whole,predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.rutstein avis,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
violation of antitrust law 
the district court examined whether plaintiffs could establish each of the three required elements of an antitrust claim a violation of antitrust law injury and causation and common evidence.in re visa antitrust,at.concerning proof of the substantive elements of an antitrust violation,the district court determined that plaintiffs could use common proof to establish the existence of a tying arrangement and to show defendants market power.id.at.additionally,the court found that the question of coercion was also amenable to proof on a basis because the contractual provision to which all class members were honor all cards establish the requisite coercion.id.at.defendants do not seriously dispute on appeal that common proof could be used to prove the substantive elements of the antitrust violations,and the district court findings on this issue do not constitute an abuse of its discretion.
the district court also determined that plaintiffs overcharge theory would permit them to establish on a basis.id.at.the court noted that although defendants argued that the overcharge theory was too speculative,defendants conceded in their briefs that the theory is not unknown and they did not contend that no plaintiff could ever recover under such a theory.id.at.defendants also claimed that could not be established using common proof because the district court would be required to examine a number of issues on an individual basis,including whether a merchant would have continued to accept debit cards at their current prices even absent the tie,whether the merchant had the ability to process debit transactions,and what forms of payment would replace the transactions formerly processed as debit transactions.id.at.the district court rejected this argument,finding that carlton scenario is a complete answer to the defendants attack on the theory of the complaint it posits injury resulting from every single class member overpaying for debit cards as a direct result of the tie and that carlton theory does not require analysis of any of the individualized questions suggested by defendants.id.at.
the district court further found that plaintiffs had responded persuasively to defendants other argument regarding credit card interchange fees would increase if debit card interchange fees decreased without the tie.id.at.the court explained that plaintiffs had presented empirical evidence showing that credit card interchange fees do not necessarily increase when debit card interchange fees decrease had informed the court that as part of their claim,they would demonstrate that the defendants had attempted to monopolize the debit card market in part to keep credit card interchange fees high and had impeached schmalensee on this issue by pointing to his deposition testimony that,although he thought it was likely credit card interchange fees would increase absent the tie,he had not pushed it far enough to have an opinion.id.at.thus,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had met their burden of showing that was amenable to common proof and that class treatment was therefore appropriate.id.
the district court also considered and rejected defendants arguments that causation could not be proven on a basis.the court found that defendants contention that,absent the tie,they would have selectively reduced fees as necessary to retain individual merchants business was too speculative because defendants had not previously engaged in such pricing.id.at.the court also observed that although defendants do have broad pricing categories for different classes of merchants,carlton damage formula could easily be adjusted to account for that fact.id.further,the court found that defendants claim that the usage of visa check and mastermoney would decrease absent the tie was contradicted by empirical evidence and was not relevant to carlton overcharge theory.id.
the court further found that defendants contention that a merchant ability to steer makes it impossible for plaintiffs to prove causation on a basis was without merit.defendants argued that if a merchant did not want to accept debit cards because of the allegedly inflated fees it would have to pay,the merchant could steer its customers to other forms of payment by,for example,converting the transaction to debit by asking for a pin or for another form of payment.id.at.the court found,however,that if a customer refused to be steered,the merchant would have to allow the customer to complete the debit transaction under defendants honor all cards rule.the court stated that t he presence of injury and causation is binary it is either there or it is not.according to carlton theory,injury and causation is present for every putative class member.id.at.the court observed,however,that if defendants repackaged their steering argument as one addressing mitigation of damages,rather than causation,it may have force.id.therefore,the court concluded that causation also could be proven on a basis.
defendants arguments on appeal regarding the district court finding that the existence of injury and causation can be established by proof appear merely to rehash their many criticisms of carlton theory.because we find that the district court resolution of these issues did not constitute an abuse of its discretion,see supra section,we affirm the district court determination that the existence of injury and causation can be proven on a basis.
the heart of defendants predominance argument is that the common issues in this action do not predominate over the individual damages questions,primarily the defense of mitigation of damages by steering although a court must examine the relevant facts and both the claims and defenses in determining whether a putative class meets the requirements of rule b,the fact that a defense may arise and may affect different class members differently does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones.see waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.rather,a s long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together,variations in the sources and application of a defense will not automatically foreclose class certification under rule b.accord williams sinclair,cir stating that the existence of a defense does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones when there is a sufficient nucleus of common questions.therefore,the question for purposes of determining predominance is not whether a defense exists,but whether the common issues will predominate over the individual questions raised by that defense.
defendants mitigation defense goes only to the calculation of damages.in re visa antitrust,at.the district court found that carlton common formula for absent the tie,the interchange fees for debit cards would have decreased,the interchange fees for credit cards would not have increased,and that an individual merchant damages could be calculated by comparing those fees with the interchange fees actually not fatally flawed.id.at.we have already stated that the district court determination did not constitute an abuse of its discretion.see supra section bogosian,at stating that in proving injury and damages for an illegal tie,plaintiff s may recover the amount of the illegal overcharge and could prove fact of damage simply by proving that the free market prices would be lower than the prices paid and that each plaintiff made some purchases at the higher price.assuming arguendo that the mitigation defense is viable the majority of the issues relating to this defense are common to the class,including,inter alia,whether defendants honor all cards rule allows steering and whether steering is impeded due to the physical similarities between visa check and mastermoney and defendants credit cards.the only individualized question regarding this mitigation defense,if viable,is the extent to which a particular merchant could have steered.
common issues may predominate when liability can be determined on a basis,even when there are some individualized damage issues.see,bertulli indep.ass of cont l pilots,cir affirming district court determination that common issues predominated because a lthough calculating damages will require some individualized determinations,it appears that virtually every issue prior to damages is a common issue bogosian,at stating that although calculation of damages in an antitrust action would involve some individualized issues,it has been commonly recognized that the necessity for calculation of damages on an individual basis should not preclude class determination when the common issues which determine liability predominate gold strike stamp christensen,cir affirming district court determination that common issues predominated in an antitrust suit where the question of basic liability can be established readily by common issues and stating that t he fact that there may have to be individual examinations on the issue of damages has never been held,however,a bar to class actions blackie barrack,cir the amount of damages is invariably an individual question and does not defeat class action treatment.julian von kalinowski et,antitrust laws and trade regulations a i ed.in antitrust cases,courts are more likely to consider the critical issue to be whether common liability issues predominate and to disregard individual damages questions.herbert newberg alba conte,newberg on class actions,at ed stating that for antitrust class actions,a particularly significant aspect of the rule b approach is the recognition that individual damages questions do not preclude a rule b class action when the issue of liability is common to the class ii phillip areeda et,antitrust law an analysis of antitrust principles and their application,at ed.although the evidence establishing damages usually varies from class member to class member,this fact alone does not defeat certification.see generally.b advisory committee notes to amendments explaining that a fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing situation for a class action under rule b,and it may remain so despite the need,if liability is found,for separate determination of the damages suffered by individuals within the class.district courts have correctly recognized that any other rule would eliminate antitrust class actions 
i f defendants argument that the requirement of individualized proof on the question of damages is in itself sufficient to preclude class treatment were uncritically accepted,there would be little if any place for the class action device in the adjudication of antitrust claims.such a result should not be and has not been readily embraced by the various courts confronted with the same argument.the predominance requirement calls only for predominance,not exclusivity,of common questions.
in re alcoholic beverages,internal quotation marks omitted see also in re catfish antitrust,same in re fine paper antitrust,aff,cir same.
under carlton theory of the case,which the district court found to be sufficiently reliable for class certification purposes,plaintiffs can prove on a basis the substantive elements of the antitrust violations and causation viability of the mitigation defense and general application of the overcharge formula for damages.in contrast,the only issues that might require some individualized inquiry under carlton theory are the extent to which a particular merchant could have steered customers away from debit card transactions,assuming the mitigation defense is viable and the calculation of damages using the overcharge formula and,if necessary,mitigation.under these circumstances,we can not say that the district court conclusion that the common issues of law and fact predominated over the individualized issues constitutes an abuse of its discretion.
manageability 
defendants also argue that the calculation of individualized damages makes this case unmanageable as a class action.we disagree.there are some situations where courts have determined that a case is not manageable as a class action because of the necessity for individualized damages determinations.see,ii areeda et,supra,at von kalinowski et,supra,collecting cases.nevertheless,failure to certify an action under rule b on the sole ground that it would be unmanageable is disfavored and should be the exception rather than the rule.in re cent.states bakery prods.antitrust,quoting manual for complex litigation,see also in re workers compensation,stating that dismissal for management reasons is never favored in re bristol bay,alaska,salmon fishery antitrust,stating that dismissal for management reasons,in view of the public interest involved in class actions,should be the exception rather than the rule internal quotation marks omitted von kalinowski et,supra,b iv generally,though,class action status will be denied on the ground of unmanageability only when it is found that efficient management is nearly impossible some courts have stated that there is a presumption against refusing to certify a class on manageability grounds.emphasis in original see generally yaffe powers,cir stating that for a court to refuse to certify a class because of management problems discount s too much the power of the court to deal with a class suit flexibly,in response to difficulties as they arise.
there are a number of management tools available to a district court to address any individualized damages issues that might arise in a class action,including bifurcating liability and damage trials with the same or different juries appointing a magistrate judge or special master to preside over individual damages proceedings decertifying the class after the liability trial and providing notice to class members concerning how they may proceed to prove damages creating subclasses or altering or amending the class.see.c stating that w hen appropriate,a an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues,or b a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class in re master key antitrust,cir discussing use of a separate liability and damages trial in an antitrust case and,if appropriate,use of subclasses to facilitate damages determination green wolf,cir stating that t he district court may use the procedures suggested by rule to cope with the distinctions between plaintiffs,if,indeed,they exist and noting that if the district court encounters individual damages issues t he effective administration of b may require the use of the sensible device of split trials internal quotation marks omitted newberg conte,supra,at to collecting cases applying each of these management tools newberg conte,supra,at stating that courts usually provide for a separate proceeding in antitrust suits where individualized damages issues arise von kalinowski et,supra,a i discussing adjudication of individualized questions in separate actions or in separate damage proceedings,allowing a class action to proceed for the purposes of litigating particular issues,or dividing the class into subclasses,and collecting cases applying those tools id.at b iv stating that manageability problems may be obviated by dividing the class into subclasses or confining certification to certain issues.we emphasize that the issue of manageability of a proposed class action is always a matter of justifiable and serious concern for the trial court and peculiarly within its discretion.windham american brands,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court recognized that although it appeared at this preliminary stage that damages could be determined with the aid of a formula,it had the flexibility to address any individualized damages issues,including the steering mitigation defense,that might arise.in re visa antitrust,at.in this regard,the court specifically recognized its ability to modify its class certification order,sever liability and damages,or even decertify the class if such an action ultimately became necessary.id.at.because the district court adequately considered how it would address any individualized issues that might arise in the case,the district court conclusion that this action will be manageable as a class action does not constitute an abuse of its discretion.
defendants erroneously suggest that our decision in abrams interco,cir,compels a finding that this case is unmanageable.in abrams,we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to certify an antitrust suit on manageability grounds.the district court in abrams determined that individualized issues of fact would greatly predominate over common issues,causing severe difficulties in the management of the class action because b y alleging a conspiracy with some dealers,coercion of others,and bribery of still others,the plaintiffs had raised issues relating to defendant individual relationships with each of its thousands of dealers.abrams,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the district court observed that certification might have been appropriate if plaintiffs had instead alleged some pattern on defendant part which was reasonably consistent,affecting all or most of the dealers referred to in the complaint.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we affirmed the district court finding that the case was unmanageable,particularly with regard to damages,because plaintiffs damages calculations would be complicated by the scores of different products involved,varying local market conditions,fluctuations over time,and the difficulties of proving consumer purchases after a lapse of five or ten years and would necessitate individual trials on damages for thousands or millions of class members.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in stark contrast,the action before us involves only two products credit cards and pos debit cards with set interchange fees and class members who can be identified by defendants own records.in this action,unlike in abrams,there are no individualized issues relating to each plaintiffs relationship with visa and mastercard because defendants honor all cards rule contractually applied to each of the plaintiffs in the putative class.additionally,plaintiffs here,unlike in abrams,have alleged a common practice affecting each member of the class and have proffered a damages formula to assist with the calculation of damages.thus,we find defendants reliance on abrams is misplaced.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the action will be manageable as a class action.
adequacy of representation 
the dissent discusses an issue not raised by the parties regarding adequacy of representation.rule a provides that,in order to certify a class,its proponents must show that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.this rule requires courts to ask whether plaintiff interests are antagonistic to the interest of other members of the class.baffa donaldson,lufkin jenrette sec,cir see also amchem,at.stating that class members must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury to meet the rule a requirement internal quotation marks omitted.the dissent argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to determine which of the two available techniques for measuring damages should be used before it decided to certify the class,because the choice of the correct measure of damages in this action would lead to conflicts among class members and inadequacy of representation.we disagree.
as the dissent points out,and the district court recognized,there are two basic methods that courts use to measure damages in tying cases.one method is the tied product approach,as referred to by the district court.in re visa antitrust,at.under this measure,the damages awarded reflect the difference between the price actually paid for the tied product and the price for which the item could have been purchased on the open market.see von kalinowski et,supra,at describing the tied product approach.the second approach is the package measure,which would award damages only to the extent that the plaintiff overpaid for the combination of the tied and tying products.see x phillip areeda et,antitrust law an analysis of antitrust principles and their application,at asserting the package approach as the proper standard.
the question of whether to apply the tied product or package approach is a complex issue that has long divided the circuits.compare kaiser aluminum chem.sales,avondale shipyards,cir tied product approach,and bell cherokee aviation,cir tied product approach,and northern mcgraw edison,cir tied product approach,with will comprehensive accounting,cir package approach,and kypta mcdonald,cir package approach,and siegel chicken delight,cir package approach.this court has not taken a position on the issue.
the district court discussed these competing lines of cases when it considered whether the alleged was amenable to treatment.see in re visa antitrust,at.defendants advocated the package measure and contended that,under this approach,would no longer be susceptible to proof.id.plaintiffs countered that,under the tied product approach,the process of proving damages would be uniform among the class members.id.the district court did not choose between the two approaches because it found that plaintiffs theory of the case,supported by their expert,rendered such a decision unnecessary.id.the plaintiffs expert opinion asserted,as discussed above,that the price of the tying product the credit cards would not have risen absent the tie.id.the district court found this evidence credible and determined that plaintiffs had made a showing,sufficient to support class certification,that the price of the tied package would decline without the tie.id.as a result,the court concluded that it need not choose between the competing line of cases because plaintiffs have proffered a sufficient theory of injury under either the package or the tied product measure of injury.id.at.
the dissent contends that choosing a damage measure was essential to the disposition of this case and that failure to do so was an abuse of discretion.in the dissent view,the correct measure of damages is the package approach.see post,at.the dissent argues that if the district court had properly decided this issue and had correctly chosen the package approach,certification would have been defeated because the interests of the class members would have conflicted,causing inadequacy of representation.id.because this is a variable proportion tying case,according to the dissent,class members who have transacted predominantly with credit cards would have interests differing from those who have processed mostly debit cards.
there is no need on this interlocutory appeal from class certification for this court to decide which of the two approaches to measuring damages in tying cases is appropriate.by engaging in the following analysis,this court does not endorse the package measure of damages.we consider the question to be an open one in this circuit.we proceed on the assumption that the package measure would apply only to test the dissent contention that,if this approach were adopted,intractable conflicts would emerge within the class.this contention forms the basis of the dissent conclusion that the district court abused its discretion by not choosing a measure of damage before deciding to certify the class.because we conclude that the possible tensions identified by the dissent are not fatal to certification,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to decide the issue at the certification stage.
as an initial matter,we note that the dissent concerns turn largely on the sufficiency of the plaintiffs expert opinion.we have already affirmed the district court finding regarding the sufficiency of that opinion,concluding that it was not fatally flawed.this expert opinion,adequate to support our finding of predominance under rule b,is likewise sufficient to uphold a finding of adequacy of representation under rule a.
the dissent maintains,however,that the very choice to adopt this expert theory is symptomatic of intractable conflicts within the class,causing certification to run afoul of rule a.see post,at.the dissent divides the class into three groups of merchants,based on the merchants proportion of debit card sales to credit card sales.the interests of these three groups,according to the dissent,would be fundamentally at odds if the package measure of damages were applied at trial including these three groups in one class,the dissent argues,compromises the interests of the merchants whose debit card sales predominate over their credit card sales.for these merchants,the task of proving that credit card prices would not be higher without the tie is unnecessary and impedes recovery under other theories that offer better prospects of recovery.id.
the dissent overstates the potential conflict.the three types of merchants discussed by the dissent have much in only as to liability,but as to damages as well.all class members,regardless of their proportion,wish to prove that the debit card fees would be significantly lower without the tie.every member also has an interest in establishing the hypothetical,untied price as low as possible in order to maximize recovery of damages.as for establishing the hypothetical,untied price of credit cards,the tension is not nearly as pronounced as the dissent contends.it may be less vital for merchants with predominantly debit card sales to prove that credit cards would be no more expensive without the tie.it is,however,still in the interest of these merchants to show that credit card fees would not have increased,because any finding to the contrary would likely reduce,though not decimate,their damage awards if the package measure were applied.it would seem to maximize the potential recovery for all three groups to argue,as they do here,that credit card prices would not increase without the tie.other theories may or may not be simpler to prove.even if they are,the merchants would not necessarily choose to concede that credit card prices would increase,and see their potential damage awards diminished.
even if a level of conflict may exist among the three groups,that potential for conflict need not defeat certification.while rule a is designed to ferret out potential conflicts between representatives and other class members,see amchem,at,not every potential disagreement between a representative and the class members will stand in the way of a class suit.newberg conte,supra,at.the conflict that will prevent a plaintiff from meeting the rule a prerequisite must be fundamental,id,at to,and speculative conflict should be disregarded at the class certification stage.id,at see also james moore et,moore federal practice b ii,at ed stating that to find inadequacy of representation most courts hold that the conflict must be more than merely speculative or hypothetical.courts have applied these general principles with regularity in the area of antitrust.see newberg conte,supra,at to collecting antitrust class action cases in which differences among class members were not held to result in inadequacy of representation eisen carlisle jacquelin,cir,vacated on other grounds,d explaining that,in antitrust litigation,the fact that class members may have varying theories as to what constitutes the excessive price will not generally defeat certification where all members will be helped if the rates are found to be excessive.
in the event that the district court does find conflicts arising of the type identified by the dissent,there are a variety of devices available to resolve the problem.we discussed a battery of options in part.of this opinion.of particular relevance here are the possibilities of bifurcating liability and damage trials,decertifying the class after the liability trial,and creating subclasses.the availability of this range of options sufficiently addresses the dissent concerns regarding adequacy of representation.
having determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that common issues of law and fact predominate,that the action will be manageable as a class action,and that choosing a measure of damages was not required before certification,we affirm the district court certification of the class under rule b.
effect of certification 
given these conclusions regarding the soundness of the class under rule,the dissent comments about the possibility that certification will coerce defendants into settlement are largely inapposite.the effect of certification on parties leverage in settlement negotiations is a fact of life for class action litigants.while the sheer size of the class in this case may enhance this effect,this alone can not defeat an otherwise proper certification.the dissent notes that,in our recent decision in sumitomo,we listed as a basis for granting a rule f appeal the fact that the certification order will effectively terminate the litigation.at post,at.we need not decide whether this is such a death knell certification because the other basis for granting a rule f existence of legal questions requiring present.see ante,at.even assuming arguendo that we found this to be a death knell case,under sumitomo that finding would bear only on our decision to grant the interlocutory appeal.now that we have granted the appeal and found the district court certification decision to be thorough,accurate,and not an abuse of discretion,the dissent argument about coercion loses its force.
meanwhile,the dissent underestimates the powerful policy considerations that favor certification,and ignores the exhaustive analysis performed by the district court,carefully applying the rule requirements for class certification.while both the district court and this court have acknowledged that difficulties in managing this large class action may arise,these problems pale in comparison to the burden on the courts that would result from trying the cases individually.see in re visa antitrust,at observing that w ithout class certification,there are likely to be numerous motions to intervene,and millions of small merchants will lose any practical means of obtaining damages for defendants allegedly illegal conduct.
it is not as though the class members were haphazardly thrown together,nor herded or agglomerated as the dissent contends.post,at.they were,after all,allegedly aggrieved by a single policy of the defendants.given the strong commonality of the violation and the harm among the merchants,this is precisely the type of situation for which the class action device is suited.
rule b certification 
certification under rule b is permissible when defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class,making final injunctive or declaratory relief appropriate.b.certification under rule b is not appropriate,however,in cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.b advisory committee notes to amendments.
the district court found that the putative class is certifiable under rule b,in addition to rule b,because t he honor all cards rule is generally applicable to all members of the class,and the request for an injunction ending it is central to the plaintiffs suit.in re visa antitrust,at.the court estimated that the injunctive relief requested would have an economic value of billion,which is significant even when compared to the preliminary monetary damage estimate of billion.id.at.defendants contend that the district court abused its discretion by finding that this action is maintainable under rule b.specifically,relying on a recent line of cases from other circuits,defendants argue that the money damages in this case predominate because they are not merely incidental to the injunctive relief,making class certification under rule b inappropriate.see allison citgo petroleum,cir reh g denied by.lexis m onetary relief predominates in b class actions unless it is incidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief.see also murray auslander,cir adopting reasoning of allison court jefferson ingersoll int l,cir same.
neither the supreme court nor this circuit has delineated the precise circumstances under which a putative class requesting both injunctive and monetary relief can be certified under rule b.see jefferson,at it is an open question in the supreme court whether rule b ever may be used to certify a,class when compensatory or punitive damages are in issue.citing ticor title insurance brown,d,emphasis in original newberg conte,supra,at least settled is the common situation when both injunctive relief and damages are sought for the class,and both forms of relief are important and equally sought.most courts use a predominance test to determine which form of relief is primary,and in light thereof,whether rule b or b applies.we need not delve into this thorny question today,however,because we have already concluded that the district court appropriately certified the class under rule b.see von kalinowski et,supra,once a court has found that a class action is maintainable under any single category of rule b,there is no necessity of showing that it may also be brought under any other.see also jefferson,at rule b begins by saying that an action may be maintained as a class action when the prerequisites of subdivision a and a part of subdivision b have been satisfied it does not say that the class must be certified under the first matching section.emphasis in original.
in any event,the primary concern about certifying a class with significant damages under rule b is the absence of mandatory notice and rights.see lemon int l union of operating eng rs,cir allison,at.because these rights are guaranteed under rule b,pursuant to which this action will now proceed,our inquiry need progress no further.see lemon,at discussing methods for avoiding procedural problems in cases with both injunctive and monetary relief chateau de ville,tams witmark music library,cir noting that when a district court certifies a class under both rule b and b,major problems can arise where different procedural consequences attach depending upon the subsection used.therefore,we need not consider whether the district court erred by certifying the class under rule b in addition to rule b.
conclusion 
for these reasons,we affirm the district court grant of plaintiffs motion for class certification pursuant to rule b.
i respectfully dissent.
in in re sumitomo copper litigation,we recently held that petitioners seeking leave to appeal pursuant to rule f must demonstrate either that the certification order will effectively terminate the litigation and there has been a substantial showing that the district court decisions is questionable,or that the certification order implicates a legal question about which there is a compelling need for immediate resolution.at,cir this approach accords with the advisory committee note to the rule permission to appeal is most likely to be granted when the certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law,or when,as a practical matter,the decision on certification is likely dispositive of the litigation.advisory committee note.
appellants here have made a more than sufficient showing under sumitomo a that the certification order tends to terminate the litigation by a coercive settlement and b that two crucial rulings embedded in the district court otherwise thorough opinion are questionable,to say the least.
a rule f was adopted in part to alleviate the danger that an erroneous order granting certification may force a defendant to settle rather than incur the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of ruinous liability.advisory committee note.one sound basis for granting jurisdiction under rule f is thus the circumstance that the class certification places inordinate or hydraulic pressure on defendants to settle,avoiding the risk,however small,of potentially ruinous liability.newton merrill lynch,cir.no doubt,true death knell cases are few and a reviewing court must be wary lest the mind hear a bell that is not tolling.blair equifax check,cir.but in this which the aggregated and trebled claims of the four million class members are alleged to top carillon is in full peal.even a defendant who is innocent and holy may rationally choose to pay a few hundred million dollars in settlement of a class action rather than run the risk of ruinous liability.as the district court observed without the slightest overstatement,the enormous financial risks faced by the defendants are obviously increased drastically by certification of the class.in re visa antitrust,at.the certification order in this case may therefore coerce settlement.
b the district court decision is rendered questionable by two errors of law that render grant of the certification an abuse of discretion.
first,the district court inadequately considered whether the class action can be manageably tried and has certified the four million member class without identifying a practical means for calculating the extent of each merchant damages.see abrams interco,cir friendly,quoting ii areeda turner,antitrust law,at.the majority opinion draws comfort from the conditional nature of the certification and the district court retained power to modify it.but this is cold comfort for the defendants the brutally coercive effect of the certification can not be stayed.
second,the district court ruled on certification without deciding a threshold question of law that determines whether the class members interests will be aligned and therefore whether litigation by representative is appropriate.courts are split on whether a tying plaintiff injury must be measured as i believe by how much the tie increased the combined cost of buying both the tying and the tied products.if that is the correct measure,there can be no class here because the putative members used the tying and tied products in different proportions,and therefore have conflicting interests when it comes to how the fact and extent of any injuries are to be proven.
because of these two legal errors,and because the majority opinion is so deferential that this appeal is no check at all on the coercion that rule f is designed to curb,i can not join the majority opinion.
certification prior to identification of a practical means for trying four million claims 
in ruling on certification,a court is required to consider the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.fed.civ.pro.b d.and unless a court is confronted with a request for a class certification,the court must specifically inquire whether the case,if tried,would present intractable management problems.amchem prods.windsor,d emphasis added noting that the inquiry is unnecessary as to classes,because the proposal is that there be no trial citing fed.civ.pro.b d.for that reason,judge friendly instructed that if an antitrust class numbers in the thousands or millions,a court may not grant certification until it can devise a practical means for trying the action abrams,at quoting ii areeda turner,supra,at.
any case of this size and numerosity is beset by potentially intractable problems of manageability.the crucial,unresolved difficulty in this litigation concerns individualized proof of damages,an issue that can be critical in determining whether a class of antitrust claimants should be certified.manual for complex litigation,at ed see windham american brands,cir en banc holding that in determining the manageability of a proposed antitrust class action,the district court must consider proof of damages.specifically,a defense has been interposed that if litigated would require findings as to the extent of the damages recoverable by each of the four million members of the putative class 
the law is settled that affirmative defenses should be considered in making class certification decisions.waste mgmt.holdings mowbray,cir see also majority op.at,a court must examine defenses in determining whether a putative class meets the requirements of rule b emphasis added castano american tobacco,cir going beyond the pleadings is necessary,as a court must understand inter alia defenses in order to make a meaningful determination of the certification issues.broussard meineke discount muffler shops,cir certification is erroneous when affirmative defenses may depend on facts peculiar to each plaintiff case citation omitted.and there is good reason for considering the manageability of defenses in this case even if each merchant claim took no more than a half a day to sort out,the damages phase of trial would last as long as the whole course of western civilization from ur.
the asserted the district judge acknowledged may have force is that the merchants had a duty to mitigate their losses by encouraging at least some of their customers to use forms of payment other than debit.in re visa antitrust,at.we have repeatedly held that mitigation is a viable theory in antitrust actions.see litton systems v.at t,cir sherman act borger yamaha int l,cir sherman act see generally neil hamilton virginia cone,mitigation of antitrust damages,or.enforcement of the mitigation duty may be even more critical in antitrust cases than in cases sounding in contract or tort because an antitrust plaintiff seeking treble damages can profit by avoiding mitigation of loss.see hamilton cone,supra at noting the perverse impact of trebling on a plaintiff incentive to minimize damage.
just as we assume for purposes of class certification that the illegality of the tie is litigable,we must assume that defendants will be entitled to try their mitigation defense.the rule against decisions on the merits is and serves neutrally to avoid the risk that a court tentative findings,made in the absence of established safeguards,may color the subsequent proceedings.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.
the majority recites the principle that a court must examine defenses in determining whether a putative class meets the requirements of rule b,but finds no abuse of discretion because the district court specifically recognized its ability to modify its class certification order,sever liability and damages,or even decertify the class if such an action ultimately became necessary.majority op.at,emphasis added citing in re visa antitrust,at citing fed.civ.pro.c.
this approach reflects a serious misinterpretation of rule c,which permits courts to enter a conditional certification and then alter or amend the certification as the case proceeds.but as other circuits have repeatedly explained,individual questions must be resolved before a class is certified,even if certification is conditional.in re hotel.charges,cir emphasis added accord windham american brands,cir en banc.conditional certification therefore is emphatically not an expedient by which a court may avoid deciding whether,at that time,the requirements of the rule have been substantially met.castano american tobacco,cir quoting in re hotel.charges,at accord in re american med,cir see manual for complex litigation,at although.c permits entry of a conditional class determination order and amendment before the decision on the merits,that procedure should not be used to defer a final class ruling.emphasis added.the purpose of conditional certification is,rather,to preserve the court power to revoke certification in those cases wherein the magnitude or complexity of the litigation may eventually reveal problems not theretofore apparent.castano,at emphasis added quoting in re hotel.charges,at.
the manageability problem in this case has been apparent from the outset and is apparent right now.the record developed so far reveals that mastercard encouraged merchants to channel customers to the company debit alternative,which it explained was more secure and therefore less expensive.and as plaintiffs conceded in the district court,some merchants did adopt programs that so channeled an appreciable number of debit transactions,thus reducing the amount of damages that those class members could collect from this suit.see plaintiffs reply memorandum of law in support in of plaintiffs motion for class certification at.the mitigation issues are whether it is reasonable to expect other class members to have adopted similar programs,and to what extent would such programs have achieved mitigation for such class members.the district judge recognition that the defense may have force is 
it makes no sense to provide individualized notice to millions of merchants before the court has devised a practical means for trying the issues presented.see fed.civ.pro.c requiring individual notice to all rule b damages class members who can be identified through reasonable effort.certification that is premature does no favor to the millions of absent class members because u ndesirable consequences may follow if the class is later decertified or redefined.manual for complex litigation,at.class members who are eliminated from the litigation as a result of decertification or reduction in the size of a class may be confused at best or prejudiced at worst.id.even if relief is eventually obtained for a pared down class,those who were initially in the larger class may attempt to reverse the decision that excluded them from the class such a reversal may be particularly troublesome if the relief was obtained by settlement.id.
the majority opinion view of conditional certification also seriously impairs our ability to conduct a meaningful interlocutory review under rule f.conditional certification is not a hedge against present error.our power of interlocutory review was conferred for a case such as this,where scores of billions of dollars are thought to be at stake and no procedure has been conceived for a fair merits adjudication.a purpose of our interlocutory look is to assure that defendants are not coerced into settlement by an improvident certification,conditional or otherwise.but if district courts can simply postpone consideration of difficult issues by making certification conditional as all certifications tend to be anyway,it is unlikely that we would ever vacate such an order.at a minimum,the approach in the majority opinion will lead unnecessarily to multiple requests for appellate intervention in class actions one after the conditional certification,and others as the district judge eventually confronts issues that were apparent before conditional certification was given.
finally,unless there is a practical means of trying the case,certification leads to unfairness and injustice if the district court later finds that a trial is unmanageable,the named plaintiffs and their counsel lose nothing,but in the meantime they have in hand the means to extract a favorable settlement of what may be weak claims.see eisen carlisle jacquelin,d explaining that a representative plaintiff should not be allowed to secure the benefits of a class action without first satisfying the requirements for it.once a certification order is issued,the parties can be expected to rely on it and engage in settlement discussions on the assumption that in the normal course of events it will not be altered except for good cause.manual for complex litigation,at.judge friendly,who was not given to hyperbole,called settlements induced by a small probability of an immense judgment in a class action blackmail settlements.in re rorer,cir posner,quoting henry friendly,federal jurisdiction a general view accord rutstein avis,cir referring to the blackmail value of a class certification that can aid the plaintiffs in coercing the defendant into a settlement.unfortunately,the majority excessive deference facilitates such an injustice.szabo bridgeport machines,cir holding that a prime occasion for rule f appellate review is when class certification puts a decision to defendant managers and may induce a substantial settlement even if the plaintiffs position is weak.
finally,would not doom this litigation this is not a case in which the named plaintiffs claims are far smaller than the costs of litigation.f advisory committee note.for instance,if named plaintiff wal mart stores processed even of its sales with credit and debit,and if it established an average percent overcharge on those transactions,its claim would reach a quarter billion dollars with trebling and before attorneys fees for alone.
conflicts among class members in proving the fact and extent of injury 
certification of this class is untenable for another,entirely independent reason under the correct measure of injury in a tying case,the class members face irreconcilable conflicts in proving the fact and extent of any injury caused by the tie.rule a therefore prohibits litigation by representative because no representative can adequately protect the interests of the millions of absent class members.see general.falcon,d rule a tests whether the named plaintiff claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.
there is little dispute that plaintiffs can use common proof to litigate the threshold question as to whether there is an illegal tie consequently,the principal issue for consideration by the district court in weighing certification was whether the plaintiffs also could prove that the allegedly illegal tie caused the class injury in fact the gravamen of a action.in re visa antitrust,at e ven an antitrust plaintiff who has successfully proven illegal conduct on the part of the defendant must also show that it was injured in fact by the illegality.kypta mcdonald,cir.the injury in fact element is satisfied by proof of some damage flowing from the defendant conduct,see zenith radio hazeltine research,d under the rules enabling act,this requirement applies to class actions as well as to litigation by named parties only.see alabama blue bird body,cir bogosian gulf oil,cir.plaintiffs therefore concede that their class of four million merchants can not be certified unless plaintiffs rely on a theory that posits at least some injury to every class member.however,the district court avoided or has delayed deciding how injury in fact would be measured.in this litigation,that is a vexed question.
in many tying cases,measuring the impact of the tie is fairly mechanical because the buyers have used the two products in fixed proportions.see,united states microsoft,one computer operating system one internet web browser town sound and custom tops chrysler motors,cir en banc one car one automobile sound system.but the question is troublesome here,and should have been considered in the context of class certification,because these plaintiffs have used the credit cards the tying product and debit cards the tied product in different proportions fine jewelers,for example,would rarely be presented with an debit card.see in re visa antitrust,at.the varying proportions of use create intractable conflicts among the four million merchants agglomerated as a class by the district court.
in my view the court failure to decide how injury in fact would be measured was an error of law and thus an abuse of discretion the correct measure of injury is the extent to which a merchant would have paid less for the package of the tying and tied products in the absence of the tie and plaintiffs who use tied and tying products in varying proportions have conflicting interests in how the class goes about proving the fact that they would have paid less for their particular package,as well as in showing the extent of any disparity.since rule a requires that members of a class possess the same interest and suffer the same injury,class certification is not an option in this case.amchem prods.windsor,d.
a.the measure of injury applied in the district court 
the need to show injury to all class members has been problematic for plaintiffs from the outset,and their theory of injury has mutated as class counsel has tried gamely to fix the problem.the second amended class action complaint alleged that absent the tie,virtually all members of the putative class would have refused the debit cards and processed the same transactions using cash,checks,debit,or other payment forms.in re visa antitrust,at emphasis added.in the course of briefing the class certification motion,however,defendants demonstrated that there could be no injury under that scenario because inter alia even some named plaintiffs have testified that they would have continued to accept debit cards at current prices even absent the tie.id.
plaintiffs then sponsored an expert affidavit positing that all plaintiffs would have continued to accept debit cards even absent the tie,but that the defendants would have charged a lower fee for them.see id.specifically,the expert articulated the following theory of injury in fact in the,untied world,visa and mastercard would have cut their interchange fees in order to preserve universal acceptance.in re visa antitrust,at.that move,according to the expert,would have led merchants to accept the cards once again.id.this theory thus posited injury resulting from every single class member overpaying for debit cards as a direct result of the tie.id.plaintiffs supported their argument by pointing to tying cases that measure injury solely by the inflated price paid for the tied product.see,bell cherokee aviation,cir t he measure of damages is the difference between the price actually paid for the tied product and the price at which the product could have been obtained on the open market.but see x phillip areeda et,antitrust law,at calling the tied product measure of injury quite wrong.
defendants responded that the tied product overcharge measure of injury is flawed because it ignores what would happen to the price of the tying product in the untied world.as a matter of elementary economic theory,defendants argued that a seller who has market power in the tying product and overcharges on the tied product will do two things if the tie is broken decrease the price of the tied product and increase the price of the tying product.id.at.and since a plaintiff can not show injury in fact if his loss from the defendant violation is offset by his gain in the very transaction he attacks,ii phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed,the defendants contended that the tying product price had to be considered.several authorities agree that injury must be measured by reference to the package price of the two products.see,kypta mcdonald,cir i njury resulting from a must be shown by establishing that payments for both the tied and tying products exceeded their combined fair market value.accord ii areeda hovenkamp,supra,at approving this measure of injury.the issue is open in this circuit.see in re visa antitrust,at.
if credit card fees would have been higher in the untied world,certification would depend as the district court fully recognized on which measure of injury is adopted because under the package measure 
the fact of injury would no t be susceptible to proof.specifically,merchants with relatively high amounts of credit card transactions vis a vis debit card transactions,jewelry stores would have suffered little or no injury from the tie indeed,they would have benefitted from it to the extent it kept credit card interchange fees down.
the district court did not decide which measure of injury applies,however,because in its view the question was obviated by a new proffer in plaintiffs expert reply declaration.according to plaintiff new third conception of the untied world,defendants would have lowered debit fees but would not have raised the credit card fees.id.at emphasis added.the district court deemed this a sufficient theory of injury under either the package or the tied product measure of injury because under this theory even merchants with relatively high credit card volume would have been injured.id.at.accordingly,the district court saw no need to choose between the competing line s of cases.id.
the district court refusal to decide how injury in fact would be measured was an error of law and thus an abuse of discretion.see castano american tobacco,cir in order to make the findings required to certify a class action under rule b one must initially identify the substantive law issues that will control the outcome of the litigation.the decision was critical to the class certification motion,and involved a pure question of law no purpose was served by a delay pending future factual development.
if the court had decided this question,and decided correctly that injury is measured by the package price rather than by the price of the tied product alone,see part below,it would have encountered a subtle problem,unique to variable proportion tying cases,that is fatal to certification,see part below.
b.the correct measure of injury 
i would hold that the correct measure of injury in fact is the package price of the tying and tied products.the statutory text compels this rule.the injury in fact requirement is derived from of the clayton act,which provides a damages cause of action only to plaintiffs who have been injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation.see truett payne chrysler motors,d ii areeda hovenkamp,supra,at.awarding damages to an uninjured plaintiff is inconsistent with the statutory requirement.ii areeda hovenkamp,supra,at.accordingly,the tied buyer is injured in fact only when he is forced to pay prices for the sum of the tying and tied products.x areeda et,supra,at citation omitted.
the price of the tying product must be taken into account because it usually does rise if the tie is broken.a rational person can not be made to pay more for a package of two products than he would pay for the two products separately.so if a tie causes the buyer to pay more than the market price for the tied product,the buyer is most likely paying less than the price that the seller could profitably charge for the tying product if sold separately.otherwise,the buyer would avoid the tie and if somehow a plaintiff actually shows that decoupling would cause the tying product price to fall,he should be entitled to recover that much more.
based on the text of and these economic principles,an increasing number of courts have correctly held that the purchaser has not been injured in fact,and thus can not recover damages,unless he shows that the combined payment for both tying and tied products exceeds their combined fair market value.ii areeda hovenkamp,supra,at quoting kypta mcdonald,cir a determination of the value of the tied products alone would not indicate whether the plaintiff indeed suffered any net economic harm,since a lower price might conceivably have been exacted by the seller for the tying product.see also will comprehensive accounting,cir u nless the plaintiff shows that the package price was elevated the suit must be dismissed without further ado.siegel chicken delight,cir to ascertain whether an unlawful arrangement for the sale of products has caused injury to the purchaser,the cost or value of the products involved,free from the unlawful arrangement,must first be ascertained.the competing line of cases,which measure injury by the price of the tied product alone,are,in professor areeda phrase,quite wrong.x areeda,et,supra,at.
c.the package measure of injury applied to variable proportion tying cases 
if injury were measured erroneously by reference to the tied product alone,the interests of the class members would be aligned.every class member processed at least some debit transactions,so every class member would want the class representatives to prove that in the absence of the tie,the price of the tied product would have been as low as economic theory could support.the fact that the class members happened to process credit cards and debit cards in varying proportions would be irrelevant.indeed,as compared to the package measure or to a theory of injury,a claim of overcharge on the tied product is the most likely prospect for common treatment of the fact of damage.john matheson,class action tying cases a framework for certification decisions,nw,emphasis added.
however,under the package measure described in part above,the variation among merchants of the proportion of sales using credit cards versus debit cards has great bearing on proof of common injury.see matheson,supra at herbert hovenkamp,tying arrangements and class actions,vand,concluding that buyers subject to variable proportion s can not prove injury in fact on a basis,and suggesting as an alternative attack the use of offensive collateral estoppel under parklane hosiery shore,d emphasis added.to show injury,the class representatives will have to establish what both interchange fees would have been in the,untied therein lies the conflict.
any given set of credit and debit fees that class counsel might seek to prove would have different anticipated impacts i on the merchant whose sales predominate,ii on the merchant whose and sales are in parity,iii on the merchant whose sales on each merchant along the continuum.in proving injury and damages,any given economic assumption or analysis will as the case may be enhance,impair or preclude the antitrust claim of a merchant depending on that merchant location along the continuum.
like other class members,the merchant whose sales predominate benefits by showing that the debit charge would have been much lower but,unlike other class members,the merchant whose sales predominate can still achieve a substantial recovery even if the price of credit would have risen by an even greater amount.therefore,this merchant is not compelled to make the elusive and seldom attempted proof that the sum of tying and tied product prices would have been lower absent the tie.in re visa antitrust,at quoting x areeda et,supra,at.i illustrate the point with a numerical example in the margin 
in contrast,the merchant whose and sales are in parity would get nothing if decoupling caused credit charges to rise by as much as debit prices fell.to establish injury in fact,this merchant would be compelled to undertake the elusive and seldom attempted proof that the sum of the untied prices would have been lower.as to the extent of injury,he would be indifferent to the relative prices of credit and debit and would do best by proving that the combination would have been as low as possible 
the merchant whose sales predominate faces the toughest constraints.for this merchant,it is necessary but insufficient to make the elusive and seldom attempted proof that the sum of the prices would have been lower.he would need to argue also that decoupling would cause the debit price to fall without causing any appreciable rise in the credit price,because even a minuscule rise in the credit price would neutralize a reduction even a gross reduction in the debit price.this is a tough row to hoe this is plaintiff third theory,the one first advanced in the reply affidavit of plaintiffs expert.
the three merchants at these three points on the continuum thus have different cases their anticipated recoveries depend on and are maximized by different theories and economic assumptions those theories and assumptions are incompatible or at best incoherent when advanced at once there are winners and losers within the class and the distribution of these competing interests creates a problem that can not be resolved by subclass representatives even if one had a thousand of them.see amchem prods.windsor,d members of a class must possess the same interest and suffer the same injury general.falcon,d.as far as i can see,the only unified interests served by herding these competing claims into one class are the interests served by settlement i the interest of class counsel in fees,and ii the interest of defendants perhaps later in the litigation in a bundled group of all possible claimants who can be precluded by a single payment.
certification does no servic
