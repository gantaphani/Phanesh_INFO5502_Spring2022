the federal trade commission ftc has broad powers under the ftc act to prevent businesses from engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.this case arises from a by neovi data corporation dba,productivity systems dba,james danforth,and thomas villwock together qchex that created and delivered unverified checks at the direction of registered users.during its run,fraudsters and con artists extensively abused the website.
we examine here the reach of of the act,which empowers the ftc to prevent the use of unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce a.the key issue on appeal is whether qchex is liable for causing substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by countervailing benefits.n.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the ftc,finding that qchex profound lack of diligence,coupled with the affirmative acts of creating and delivering hundreds of thousands of unverified of which were from accounts later frozen for liability under the act.qchex was ordered to disgorge in revenue and permanently enjoined from operating any similar business without taking appropriate,specified measures to protect consumers.we affirm.
background 
from to,qchex marketed a series of software programs on a website called.the software allowed registered users to create and send checks by post or email.in october,the website was shut down.the governing corporation,neovi filed for chapter bankruptcy a year later in october 
to register for a qchex account,users were prompted to enter a name and email address,and then to create a password.the account could be activated simply by clicking on a link that qchex sent to the email address provided.setup was completed after qchex received pertinent information about the user bank account,such as the routing and account numbers.registered users could submit a request on the website that a check drawn from their account be created and delivered to a third party.to achieve this end,users needed only to enter the name of a payee,the check amount,and the payee email or mailing address,depending on the preferred method of delivery.then converted the information into a negotiable instrument that,when printed,conformed to banking regulations.the instrument was designed to be negotiable without the user signature,but users could choose to upload their signatures if they so desired.
if the user chose to send the check electronically,the payee would receive email instructions to sign up for an account on.once registered,the payee could print the check,and a confirmation email would be sent to the payor.if the user chose to send the check by post,it would be printed at a print service center operated in the main by employees of productivity systems,a california corporation that produced the check software,ink,and paper that was marketed by neovi on the qchex website employees mailed the checks to the payees.
the qchex system was highly vulnerable to con artists and fraudsters.because the information necessary to set up an account was relatively public and easy to come by,it was a simple matter for unscrupulous opportunists to obtain identity information and draw checks from accounts that were not their own.indeed,over a period,qchex froze over accounts for fraud.those accounts spawned nearly checks,supplied over bank account numbers,and were the source of checks totaling more than amount more than half of the total drawn during that time.
as one would expect,qchex received hundreds of letters and thousands of telephone calls from consumers,banks,and law enforcement agencies complaining about funds drawn from accounts without authorization.victims included not only individuals and businesses,but also large institutions and agencies like the university of chicago,goldman sachs,the federal communications commission,and,ironically,the ftc itself.
qchex contends that it was attuned to the risk of fraud from the outset and acted responsibly to curtail it.before,qchex argues that it took multiple fraud reduction measures,pointing specifically to the qchex monitor system that enabled employees to spot irregular activity like the presence of large volumes of checks.internet protocol addresses associated with fraudulent transactions were blacklisted and qchex placed warnings on the checks alerting the payees that it could not verify whether the check was duly authorized by the payors.on a basis,qchex froze suspicious accounts.finally,qchex encrypted the check data it transmitted over the internet and used barcoding to obscure account data on the face of the checks it issued.
none of these measures proved successful.the qchex monitor was underutilized and does not appear to have been employed in any focused way to target or unearth fraud.the rest of the measures were either place after fraud had already unresponsive to the chief concern that checks were being drawn against unauthorized accounts.
in,after meeting with the american banking association and the federal deposit insurance corporation,qchex implemented a program called the qchex validation system qvs.to verify that a user account was legitimate,qchex made a single,nominal deposit of somewhere between three and twenty cents in the account the user provided.the user was required to check the account to determine the deposit value.qchex declined to deliver checks from a provided account unless the user was first able to accurately report the value of the.after three failed attempts,the qchex account would be frozen.
although it was a step in the right direction,qvs had a number of loopholes that rendered it ineffective.for example,it only applied to accounts that were newly activated.users who had balances established before the new security system was adopted were still able to send checks by mail.even for new users the system was easy to game.because qvs validated just one bank account per registered user,as long as a user had legitimate access to one bank account,other be used without verification through qvs.significantly,the new system did not apply to emailed checks at all.whatever its failings,the qvs system was short lived.for reasons that are unclear,the payment processor that enabled qchex to run the system terminated its contract in april.
unfair practices under of the ftcact 
under of the ftc act,an unfair practice or act is one that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.n.
the district court found that qchex is liable for the u nfair creation and delivery of unverified checks.qchex urges that this charge is both legally and literally impossible.it claims that only users can create checks because without user input nothing,and certainly not a check,could be created or delivered.this semantic argument is meant to encompass not only the causation requirement,but also qchex claim that it was not given adequate notice of the charges.
qchex challenge to causation is best captured in its statement that it did not obtain,input or direct the delivery of consumer information nor facilitate the theft.this spin ignores the fact that qchex created and controlled a system that facilitated fraud and that the company was on notice as to the high fraud rate.qchex approach would immunize a website operator that turned a blind eye to fraudulent business made possible only through the operator software.even if the creation of the checks was impossible without user input,that does not mean qchex did not create the checks that it later delivered.
by qchex logic,a publishing house can not be said to create and distribute books,because it is impossible to print books without content provided by an author.indeed,the creation and distribution of most any good is subject to a host of sequential steps.some of those steps involve the contribution of independent causal agents,but those contributions do not magically erase the role of the aggregator and distributor of the goods.this reality becomes obvious if we flip the counterfactual.without the qchex software and the workforce,users would not be able to create and deliver checks.therefore,by qchex lights,users can not be said to create and deliver checks either.this circular logic leads to the absurd result that although checks have been created and delivered,no one is doing the creating or the delivering.
at most,qchex argument shows that qchex and the users each contributed to the creation and delivery of the checks.but,even granting this characterization,qchex is not discharged from liability under the ftc single violation of the act may have more than one perpetrator.see,ftc bay area bus.council,cir holding multiple defendants liable under of ftc act.
to support its argument that the ftc showing of causation was insufficient,qchex urges us to seek interpretive guidance from several california state cases that were decided under california business professions code little ftc act.we decline the invitation.while it is common practice for states with consumer protection statutes modeled on the ftc act to rely on federal authority when interpreting those statutes,the reverse is not the case.as the ftc points out,given the abundance of state laws on which such interpretations could be based,this practice would likely result in a sea of inconsistent rulings.see orkin exterminating,ftc,cir noting that there is nothing constraining the ftc to follow judicial interpretations of state statutes in construing the agency section authority.
qchex also criticizes the district court reliance on two unpublished district court cases.although not precedential,these cases are instructive insofar as they illustrate the role of a facilitator under the ftc act.
in ftc windward marketing,the court found multiple defendants liable for a magazine telemarketing scheme in which defendants obtained victims banking information over the phone and illegitimately debited their accounts for magazine subscriptions they did not realize they were purchasing.defendant wholesale capital corporation wholesale maintained several bank accounts used to collect on victims invoices.see no,wl,at.the court noted that of the drafts were returned unauthorized and that,at the very least,wholesale was on notice of a high probability of fraud unfairness id.at.
although wholesale did not itself make any misrepresentations or initiate the fraudulent scheme,the court found wholesale liable under the ftc act because it facilitated and provided substantial assistance to a deceptive scheme,resulting in substantial injury to consumers.id.at.this conduct was enough to find wholesale primarily opposed to liable as an the act.id.
similarly,in ftc accusearch,accusearch was held liable for maintaining a website that sold the gps locations of individual cell phones and other confidential,personal information,even though it did not itself illegally obtain the information,wl,at,noting that e ach time the defendants placed an order for phone records,they caused others to use false pretenses and other fraudulent means to obtain confidential consumer phone records.
these cases illustrate that businesses can cause direct consumer harm as contemplated by the ftc act in a variety of ways.in assessing that harm,we look of course to the deceptive nature of the practice,but the absence of deceit is not dispositive.nor is actual knowledge of the harm a requirement under the act.courts have long held that consumers are injured for purposes of the act not solely through the machinations of those with ill intentions,but also through the actions of those whose practices facilitate,or contribute to,ill intentioned schemes if the injury was a predictable consequence of those actions.see ftc winsted hosiery,holding that t he honest manufacturer business may suffer,not merely through a competitor deceiving his direct customer,the retailer,but also through the competitor putting into the hands of the retailer an unlawful instrument ftc keppel,holding candy retailer liable for unfair practices although manufacturer was responsible for the element of chance that made the practices unfair regina ftc,cir explaining that w ith respect to those instances where petitioner did not contribute to the misleading act,it is settled that o ne who places in the hands of another a means of consummating a fraud or competing unfairly in violation of the federal trade commission act is himself guilty of a violation of the act quotation marks and citations omitted.
qchex had reason to believe that a vast number of checks were being drawn on unauthorized that it legitimized in the eyes of consumers.aside from the prodigious number of complaints qchex received,its president testified that qchex expected the site would be used for fraudulent purposes from the beginning.qchex nonetheless continued to create and deliver checks without proper verification.by doing so it engaged in a practice that facilitated and provided substantial assistance to a multitude of deceptive schemes.
to be clear,none of this is to say that qchex is liable under a theory of aiding and abetting.qchex engaged in behavior that was,itself,injurious to consumers.qchex business practices might have served to assist others in illicit or deceptive schemes,but the liability under the ftc act that attaches to qchex is not mediated by the actions of those third parties.qchex caused harm through its own this case creating and delivering unverified thus of the ftc act easily extends to its conduct 
finally,as to its notice argument,qchex contends that the ftc complaint must be read as alleging that qchex originated checks in the sense that it,not the users,directed the unauthorized withdrawal of funds out of consumer accounts.this allegation does not square with a plain reading of the complaint.as the district court points out,qchex created the checks in the sense that it physically brought them into provided the means to do made them appear legitimate and credible in the eyes of consumers.
substantial injury 
the ftc met its burden of establishing substantial injury there is no triable issue of fact with respect to this issue.the district court based its findings on record facts that it pulled from various sources,including qchex database,qchex declarations,and consumer complaints.qchex claim that the district court based its findings on speculation,not evidence,is without support.
the district court acknowledged that the number of fraudulent items created could not be definitively quantified,but it also said that more than half the total value of all the checks drawn with the help of qchex came from accounts later frozen for fraud.that concrete and quantifiable finding is sufficient to show substantial harm because it establishes that consumers were injured by a practice for which they did not bargain.see windward marketing,wl at citing orkin exterminating,at.an act or practice can cause substantial injury by doing a small harm to a large number of people,or if it raises a significant risk of concrete harm.am.fin.servs.ass ftc,quotation marks and citations omitted cert.denied.
finally,in an effort to skirt liability,qchex observes that because the victims of fraud already had their banking information compromised,they would have had to spend time protecting their accounts whether or not the qchex system was instrumental in their loss.if qchex caused or helped to cause substantial injury to consumers,it is no defense to say that consumers nonetheless would have been harmed by someone else.in any case,it is not clear that the fraudsters would have had the means to take advantage of the victims information without the aid of the qchex software.indeed,some of the frauds stemming from the qchex system involved victims whose account information was not compromised 
reasonable avoidability 
in determining whether consumers injuries were reasonably avoidable,courts look to whether the consumers had a free and informed choice.see am.fin.servs.ass n,at.qchex argues that there are triable issues of fact as to whether consumers could reasonably have avoided their alleged injuries.although the district court addressed consumers ability to avoid injury before it occurred,qchex argues that the court did not address the co
