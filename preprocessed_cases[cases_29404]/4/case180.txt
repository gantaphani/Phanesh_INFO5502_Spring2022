opinion of the court 
in this antitrust action,we address allegations of unlawful monopolization and tying in the aftermarket for replacement hot air balloon fabric.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,finding no triable issue of monopoly power in the relevant product market.we will affirm.
harrison aire,a hot air balloon ride operator,alleges antitrust violations by raven industries and its subsidiary,aerostar international.consistent with our standard of review on summary judgment,we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the party,appellant harrison aire.
terry harrison,the sole owner and proprietor of harrison aire,is an pilot and aircraft mechanic.after a year career at eastern airlines,he retired in to launch the harrison aire enterprise from an airstrip in central new jersey.the company owns and operates several hot air balloons which it charters for recreational day trips over the new jersey countryside.since the mid,the business has suffered problems.harrison aire blames its losses,in part,on the prohibitive expense of replacement balloon fabric,which it contends is a result of monopolization of the relevant balloon fabric aftermarket.
raven industries is a diversified manufacturing company based in sioux falls,south dakota.from the through,it manufactured hot air balloons and replacement balloon fabric.in,raven formed aerostar international as a subsidiary to take over its balloon business.aerostar international manufactures and sells hot air balloons in a market of at least five competitors and also produces and sells replacement balloon fabric.
hot air balloons are regulated from cradle to grave by the federal aviation administration.the faa certifies balloon design and manufacturing standards,requires the manufacturer to provide a maintenance manual along with its aircraft,id,reviews the content of the manual,id,and certifies replacement part designs for airworthiness,id.the faa maintenance manual and replacement part regulations bear on this appeal.
balloon manufacturers are required to provide their customers with a balloon maintenance manual,known as an ica instructions for continued airworthiness,which sets forth recommended and required maintenance procedures.the manual is in two parts.the first,known as the faa accepted section,establishes but not protocols.the second,known as the airworthiness limitation section,establishes faa requirements affecting flight safety.
regulations also govern the manufacture and sale of replacement balloon parts,including replacement fabric.all replacement parts must be of such a quality that the repaired balloon is at least equal to its original or properly altered condition.b.the faa authorizes manufacturers to sell aftermarket parts,including replacement fabric,provided they first obtain faa certification that the product is equal to or better than the original.id.
replacement fabric extends the service life of a hot air balloon.the top half of the balloon envelope the material encapsulating the hot to deteriorate more rapidly than the bottom half.by replacing fabric after to hours of use,balloon owners are able to extend the aircraft service life for an additional to hours.generally,it is more economical to replace fabric in this manner than to purchase an entirely new envelope.harrison aire followed this practice in maintaining its fleet of balloons.
harrison aire purchased its first raven balloon in.the parties dispute over fabric replacement began shortly thereafter.according to terry harrison,raven advised him that he could not purchase replacement fabric from other manufacturers because installation of fabric would render the balloon unairworthy.in,raven revised its balloon maintenance manuals to make this policy explicit,warning raven balloon owners that only fabric which has been tested and approved according to raven factory standards may be used for repair of raven envelopes.failure to comply with this requirement constitutes a departure from type design and renders the balloon unairworthy.this language appeared in the,rather than the,section of raven maintenance manuals.reading the manual in the light most favorable to harrison aire,it warned that only fabric should be used in raven balloons.
terry harrison repeatedly complained to raven,believing its insertion of the warning into the balloon manual transformed the fabric policy into an faa requirement that legally barred him from obtaining cheaper fabric elsewhere.on several occasions between and,harrison confronted raven representatives about the manual language,but was told that no other aftermarket product was equal to or better than raven fabric,and that only raven fabric was consistent with airworthiness standards.harrison understood this as a representation that he was required to purchase raven fabric in order to comply with the faa equal to or better standard for replacement parts.harrison aire contends that from to,raven misled the company into believing the purchase of raven fabric was mandated by law,when in fact it was merely recommended by the manufacturer.
in february,raven industries formed aerostar international to take over its hot air balloon business.aerostar continued raven balloon operation essentially uninterrupted,and became the new focus of harrison aire campaign to purchase fabric from sources.shortly after aerostar was incorporated,harrison registered several complaints with aerostar about being forced to use fabric.nevertheless,despite its understanding that aerostar balloons required aerostar replacement fabric,harrison aire purchased a big ride aerostar balloon in that is the subject of this litigation.
by,harrison aire big ride aerostar balloon required a major fabric replacement.by this time,two other manufacturers had received faa approval to produce aftermarket fabric for aerostar balloons.see authorizing the manufacture of replacement balloon parts upon receipt of a parts manufacturer approval from the faa.harrison investigated one of the approved sellers,custom nine designs,but decided against purchasing their fabric because of concerns that it lacked quality.harrison never contacted the other approved supplier,head balloons.viewing fabric as its only option and as prohibitively expensive,harrison aire retired the big ride balloon in rather than repairing it.
harrison eventually realized that installation of fabric was legally permissible.in july,following an administrative proceeding between the faa and a balloon repair service,an administrative law judge concluded the fabric warning found in aerostar maintenance manual was not legally binding.in re braden balloons aloft,faa no.july.harrison contends the braden decision provided him notice,for the first time,that his company was not required to purchase fabric.
in march,harrison aire filed suit in federal court,alleging,inter alia,antitrust injury arising from monopolization of the aftermarket for replacement aerostar balloon fabric and from the unlawful tying of fabric to aerostar balloons.but for allegedly misleading and exclusionary aftermarket fabric policy,harrison aire contends that its big ride balloon would have been repaired in and still operational.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants,holding they lacked sufficient market power in the relevant product market.harrison aire,aerostar int l,d

significantly,however,antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences that can be drawn from ambiguous evidence.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d see also monsanto serv,d.to avoid deterring behavior,certain inferences may not be drawn from circumstantial evidence in an antitrust case.in re flat glass antitrust,at quoting intervest,bloomberg,cir.

we begin with harrison aire monopolization claim.under section of the sherman act,monopolization consists of the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.united states grinnell,d see also lepage,cir en banc reviewing section case law and explaining the willful acquisition or maintenance element.
monopoly power is defined as the power to control prices or exclude competition.united states du pont de nemours.more precisely,it is the power to charge a price higher than the competitive price without inducing so rapid and great an expansion of output from competing firms as to make the supracompetitive price untenable.am.academic suppliers,cir see also united states dentsply int l,cir emphasizing a monopolist power to maintain market share emphasis in original quoting united states syufy,cir.
monopoly power can be demonstrated with either direct evidence of supracompetitive pricing and high barriers to entry,see rebel oil atl.richfield,cir,or with structural evidence of a monopolized market.because direct proof is only rarely available,courts more typically examine market structure in search of circumstantial evidence of monopoly power.united states microsoft,en banc citations omitted.
harrison aire contends aerostar charged supracompetitive prices for its fabric,based on the uncontested fact that aerostar fabric is more expensive than that of its aftermarket competitors.but this alone does not support a reasonable inference of monopoly power.competitive markets are characterized by both price and quality competition,and a firm comparatively high price may simply reflect a superior product.blue cross blue shield united marshfield clinic,cir generally you must pay more for higher quality.therefore,when dealing with a heterogeneous product or service a reasonable finder of fact can not infer monopoly power just from higher prices.id.at.
here,the record is clear that balloon fabric is a heterogeneous product.fabric is sold in various weaves and grades,of differing strength and durability.the record demonstrates that aerostar fabric is of comparatively high quality.although harrison considered purchasing fabric from one of aerostar aftermarket competitors,custom nine designs,he rejected the product because custom nine did prove to me that it was a bogus part.furthermore,custom nine president acknowledged that aerostar diamond weave fabric was a superior aftermarket product to his own.because it is undisputed that balloon fabric,and particularly aerostar fabric,is differentiated by composition and quality,aerostar comparatively high price does not,by itself,support a reasonable inference of monopoly power.
turning to harrison aire circumstantial evidence of monopoly power,we note the structural indicators of a monopolized market.in a typical section case,monopoly power is inferred from a firm possession of a dominant share of a relevant market that is protected by entry barriers.microsoft,at see also fineman armstrong world,cir explaining market share analysis.plaintiffs relying on market share as a proxy for monopoly power must plead and produce evidence of a relevant product market,of the alleged monopolist dominant share of that market,and of high barriers to entry.queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir market definition fineman,at cir market share microsoft,at barriers to entry.
additional factors are relevant in the aftermarket context.aftermarket monopolization cases require a more comprehensive analysis,because market share data standing alone is not necessarily a reliable proxy for monopoly power.sms syst.maint.servs.digital equip,cir.many firms supply unique proprietary aftermarket parts and services for their primary market products.as a result,they can be expected to have a very high percentage share of the relevant aftermarket.id.but high aftermarket share is not necessarily indicative of monopoly,the power to charge and maintain a supracompetitive aftermarket behavior generally is disciplined by competition in the primary product market.if the primary market is competitive,a firm exploiting its aftermarket customers ordinarily is engaged in a when buyers evaluate the lifecycle cost of the product,the cost of the product over its full service life,they will shop elsewhere.eventually,the aftermarket monopolist lacks customers to exploit.see parts motors,sterling,cir posner,dissenting describing the exploitation of aftermarket customers as a suicidal business practice sms,at firms concerned with the long term can not afford to bite the hands that feed them.
this portrayal is conventional antitrust theory.see philip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed.but as explained in kodak,it may not accurately explain the behavior of the primary and derivative markets for complex durable goods where significant information and switching costs sever the usual link between the primary market and the aftermarket.at.information costs are barriers that prevent primary market consumers from evaluating the lifecycle costs of a product.id.at.for primary market competition to discipline aftermarket behavior,consumers require information on,among other things,the expected cost,quality and availability of aftermarket products such as parts and service.perfect information is not required for the primary market to check the aftermarket.see jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d holding,in tying case,that imperfect information does not necessarily generate the kind of monopoly power that justifies condemnation sms,at perfect information about the aftermarket is not required.but sometimes lifecycle pricing information is particularly difficult or impossible for primary market customers to acquire,as in the case of a unilateral change in aftermarket policy targeting locked in customers.kodak involved this type of market failure.see queen city pizza,at the kodak case arose out of concerns about unilateral changes in kodak parts and repairs policies.
kodak involved a primary market for photocopiers and an aftermarket for kodak parts and service.the primary market was competitive.but kodak controlled nearly of the parts aftermarket,and to of the service market.at.historically,kodak customers had been able to obtain copier repair service from independent service organizations that charged substantially less than kodak.at.later,however,after customers were locked in to kodak copiers,kodak changed its aftermarket policy to sell replacement parts only to those customers who also purchased kodak service or who repaired their own machines.id.at.this policy change led to higher aftermarket prices.id.at.in other words,kodak used its power in the replacement parts market to squeeze the independent service providers out of the repair market and to force copier purchasers to obtain service directly from kodak,at higher cost.queen city pizza,at.
