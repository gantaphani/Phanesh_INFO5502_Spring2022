opinion of the court 
we address for the first time the use of cy pres distributions in class action settlements the term cy pres is derived from the norman french expression cy pres comme possible,which means as near as possible.democratic cent.comm.washington metro.area transit comm n,when class actions are resolved through settlement,it may be difficult to distribute the entire settlement fund,after paying attorneys fees and costs along with fund administration expenses,directly to its intended beneficiaries the class members.money may remain unclaimed if class members can not be located,decline to file claims,have died,or the parties have overestimated the amount projected for distribution for some other reason.it may also be economically or administratively infeasible to distribute funds to class members if,for example,the cost of distributing individually to all class members exceeds the amount to be distributed.in these circumstances,courts have permitted the parties to distribute to a nonparty or nonparties the excess settlement funds for their next best use a charitable purpose reasonably approximating the interests pursued by the class.
the cy pres award in this case was part of a settlement of consolidated antitrust class actions brought by several named plaintiffs collectively,the plaintiffs on behalf of consumers against retailers toys r us,and babies r us,along with several baby product manufacturers the retailers and manufacturers are collectively referred to as the defendants.pursuant to that settlement,which was approved by the district court,all settlement funds remaining after attorneys fees and costs are paid,and individual distributions are made to claimants,would go to one or more charitable organizations proposed by the parties and selected by the court.the court indicated it would ensure the funds are used for a purpose underlying the interests of the class.
kevin young,an unnamed class member who objected to the settlement before the district court,raises the following three issues relating to the cy pres provision on appeal 
the district court erred in approving a settlement that would result in funds being distributed to one or more cy pres recipients in lieu of fully compensating class members for their losses.
the court should have discounted the value of the cy pres distribution for purposes of calculating attorneys fees,which were awarded on a basis.
the class notice was deficient because it did not identify the recipients that would receive the cy pres distributions.
young overarching concern,and ours as well,is that the settlement has resulted in a troubling and,according to counsel for the parties,surprising allocation of the settlement fund.cy pres distributions,while in our view permissible,are inferior to direct distributions to the class because they only imperfectly serve the purpose of the underlying causes of action to compensate class members.though the parties contemplated that excess funds would be distributed to charity after the bulk of the settlement fund was distributed to class members through an exhaustive claims process,it appears the actual allocation will be just the opposite.defendants paid into a settlement fund.about will go to class counsel in attorneys fees and expenses.of the remainder,it is expected that roughly will be distributed to class members,while the rest approximately less administrative expenses will be distributed to one or more cy pres recipients.
we vacate the district court approval of the settlement because the court was apparently unaware of the amount of the fund that would be distributed to cy pres beneficiaries rather than being distributed directly to the class.on remand,the court should consider whether this or any alternative settlement provides sufficient direct benefit to the class before giving its approval.we also vacate the attorneys fees award because its approval was based on the terms of a settlement that are no longer in effect and may be altered on remand.addressing young argument that attorneys fees should be reduced,we confirm that courts need to consider the level of direct benefit provided to the class in calculating attorneys fees.we leave it to the district court discretion to assess what effect,if any,that consideration should have on any future fee award in this case.as there was no error in the notice provided to the class,we do not reverse on that basis.
background 
this appeal follows from two antitrust class actions consolidated for settlement purposes.in,carol mcdonough and other named plaintiffs filed a suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging that defendants conspired to set a price floor for the sale of certain baby products,causing consumers to pay increased prices for these products.in,class certification of that suit was granted and several subclasses were created based on the products purchased and the timeframe of those purchases.because the district court did not permit the subclass periods to extend beyond the date when the case was filed,ariel elliott and other named plaintiffs subsequently filed a related putative class action.in,the parties in those actions signed an agreement consolidating and settling their lawsuits.
the court initially approved the settlement in january.notice was sent to putative class members informing them of their right to submit a claim,opt out,or object.in july,the court held a fairness hearing to consider any objections made by class members.the deadline for submitting claims expired in august.approximately four months later,the court approved the settlement and a fund allocation plan proposed by the parties.it also granted class counsel fee request for,representing of the gross settlement amount,and for litigation expenses.
per the settlement,defendants deposited into a settlement fund.after payment of attorneys fees and expenses,the remainder of the fund was slated for distribution to the settlement class in order to receive a cash distribution,a claimant must demonstrate that he or she is a member of a settlement subclass by submitting a valid,sworn,and timely claim form.
claimants are entitled to different levels of compensation based on the evidence submitted.those who submit valid documentary proof of purchase and of the actual price paid for a product are eligible to receive of the actual purchase price of each product purchased.those who do not submit documentary proof of the actual purchase price but submit a valid proof of purchase are eligible to receive of the estimated retail price,as calculated by class counsel,of each product purchased the figure slightly exceeds the average overcharge an independent economics expert hired by class counsel estimated class members would have paid for a baby product covered by the settlement.those who do not submit any proof of purchase are eligible to receive a payment of.
claims in the first two categories of compensation those receiving of the actual or estimated purchase price are subject to pro rata enhancements.the settlement class is divided into eight different settlement subclasses,based on the baby product purchased.if the claims awarded do not exhaust the funds allocated to a particular settlement subclass,these awards are enhanced by up to three times the baseline figure,consistent with section of the clayton act,which entitles private plaintiffs to receive treble damages for violations of the antitrust laws.
the settlement terms establish an order of priority for distributing any remaining funds.funds in a subclass after the initial distribution will be redistributed first to the other settlement classes until all claims are fully satisfied in accordance with the compensation categories and accompanying enhancements described.if funds remain after that redistribution and the payment of administrative costs,they will be donated to one or more charitable organizations the cy pres recipients.under the terms of the settlement,plaintiffs and defendants are each permitted to recommend up to two organizations to receive the award.the district court,however,is entrusted with the responsibility of selecting one or more cy pres recipients that will receive distributions.
we do not know the exact allocation of the funds that will result from the current settlement.at the time of the fairness hearing in july,class members had submitted approximately claims.because the deadline for submissions was not until august,more claims likely were submitted.in response to a concern regarding whether the in the settlement fund would be sufficient to pay counsel fees and expenses while compensating class members under the terms of the agreement,the district court estimated that at most assuming claims,each entitling the claimant to three times of a baby product would be distributed to class members.it appears,however,that far less will actually be distributed to them.at oral argument,class and defense counsel informed us that,largely because the vast majority of the claims fell into the third category of compensation entitling claimants to payouts,class members will receive only about through the claims process.
ii.cy pres 
we have not ruled on whether class action settlements may include cy pres provisions.courts generally have approved cy pres distributions in two circumstances.
first,many courts allow a settlement that directs funds to a third party when funds are left over after all individual claims have been satisfied second,some courts allow a settlement to require a payment only to a third party,that is,to provide no recovery at all directly to class members.
american law institute ali,principles of the law of aggregate litig,comment a.we deal with the former here.
the use of cy pres recipients to dispose of excess funds first suggested in a student comment in,see stewart shepherd,comment,damage distribution in class actions the cy pres remedy,chi.has accelerated rapidly in recent years.
from through,federal courts granted or approved cy pres awards to third party charities in thirty class actions,or an average of approximately once per year.from through,federal courts granted or approved cy pres awards in class actions,or an average of roughly eight per year.
martin redish et,cy pres relief and the pathologies of the modern class action a normative and empirical analysis.
this is unsurprising.when excess settlement funds remain after claimants have received the distribution they are entitled to under the terms of the settlement agreement,there are three principal options for distributing the remaining funds reversion to the defendant,escheat to the state,or distribution of the funds cy among these options,cy pres distributions have benefits over the alternative choices.reversion to the defendant risks undermining the deterrent effect of class actions by rewarding defendants for the failure of class members to collect their share of the settlement.escheat to the state preserves the deterrent effect of class actions,but it benefits the community at large rather than those harmed by the defendant conduct.cy pres distributions also preserve the deterrent effect,but at least theoretically more closely tailor the distribution to the interests of class members,including those absent members who have not received individual distributions.
we join other courts of appeals in holding that a district court does not abuse its discretion by approving a class action settlement agreement that includes a cy pres component directing the distribution of excess settlement funds to a third party to be used for a purpose related to the class injury see lane facebook,cir in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,cir see also herbert newberg et,newberg on class actions ed ali,supra.the claims,issues,or defenses of a certified class may be settled,voluntarily dismissed,or compromised only with the court approval.e.that approval is warranted when the court finds that the settlement,taken as a whole,is fair,reasonable,and adequate from the perspective of the class.e.inclusion of a cy pres provision by itself does not render a settlement unfair,unreasonable,or inadequate.
we caution,however,that direct distributions to the class are preferred over cy pres distributions.the private causes of action aggregated in this class action as in many others were created by congress to allow plaintiffs to recover compensatory damages for their injuries.see.cy pres distributions imperfectly serve that purpose by substituting for that direct compensation an indirect benefit that is at best attenuated and at worse illusory mirfasihi fleet mortg,cir.cy pres distributions also present a potential conflict of interest between class counsel and their clients because the inclusion of a cy pres distribution may increase a settlement fund,and with it attorneys fees,without increasing the direct benefit to the class.where a court fears counsel is conflicted,it should subject the settlement to increased scrutiny 
to account for the inferiority of cy pres distributions,the ali has published guidelines limiting them to instances where further individual distributions are infeasible.those guidelines provide in pertinent part 
if the settlement involves individual distributions to class members and funds remain after distributions because some class members could not be identified or chose not to participate,the settlement should presumptively provide for further distributions to participating class members unless the amounts involved are too small to make individual distributions economically viable or other specific reasons exist that would make such further distributions impossible or unfair.
ali,supra,b.the ali does not explain further what other specific reasons would justify a cy pres distribution.
although we agree with the ali that cy pres distributions are most appropriate where further individual distributions are economically infeasible,we decline to hold that cy pres distributions are only appropriate in this context.settlements are private contracts reflecting negotiated compromises.sullivan,at.the role of a district court is not to determine whether the settlement is the fairest possible resolution a task particularly given that the likelihood of success at trial on which all settlements are based can only be estimated imperfectly.the court must determine whether the compromises reflected in the settlement including those terms relating to the allocation of settlement funds are fair,reasonable,and adequate when considered from the perspective of the class as a whole.
to assess whether a settlement containing a cy pres provision satisfies this requirement,courts should employ the same framework developed for assessing other aspects of class action settlements.in girsh jepson,cir,we set out nine factors that courts should consider when deciding whether to approve a settlement.id.at.in in re prudential insurance of america sales practices litigation,cir,we expanded that analysis to include what may be termed the prudential considerations.id.at.unlike the girsh factors,each of which the district court must consider before approving a class settlement,the prudential considerations are just that,prudential.they are permissive and,illustrat ing the additional inquiries that in many instances will be useful for a thoroughgoing analysis of a settlement terms.see in re pet food,at.
we add today that one of the additional inquiries for a thorough analysis of settlement terms is the degree of direct benefit provided to the class.in making this determination,a district court may consider,among other things,the number of individual awards compared to both the number of claims and the estimated number of class members,the size of the individual awards compared to claimants estimated damages,and the claims process used to determine individual awards.barring sufficient justification,cy pres awards should generally represent a small percentage of total settlement funds.
we note that this inquiry needs to be,as much as possible,practical and not abstract.if the parties have not on their own initiative supplied the information needed to make the necessary findings,the court should affirmatively seek out such information.in re pet food,at citation omitted.making these findings may also require a court to withhold final approval of a settlement until the actual distribution of funds can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.alternatively,a court may urge the parties to implement a settlement structure that attempts to maintain an appropriate balance between payments to the class and cy pres awards.for instance,it could condition approval of a settlement on the inclusion of a mechanism for additional payouts to individual class members if the number of claimants turns out to be insufficient to deplete a significant portion of the total settlement fund.
turning to the particular cy pres distribution in this case,young asserts that the district court failed to fulfill its oversight responsibility by approving a class action settlement containing a cy pres provision that permits the distribution of funds to a third party without first fully compensating all claimants.as noted above,the settlement directs a cy pres award after claimants receive cash distributions via a compensation structure claimants with valid documentary proof of purchase and purchase price receive up to three times of the actual price of the product they purchased claimants with valid documentary proof of purchase receive up to three times of the estimated price and claimants without any valid proof receive a payout.young does not object to the figure or argue that the first two categories of claimants will be undercompensated.instead,he asserts that the cy pres award is inappropriate because the third category of claimants those receiving a payout regardless of price of the product they purchased will not be fully compensated for their losses.
we review a district court decision to approve a settlement for abuse of discretion.girsh,at.an appellate court may find an abuse of discretion where the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.in re prudential,at quoting in re motors.pick up truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir.mindful that we are dealing with a settlement,we remain hesitant to undo an agreement that has resolved a,litigation.see in re warfarin sodium antitrust,cir.because class actions are rife with potential conflicts of interest between class counsel and class members,however,district judges presiding over such actions are expected to give careful scrutiny to the terms of proposed settlement in order to make sure that class counsel are behaving as honest fiduciaries for the class as a whole.mirfasihi,at collecting cases see also in re motors,at.
we vacate the district court orders approving the settlement and the fund allocation plan because it did not have the factual basis necessary to determine whether the settlement was fair to the entire class.most importantly,it did not know the amount of compensation that will be distributed directly to the class.removing attorneys fees and expenses,approximately less costs of administration of the settlement were designated for the class,but only around of that amount actually will be distributed to class members,with the remainder going to cy pres recipients after expenses relating to the administration of the fund are paid.
though the claims period had concluded,counsel did not provide this information to the court,preventing it from properly assessing whether the settlement was in the best interest of the class as a whole.the court approved the cap on compensation for those without documentary proof of their claims in part because it believed the standard of proof required to receive a higher award was fairly low.mcdonough toys r us,d.according to counsel,however,the vast majority of claimants have not submitted documentary proof entitling them to a greater award,casting doubt on this assumption.similarly,the court found the cap was justified by the need to avoid encouraging fraud.id.while without doubt this is a good goal,we do not believe the court could have reasonably assessed whether these concerns justified the cap without knowing the resulting allocation of funds.other means of preventing fraud could have been explored.
based on the information we now have,we remand for the court to reconsider the fairness of the settlement.the parties may wish to alter its terms on remand to provide greater direct benefit to the class,such as by increasing the payment or lowering the evidentiary bar for receiving a higher award after allowing them that opportunity,we ask the court to make the factual findings necessary to evaluate whether the settlement provides sufficient direct benefit to the class.
we place no absolute requirement on the amount of direct compensation the third category of claimants must receive.courts of appeals have approved cy pres distributions where all class members submitting claims have already been fully compensated for their damages by prior distributions.see,in re lupron mktg.sales practices,cir.a cy pres distribution is considered appropriate in that circumstance because additional individual distributions would overcompensat e claimant class members at the expense of absent class members.id.at citing in re pharm,at.we agree,but do not limit cy pres distributions to instances where all claimants have received of their estimated damages.as the parties explain,the payment to claimants in the third category can be seen as compensation for a full release of their claims rather than as an attempt to compensate them for their damages.indeed,provided the class as a whole received sufficient direct benefit,it would not have been unreasonable to eliminate the category altogether and require class members to submit documentary proof to receive any award.we do not intend to raise the bar for obtaining approval of a class action settlement simply because it includes a cy pres provision.
what we are concerned with in this case is that the court approved the settlement without being made aware that almost all claimants would fall into the compensation category,resulting in minimal and we doubt sufficient compensation going directly to class members.the baby products at issue cost up to,resulting in damages,at the estimated overcharge,of over.combined with the possibility of treble damages,we doubt that this is the type of small claims case where the potential awards were necessarily insufficient to motivate class members to file claims.we think it more likely that many class members did not submit claims because they lacked the documentary proof necessary to receive the higher awards contemplated,and the award they could receive left them apathetic.this casts doubt on whether agreeing to a settlement with such a restrictive claims process was in the best interest of the class.if defendants decline to raise the cap or alter the documentary proof requirement on remand,the court will need to determine whether the class received sufficient direct benefit to justify the settlement as fair,reasonable,and adequate.before doing so,though,it must have the requisite factual basis.
iii.attorneys fees 
in a certified class action,the court may award reasonable attorney fees and nontaxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties agreement.h.courts generally use one of two methods for assessing the reasonableness of attorneys fees a method or a lodestar method.the former resembles a contingent fee in that it awards counsel a variable percentage of the amount recovered for the class.in re motors.pick up truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir.the latter calculates fees by multiplying the number of hours expended by some hourly rate appropriate for the region and for the experience of the lawyer.id.at.whichever method is chosen,we have noted previously that it is sensible for a court to use a second method of fee approval to cross check its initial fee calculation.in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices,cir quoting in re motors,at.
the district court as is generally favored in cases involving a common fund,id.awarded fees on a basis.we have identified a number of factors to aid courts in evaluating the reasonableness of percentage fee awards.in re diet drugs prod.liab,cir citing gunter ridgewood energy,cir in re prud
