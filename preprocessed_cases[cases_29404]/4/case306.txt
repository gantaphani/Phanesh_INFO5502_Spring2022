national hockey league players association nhlpa brought this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,alleging that the ontario hockey league ohl and all of its member teams conspired with the national hockey league nhl to violate section of the sherman antitrust act.nhlpa sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on behalf of the hockey players it represents.nhlpa then moved for leave to amend the complaint to add anthony aquino as a plaintiff and also requested a preliminary injunction on his behalf.the district court granted nhlpa motion to amend and issued a preliminary injunction.on november,this court stayed the preliminary injunction,ohl and its member teams,appeal the district court grant of the preliminary injunction.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court grant of the preliminary injunction.
factual and procedural history 
the nhlpa,an unincorporated labor association organized under the laws of ontario,is the exclusive collective bargaining representative for all current and future nhl hockey players.the ohl is one of three amateur hockey leagues that comprise the canadian hockey league chl.the ohl consists of twenty teams whose players range in age from sixteen to twenty.while the vast majority of the ohl clubs are located within ontario,canada,two of the teams are located in michigan,and one team is located in pennsylvania.according to appellees,the ohl is a major source of players for the nhl,and various financial and other agreements exist between the two organizations.
the ohl eligibility rules provide that each team may have only three players,typically referred to as overage players.in addition to limiting the number of overage players,the ohl adopted a rule in august of under which any overage player signed by an ohl team must have been on a canadian hockey association cha or usa hockey player registration certificate the previous season.this rule,commonly referred to as the van ryn rule also referred to as the rule,effectively prevents ohl teams from signing any united states college hockey players because the national collegiate athletic association ncaa does not allow individuals holding a cha or usa hockey player registration certificate to play hockey at an ncaa school.
anthony aquino is a hockey player who has been affected by the van ryn rule.at age sixteen,aquino,a canadian citizen,was drafted by an ohl team,the owen sound attack.instead of playing for the attack,aquino chose to attend merrimack college in massachusetts.aquino began playing hockey at merrimack during the season and played for three seasons.in june,aquino was drafted by the dallas stars,an nhl hockey team.during the season,the attack traded its rights to aquino to the oshawa generals,another ohl team.while attending merrimack college,aquino was placed on the generals protected list,which prevented aquino from negotiating or signing with any other team in the chl.
aquino decided against returning to merrimack for a fourth season.after deciding not to return to merrimack,aquino believed that he had two options for working toward a career in the nhl.aquino could attempt to sign with and play for the team that drafted him,the stars.signing with the stars,however,would result in his becoming a restricted agent with that team for the next eleven years.in the alternative,aquino could play in the chl,most likely for the generals,an ohl team,for one year as an overage player,which would allow him to become a free agent in.the van ryn rule,however,currently prevents aquino from playing for the generals.while the nhl drafts many players from the ohl,which mirrors the style of play,rules,practice and game schedule of the nhl,players are also drafted from american colleges and high schools,canadian junior leagues,american junior leagues,minor professional leagues,midget leagues,and international leagues.while the parties disagree about aquino options for becoming an unrestricted free agent,aquino position is that playing for the generals is the only route to becoming an unrestricted free agent.his position is that,assuming he could join a professional league other than the nhl or the chl,he would fall into defected status,causing the stars to hold his exclusive rights in perpetuity.
on march,appellee nhlpa brought this action alleging that,in adopting the van ryn rule,the ohl and its member teams conspired with the nhl in violation of section of the sherman act.the original complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of present and future nhl players.on may,appellants moved to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens and lack of personal jurisdiction the district court denied appellants motion to dismiss.hockey league players ass plymouth whalers hockey club et,d.on july,appellees moved to add anthony aquino as a plaintiff and requested a preliminary injunction on his behalf.
on august,the district court granted nhlpa request to amend the complaint to add aquino as a plaintiff and granted a preliminary injunction ordering the ohl to refrain from applying the van ryn rule,which prohibits any ohl team from considering or hiring aquino.this timely appeal followed.
after filing their appeal,appellants submitted a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending disposition of the appeal.on november,a panel of this court granted appellants motion for a stay and ordered an expedited appeal.the case was assigned to this panel and placed on the oral argument calendar for february.appellees then filed a motion seeking reconsideration and requesting that the court lift the stay.this panel denied the motion for reconsideration and deferred ruling on the issues surrounding the preliminary injunction until after oral argument.
ii.analysis 
foreign trade antitrust improvements act 
appellants first argue that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over aquino antitrust claims because these claims are barred by the foreign trade antitrust improvements act ftaia,which limits the extraterritorial application of the sherman act.in ruling on appellees motion to amend,the district court determined that the ftaia did not prohibit the court from exercising jurisdiction over aquino antitrust claims because aquino adequately alleged that the van ryn rule is an unreasonable restraint of trade and that the rule significantly affects united states commerce.appellants now argue not only that the ftaia bars aquino antitrust claims,but also that the bar to aquino antitrust claims deprived the district court of jurisdiction to issue an injunction.appellants base the argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin application of the rule on a contention that the nhlpa did not demonstrate any right to a preliminary injunction on its own behalf.
appellants argument fails for two reasons.first,the district court jurisdiction to issue an injunction was not dependent on the viability of aquino claims.in denying the motion to dismiss,the district court determined that the nhlpa had standing to seek injunctive relief on behalf of present and future nhl players.the motion for a preliminary injunction specifically noted that the nhlpa sought relief on behalf of aquino if he was not added as a party.consequently,even if the ftaia bars aquino claims,the nhlpa claim for injunctive relief on his behalf and on behalf of other players remains.second,in the district court appellants raised the argument that the ftaia barred aquino claims in response to the motion to amend.we appropriately consider the issue only in the context in which it was raised in the district court.see estate of quirk,cir.yet,the district court grant of the motion to amend is not an appealable interlocutory order under.thus,an appeal of the ftaia issue is not properly before the court.
preliminary injunction 
we review a lower court decision to grant a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.in re delorean motor,cir.the district court determination will be disturbed only if the district court relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applied the governing law,or used an erroneous legal standard.nightclubs,city of paducah,cir quoting connection distrib.reno,cir.when considering a motion for preliminary injunction,the district court should consider four factors whether the moving party has a strong likelihood of success on the merits whether the moving party will suffer irreparable injury without the injunction whether the issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others and whether the public interest would be served by issuance of the injunction.id.the four considerations applicable to preliminary injunction decisions are factors to be balanced,not prerequisites that must be met.delorean,at.moreover,a district court is not required to make specific findings concerning each of the four factors used in determining a motion for preliminary injunction if fewer factors are determinative of the issue.id.
likelihood of success on the merits 
after recognizing that the court must determine whether the van ryn rule amounts to an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of section of the sherman act under either a per se analysis or a rule of reason analysis,the district court applied a per se analysis because it found that the van ryn rule constitutes a group boycott.under the per se analysis,the district court concluded that appellees had a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.appellants contend that the district court erred in applying a per se rule and in its conclusion about the likelihood of success on the merits.
section of the sherman act provides that every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is hereby declared to be illegal.because nearly every contract that binds parties to an agreed course of conduct is a restraint of trade of some sort,the supreme court has limited the restrictions contained in section to bar only unreasonable restraints of trade.collegiate athletic ass board of regents of of,d hereinafter referred to as board of regents.in order to establish their antitrust claim,appellees must prove that appellants participated in an agreement that unreasonably restrained trade in the relevant market.see law collegiate athletic ass n,cir.the district court found,and the parties do not contest,that appellants have entered into an agreement via their adoption of the van ryn rule.appellants,however,contest the district court finding that the van ryn rule is an unreasonable restraint of trade.
two analytical approaches are used to determine whether a defendant conduct unreasonably restrains trade the per se rule and the rule of reason.id.at citing scfc ilc,visa usa,cir.the per se rule identifies certain practices that are entirely void of redeeming competitive rationales.id.if a court determines that a practice is illegal per se,no examination of the practice impact on the market or the procompetitive justifications for the practice is necessary for finding a violation of antitrust law.id.the rule of reason,however,requires a court to analyze the history of the restraint and the restraint effect on competition.see smith pro football.the rule of reason analysis employs a framework.see california dental ass ftc,d.first,the plaintiff must establish that the restraint produces significant anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets.see tanaka of southern,cir.if the plaintiff meets this burden,the defendant must come forward with evidence of the restraint procompetitive effects to establish that the alleged conduct justifies the otherwise anticompetitive injuries.see also united states brown,cir.if the defendant is able to demonstrate procompetitive effects,the plaintiff then must show that any legitimate objectives can be achieved in a substantially less restrictive manner.law,at.
the supreme court has stated that the per se rule is a demanding standard that should be applied only in clear cut cases.continental,gte sylvania,d accord walker process,food mach.chem,d finding that the area of per se illegality is carefully limited.therefore,courts consistently have analyzed challenged conduct under the rule of reason when dealing with an industry in which some horizontal restraints are necessary for the availability of a product such as sports leagues.law,at.moreover,the supreme court has recognized that in cases involving industries in which horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all,the rule of reason analysis should apply.see board of regents,at.banks ncaa,cir finding that u nder the supreme court ruling in board of regents,allegations that the ncaa rules restrain trade or commerce may not be viewed as per se violations of the sherman act see also mark anderson,and league rules under the sherman act,cap,noting that i t is now well established through the myriad of case law that rules and regulations normally employed by professional sports leagues and other organizations are not subject to the per se rule,but rather will be analyzed under the rule of reason.robert freitas,overview looking ahead at sports and the antitrust law,antitrust,spring stating that it is now settled that the practices typically associated with the organization of professional sports leagues and other organizations such as the ncaa are not subject to the per se rule.because hockey leagues involve the same types of restraints discussed by the supreme court in board of regents,the district court erred in failing to apply the rule of reason analysis 
all of the cases relied upon by the district court in applying the per se rule were decided prior to the supreme court decision in board of regents.after the supreme court decision in board of regents,courts have applied the rule of reason to eligibility rules and frequently concluded that such rules do not violate antitrust law.see,tanaka,at mccormack ncaa,cir toscano pga tour,d.as discussed above,under the rule of reason,appellees have the initial burden of demonstrating significant anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets.in the present case,the product made available by the ohl is amateur hockey.there are horizontal restraints that are necessary for the product to exist,including rules such as those restricting the number of players and the ages of players.see board of regents,at.noting that what a sports league and its members market is competition itself of course,this would be completely ineffective if there were no rules to create and define the competition to be marketed.it is difficult,however,to define the relevant market.the term relevant market encompasses notions of geography as well as product use,quality,and description.tanaka,at quotation omitted.failure to identify a relevant market is a proper ground for dismissing a sherman act claim.id.citing big bear lodging ass snow summit,cir.
appellees do not define a relevant market in their complaint.instead,they rely on the district court statement in the order granting the preliminary injunction that plaintiff has defined the market at issue here as the market for competition among ohl and chl teams for player services and argues that the rule limits competition among a group of players in such a market which has value to the nhl.according to the district court,b ecause he is a year old college hockey player,aquino is excluded from this market.the market for player services in the ohl,however,is not a market that involves economic competition.the ohl rules clearly limit the amount a player may be paid to schooling and a limited stipend.instead,the effect on the market as defined by appellees is on athletic competition,which is not protected by the antitrust laws.see toscano,d at citing m h tire hoosier racing tire,cir grizzlies football league,cir.the application of the van ryn rule does not result in any economic injury to the market for competition among ohl and chl teams for player services,but merely substitutes one arguably less skilled player for another arguably more skilled player.while a player barred by the rule is precluded from taking advantage of the benefits of playing on an ohl team
