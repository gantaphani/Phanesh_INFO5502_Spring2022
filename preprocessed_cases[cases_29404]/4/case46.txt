this is an appeal by eastern food services,eastern from the dismissal of its antitrust suit.the defendants in the district court were pontifical catholic university of puerto rico services association,university services and coca cola puerto rico bottlers,coca cola.because dismissal was on the complaint,we take the factual allegations of the complaint as true for purposes of this appeal.martin applied cellular,cir.
eastern is a company based in san juan,puerto rico,engaged in distributing food and beverage products in puerto rico this includes sales through cafeteria operations and food and beverage machines.pontificia universidad cat√≥lica de puerto rico is a university based in ponce,puerto rico university services is a related entity that provides ancillary services for the university and has control over its cafeteria and other food distribution points.
in,eastern and university services entered into a contract,extendable to five years,whereby eastern agreed to operate the cafeteria at the university and was given,for specified payments,the exclusive concession with a few narrow exceptions for other food and beverage distribution inside the university.eastern alleges that in,in order to secure a donation from coca cola to the university,university services allowed coca cola to place its own food and beverage machines on the campus and told eastern to have the machines it was using removed.
there were negotiations between the parties as to this and other matters.ultimately,university services terminated the contract,claiming that eastern had breached its provisions in various respects eastern made similar claims against university services.asserting that it made large investments in reliance upon the contract,eastern brought the present suit in federal district court in against both university services and coca cola.
although the complaint asserts contract,tort,and other claims under local law and university services filed a counterclaim based on breach of contract,our concern is solely with eastern claim based upon section of the sherman act.this claim alleged a conspiracy by the two defendants,through unfair business practices,to eliminate competition by eastern in the supply of food and beverage service within the university.this was,according to the complaint,unlawful per se and under the rule of reason.
the district court dismissed the antitrust claim on the merits.the ruling most important to this appeal was that the complaint failed to allege a valid geographic market the district judge said that eastern alleged geographic extremely narrow and not large enough so as to constitute an economically significant area of commerce.the local law claims were dismissed without prejudice to their assertion in puerto rico courts.this appeal followed.
our review of a dismissal for failure to state a claim is de novo.martin,at.in addition to accepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint,we draw reasonable inferences in favor of the party.id.nevertheless,we conclude that this is essentially a contract dispute with possible attendant tort claims and it is not a plausible antitrust case,however tempting may be the lure of treble damages and attorney fees.
in substance,eastern alleges that it had from the university,through its services auxiliary,something close to an exclusive contract to provide food services on the university campus,and that after receiving a large donation for the university from coca cola,university services broke the contract in order to transfer to coca cola exclusive rights to a part of eastern domain,namely,the vending machine portion of the business on the campus.indulging all inferences in favor of eastern,we will assume that coca cola was complicit in the breach.
the line is not always clear between antitrust violations and ordinary business wrongs,such as breach of contract or tortious interference.indeed,both antitrust and ordinary contract or tort claims may sometimes arise out of the same body of conduct,see hayes solomon,cir,cert.denied,d iiia areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,imagine a near monopolist who burns down the plant of his only competitor.but antitrust claims are concerned not with wrongs directed against the private interest of an individual business but with conduct that stifles competition.brown shoe united states,d.
from the outset,eastern description of what happened raises warning flags for anyone familiar with antitrust law.the university,like most landlords,controls who may set up shop on its premises.it could act as the sole supplier of food and beverages,allow multiple suppliers,or give exclusive access to one supplier.here,before the dispute,eastern was virtually the sole supplier of food and beverages after,coca cola has exclusive control of the vending machine portion of the business.
in all events,antitrust doctrine does not operate by purely ad hoc judgments as to whether an action adds to or detracts from competition.section of the sherman act makes unlawful contracts,combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade and the courts have developed algorithms for implementing this generalization.the easiest way is for the plaintiff to show a per se violation,that is,that the challenged conduct falls within a small set of acts regarded by courts as sufficiently dangerous,and so clearly without redeeming value,that they are condemned out of is without a showing of wrongful purpose,power or effect.see united states oil.
almost the only important categories of agreements that reliably deserve this label today are those among competitors that amount to naked price fixing,output restriction,or division of customers or territories.augusta news hudson news,cir agreements between a supplier and a buyer as to a minimum resale price remain per se unlawful,but that category is a narrow one.in this case eastern invokes a different category of agreements sometimes labeled per se,namely,concerted refusals to deal or group boycotts,fashion originators guild of,ftc.
as to this last category,the label is deceptive because lots of arrangements that might literally be described as agreements not to deal are not per se unlawful.a common arrangement that involves an agreement not to deal but is far from unlawful per se is the exclusive dealing contract,a sole supplier contract,a exclusive territorial franchise for an outlet.such arrangements can be attacked under the rule of,on their are not per se violations.tampa nashville coal,d.
those refusals to deal arrangements that are treated as per se violations are horizontal,that is,they are agreements between competitors.see healthcare,healthsource,cir.even then,not all such horizontal arrangements are subject to per se treatment or necessarily violate the antitrust laws,northwest stationers,at.an entity that grants an exclusive franchise is ordinarily in a vertical,not a horizontal,relationship with the grantee.xi hovenkamp,antitrust law.
what is alleged here is nothing other than an exclusive dealing arrangement by which one given the sole right by the university to supply and stock vending machines on campus eastern was itself the beneficiary of just such a,a broader one since it included other food it was terminated.there might be circumstances in which exclusivity was unlawful for but not for eastern but in neither case does such a contract fall into the category of a per se violation.
to show an antitrust violation in the transfer of exclusive rights from eastern to coca cola,eastern had to commit itself to show that the new arrangement would have effects outweighing the legitimate economic advantages that it might provide.healthcare,at see fraser major league soccer,cir,cert.denied,d.this is usually a demanding and process,tampa,at,which is why plaintiffs almost always allege a per se violation where they can do so.but plaintiffs are free to urge per se and se theories at the same time.healthcare,at.
virtually always,effects under the rule of reason require that the arrangement or action in question create or enhance market the power to control prices or exclude competition.iia areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,ed.this is not necessarily enough to condemn the may outweigh detriments,see northwest wholesale stationers,at,d broadcast music,at.absent market power there is ordinarily no detriment and no reason to engage in any weighing.oksanen page mem l,cir,cert.denied,d.
thus,the identification of market power is ordinarily the first step in any rule of reason claim under section.visa,cir valley liquors,renfield importers,cir,cert.denied,d.this in turn requires the identification of some economic market in which power can be measured and the consequences of the act or transaction assessed.indeed,virtually all courts applying the rule of reason require the plaintiff to define the product and geographic market in which competition is allegedly restrained vii areeda,antitrust law,at.
so how is market power to be assessed as to power over price,the conventional way is to determine whether the relevant actor or combination has a sufficient percentage share of a relevant market to give it or them power to raise price over cost without losing so many customers as to defeat the effort.todd exxon,cir.where exclusion rather than exploitation is the concern,market share figures help gauge the potential impact of restrictive conduct on suppliers or purchasers.see tampa,at.a defendant high share is only a presumptive basis for inferring market power entry barriers to the market may be very low but a low share is almost always an indication that the defendant lacks market power.
here,perhaps university services has power in an economic market after all,it can set the prices charged students for food simply by making itself the sole distributor.in fact,whether it has power to raise price to a level depends on how easy it is for students to find other nearby food suppliers.in any event,if the university has power to charge high prices to those on campus,it can be exploited without regard to whether it contracts with coca cola or eastern or does the job itself.
by contrast,competition in the market to supply vending that this is a different in theory be affected by a exclusive franchise contract between the university and coca cola suppose eastern were the only food distributor in puerto rico beside coca cola and the latter contracts with various outlets deprived eastern of the minimum number necessary to its survival.healthcare,at.even then,one would have to consider whether eastern could feasibly create new outlets by itself.posner,antitrust law ed.
in all events,so far as eastern competitive access to customers is concerned,the key question in market definition is what other customers eastern and its competitors can supply and with what.here,eastern described in its complaint the product as vending machine sales and the geographic area of competition as the university campus.the district court in dismissing the complaint thought that the former was not a meaningful product and the latter was too small and narrowly defined to be a realistic geographic market.
we can confine ourselves here to the geographic market and assume arguendo that supplying food or beverages through vending machines might be a legitimate product for purposes of market analysis.see allegheny bottling bottling,cir.we also put aside any suggestion that vending sales in the university are too small in dollar terms to be of interest to the sherman act.perhaps section includes a de minimis dollar requirement based on the interstate commerce element of the offense,hammes aamco transmissions,cir posner,ia areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed but such a requirement,even if it exists,is low,summit health,pinhas,d,and nothing before us suggests that the dollar volume of vending sales on campus is trivial.
the more important question is the percentage of the market represented by the university.consider that if food and beverage vending within the university is but a modest fraction of all food and beverage vending distribution in ponce and eastern can serve the ponce area,then foreclosure of the campus segment of the market,even by giving coca cola the university franchise for a long period,can not prevent eastern from distributing through other vending machine outlets.this is just another way of saying that,except in special circumstances,a contract restricting a small percentage of a larger available market will have no effect on that market.
here,to put matters in a nutshell,the district court said that the university was obviously a small portion of the distribution market,measured geographically.eastern says that the district court had no business making this determination on a motion to dismiss there is,after all,nothing in the complaint that establishes that eastern and other vending machine suppliers operate in a larger market.eastern also says that even if the district court could reject the university as a valid economic market for distribution,eastern was still entitled to a opportunity to conduct discovery to identify some broader but more plausible market in which foreclosure might still be significant.
as to the first issue,the district court was entitled to take notice that ponce is a major city in puerto rico and,as a matter of common experience,to recognize that food and beverage machines are customarily accessible at a host of public and business points within cities.the idea that one university campus represents even a majority of the vending machine sales in a large city is so improbable that eastern own brief makes no such suggestion quite possibly note eastern location in san juan distribution is an business,but it is enough that it is at least municipal.
eastern does say that for students and faculty the campus may be a geographic market in which they purchase snacks and beverages,and we would not rule out this possibility without more information about student habits and nearby locations.see,cir.but,as noted,this market,even if real,is already captive to the university and a change in exclusive distributors does not further restrict it.eastern,by contrast,could be affected by being excluded from the campus,but it is a distributor which,if it can serve the university,is also capable of serving other outlets in ponce.
at oral argument,eastern counsel said that his client did not need to identify the geographic and product market in the complaint and could have merely alleged effects in a valid economic market.even if this were different views might be taken on this would be no excuse for sustaining a complaint that had shown itself to be inadequate based on the drafter candor.jackson marion county,cir posner.the time of judges and lawyers is a scarce resource the sooner a hopeless claim is sent on its way,the more time is available for plausible cases.
this brings us to eastern position as already noted,eastern argues that even if its initial claim was doomed,it was entitled to add new allegations to the complaint,conduct discovery or at developing other market definitions or theories of antitrust violation.specifically,eastern says that in opposing the motion to dismiss,it told the district court that it might eventually urge that the market was all of ponce or even,depending upon what discovery revealed.
this argument has several variations,and we start with the easiest,namely,the possibility of amending the complaint.once the adversary has answered,amendment is no longer allowed as of right.a,but in general permission is liberally granted where there is no prejudice.fdic consol.mortgage and fin,cir.it is often granted not only pretrial but after a dismissal for failure to state a claim where the court thinks that the case has some promise and there is some excuse for the delay.see wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed.
refusals to allow amendment are reviewed only for abuse of discretion,resolution trust gold,cir,but district judges do not customarily aim to defeat valid claims.here,little had occurred at the time of dismissal beyond the filing of motion papers.it is a fair guess that if eastern had moved to amend the complaint after the dismissal and had offered the court some hope of an amendment raising a plausible antitrust claim,amendment would have been allowed.but eastern did not move to amend
