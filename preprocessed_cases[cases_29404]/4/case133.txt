commercial cleaning services,commercial appeals from the dismissal of its suit.commercial brought this putative suit for damages against a business competitor,colin service systems,colin,under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations statute rico,c.the complaint alleges that colin engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity by hiring undocumented aliens for profit in violation of section of the immigration and nationality act ina,a,a rico predicate offense.according to the complaint,colin illegal hiring practices enabled it to lower its variable costs and thereby underbid competing firms,which consequently lost contracts and customers to colin.colin moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the district court granted colin motion and dismissed the complaint without leave to amend,granting judgment in colin favor,on the grounds that i commercial had no standing to sue because it did not allege a direct injury proximately caused by colin illegal hiring,and ii commercial failed to provide a sufficiently detailed rico case statement as required by the connecticut district court standing order in civil rico cases standing order.
we agree with commercial contentions that its allegations satisfy the proximate cause requirement for civil rico cases and that the deficiencies in its rico case statement filed pursuant to the district court standing order did not justify the grant of judgment in defendant favor.we therefore vacate the judgment.
background 
a.the complaint 
for the purposes of reviewing the grant of colin motion to dismiss,we take as true the factual allegations of commercial complaint,as supplemented by the rico case statement submitted pursuant to the district court standing order.see mclaughlin.anderson,cir.
the parties 
commercial and colin each provide janitorial services for commercial buildings.according to the complaint,commercial is a small company that has bid against colin for competitively awarded janitorial service contracts in the hartford area.colin operates throughout the eastern seaboard and is described in the complaint as one of the nation largest corporations engaged in the business of cleaning commercial facilities.the complaint was filed as a national class action on behalf of colin competitors.
the illegal immigrant hiring scheme 
the complaint alleges that commercial and the members of the plaintiff class are victims of colin pattern of racketeering activity in violation of c referred to as the illegal immigrant hiring scheme.the theory of the case,succinctly stated,is that colin obtained a significant business advantage over other firms in the highly competitive and cleaning services industry by knowingly hiring hundreds of illegal immigrants at low wages.colin illegal immigrant hiring scheme allows it to employ large numbers of workers at lower costs than its competitors must bear when operating lawfully.colin allegedly pays undocumented workers less than the prevailing wage,and does not withhold or pay their federal and state payroll taxes,or workers compensation insurance fees.the complaint refers to colin prosecution in by the united states department of justice for,among other things,hiring at least undocumented workers,continuing to employ aliens after their work authorizations had expired,and failing to prepare,complete,and update employment documents.
the allegations assert that colin is part of an enterprise composed of entities that includes employment placement services,labor contractors,newspapers in which colin advertises for laborers,and various immigrant networks that assist fellow illegal immigrants in obtaining employment,housing and illegal work permits.the complaint neither describes how the undocumented workers allegedly hired by colin entered the country,nor claims that colin had knowledge of how those workers came to the united states.it alleges that colin participation in the affairs of the enterprise through the illegal immigrant hiring scheme violates a,which prohibits hiring certain undocumented aliens,and which is a rico predicate offense if committed for financial gain.see f.
the pratt whitney contracts 
what apparently led to this lawsuit was commercial loss of lucrative cleaning contracts to colin.in,commercial obtained a contract to clean pratt whitney facility at southington,connecticut.after successfully performing on that contract for approximately one year,however,commercial was underbid by colin for cleaning contracts at other pratt whitney facilities in the area.the complaint alleges that,through the illegal immigrant hiring scheme,colin could offer pratt whitney and other potential customers access to a virtually limitless pool of workers on short notice at significantly lower prices than other firms could offer by operating lawfully.as a result,pratt whitney and other large contractors for cleaning services accepted colin lower bids over commercial.
proceedings below 
commercial complaint requests class certification,an award of treble damages,and injunctive relief.commercial submitted a rico case statement with its complaint,as required by the district of connecticut standing order in civil rico cases.colin moved pursuant to.b to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.before ruling on commercial request for class certification,the district court granted colin motion.the court dismissed the complaint primarily on the ground that commercial had no standing to bring suit because its injury did not bear a direct relation to colin racketeering activity as required by holmes securities investor protection,d.the district court believed the perceived deficiency in commercial standing to bring suit was not curable.it therefore dismissed the complaint without leave to amend.the court also asserted,as an alternative justification for dismissal without leave to amend,that commercial rico case statement,filed pursuant to the standing order,was so insufficiently detailed as to violate the intended purpose of giving the defendant basic factual information underlying the rico claim.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
civil rico standinga.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint under.b.see stuto fleishman,cir.dismissal of a civil rico complaint for failure to state a claim is appropriate only when it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with plaintiff allegations.mclaughlin,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting,northwestern bell,d.in applying this standard,a court must read all well pleaded allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see see also de jesus sears,roebuck,cir.
proximate cause 
rico grants standing to pursue a civil damages remedy to a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of.c.in order to bring suit under c,a plaintiff must plead the defendant violation of,an injury to the plaintiff business or property,and causation of the injury by the defendant violation.see first nationwide bank gelt funding,cir.commercial appeal turns in part on whether its complaint satisfies the causation requirement.
rico use of the clause by reason of has been held to limit standing to those plaintiffs who allege that the asserted rico violation was the legal,or proximate,cause of their injury,as well as a logical,or but for,cause.see holmes,at.see also hecht commerce clearing house,cir by itself,factual causation is not sufficient.the requirement that a defendant actions be the proximate cause of a plaintiff harm represents a policy choice premised on recognition of the impracticality of asserting liability based on the almost infinite expanse of actions that are in some sense causally related to an injury.see sperber boesky,cir.in marking that boundary,the supreme court has emphasized that a plaintiff can not complain of harm so remotely caused by a defendant actions that imposing legal liability would transgress our ideas of what justice demands,or of what is administratively possible and convenient.holmes,at.internal quotation marks omitted quoting page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at ed.
direct relation test 
colin contends that the chain of causation between its alleged hiring of undocumented workers and pratt whitney decision to award cleaning contracts to colin instead of commercial is too long and tenuous to meet the proximate cause test of holmes.the defendants in holmes were alleged to have participated in a conspiracy to manipulate the value of the stock of several companies.see holmes,at.two who dealt in large amounts of the manipulated stock were put into liquidation when they experienced financial difficulties after the fraud was disclosed and the value of the manipulated stock precipitously declined.the securities investor protection corporation sipc alleged that the defendants securities and offenses amounted to a pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of the rico statute.it brought suit,based on a subrogation theory,on behalf of certain of the injured firms customers who became unsecured creditors of the firms when the firms became insolvent.see id.at.
the holmes court applied a proximate cause test requiring a direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.id.at.the direct relation requirement generally precludes recovery by a plaintiff who complain s of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant acts.see also laborers local health benefit fund philip morris,cir t he other traditional rules requiring that defendant acts were a substantial cause of the injury,and that plaintiff injury was reasonably foreseeable,are additional elements,not substitutes for alleging and ultimately,showing a direct injury.the court found that the link between the customers losses sipc sought to recover and the defendants stock manipulation was too remote to satisfy the direct relation test.it explained that t he simply can not pay their bills,and only that intervening insolvency connects the conspirators acts to the losses suffered by the customers.holmes,at.the court noted in contrast that the liquidating trustees suing directly on behalf of the defunct would have been the proper plaintiffs.id.at.
the court stressed the difficulty of achieving precision in fashioning a test for determining whether a plaintiff injury was sufficiently direct to permit standing under rico.id.at.t he infinite variety of claims that may arise make it virtually impossible to announce a rule that will dictate the result in every case.internal quotation marks omitted.it expressly warned against applying a mechanical test detached from the policy considerations associated with the proximate cause analysis at play in the case.see id.o ur use of the term direct should merely be understood as a reference to the enquiry that is informed by the policy concerns set out in the opinion.we have accordingly turned to those policy considerations explained in holmes to guide any application of the court direct relation test.see laborers,at t he outer limits of the direct injury test are described more by the holmes court policy concerns than by any,verbal definition.see also first nationwide bank,at.
evaluation of plaintiff claim in relation to the proximate cause test 
we conclude that commercial complaint,when evaluated in light of these considerations,adequately states a direct proximate relationship between its injury and colin pattern of racketeering activity.the holmes court gave three policy reasons for limiting rico civil damages action only to those plaintiffs who could allege a direct injury.first,the less direct an injury is,the more difficult it becomes to determine what portion of the damages are attributable to the rico violation as distinct from other,independent,factors.holmes,at.discussing the difficulty of determining whether customers inability to collect from was the result of the defendants stock manipulation as opposed to the poor business practices or their failures to anticipate developments in the financial markets.second,if recovery by indirectly injured plaintiffs were not barred,courts would be forced,in order to prevent multiple recovery,to develop complicated rules apportioning damages among groups of plaintiffs depending on how far each group was removed from the defendant underlying rico violation.id.at.third,there was no need to permit indirectly injured plaintiffs to sue,as directly injured victims could be counted on to vindicate the aims of the rico statute,and their recovery would fix the injury to those harmed as the result of the injury they suffered.id.
difficulty of determining damages attributable to the rico violation 
the district court found plaintiff claim deficient on the first holmes factor,because a fact finder would be required to determine whether commercial lost business to colin was the result of the illegal immigrant hiring scheme as opposed to independent business reasons,such as the comparative quality of the companies services,their comparative business reputations,the fluctuations in demand for their services,or other reasons customers might have for selecting one cleaning company over another.the district court concluded that,even if a fact finder could make such a determination,the calculation of damages attributable to the illegal immigrant hiring scheme would be daunting,if not impossible.
the difficulty of proof identified in holmes,however,was quite different from the circumstances of this case.here,the plaintiffs bid against the defendant as direct competitors.the complaint asserts that pratt whitney chose colin because colin submitted significantly lower bids in a highly competitive market.according to the complaint,colin was able to underbid its competitors because its scheme to hire illegal immigrant workers permitted it to pay well below the prevailing wage for legal workers.although we do not deny that there may be disputes as to whether the plaintiff class lost business because of defendant violation of a or for other reasons,the plaintiff class was no less directly injured than the insolvent in holmes,whose trustees,the court indicated,would be proper plaintiffs.see holmes,at.if plaintiffs can substantiate their claims,the plaintiffs may well show that they lost contracts directly because of the cost savings defendant realized through its scheme to employ illegal workers.
this theory fits our suggestion in sperber,at,where we affirmed the dismissal on proximate causation grounds of a civil rico complaint by investors whose share values declined in the wake of the defendant guilty plea to insider trading.although we found the causation chain offered by plaintiffs too remote,we distinguished a circumstance where a plaintiff was a direct competitor against a defendant.see id.we stated that the rico statute would grant standing if plaintiff were a bidder against defendant who lost because of defendant reputation or economic power.id where,as here,the parties have bid against each other,the difference between the lowest and second lowest bid is readily discoverable.if commercial can prove that but for colin lower wage costs attributable to its illegal hiring scheme,commercial would have won the contract and would have earned a profit on it,it will have shown a proximately caused injury,compensable under rico.
colin objects that any reduced labor costs were due to its alleged underpayment of workers and failure to pay other costs of doing business,not its participation in the illegal immigrant hiring scheme.in other words,colin claims that commercial complains of an injury caused by the low wages paid to colin not by their immigration status.of course,paying workers less than the prevailing wage and failing to withhold payroll taxes are not rico predicate acts.nonetheless,the purpose of the alleged violation of a,the hiring of illegal alien workers,was to take advantage of their diminished bargaining position,so as to employ a cheaper labor force and compete unfairly on the basis of lower costs.by illegally hiring undocumented alien labor,colin was able to hire cheaper labor and compete unfairly.the violation of a alleged by the complaint was a p
