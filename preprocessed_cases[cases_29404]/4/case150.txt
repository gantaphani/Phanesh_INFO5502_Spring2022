opinion of the court 
in their challenge to new jersey title insurance regulations,appellants would have this court disregard a decision of the united states supreme court and the numerous cases that have relied on it.we are not about to do that.appellants efforts belong in another venue.
background 
appellants,title insurance purchasers,on behalf of themselves and similarly situated consumers,appeal the district court orders dismissing their state and federal antitrust claims against numerous new jersey title insurance companies.appellants claim that the appellee insurers collectively fixed title insurance rates in violation of the sherman act and the new jersey antitrust act.the district court held that appellants complaint is barred by the filed rate doctrine,a lack of standing,and federal and state antitrust liability exemptions.
in new jersey,the department of banking and insurance dobi approves and regulates title insurance rates.see stat.ann.c a.insurers may collectively file rates for approval with the dobi through a licensed rating organization.id.b.appellees are members of and file their rates through the new jersey land title insurance rating bureau njltirb a voluntary association of title insurers acting under new jersey law.app.at.the njltirb operates,more or less,as a clearing house for its constituent members by collecting their proposed rates and supporting data and submitting them to the dobi.in re title ins,wl,at.new jersey thus specifically authorize s cooperative action between or among title insurance companies in rate making.stat.ann.b.
once insurers submit rate filings with the dobi,the commissioner shall make such review of the filing as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the title insurance act.id.b c.the commissioner may approve the rates,id.b a,or,after holding a hearing,issue an order disapproving the rates,id.b b.additionally,the commissioner can only approve rates that are not unreasonably high,and are not inadequate for the safeness and soundness of the insurer,and are not unfairly discriminatory.id.b a.once the dobi issues its approval,each member of the title insurance rating organization shall adhere to the filings made on its behalf.id.b.members,however,can seek to modify their individual rates through a deviation filing.id.moreover,aggrieved parties can challenge title insurance rates through an administrative hearing,after which the commissioner may deem the rates no longer effective.id.b c.
on september,appellants filed a putative class action complaint,alleging that appellees engaged in collective price fixing in violation of section of the sherman act and the new jersey antitrust act.appellants alleged that t hrough njltirb,appellees and their have agreed upon and engaged in concerted efforts to i collectively set and charge uniform and rates for title insurance and attendant services in new jersey,ii embed within these title insurance rates payoffs,kickbacks,and other charges that are unrelated to the issuance of title insurance or the business of insurance,and iii hide these costs from regulatory scrutiny by funneling them to and through title agents.app.at.appellants sought immediate injunctive relief and treble damages.
the district court dismissed appellants complaint under.b but granted appellants leave to amend their claims.specifically,the court concluded that appellants claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine,which precludes antitrust suits based on rates currently filed with federal or state agencies.see in re title ins,wl,at.on november,appellants filed a nearly identical amended complaint which the court also dismissed under b.see in re title ins,wl,at july.the court held that appellants lack standing to seek injunctive relief under article iii of the constitution and section of the clayton act appellants sherman act claim is barred by the mccarran ferguson act antitrust exemption appellants new jersey antitrust act claim is barred by stat.ann.b antitrust exemption and the subsequent amendment of appellants complaint would be futile.plaintiffs appeal.

a.the filed rate doctrine 
courts often trace the filed rate doctrine to keogh chicago northwestern railway.in that case,a shipper alleged that certain railroad carriers conspired to fix freight transportation rates in violation of the sherman act.id.at.the shipper sought damages based on the unusually high rates.id.the supreme court,however,denied the shipper claim because the carriers had been authorized to charge the challenged rates by the interstate commerce commission icc.id.at.the court reasoned that it would be improper to hold carriers civilly liable for enforcing rates that the icc had already approved as legal.id.at.in addition,the court expressed a concern for rate discrimination,stating that the shipper potential damages might,like a rebate,operate to give him a preference over his trade competitors.id.at.finally,the court considered the impracticability of awarding damages based on a lower hypothetical rate,which would require reconstituting the whole rate structure a task that the court viewed the icc as more competent to handle.id.at.i t is the commission which must determine whether a rate is discriminatory,legal at least,in the first instance.
the filed rate doctrine stood undisturbed by the supreme court for almost three quarters of a century when the court the doctrine in square d niagara frontier tariff bureau,d.there,various corporations alleged that the respondents conspired with their rate making bureau to fix freight transportation rates in violation of the sherman act.id.at.the petitioners sought treble damages based on the fixed rates.id.at.they argued that unlike keogh,respondents rates were not challenged in a formal icc hearing,thus claiming that the agency approval was insufficient to trigger the filed rate doctrine.id.at.see also id.at.rejecting that argument,the court reasoned that respondents rates were duly submitted,lawful rates under the interstate commerce act in the same sense that the rates filed in keogh were lawful.id.at.therefore,the court concluded that the petitioners can not bring a antitrust action.see id.at.moreover,the court approvingly quoted the second circuit interpretation of keogh 
rather than limiting its holding to cases where,as in keogh,rates had been investigated and approved by the icc,the keogh court said broadly that shippers could not recover for overcharges whenever tariffs have been filed.

this court has recognized that the filed rate doctrine bars antitrust suits based on rates that have been filed and approved by federal agencies,at.other courts of appeals have also extended the doctrine to rates filed with state agencies.see,wegoland nynex,cir c ourts have uniformly held,and we agree,that the rationales underlying the filed rate doctrine apply equally strongly to regulation by state agencies.nw.bell,cir w e see no reason to distinguish between rates promulgated by state and federal agencies.moreover,although the doctrine has its origins in cases interpreting the interstate commerce act,it has been extended across the spectrum of regulated utilities.gas hall,d.
appellants argue that the filed rate doctrine does not preclude their antitrust claims because those claims do not implicate the doctrine underlying policies.although we have not previously outlined the policies underlying the filed rate doctrine,the court of appeals for the second circuit has explained that the doctrine is designed to advance two companion principles preventing carriers from engaging in price discrimination as between ratepayers,and preserving the exclusive role of agencies in approving rates by keeping courts out of the process,a function that regulatory agencies are more competent to perform.marcus v.at t,cir.these companion principles are often called the nondiscrimination strand and the nonjusticiability strand.id.the nonjusticiability strand recognizes that legislatively appointed regulatory bodies have institutional competence to address issues courts lack the competence to set rates and the interference of courts in the process would subvert the authority of bodies and undermine the regulatory regime.sun city taxpayers citizens utils,cir.the nondiscrimination strand recognizes that victorious plaintiffs would wind up paying less than ratepayers.wegoland,at.
the policies underlying the filed rate doctrine are also reflected in supreme court precedent.in montana dakota utilities northwestern public service,for example,the court refused to grant relief to a petitioner who claimed that its predecessor company had paid unreasonably high electric rates to the respondent.addressing the issue of damages,the court stated that the problem is whether it is open to the courts to determine what the reasonable rates during the past should have been.id.at.although the court did not explicitly mention the filed rate doctrine,it relied on the nonjusticiability principle to deny relief,concluding that reduc ing the abstract concept of reasonableness to concrete expression in dollars and cents is the function of the agency commission.id.
in arkansas louisiana gas,on the other hand,the court relied heavily on the nondiscrimination strand to deny relief.at.there,the plaintiffs,natural gas producers,sued a customer to recover an unfiled gas rate under the parties purchase agreement.id.at.the parties agreement contained a favored nations clause,which allowed the plaintiffs to charge the defendant at a rate higher than the filed rate if the defendant ever purchased gas from another party at a rate higher than the one it was paying the plaintiffs.id.at.relying on the filed rate doctrine,the court recognized that t he considerations underlying the doctrine are preservation of the agency primary jurisdiction over reasonableness of rates and the need to insure that regulated companies charge only those rates of which the agency has been made cognizant.id.at.quoting city of cleveland fed.power comm n.the court denied plaintiffs requested relief,however,specifically because awarding damages based on a rate never filed and thus never found to be reasonable would undermine the congressional scheme of uniform rate regulation.id.at.
as a preliminary matter,appellants argue that the district court erred by concluding that the mere filing and approval of rates with a regulating agency triggers the filed rate doctrine.appellant br.at.according to appellants,that approach is only proper where stare decisis requires the doctrine application to the regulatory scheme at issue.see id.at.thus,before extending the doctrine to a new regulatory context,new jersey title insurance appellants argue that the district court should have determined whether the doctrine underlying policies are implicated.id.at.yet appellants offer no authority showing that those policies are elements in determining whether to extend the doctrine to new areas.the supreme court has indicated that the doctrine applies whenever rates are properly filed with a regulating agency.compare square d,at.applying the doctrine to rates governed by the interstate commerce act and noting that keogh simply held that an award of treble damages is not an available remedy for a private shipper claiming that the rate submitted to,and approved by,the icc was the product of an antitrust violation,with.gas,at.extending the doctrine to rates governed by the natural gas act because they were properly filed with the appropriate federal regulatory authority.furthermore,the second circuit has held that the doctrine is applied strictly whenever either the nondiscrimination strand or the nonjusticiability strand is implicated.marcus,at emphasis added.
appellants argue that this action does not implicate the nonjusticiability strand because it does not any ratemaking determination made by the dobi.appellants br.at.they alleged in their complaint that the dobi has neither actively supervised the defendants collective rate setting scheme nor subjected the defendants to any analysis designed to determine whether their filed rates for title insurance and attendant services conformed to statutory requirements.app.at.appellants therefore claim that the doctrine policy of deferring to agency expertise,nonjusticiability is irrelevant because the dobi did not exercise any meaningful review of the challenged rates.see appellants br.at.
appellees counter that the nonjusticiability strand is actually grounded in concerns about the institutional competence of federal courts to set rates,not the expertise of state regulatory agencies.appellees br.at.thus,they contend that the policy is applicable in this case because appellants requested the district court to award damages based on the rates that would have been paid in the absence of antitrust violations.id.at quoting am.compl.at,app.at.moreover,appellees argue that square d rejected the idea that the filed rate doctrine only applies if an agency conducts meaningful review of the challenged rates.id.at.
appellants argument is meritless because the nonjusticiability strand recognizes that federal courts are to engage in the rate making process,which does not depend on whether agencies actually use their superior expertise.see,montana dakota utils,at.finding that it is not open to the courts to determine what the reasonable rates during the past should have been sun city taxpayers,at c ourts lack the competence to set utility rates wegoland,at courts are simply to systematically second guess the regulators decisions and overlay their own resolution.indeed,appellants argue that t here is no reason a court can not determine what rates the dobi would have approved since it does nothing but rubber stamp rates filed by appellees but,at the same time,suggest that the district court should have determined what the competitive rates would have been in order to award damages.appellants reply br.at.therefore,even accepting appellants logic,their antitrust claims would require the district court to determine the reasonable rate absent the alleged conspiracy a function that regulatory agencies are more competent to perform.marcus,at.additionally,to the extent that the justiciability principle is aimed at preserv ing the agency primary jurisdiction over reasonableness of rates,hall,at,the adjudication of appellants complaint would intrude upon that jurisdiction because it challenges rates that the dobi has already approved as not unreasonably high or unfairly discriminatory.stat.ann.b a 
appellants seek to reinforce their argument that the nonjusticiability strand is only implicated where agencies have meaningfully reviewed the challenged rate by relying on brown ticor title ins,cir.in that case,consumers alleged that various title insurance companies conspired to fix price levels for title search and examination services.id.at.although the insurers filed their rates with regulating agencies,the relevant statutory schemes required only of the rates before they became effective and d id not require compliance with strict guidelines.id.at.the court therefore observed that if the challenged rates were the product of unlawful activity prior to their being filed and were not subjected to meaningful review by the state,then the fact that they were filed does not render them immune from challenge.id.furthermore,the court reasoned that t he absence of meaningful state review allows the insurers to file any rates they want.id.thus,it concluded that the act of filing does not legitimize a rate arrived at by improper action and refused to apply the filed rate doctrine.id.
appellants reliance on brown is unpersuasive.brown adopts a particularly narrow and unprecedented view of the filed rate doctrine.the regulatory schemes at issue in brown also required only of the challenged rates,and it is unclear from the court opinion whether the regulating agencies had to conduct
