port dock holdings,and its two subsidiaries,port dock stone and gotham sand stone whom we will refer to collectively as port dock,appeal from the district court dismissal of their antitrust claim against their erstwhile suppliers crh,plc,oldcastle northeast,and tilcon,known collectively as tilcon port dock stone oldcastle northeast,civ.drh arl,wl.port dock alleged that tilcon monopolized the market for manufacturing crushed stone,or aggregate,by buying out its only significant manufacturing competitor,lone star industries.before the lone star buyout,port dock bought aggregate from tilcon and distributed it after the buyout,port dock alleges that tilcon refused to sell aggregate to port dock,thus depriving port dock of any source of supply and coercing it to sell its assets to tilcon at a sacrifice.the district court held that port dock did not show that it had suffered an antitrust injury.we affirm.
because this case was decided on the pleadings,we take the facts as stated in the complaint.tilcon and its predecessor owned quarries and were in the business of producing aggregate.port dock acted as a distributor,buying its aggregate from tilcon and tilcon predecessor and reselling in long island and the new york metropolitan area.according to the complaint,by the,tilcon produced about of the supply of aggregate in the market area,with only one significant competitor,new york trap rock,which had about of the market share.the complaint alleged that in this market,tilcon attempted to raise prices unilaterally in,but was forced to rescind when new york trap rock did not follow suit.even though port dock was tilcon largest customer,in the early tilcon sought to compete with port dock in the distribution market by soliciting port dock customers and selling them aggregate at prices below tilcon actual cost.in,tilcon acquired new york trap rock parent company,lone star industries,and so captured port dock only alternative source of supply.in,tilcon announced that it would no longer sell aggregate to port dock.tilcon proposed to purchase port dock assets because port dock had no alternative source of supply,it had no choice but to sell on tilcon terms,at a sacrifice price.within weeks of closing the purchase of port dock assets,tilcon raised prices to its customers.port dock filed for bankruptcy in.
port dock filed this antitrust complaint in september,alleging that tilcon had attempted to monopolize the relevant market in violation of section of the sherman act that tilcon had in fact monopolized the market and that tilcon had unlawfully acquired businesses with the effect of substantially limiting competition and tending to create a monopoly in violation of section of the clayton act port dock also alleged state law claims for tortious interference with business relations and unfair competition.port dock defines the relevant product market as the market for aggregate for use in the construction,paving,and concrete manufacturing industries,and the relevant geographic market as long island and the new york city metropolitan area,as well as counties in northern new jersey 
tilcon moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the district court held that port dock had not pleaded an antitrust injury because its injury resulted from tilcon vertical integration into the distribution market,rather than from tilcon acquisition of its competitor in the manufacturing market.port dock stone,wl,at.the court also held that port dock was not an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws because port dock was not a participant in the market allegedly monopolized.id.at.having dismissed the federal claims,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and so dismissed those as well.id.
we review the district court dismissal of a complaint under.b de novo,taking as true the factual allegations of the complaint,but giving no effect to legal conclusions couched as factual allegations.bell atl.twombly,d.the plaintiff factual allegations must be enough to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.id.in last term twombly decision,itself an antitrust case,the supreme court held that a complaint must allege facts that are not merely consistent with the conclusion that the defendant violated the law,but which actively and plausibly suggest that conclusion.id.at see iqbal hasty,cir interpreting twombly as instituting a plausibility standard,requiring amplification of facts in certain contexts.
on appeal,port dock contends that it had antitrust standing because it was both a customer and competitor in the relevant geographic market for aggregate.port dock argues it was tilcon customer at the production level and tilcon competitor at the distribution level.port dock argues that by acquiring lone star industries,tilcon achieved a monopoly at the production level,then expanded vertically into the distribution level and refused to deal with port dock.the loss of the only alternative supplier at the production level rendered port dock utterly dependent on tilcon,which then cut off port dock supply of aggregate.
although port dock substantive claims arise under section of the sherman act and section of the clayton act,the private right of action is provided by section of the clayton act.section confers standing on private plaintiffs in sweeping language a ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained despite the broad language of the statute,courts have carefully parsed antitrust standing in order to avoid use of antitrust laws in ways that could harm competition rather than protecting it.see serpa mcwane,cir.
antitrust standing is distinct from constitutional standing,in which a mere showing of harm in fact will establish the necessary injury.associated contractors of,cal.state council of carpenters,d.in addition to injury in fact to the plaintiff business or property caused by the antitrust violation,antitrust standing for a private plaintiff requires a showing of a special kind of antitrust injury,as well as a showing that the plaintiff is an efficient enforcer to assert a private antitrust claim.see associated contractors,at.paycom billing,mastercard int l,cir suitability of plaintiff evaluated by efficient enforcer factors whether the violation was a direct or remote cause of the injury whether there is an identifiable class of other persons whose would normally lead them to sue for the violation whether the injury was speculative and whether there is a risk that other plaintiffs would be entitled to recover duplicative damages or that damages would be difficult to apportion among possible victims of antitrust injury see generally phillip areeda et,antitrust law,ed.
the necessary antitrust injury is an injury attributable to the anticompetitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny.see atl.richfield usa petroleum,d.showing such an injury requires identifying the practice complained of and the reasons such a practice is or might be anticompetitive.for instance,in atlantic richfield,even where a retail competitor was actually injured due to the effects of an illegal vertical agreement among an oil company and its retailers setting a maximum price for gasoline,the supreme court held the competitor had no antitrust injury.the court said the reason vertical maximum price fixing was illegal was that it would restrain competition by the dealers subject to artificial price caps,preventing the dealers from offering the kind of service they might otherwise choose to provide and depriving customers of such superior service.id.at.competitors who were not bound by the resale price arrangement were not injured by the anticompetitive aspect of vertical maximum price fixing,since they could offer superior service if they liked.nevertheless,those competitors might in fact be hurt by the price fixing in another might make less money because they had to charge lower prices to compete with an artificially capped price.id.at.despite their actual injury from price competition,the competitors would not have antitrust injury,for it is axiomatic that the antitrust laws do not protect a competitor against competition.see also brunswick pueblo,d.
port dock argues that it was a customer and a competitor in the market for aggregate and therefore should have antitrust standing.however,port dock argument that competitors and customers have antitrust standing is oversimplified,as we see from atlantic richfield and other cases in which competitors lacked standing.at.accord cargill,monfort of,d pueblo,at.see also novell,microsoft,cir declining to adopt bright line rule that only consumers or competitors have antitrust standing.we can ascertain antitrust injury only by identifying the anticipated anticompetitive effect of the specific practice at issue and comparing it to the actual injury the plaintiff alleges.
in this case,tilcon alleged anticompetitive practices are acquisition of its only major competitor,resulting in a monopoly in the production of aggregate in,followed by vertical integration into the distribution level and refusal to deal with port dock in,leading to a second tilcon monopoly at the distribution level.
first,we must examine the danger to competition to be expected from tilcon acquisition of lone star for the alleged purpose of monopolizing production of aggregate and compare it to port dock alleged injury.the danger to customers from monopolization of the production level is the danger that the monopolist will raise prices and restrict output.t he rationale for condemning a merger lies in its potential for supracompetitive pricing,not in its potential for cost savings and other efficiencies.seed monsanto,cir quoting phillip areeda herbert hovencamp,antitrust law ed.port dock,although it had formerly been a customer of tilcon,did not suffer an injury from increased prices.indeed,port dock counsel conceded at oral argument that after the acquisition of lone star,tilcon did not raise prices to port dock instead,port dock grievance is that tilcon refused to sell to it at all.in other words,port dock is a former customer.
where a defendant is alleged to have acquired other firms in order to achieve monopoly power at the manufacturing level of a product market,dealers or distributors terminated in the aftermath do not have standing to assert claims under section of the sherman act or section of the clayton act for monopolization at the manufacturing level.see beverage honickman,cir see also norris hearst trust,cir serpa,at and.seed,at john lenore olympia brewing,cir,aff,cir.dealers in this situation lack standing because their particular injury was not caused by an exercise of the defendant newly acquired power to raise prices.see generally eastman kodak image technical,d defining market power as the ability of a single seller to raise price and restrict output associated press,cir defining monopoly power as ability to sustain price substantially above competitive level for significant time.instead,the dealer injury was caused by the manufacturer decision to terminate their relationship,something the manufacturer could have just as well done without having monopoly power.beverage,at reasoning that acquired bottler could have terminated distributors before acquisition serpa,at this loss of a distributorship is neither connected with,nor resulted from,defendant market power john lenore,at the terminations of distributors were an incidental matter which the merger may have made possible,but certainly did not cause.those who would suffer from the defendant exercise of monopoly power would be the dealers or consumers who were forced to buy at higher prices or inferior quality because the defendant had acquired the market power to charge monopoly prices.see precision surgical,tyco int l,d,here,there is no overcharge issue regarding terminated distributor because the distributors no longer deal in defendants products.the only potential victim of a monopoly overcharge would be hospitals and doctors purchasing directly from the manufacturer.therefore,port dock did not plead an antitrust injury from tilcon alleged monopolization of the production level.
next,port dock alleges that tilcon monopolized the distribution level of the aggregate market by expanding vertically into the distribution level and later refusing to deal with port dock.vertical expansion by a monopolist,without more,does not violate section of the sherman act.belfiore times,cir.
here,in addition to vertical expansion by a monopolist,port dock alleges the monopolist refused to deal with a former distributor.a refusal to deal is generally not unlawful unless it is done for the purpose of monopolization.united states colgate.trans sport,starter sportswear,cir.the absence of a legitimate business purpose for the defendant refusal to deal has been seen as circumstantial evidence of improper intent.see aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d otter tail power united states,d eastman kodak so.photo materials.morris commc ns pga tour,cir anticompetitive conduct is conduct without a legitimate business purpose that makes sense only because it eliminates competition internal quotation marks omitted.
our cases establish that when a monopolist has acquired its monopoly at one level of a product market,its vertical expansion into another level of the same product market will ordinarily be for the purpose of increasing its efficiency,which is a prototypical valid business purpose.in beverage honickman,cir,distributors alleged that a bottler,honickman,had monopolized the upstream market by acquiring its principal competitor and had then expanded that monopoly into the distribution level.this court held that there was no anticompetitive effect from this monopolization.id.at.we affirmed dismissal of the beverage complaint for failure to state a claim.id.at.the rationale for our ruling was that a monopolist can only extract one monopoly profit on a product once it enjoys a monopoly at one level of the product market,there is no further monopoly profit to be had from its expansion vertically.accordingly,once honickman had achieved an upstream monopoly,it had no incentive to behave anticompetitively at the distribution level once having achieved the alleged bottling monopoly,therefore,the bottler sole incentive is to select the cheapest method of distribution.id.at.since honickman had no anticompetitive incentive to create a downstream monopoly,the allegations of the complaint made it more likely that honickman chose to eliminate the distributors to increase efficiency,rather than for the purpose of monopolization.id.therefore,a complaint pleading that a defendant expanded vertically and as a result,decided to discontinue doing business with its erstwhile trading partners at the next level down,does not plead an actionable refusal to deal.such allegations are equally consistent with the idea that the monopolist expected to perform the second level service more efficiently than the old trading partners and thus undertook the vertical integration for a valid business reason,rather than for an anticompetitive one.
the same reasoning,but slightly different facts,underlay this court decision in e l consulting doman,cir,cert.denied,d,where a lumber production monopolist allegedly cut off a distributor and created a monopoly in another dealer.we affirmed dismissal of the complaint,holding that there was no anticompetitive incentive for the lumber producer to create a monopoly in retail distribution of its product.id.at.the facts pleaded suggested that the producer acted for the purpose of increasing efficiency in some way like any seller of a product,a monopolist would prefer multiple competing buyers unless an exclusive distributorship arrangement provides other benefits in the way of,for example,product promotion or distribution.id.following this reasoning,the allegations of an exclusive distribution agreement between the monopolist and the new dealer did not state a cause of action under section of the sherman act.id.at.
in light of beverage and e l consulting,the facts alleged by port dock do not establish that the vertical expansion and the accompanying refusal to deal wi
