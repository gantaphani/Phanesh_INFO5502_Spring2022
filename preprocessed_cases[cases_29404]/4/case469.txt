john lippitt originally sued a number of brokerage firms in state court,praying for relief under california unfair competition law ucl that was unavailable in federal court.he now appeals the district court denial of his motion to remand the removed case back to state court.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the decision to retain the case as exclusively within federal jurisdiction.
background 
lippitt complaint 
lippitt has nominated himself as a private attorney general to bring an action on behalf of the general public to challenge the marketing by national brokerage firms defendants of an instrument known as a callable certificate of deposit or callable cd.the complaint scrupulously avoided any pretense of complying with,which calls for a short and plain statement of the claim.instead,it expended some pages of prolixity in an effort to describe a cause of action under california unfair competition law,codified at cal.bus.et.defendants removed the case asserting that the district court had original jurisdiction under and exclusive jurisdiction under of the securities exchange act the exchange act or the act.
in their removal papers,defendants argued that lippitt ucl claim sought to implement and enforce rules and regulations promulgated by the new york stock exchange pursuant to the directive of the exchange act.because lippitt had no private right of action in federal court for the violation of an nyse rule or regulation,see infra,removal of his complaint to federal court,if not remanded to state court,would result in a quick dismissal of the action as soon as requested by the defendants.
the unchallenged removal of an arguably viable state law action from a court where some form of recovery is theoretically available,to a federal district court where a private remedy is categorically impossible results in the case being dismissed.this state of affairs exists because the securities exchange act,which regulates the securities industry,expressly denies a remedy in an action brought by a private class representative to enforce nyse rules,the judicial supervision of which resides exclusively in federal agencies and courts.because the laws of california do provide remedies for the kind of fraud and mendacity alleged by lippitt complaint,he contends that the district court has denied him his day in court.
within the same legislative scheme congress enacted two subsections which,if read literally,create tension between each other.section of the act,now codified at,provides in relevant part 
the district courts of the united states shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder,and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder 
while we agree that any claim that properly falls within the scope of is necessarily federal in character,lippitt asserts that his claim falls outside the scope of,and squarely within,codified at,which provides in relevant part 
t he rights and remedies provided by this chapter shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter,nothing in this chapter shall affect the jurisdiction of the securities commission or any agency or officer performing like functions of any state over any security or any person insofar as it does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder 
on its face,preserves both common law and statutory authority over securities matters and thus reflects congressional recognition of state competence in the securities field.see murphy gallagher,cir recognizing that reflects congress cognizance of the state securities acts and the common law of fraud.in contrast,section confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal courts for suits brought to enforce the act or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.matsushita industrial epstein,d.
as both parties correctly recognize,the exchange act does not completely preempt or occupy the field of securities regulation.see id.at.congress plainly contemplated the possibility of dual litigation in state and federal courts relating to securities transactions.because the act contains an explicit savings clause at,and an exclusive federal jurisdiction clause at,we arrive at the following question does trump,or vice versa,or can they both be given effect 
both parties agree that the exchange act saves existing state laws that provide private remedies to enforce a state own laws to protect its citizens from conduct that is actionable under state law.both parties also agree that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the rules authorized by federal law.disagreement arises from the jurisdictional effect of commencing an action in state court to enforce state law.here,the complaint alleges in a string of wholly needless epithets,misconduct.the alleged misconduct overlaps with conduct that is likewise proscribed by nyse rules,the enforcement of which is exclusively delegated to the nyse and the sec.enforcement is the key word here.lippitt seeks only to enforce state law.he seeks no enforcement of any nyse rule or regulation.
while lippitt contends that his complaint does not assert any rights under nyse rules or regulations,and that he is not seeking to enforce those rules,his complaint unnecessarily describes the alleged conduct of the defendants in terms that track almost verbatim the misdeeds proscribed by nyse rules.this,of course,prompted the defendants to federalize the case by removal.
the able and experienced district court denied lippitt motion to remand his case to state court on the ground that created exclusive federal jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim.lippitt then voluntarily dismissed his case with prejudice,obtaining an appealable final order.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.see concha london,cir p laintiffs may appeal from a voluntary dismissal with prejudice,at least where the plaintiff is not acting pursuant to a settlement agreement intended to terminate the litigation.emphasis in original.
by the nyse under the exchange act 
the exchange act establishes a broad regulatory regime over issuers,markets,and market professionals.congress intended the act to deter fraud and manipulative practices in the securities markets,and thus established full disclosure requirements for information material to investment decisions and administrative avenues for compensating defrauded investors.
while the act provides for direct market oversight by the securities exchange commission,the trading activities of market professionals,like defendants,are overseen by organizations such as the new york stock exchange nyse or the national association of securities dealers nasd.see a see also barbara new york stock exchange,cir detailing interplay between sec and nyse in regulating securities transactions and compliance with the exchange act.
as an association of securities dealers,the nyse has the authority to allow its members to effectuate transactions on its trading floor and the duty to promulgate and enforce rules governing the conduct of its members.see,g see also silver new york stock exchange,d one aspect of the statutorily imposed duty of is the obligation to formulate rules governing the conduct of exchange members.the nyse requires member firms to supervise and control employee activity related to compliance with securities laws and regulations,see nyse rule,as well as to adhere to principles of good business practice in the conduct of their affairs,see nyse rule.when the nyse suspects that a member has violated federal securities laws or internal exchange rules,it must conduct disciplinary proceedings,see d,g,and if necessary impose sanctions subject to review and enforcement by the sec,see d.
callable cds and nyse oversight 
after numerous customer complaints,the nyse initiated disciplinary proceedings in october against one member firm,edward jones,jones for its failure to supervise and control adequately the sale of callable cds by its representatives.see new york stock exchange hearing panel decision,wl.the nyse disciplinary board found that the company sales representatives provided vague and often misleading explanations on the differences between callable cds and traditional cds,thus causing customers to purchase unwittingly an investment that did not suit their financial objectives.
introduced to the marketplace in late,callable cds resemble traditional cds in that both are issued and insured by banks,pay interest at a specified rate in regular intervals,and have maturity dates after which the issuing bank returns the full principal to the investor.however,callable cds differ from their traditional counterparts in that they offer investors a higher rate of return,have much longer maturity periods up to years,and contain a callable component that allows issuing banks to redeem them from the investor after a specified period typically,or months.furthermore,investors may sell their callable cds in a secondary market before maturity without incurring a penalty but will receive only the prevailing market price,rather than the full face amount of the cd.
generally,banks will exercise their option to redeem a callable cd when interest rates fall below the specified fixed rate and will allow the cd to mature when interest rates rise above that rate.accordingly,callable cds may not suitable for elderly investors looking for stable,fixed income instruments with short maturity periods.
the nyse disciplinary board found that elderly investors were the primary victims of the misleading and deceptive practices used by the sales representatives at jones.the board found that representatives lied about the lengthy maturity periods and convinced customers that the investor,instead of the issuing bank,had the option of redeeming the callable cd.see supra.because these deceptive and misleading practices violated several exchange rules,the nyse issued a fine against jones and established a detailed set of disclosure and review requirements with which the firm would have to comply for the next five years to continue selling callable cds.
several months after the disciplinary decision against jones,the nyse issued an information memorandum that essentially echoed its precautions about misleading investors in the sale of callable cds see information memo,long term certificates of practices march.the text advised member firms to distribute informational materials regarding the characteristics and risks of callable cds and cautioned its members to provide accurate market values in their customer reports.
ii.analysis 
complaint rule 
when reviewing a district court denial of a motion to remand,w e begin our analysis with a fundamental tenet of federal complaint rule.sullivan first affiliated securities,cir.the complaint rule is a powerful doctrine that severely limits the number of cases in which state law creates the cause of action that may be initiated in or removed to federal district court franchise tax bd.of california construction laborers vacation trust,d.under this doctrine 
whether a case is one arising under the constitution or a law or treaty of the united states must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration,unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant might interpose.
taylor anderson.
hence,our first task is to determine whether the face of lippitt complaint contains any allegations that would render his cause of action one that arises under federal law.see sparta surgical national of securities dealers,cir we ordinarily determine the existence of a federal question from the face of plaintiff complaint.
lippitt contends that his complaint has been misinterpreted by defendants and by the district court.in particular,defendants have asserted that the complaint seeks an outright ban on the sale of instruments known to the brokerage industry as callable certificates of deposits.answering brief at.the district court appears to have read the complaint that way as well,and that understanding was emphasized in its order denying lippitt motion for remand see pages of that order.lippitt argues that his complaint does not seek any such broad ban.rather,he says,the complaint deals with the way the instruments in question are marketed.what the complaint seeks,according to lippitt,is not a ban on the instrument itself or on sale of that kind of instrument,but rather a ban on false advertising,including defendants use of the monikers callable certificate of deposit and callable cd.reply brief,at.while the complaint is the exact opposite of a model of clarity,it can be read in the way lippitt asserts.because lippitt has disclaimed a broader reach,we need not consider whether a state court action that seeks to ban the sale of a given investment instrument altogether would necessarily be subject to federal jurisdiction.
defendants point out that of the complaint needlessly quotes in substantial part a statement published in the wall street journal by former sec chairman arthur levitt condemning several brokerage firms for selling callable cds to elderly people and calling such conduct misleading,wrong,and immoral.likewise,and describe the disciplinary procedures and the resulting sanctions conducted by the nyse against jones and quote entire passages from the disciplinary decision.the complaint uses these passages as an example of the deceptive practices utilized by defendants in the marketing of callable cds and that defendants in this case engaged in deceptive practices similar or identical to those employed by jones.
while this kind of garrulity in pleading is flagrantly inconsistent with rule,and may shock environmentalists keen on saving trees,it does not of itself,turn a state law case into a federal case.it is a understanding that the mere presence of a federal issue in a state cause of action does not automatically confer jurisdiction,merrell dow pharmaceuticals,thompson,d.it should be obvious,then,that mere references by way of example to statements made by the chairman of a federal agency or from a disciplinary action issued by a registered exchange are not enough to confer federal question jurisdiction.see also rains criterion systems,cir in wrongful termination action,direct and indirect references to title vii were not sufficient to establish federal jurisdiction.lippitt does not allege,nor can he,that statements by former chairman levitt or passages from the nyse disciplinary decision create a liability that is enforceable by a private plaintiff upon all brokerage firms.the appropriate punishment for bad pleading is the striking of surplusage,not removal to federal court where no remedy exists.
artful pleading doctrine 
although the face of lippitt complaint does not present a claim arising under federal law to warrant subject matter jurisdiction,our inquiry does not end there.the artful pleading doctrine is a corollary to the complaint rule,and provides that a lthough the plaintiff is master of his own pleadings,he may not avoid federal jurisdiction by omitting from the complaint allegations of federal law that are essential to the establishment of his claim.hansen blue cross of california,cir quoting paige henry kaiser,cir.
under the artful pleading doctrine,a plaintiff may not defeat removal by omitting to plead necessary federal questions in a complaint.franchise tax board,at.see also sparta,at a plaintiff may not avoid federal jurisdiction by omitting from the complaint federal law essential to his or her claim or by casting in state terms a claim that can be made only under federal law.the artful pleading doctrine allows courts to delve beyond the face of the state court complaint and find federal question jurisdiction by recharacteriz ing a plaintiff claim as a federal claim.precision pay phones qwest communications,d,citing hunter united van lines,cir.
courts should invoke the doctrine only in limited circumstances as it raises difficult issues of state and federal relationships and often yields unsatisfactory results.sullivan,at quoting salveson western states bankcard,cir.while the artful pleading doctrine is a useful procedural sieve to detect traces of federal subject matter jurisdiction in a particular case,it also has substantive implications on the scope of federal jurisdiction and efficiency.see generally arthur miller,artful pleading a doctrine in search of definition.discussing the history of artful pleading doctrine and the implications of doctrinal expansion on federal jurisdiction.
mindful that the district court was treading in a doctrinal minefield,we turn to the same question whether lippitt has artfully phrased a federal claim by dressing it in state law attire.since its first articulation in skelly oil phillips petroleum,courts have used the artful pleading doctrine in complete preemption cases,see metropolitan life ins.taylor,d and substantial federal question cases,see franchise tax,at.subsumed within this second category are those cases where the claim is necessarily federal in character,see brennan southwest airlines,cir,or where the right to relief depends on the resolution of a substantial,disputed federal question,see merrell dow,at.
complete preemption 
in a recent case against a national bank by plaintiffs attempting to plead only state law causes of action for usury,the supreme court clarified when removal was proper under the complete preemption doctrine 
in the two categories of cases where this court has found complete causes of action under lmra and federal statutes at issue provided the exclusive cause of action for the claim asserted and also set forth procedures and remedies governing that cause of action.
beneficial nat.bank anderson,d emphasis added citations and footnotes omitted.in the case before us,the dispositive question is whether the exchange act provides the exclusive cause of action for false advertising and deceptive marketing claims against securities firms selling callable cds id.at.if so,then the cause of action necessarily arises under federal law and the case is removable.if not,then the complaint does not arise under federal law and is not removable.
we conclude that the exchange act does not create exclusive jurisdiction for any and all actions that happen to target false advertising and deceptive sales practices in the sale of callable cds.to be sure,if lippitt were asserting a violation of an sro rule,then,as the parties both agree,this would be a matter of exclusive federal jurisdiction,and therefore removal would be proper.see also exclusive jurisdiction,under section of the exchange act,is for actions brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder emphasis added.but because lippitt challenges conduct solely under state of whether it is legal under sro claims do not fit under section.in contrast to beneficial,where there was no such thing as a claim of usury against a national bank,id.at,here,we can not say that there is no such thing as a claim of false advertising against securities firms.nothing in the exchange act stands for such a sweeping proposition.
substantial federal question cases 
in addition to state law claims subject to complete federal preemption,the artful pleading doctrine allows federal courts to retain jurisdiction over state law claims that implicate a substantial federal question.a state law claim falls within this second category when a substantial,disputed question of federal law is a necessary element of the state claim,rains,at internal citation omitted emphasis in original or the claim is an inherently federal claim articulated in terms,brennan,at or the right to relief depends on the resolution of a substantial,disputed federal question,arco,at internal citation omitted.a careful reading of artful pleading cases shows that no specific recipe exists for a court to alchemize a state claim into a federal court must look at a complex group of factors in any particular case to decide whether a state claim actually arises under federal law.
federal law is not a necessary element of lippitt ucl claim.to bring a ucl claim,a plaintiff must show either an unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business act or practice,or unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.cal.bus.because section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.communications,los angeles cellular telephone company,cal th,d.a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive even if not unlawful or vice versa.id.therefore,lippitt does not have to rely on a violation of the exchange act nor an infraction of an nyse rule or regulation to bring a ucl claim in california state court.he merely has to allege that defendants conduct was either unfair or fraudulent.see saunders superior court,th,d unfair simply means any practice whose harm to the victim outweighs its benefits.fraudulent requires a showing that members of the public are likely to be deceived.internal citations omitted see also day v.at t,th,d prohibits businesses from engaging in advertising practices which are potentially misleading to the public.
while we express no opinion on whether lippitt has made sufficiently detailed allegations of deception and fraud to survive in state court a demurrer or motion on the pleadings,his allegations are sufficient for the limited purposes of this appeal to sustain the elements of his claim without resort to federal law.see rains,at if a plaintiff can support his claim with alternative and independent of which is a state law theory and one of which is a federal law question jurisdiction does not attach.see also roskind morgan stanley dean witter,d,because the unlawful prong of plaintiff claim could be satisfied by either state or federal law,remand was proper.
lippitt here makes no effort to enforce either a provision of the act or a promulgated by the nyse.rather,he seeks to use a state statute,namely california unfair competition law,as a vehicle to hold defendants liable for misleading and deceptive practices associated with the sale and marketing of callable cds.whether he can prove the allegations of the complaint that the term callable cd is a misleading moniker is not before us.if the plaintiff can stay in state court,and if he can prove the allegations of fraud and inherently misleading conduct,there will be time enough for some other court to consider whether the defendants have a defense on the merits.
we recognize that at certain points,the complaint reads somewhat like an attack on the fiscal soundness of callable cds.for instance,the complaint refers to them as propositions and grossly disadvantageous and unsuitable investments that impose loss es far greater than any penalty ever assessed upon early withdrawal of a traditional cd.as discussed above,though,we read the complaint not to challenge the nyse decision to allow brokerage firms to sell callable cds,nor to rest upon the violation of any federal securities law or exchange rule or regulation.we can not allow defendants attempt to expand the scope of in a manner that vitiates state law remedies expressly preserved by.that the specific goal of protecting california customers from dishonest business practices,whether by brokers or otherwise,may comport with the broader regulatory goals of the exchange act and certain nyse rules and regulations is not enough to sweep lippitt complaint within the exclusive jurisdictional ambit of 
in arco,the plaintiff brought a public access claim in state court requesting information about a comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla controlled environmental site.even though the plaintiff suit arose under a state public access statute,the defendant removed,contending that the district court had exclusive original jurisdiction over all controversies arising under cercla.id.at.we disagreed,holding that because plaintiff suit did not challenge a statutory cleanup requirement or environmental standard,it did not amount to a controversy arising under cercla.id.at.similarly,even though lippitt complaint implicates a federally regulated security,it does not d
