factual and procedural background 
whirlpool manufactures household appliances,including kitchenaid dishwashers.howard is a retailer.chavez is a consumer who purchased a kitchenaid product from howard.
chavez sued whirlpool and howard in may on behalf of himself,others similarly situated,and the general public alleging that the defendants had agreed to maintain minimum resale prices for kitchenaid dishwashers.the complaint alleges causes of action for violation of the cartwright act and the unfair competition law.
chavez alleges that whirlpool announced a kitchenaid unilateral price policy the price policy prescribing minimum resale prices for kitchenaid products and informed howard and other retailers that it would monitor their compliance and would refuse to sell kitchenaid products to any retailer who failed to comply.he alleges that whirlpool advised the retailers that there would be no second chances and that any single violation of the price policy would result in the termination of sales to the individual retail store and to all of the retailer other stores.he further alleges that howard agreed to implement the price policy and maintained the minimum resale prices,although howard normally discounted its products,and that howard announced to its employees that the policy would benefit howard and its employees.he alleges in the alternative that even if howard did not voluntarily agree to maintain the minimum resale prices,it agreed under coercion and the threat that whirlpool would terminate sales to howard.
whirlpool demurred to the complaint on the ground that the alleged conduct was lawful.howard joined in the demurrer.whirlpool argued that under the colgate doctrine,if a manufacturer unilaterally announces a minimum resale price policy and a retailer unilaterally complies with the policy,there is no agreement or combination under the cartwright act and no cartwright act violation unless the manufacturer employed coercive tactics to enforce compliance.it argued that chavez allegations of an agreement and coercion were either too vague and conclusory to state a valid claim or alleged specific conduct that was lawful.it argued further that the complaint did not allege an unlawful or unfair business practice under the unfair competition law because the alleged conduct did not violate the cartwright act,threaten an incipient violation of the law,or violate the policy or spirit of the law.
chavez responded that an unlawful combination under the cartwright act exists when a manufacturer coerces a retailer to comply involuntarily with minimum resale prices,and that the complaint adequately alleges coercion.he argued that the complaint could be amended,if necessary,to allege more specific coercive acts after the completion of some discovery.with respect to the unfair competition cause of action,he argued that the price policy is unlawful because it violates the cartwright act and that it is unfair because the harm to consumers outweighs the benefits.
the trial court determined that under the colgate doctrine,whirlpool announcement of the price policy and the retailers alleged acquiescence in the policy were unilateral actions that did not constitute an agreement,and that the complaint did not allege other conduct beyond the announcement of the price policy that would create an unlawful combination.it concluded that since the alleged conduct was permissible under the cartwright act,it was neither unlawful nor unfair for purposes of the unfair competition law.the court therefore sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.
contentions 
chavez contends the complaint adequately alleges that whirlpool coerced retailers to comply with the price policy,creating an unlawful combination under the cartwright act the price policy is unlawful under the unfair competition law because it violates the cartwright act,and it is unfair because the harm to consumers outweighs the benefits and the court abused its discretion by denying leave to amend the complaint to allege additional facts to support both causes of action.

the cartwright act claim 
legal background 
the cartwright act prohibits every trust,defined as a combination of capital,skill or acts by two or more persons for specified anticompetitive purposes.bus.the federal sherman act prohibits every contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade.the similar language of the two acts reflects their common objective to protect and promote competition.state of california ex rel.van de kamp texaco,cal d,business electronics sharp electronics,d emphasizing interbrand competition.since the cartwright act and the federal sherman act share similar language and objectives,california courts often look to federal precedents under the sherman act for guidance.morrison viacom,th,fn,d.
california and federal antitrust law under the two acts generally distinguish between conduct that is per se unlawful and conduct that is evaluated under the rule of reason.the law conclusively presumes manifestly anticompetitive restraints of trade to be unreasonable and unlawful,and evaluate other restraints under the rule of reason.marin county bd.of realtors,palsson cal d,business electronics sharp electronics,supra,at.
