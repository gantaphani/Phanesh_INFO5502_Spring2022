the panel reversed the dismissal for lack of statutory standing of an antitrust complaint alleging that apple,monopolized and attempted to monopolize the market for iphone apps.
plaintiffs argued that fed.civ.g barred apple from raising in its fourth rule motion to dismiss a statutory standing defense omitted from prior motions to dismiss.agreeing with the third and tenth circuits,the panel held that as a reviewing court,the court of appeals should generally be forgiving of a district court ruling on the merits of a rule b motion.the panel concluded that any error in the district court consideration on the merits of apple rule b motion to dismiss was harmless.
disagreeing with the eight circuit analysis in a similar case,the panel held that the plaintiffs were direct purchasers of iphone apps from apple,rather than the app developers,and therefore had standing to sue under illinois brick illinois.the panel concluded that apple was a distributor of iphone apps,selling them directly to purchasers through its app store.the panel remanded the case for further proceedings.
fletcher,circuit judge 
in their current complaint,plaintiffs allege that they purchased iphones and iphone applications apps between and,and that apple has monopolized and attempted to monopolize the market for iphone apps.in ruling on apple fourth motion to dismiss,the district court held that plaintiffs lacked antitrust standing under illinois brick illinois.
we must decide two questions.first,we must decide whether rule g barred the district court from considering on the merits apple fourth motion to dismiss,brought under rule b,in which apple contended that plaintiffs lack statutory standing under illinois brick.we conclude that the district court may have erred in considering this motion on the merits,but that its error,if any,was harmless.second,we must decide whether plaintiffs lack statutory standing under illinois brick.we hold that plaintiffs are direct purchasers from apple within the meaning of illinois brick and therefore have standing.
factual allegations 
the following factual narrative is drawn from plaintiffs current complaint.because the district court dismissed plaintiffs suit under rule b for failure to state a claim,we take as true all plausible allegations.
apple released the iphone in.the iphone is a closed system,meaning that apple controls which apps such as ringtones,instant messaging,internet,video,and the like can run on an iphone software.in,apple launched the app store,an internet site where iphone users can find,purchase,and download iphone apps.apple has developed some of the apps sold in the app store,but many of the apps sold in the store have been developed by developers.apple earns a commission on each app purchased for use on an iphone.when a customer purchases a iphone app,the payment is submitted to the app store.of that payment,goes to apple and goes to the developer.
apple prohibits app developers from selling iphone apps through channels other than the app store,threatening to cut off sales by any developer who violates this prohibition.apple discourages iphone owners from downloading unapproved apps,threatening to void iphone warranties if they do so.
ii.procedural history 
the procedural history of this case is complex.we describe as much of the history as is necessary to resolve the procedural question before us.four named plaintiffs filed a putative antitrust class action complaint complaint against apple on december.counts i and ii of complaint alleged monopolization and attempted monopolization of the iphone app market by apple.count iii alleged a conspiracy between apple and mobility,llc attm to monopolize the voice and data services market for iphones.plaintiffs alleged that they had purchased iphones,but did not allege that they had ever purchased,or attempted to purchase,iphone apps.on march,apple moved to dismiss the entire complaint under rule b for failure to join attm as a defendant.this motion to dismiss was mooted when the district court consolidated the action with another action.
seven named plaintiffs,including the original four plaintiffs,then filed a consolidated putative class action complaint complaint against apple on march.the allegations in complaint were essentially the same as those in complaint,and the same three counts were alleged.none of the named plaintiffs alleged that they had bought,or attempted to buy,an iphone app.attm was not added as a defendant.on april,apple moved again to dismiss the entire complaint under rule b for failure to join attm as a defendant.in the alternative,it moved to dismiss count iii under rule b for failure to state a claim for conspiracy between apple and attm.the district court granted without prejudice the motion to dismiss the entire complaint,even though counts i and ii alleged no wrongdoing by attm.the court specifically ordered plaintiffs either to add attm as a defendant or to forgo count iii.it denied without prejudice apple motion to dismiss count iii under rule b on the ground that,in the absence of attm,the motion was premature.
plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint complaint on september.complaint was essentially the same as complaint,except that count iii was now labeled as preserved for appeal.none of the named plaintiffs alleged that they had ever purchased,or sought to purchase,iphone apps,and attm was not named as a defendant.on november,apple moved under rule f to strike claim iii on the ground that attm had still not been named as a defendant.as part of the same motion,apple moved to dismiss counts i and ii under rule b for lack of article iii standing,and under rule b for lack of statutory standing under illinois brick.this was the first time apple had moved to dismiss counts i and ii.relying on rule g,plaintiffs opposed apple motion to dismiss under rule b on the ground that apple had not moved to dismiss these claims under rule b in its two previous motions under rule.
the district court granted the rule f motion to strike count iii.the district court also granted the rule b motion to dismiss counts i and ii for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,holding that plaintiffs lacked article iii standing to bring those counts because plaintiff failed to allege that they had purchased or attempted to purchase an iphone app.the court declined to rule on the rule b motion to dismiss under illinois brick,concluding that,in the absence of an alleged article iii injury,any ruling would be advisory.the district court dismissed with leave to amend.
plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint complaint on september.complaint alleged only the iphone app monopolization claims,which had been counts i and ii of all of the earlier complaints.for the first time,plaintiffs alleged that they had purchased iphone apps,thereby alleging sufficient injury under article iii to support counts i and ii.complaint added the following allegation specifically addressed to statutory standing under illinois brick 
when an iphone customer buys an app from apple,it pays the full purchase price,including apple commission,directly to apple.apple sells the apps or,more recently,licenses for the apps directly to the customer,collects the entire purchase price,and pays the developers after the sale.the developers at no time directly sell the apps or licenses to iphone customers or collect payments from the customers.
on september,apple filed a motion to dismiss under rule b,contending that plaintiffs lacked statutory standing under illinois brick.the district court agreed and dismissed complaint with prejudice.plaintiffs timely appealed.

iv.discussion 
plaintiffs make three arguments on appeal,of which we need to reach only two.first,plaintiffs argue that rule g barred apple from raising its illinois brick statutory standing defense in its fourth rule motion to dismiss,and that the district court erred in deciding the motion on the merits.second,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in characterizing them as indirect purchasers from apple,and therefore without statutory standing under illinois brick.we address these two arguments in turn.
motions to dismiss under rule b 
rule g provides,except as provided in rule h or,a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.the consequence of omitting a defense from an earlier motion under rule depends on type of defense omitted.a defendant who omits a defense under rules b lack of personal jurisdiction,improper venue,insufficient process,and insufficient service of process entirely waives that defense.fed.civ.h a.a defendant who omits a defense under rule b failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted does not waive that defense.rule g provides that a defendant who fails to assert a defense in a rule motion can not assert that defense in a later motion under rule b,but the defense may be asserted in other ways.fed.civ.h.
our sister circuits disagree about the proper interpretation and application of rule g.the seventh circuit has held that rule g does not foreclose a motion to dismiss under rule b when there has been a previous motion to dismiss under rule.see ennenga starns,cir.rule g does not prohibit a new rule b argument from being raised in a successive motion.the seventh circuit misunderstands rule,reading rule h to provide the only sanction for failure to raise a rule defense in a prior motion under the rule.it is true that rule h singles out several rule defenses for an especially severe sanction.if a defense under rule b is not asserted in the first rule motion to dismiss,rule h tells us that the defense is entirely waived.but rule h provides a less severe sanction for failure to assert a defense under rule b.if a defense under rule b was not asserted in the first motion to dismiss under rule,rule h tells us that it can be raised,but only in a pleading under rule,in a motion under rule c,or at trial.see,english dyke,cir.correctly describing the operation of the rule.
the third and tenth circuits have read rule correctly,but have been very forgiving of a district court failure to follow rule g.see leyse bank of am.nat.ass n,cir.so long as the district court accepts all of the allegations in the complaint as true,the result is the same as if the defendant had filed an answer admitting these allegations and then filed a rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings,which rule h b expressly permits.albers bd.of cty.comm rs of jefferson,cir.w hether the district court dismissed the complaint based on a motion under rule b or rule c makes no difference for purposes of our review.therefore,any procedural error that may have been been committed would be harmless and does not prevent us from reaching the merits of the district court decision.
we agree with the approach of the third and tenth circuits.we read rule g in light of the general policy of the federal rules of civil procedure,expressed in rule.that rule directs that the federal rules be construed,administered,and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.fed.civ.denying rule b motions and relegating defendants to the three procedural avenues specified in rule h can produce unnecessary and costly delays,contrary to the direction of rule.
district courts in this circuit and others are well aware of this.for example,as the late judge pfaelzer recently wrote 
rule g is designed to avoid repetitive motion practice,delay,and ambush tactics.if the court were to evade the merits of defendants defenses here,defendants would be required to file answers within days of this order.they would presumably assert the same defenses in those answers.defendants would then file rule c motions,the parties would repeat the briefing they have already undertaken,and the court would have to address the same questions in several months.that is not the intended effect of rule g,and the result would be in contradiction of rule mandate.
allstate ins.countrywide fin,supp,cal.citations omitted see also banko apple,rs,wl,at cal,internal quotations omitted although rule g technically prohibits successive motions to dismiss that raise arguments that could have been made in a prior motion courts faced with a successive motion often exercise their discretion to consider the new arguments in the interests of judicial economy.davidson countrywide home loans,jma,wl,at cal,internal quotations omitted rule g applies to situations in which a party files successive motions under rule for the sole purpose of delay.doe white,wl,at,citing the substantial amount of case law which provides that successive rule b motions may be considered where they have not been filed for the purpose of delay,where entertaining the motion would expedite the case,and where the motion would narrow the issues involved.moore federal practice endorses this approach.see moore federal practice civil b ecause a b defense is so basic and was not waived,a district court might properly entertain a second motion if it were convinced it was not interposed for delay and that addressing it would expedite disposition of the case on the merits.
recognizing the practical wisdom of these district courts,and of the third and tenth circuits,we conclude that,as a reviewing court,we should generally be forgiving of a district court ruling on the merits of a rule b motion.with that in mind,we turn to the case now before us.
apple first two motions to dismiss under rule b,directed to complaints and,were designed to force plaintiffs to add attm as a necessary and indispensable party under rule.these were appropriate motions,given that count iii alleged a conspiracy between apple and attm to monopolize voice and data services,and given that plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged article iii injury to make that claim.after plaintiffs filed complaint,which had been amended to recognize the success of apple motions under rule b,apple moved again to dismiss.it now moved for the first time to dismiss counts i and ii,relying on rules b and b.a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,including for failure to allege injury sufficient for article iii standing,may be made at any time.see civ.b and h.apple earlier rule motions to dismiss thus in no way foreclosed its motion to dismiss counts i and ii for lack of article iii standing.the district court granted apple rule b motion to dismiss.it refused to decide apple rule b motion to dismiss for lack of statutory standing on the ground that,in the absence of an article iii case or controversy,a ruling on the motion would be an advisory opinion.
complaint realleged counts i and ii,and finally alleged,for the first time,that plaintiffs had purchased iphone apps.that is,complaint finally alleged sufficient injury to confer article iii standing to support counts i and ii.apple moved to dismiss for the fourth time,this time only under rule b for lack of statutory standing under illinois brick.
apple motions to dismiss for lack of standing under rule b,made in its third and fourth motions to dismiss under rule,may not have been within the meaning of rule g.indeed,there is an argument that apple motion to dismiss complaint under rule b,made as part of its third rule motion to dismiss,was not late but premature.at that point,plaintiffs had not alleged injury sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction over counts i and ii.for that reason,the district court properly refused to rule on apple rule b motion,holding that,in the absence of an allegation of article iii standing,any ruling would be advisory.see steel citizens for a better env t.the district court was willing to decide apple rule b motion to dismiss for lack of statutory standing only when plaintiffs finally alleged,in complaint,sufficient injury to confer article iii standing to bring the challenged counts.
even if we assume arguendo that apple motion to dismiss under rule b,made in its fourth rule motion,was late,any error by the dis
