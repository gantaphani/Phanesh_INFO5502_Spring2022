we must decide whether a complaint alleging a national dog club policy banning members that register their dogs with an alternative club raises cognizable claims of group boycott pursuant to the sherman act.we must also decide whether appellants claim of false advertising pursuant to the lanham act was properly dismissed for lack of standing after trial.
the jack russell terrier network of northern california jrtnnc and individual jack russell terrier owners and breeders claudia sprague and georgia fisher collectively appellants appeal the district court judgment,following a dismissal of antitrust claims on motion,and a dismissal of false advertising claims after bench trial,in favor of the jack russell terrier club of america jrtca.the jrtnnc,a former regional affiliate of the jrtca,seeks declaratory and injunctive relief regarding a jrtca policy known as the conflicting organization rule cor,which provides that jrtca affiliates and members will recognize only the jrtca registry of jack russell terriers,and will not register their dogs with conflicting organizations such as the american kennel club akc.the appellants argue that the cor and its enforcement mechanisms constituted a group boycott and false advertising in violation of the sherman and lanham acts,and unlawfully subjected the jrtnnc to liability from those injured by the policy.
the district court granted the jrtca motion to dismiss the appellants sherman act claims.after a bench trial,the district court held that the appellants lacked standing to raise a claim under the lanham act.the appellants appealed the dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and the trial ruling.the jrtca the district court decision to deny the jrtca any of its costs.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
this case arises from a philosophical disagreement between groups of people dedicated to a breed of dog,the jack russell terrier.a preliminary historical note is illuminating jack russell terriers were first bred in the south of england in the to hunt european red fox,both over and underground,for the sport of kings.the breed got its name from a renowned nineteenth century british huntsman and breeder,parson john russell,known as the sporting parson,whose passion for fox hunting and working terriers was legendary.russell developed and bred the particular strain of fox terriers now known as jack russell terriers to emphasize their working and hunting abilities 
the jrtca is a national breed club and dog registry with standards aimed at preserving the characteristics and heritage of the jack russell terrier formed in,the jrtca is the largest organization and registry of jack russell terriers in the world,and derives a substantial amount of income from interstate and foreign commerce in the jack russell terrier as its membership expanded,regional affiliates of the jrtca formed,and were required to comply with the jrtca constitution as terms of membership.the jrtca promotes,runs,and sanctions national dog trials for the jack russell terrier.the club affiliates host regional jack russell terrier shows and trials for which the jrtca provides certified judges.the winners of the regional shows are eligible for the annual national jrtca jack russell terrier show.jack russell terrier owners and breeders attend these jrtca events to have their dogs compete in trial events and be judged in shows to the breed standard to advertise,buy,and sell terriers and to win awards.awards are marks of excellence for dog breeders that they use to differentiate and promote their kennels in future commerce.only jrtca members are allowed to participate in jrtca events.
until recently,the jack russell terrier was not a breed recognized by the akc,the umbrella registry for almost all types of dogs in the united states.consequently,unlike other breeds recognized by the akc,there was no akc registry of jack russell terrier breeders or an certification by which potential owners could verify the authenticity of prospective dogs.aiming to remedy this omission,in a minority group of jrtca members asked the akc to recognize the jack russell terrier as an official breed.they formed a foundation stock of dogs to stand as a base for a akc dog registry and to be used to trace the pedigree of offspring.the akc accepted the jack russell as an official breed in 
the jrtca opposed the akc listing of jack russell terriers,believing that an alternative kennel club standard and registry was not in the best interests of the dog.the jrtca emphasizes the characteristics of the breed,and believes that any kennel club standard would over time change the dog into a show breed,bred for form not function the jrtca undertook a campaign to discourage its members and the public from participating with the akc,which included the adoption of the cor as part of its policy jrtca members who registered their dogs with the akc had their jrtca membership terminated and were not permitted to participate in jrtca dog shows.
georgia fisher and claudia sprague,two of the appellants,are former jack russell terrier breeders who were barred from competing in terrier trials after registering their dogs with the akc.in addition to being denied access to jrtca dog trials and shows,the jrtca blacklisted members who registered with the akc by listing them in the jrtca bimonthly magazine dedicated to jack russell terriers,true grit both fisher and sprague were blacklisted in true grit.the appellants allege that after the listing other jack russell terrier owners and breeders would not associate with fisher,breed with her dogs,or buy her puppies.
fisher and sprague then independently consulted an attorney who wrote letters to the jrtnnc threatening legal action if the jrtnnc refused to allow the breeders to participate in future jrtnnc dog shows the jrtnnc in turn contacted the jrtca,requesting indemnification from the national organization if fisher or any other breeder sued the jrtnnc for enforcing the jrtca cor,and denying those owners the ability to participate in jrtnnc events.the jrtca responded that,while it would continue to require the jrtnnc to comply with jrtca regulations and to enforce them against members who registered dogs with the akc,the jrtca would not indemnify the jrtnnc from any possible liability.the jrtnnc concluded that it could not subject itself and its members to potential liability without indemnification,and therefore would permit owners to participate in its regional terrier events.the jrtca then terminated the jrtnnc charter.
the jrtnnc filed suit in the united states district court for the district of northern california,naming the jrtca and the akc as defendants,and claiming that the jrtca cor was an illegal group boycott of akc dog owners and breeders in violation of of the sherman act.
the akc moved to dismiss based on the fact that the jrtnnc had failed to point to any akc conduct causing the jrtnnc injury.the jrtca also moved to dismiss.the district court granted both motions and dismissed the action,granting leave for the jrtnnc to amend its complaint as against the jrtca.
the jrtnnc filed a second amended complaint,adding sprague and fisher as.the jrtnnc then filed a third amended complaint,adding the jack russell terrier club of great britain as a named,as well as two regional jrtca affiliates,the california south coast jack russell terrier club scjrtc and the jack russell terrier club of central california jrtccc the third amended complaint requested declaratory and injunctive relief,and raised seven claims asserting a group boycott in violation of the sherman act,a claim of false description in violation of the lanham act,and two state law claims of unfair competition.
the jrtca again moved for a rule b dismissal.the district court granted the motion as to the jrtnnc sherman act claims,but denied the motion as to the lanham act claim and the california state law claims.regarding the sherman act group boycott claims,the district court found that the jrtnnc had not alleged that the local clubs pursued different economic goals than the national jrtca,and that this lack of multiple actors was fatal to the plaintiffs sherman act claims under copperweld independence tube,d.the motion to dismiss was denied with regard to the lanham act claim and california state law unfair competition claims,and those issues proceeded to trial.
after a bench trial,the district court concluded that,while the blacklisting advertisement in true grit constituted commercial speech which could violate the lanham act,the jrtca actions did not violate the lanham act or the california business and professions code,et,because its actions were targeted at the akc,not the plaintiffs.the court held that the jrtnnc was not a commercial competitor of the jrtca,and therefore lacked standing to bring a lanham false advertising claim.this timely appeal of both the partial rule b dismissal and trial ruling on the merits followed 
the jrtca also filed a bill of costs for approximately subsequent to the district court ruling.the jrtnnc moved to have the court review those costs.the district court denied the jrtca costs in their entirety,and the jrtca timely that denial.
we first address the district court dismissal of the appellants sherman act claims 
section of the sherman act prohibits e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce.section is intended to prohibit actions that unreasonably restrain competition.see bus.elecs.sharp elecs,d.the challenged action in this case is the cor policy of the jrtca and its enforcement.at the crux of appellants claim is the argument that,by boycotting all or dual dog owners and breeders from jrtca membership and participation in events,the jrtca and participating affiliates unreasonably restrained jack russell terrier commerce that would otherwise stem from those events,the marketplace of jack russell terrier commerce.because jrtca registration is the equivalent of the industry standard,the appellants allege that the jrtca cor manipulates the market unreasonably by eliminating superior dogs not based on merit but simply because of their dual registration.
under a rule of reason analysis of the claim the appellants must allege facts that could establish three elements the existence of a contract,combination,or conspiracy among two or more separate entities that unreasonably restrains trade and affects interstate or foreign commerce.am.ad,gte,cir.our focus is the first element,which contains a basic distinction between concerted and independent action,monsanto serv,d,such that a combination or conspiracy requires the concerted action of more than a single entity.filco amana refrigeration,cir.
in copperweld,the supreme court held that a corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries were legally incapable of conspiring for the purposes of.at.explaining that a parent corporation and its subsidiary have a complete unity of interest t here is no sudden joining of economic resources that had previously served different interests.the court reasoned that the coordinated activity of parties lacking independent sources of economic power and separate interests does not warrant judicial scrutiny.id.at.for example,the officers or employees of the same firm do not provide the plurality of actors imperative for a conspiracy because they are not separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,so agreements among them do not suddenly bring together economic power that was previously pursuing divergent goals.id.at.rather,an action requires scrutiny under of the act if it deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of decision making that competition assumes and demands.id.
lower courts have since applied copperweld reasoning sometimes referred to as the rule to a broader variety of economic relationships.see,freeman san diego ass of realtors,cir describing cases.we have held that the single entity rule applies to relationships,calculators hawaii,brandt,cir,as well as to an agreement between a franchiser and franchisee,williams fischer nevada,cir per curiam.see also levi case,ats prods,holding that a patent holder was legally incapable of conspiring with the patent licensee.two of our sister circuits have also held that separate entities with a common economic interest and without divergent interests are incapable of conspiring for purposes in other contexts.see,bell fur breeders agric,cir holding that a cooperative board members were incapable of conspiring with the member ranches city of pleasant associated,cir holding that the members of an cooperative with common economic interests were incapable of conspiring.this sets the stage for our evaluation whether the jrtca and its regional affiliates could conspire within the meaning of the sherman act as alleged in the complaint.
whether a national breed club and registry and several of its regional affiliates are capable of conspiring as separate entities under of the sherman act is a question of first impression.although the inquiry is unique to the facts of each case,williams,at,in our most recent discussion we distilled general principles to guide us the crucial question is whether the entities alleged to have conspired maintain an economic unity,and whether the entities were either actual or potential competitors.freeman,at summarizing cases and concluding that where firms are not an economic unit and are at least potential competitors,they are usually not a single entity for antitrust purposes.our inquiry is a functional one.copperweld,at.stating the principle that substance,not form,should determine whether a separately incorporated entity is capable of conspiring under united states sealy,d 
assuming all the appellants alleged facts to be true,they have not alleged sufficient facts to support a claim that the jrtca and its affiliates are separate entities pursuing different economic goals,capable of conspiring for sherman act purposes.first,regarding the parties unity of economic interest,the appellants did not allege in what manner the jrtca and the jrtca regional affiliates named as had divergent economic interests,or what goals the affiliates pursued other than those of the jrtca.although we assume the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint,we can not assume any facts necessary to the appellants claim that they have not alleged.associated contractors,california state council of carpenters,d.
in fact,as the district court concluded,the objectives of the jrtca and its regional affiliates are common,not disparate.see copperweld,at.both the national club and its affiliates have a common best interests of the jack russell both the jrtca and its regional affiliates hope to protect their identical economic current and future value of the jack russell terrier breed,as determined by the standards.see id.at.because such coordination does not represent a sudden joining of two independent sources of economic power previously pursuing separate interests,it is not activity that warrants scrutiny.city of pleasant,at t wo or more legally distinct entities can not conspire among themselves if they pursue the common interests of the whole rather than interests separate from those of the group itself.quoting copperweld,at.alterations in original.moreover,the jrtca affiliates are best understood as extensions of the national club rather than independent economic actors.the jrtca affiliation agreement mandates that affiliates,among other requirements,must be solely affiliated with the jrtca adopt the jrtca constitution and uphold its goals,purposes,and policies recognize only the registry and uphold the jrtca policy on conflicting organizations.by the terms of the affiliation agreement,then,the affiliates and the jrtca share a unity of all relevant interests and policies,which are controlled entirely by the jrtca.
second and relatedly,the appellants did not allege that the jrtca and its regional affiliates were actual or even potential competitors,or conspired through the cor to gain some competitive advantage.see freeman,at.nor can the appellants do so the jrtca is a national dog club and registry,and the regional dog clubs named as are groups of jrtca members who have formed a regional dog club to represent the jrtca in their region and host
