while the microsoft antitrust case has captured much media attention,this antitrust case is just as important to the computer program developers involved.here,the lantec companies appeal a district court order dismissing contract and promissory estoppel claims on summary judgment.the lantec companies also argue the district court incorrectly granted novell,novell motion for judgment as a matter of law on several antitrust claims.the facts and legal issues in this case are complex and will be discussed at length.however,the lantec companies basic argument is novell drove them out of business.
we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
factual background 
beginning in the,novell sold a network operating system for connecting computers called netware.james gaskin,mastering netware.a network operating system is the software used to connect computers and other devices,share resources,transfer files,and perform other network services and activities.sue plumley,network administration survival guide.it controls access to the network and allows users to share data.id.
novell also distributed message handling system and global message handling system.these products were messaging transport agents for netware.a messaging transport agent essentially acts as the computer version of a post office it routes,stores,and delivers messages sent by or groupware programs message handling system and global message handling system were designed to be used with the netware operating system and groupware programs.in addition to routing messages,message handling system and global message handling system allow groupware to access security features,printing,file sharing,and other data shared through the netware operating system.
although novell began marketing message handling system and global message handling system in the early,it did not immediately develop groupware programs to be used with message handling system and global message handling system.instead,independent software programers developed this groupware.by making the application program interfaces in message handling system and global message handling system publicly available,novell enabled independent programers to write groupware.software designed using the message handling system and global message handling system application program interfaces can communicate with message handling system or global message handling system and therefore with netware.
in addition to providing application program interfaces,novell participated in a group known as the message handling system alliance.the alliance was a group of independent software developers interested in message handling system.through this group,novell helped independent software programers market,and provide technical support for,their groupware products.
lantec,lantec,lancompany informatica ltda.lancompany,lantec informatica ltda.lantec brazil,and lantraining informatica ltda.lantraining collectively the lantec companies were interested in making groupware using the application program interfaces in message handling system and global message handling system.all the lantec companies grew out of a predecessor brazilian software development company called datarede.originally,datarede worked with novell to distribute netware in brazil.at that time,brazil refused to allow foreign software developers access to the brazilian market unless there were no similar software products designed by brazilian companies.datarede conducted similarity tests to help convince brazilian regulators to allow novell products in brazil.
one of the contract disputes in this case arises from a february letter from novell to datarede that discusses datarede participation in the similarity tests.lancompany now refers to this letter as the datarede agreement and claims novell breached the agreement by failing to fully compensate datarede or its successor company for conducting the similarity tests.
although disputes subsequently developed,datarede began doing more work with novell.as datarede novell business increased,it transferred that business to three new companies headed by marcello thoillier and other partners in the datarede organization.lantec brazil was created to develop software compatible with novell products,particularly netware and message handling system.lancompany was to market novell software,and lantraining was to train people to use novell products.in utah during,thoillier and his associates incorporated lantec,an american sister corporation to the brazilian companies.lantec was charged with translating lantec brazil products from portuguese to english.lantec also began looking for companies to manufacture,market,and distribute the products in the united states.
the lantec companies developed xpostware,a package of software containing menu,fax,and calendaring applications.xpost,the portion of xpostware,used novell message handling system to transport messages using netware.lantec and lantec brazil each entered an original equipment manufacturer agreement with novell to allow them to package xpostware with novell netware and message handling system.
just as lantec was on the verge of offering its xpostware package in the united states,novell and wordperfect announced plans to merge.at this point,the relationship between novell and the lantec companies became strained.the day of the announcement,thoillier indicated he was going to shut down lantec business.the next day,the lantec companies put all their marketing,advertising,and packaging projects on hold.less than a month later,a novell executive left thoillier a voice message stating other executives at novell wanted to terminate the relationship between novell and the lantec companies.although novell subsequently sent a letter stating it was willing to work with the lantec companies and continue the original equipment manufacturer agreements,lantec and lantec brazil argue the letter should be discounted because another novell executive later threatened to drive the lantec companies out of business.the lantec companies never shipped xpostware and made no attempt to actively sell xpostware after the merger.
the merger changed novell approach to message handling system and global message handling system.after the merger,novell released groupwise.rather than being solely a messaging transport agent like message handling system and global message handling system,groupwise contains both the messaging transport agent and groupware.this software design strategy was similar to wordperfect messaging software which also contained both the messaging transport agent and groupware.ultimately,novell quit developing message handling system and focused solely on groupwise.
procedural history 
based on these facts,in,lantec filed a complaint in federal district court in utah.more than a year later,lantec brazil,lancompany,and lantraining joined the suit as plaintiffs.the lantec companies brought state law tort claims,breach of contract claims,and a promissory estoppel claim.in addition,they alleged novell violated federal and state antitrust laws by unlawfully merging with wordperfect contracting combining,or conspiring to unreasonably restrain trade monopolizing,attempting to monopolize,and conspiring to monopolize the worldwide groupware for netware market unlawfully using its monopoly power in the network operating system market to gain a competitive advantage in what the lantec companies designate the groupware for netware market and unlawfully tying the sale of its groupware to netware.see,utah code ann.
prior to trial,the district court granted novell motion for summary judgment on the tort,contract,and promissory estoppel claims.it also dismissed the antitrust claims brought by lancompany and lantraining for lack of standing.the case,however,proceeded to trial on the remaining antitrust claims.after the lantec companies presented their case to the jury,novell moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court ruled in novell favor.lantec,novell,d.
on appeal,the lantec companies raise several issues.we first address the contract and promissory estoppel issues and then examine the antitrust issues.
contract and promissory estoppel claims 
the lantec companies argue the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the breach of contract claim based on the datarede agreement the breach of contract claim based on the original equipment manufacturing agreements the breach of the oral message handling system agreement claim and the promissory estoppel claim.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.cliffs synfuel norton,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in applying this standard,we examine the factual record and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.clinger new mexico highlands,cir,cert.denied,d.
we will address the lantec companies contract and promissory estoppel arguments in light of this standard.
i.the datarede agreement 
lancompany argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its claim novell breached the datarede agreement.the datarede agreement claim is based on a february,letter from novell director of new business development to datarede.prior to the letter,datarede had,under the direction of novell,conducted similarity tests necessary to allow novell to distribute netware in brazil.after the completion of the similarity tests,novell sent the february letter promising a license to build network interface cards with no fee.lancompany refers to this letter as the datarede agreement.
specifically,the letter states novell has agreed to the following measures as recognition of datarede special contribution to the registration and approval of netware no fee for.and are network interface cards.they are essentially hardware that allows a computer to communicate with a network.although novell had the technology for these cards,it typically licensed the technology to other hardware manufacturers rather than producing the cards itself.lancompany contends novell breached the agreement by failing to deliver the license.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of novell,concluding there was no contract because there was no consideration for the letter.the court found there was no consideration for the claimed contract because the benefits granted by the letter were past consideration for datarede earlier participation in the brazilian registration process,a process completed two months before the l etter.furthermore,the court said even if the letter was an agreement,the evidence is that novell did comply with the terms of the letter.the district court later denied a request for rehearing on this issue.
lancompany argues there was sufficient consideration for an enforceable contract because the parties had intended novell to compensate daterede for its participation in the similarity test.lancompany explains e ven though the datarede agreement is dated after the similarity test,novell promises that were memorialized in the document were not made independent of datarede promised performance.lancompany claims daterede,therefore,had a claim for its efforts,and even if the claim for a reward might not have been enforceable,the surrender of its claim in exchange for the datarede agreement was sufficient consideration for the contract.although lancompany does not specifically mention accord and satisfaction,it directs us to accord and satisfaction cases.
generally,past services can not serve as consideration for a subsequent promise.dementas estate of tallas ex rel.first security bank,utah events which occur prior to the making of the promise and not with the purpose of inducing the promise in exchange are viewed as past consideration and are the legal equivalent of no consideration.jensen anderson,utah,past services,when rendered under circumstances as to create no legal liability,are not consideration for a subsequent promise citations omitted.utah law does,however,enforce a subsequent promise based on completed services when the completed service was not meant to be gratuitous and the subsequent promise meets the requirements of an accord and satisfaction.see england horbach,utah,rev on other grounds,utah jensen,at.a party seeking to prove an accord and satisfaction must show an unliquidated claim or a bona fide dispute over the amount due a payment offered as full settlement of the entire dispute and an acceptance of the payment as full settlement of the dispute.promax dev.raile,utah.
we are not persuaded by lancompany arguments.the datarede agreement lacks sufficient consideration to constitute an enforceable contract.lancompany readily admits datarede completed the registration tests before novell sent the letter allegedly creating the datarede agreement.although lancompany brief suggests the letter simply memorialized promises made prior to the completion of the registration tests,there is no evidence in the record to support this suggestion.viewed in the light most favorable to lancompany,the record merely reveals testimony the parties expected datarede would receive some compensation.but,the parties had not agreed upon the terms of datarede compensation before novell sent the february,letter.we,therefore,will enforce the promises in the letter only if they meet the requirements of an accord and satisfaction.
even assuming lancompany is correct in its assertion there was a dispute as to the compensation novell owed lancompany for conducting the similarity tests,we can not conclude the datarede agreement amounts to an enforceable accord and satisfaction.in this case,lancompany needed to show the agreement was in satisfaction of the dispute.see promax,at.but,there is no indication datarede or lancompany ever surrendered any of its potential claims against novell.in fact,the letter embodying the datarede agreement shows the agreement was not in satisfaction of any claims.as the letter itself explains 
in the course of events,datarede made special requests to novell these requests were made without prior agreements,and,in some cases,without a precise definition of the scope or sic the request.some of the requests have been granted,others have been subject to negotiation,and still others must be further defined.
as the letter states,negotiations were still underway concerning datarede requests made incident to the registration tests.furthermore,lancompany does not direct us to any other evidence suggesting the datarede agreement was reached in satisfaction of any claims or in full settlement of any dispute.there is simply no evidence to support lancompany contention it surrendered potential claims against novell to receive the benefits in the february letter.consequently,the alleged datarede agreement fails for lack of consideration.
because we conclude the promises in the letter lack consideration,we need not consider whether novell breached the alleged agreement.the district court was correct in granting summary judgment on the breach of the datarede agreement claim.
ii.breach of original equipment manufacturer agreement 
lantec and lantec brazil claim novell breached its original equipment manufacturer agreements.these agreements allowed lantec and lantec brazil to package their products with novell netware and message handling system products.lantec and lantec brazil claim novell terminated the agreements in april when ron palmeri,a novell executive,left thoillier a voice mail message.they also claim tom pesut,a novell executive,subsequently confirmed the repudiation when he declared that novell would refuse to do business in the future with any of the lantec companies.
the district court granted novell motion for summary judgment dismissing the claims involving the original equipment manufacturer agreements because there was no showing of anticipatory repudiation by novell.the court concluded the agreements required written notice of termination and none was given.in addition,the court noted novell sent a letter reaffirming the agreements and demonstrated a willingness to continue with the agreement s as they existed or to modify them in a way that would be acceptable to all at a subsequent meeting with the lantec companies.the district court later denied lantec and lantec brazil motion for reconsideration on this issue.
we will consider each fact relevant to novell alleged wrongful breach of the original equipment manufacturer agreements in turn.we first consider whether palmeri telephone message constitutes triable evidence indicating novell repudiated the original equipment manufacturer agreements.next,even if novell did repudiate,we ask whether novell successfully retracted the repudiation.finally,we address whether the district court abused its discretion in striking a portion of an affidavit lantec and lantec brazil intended to use to establish pesut alleged threat to refuse to deal with the lantec companies.ultimately,we affirm the district court decisions related to the agreements.
voice mail message 
in april,palmeri of novell left a voice mail message for thoillier.in relevant part,it stated 
i had a meeting with tom pesut yesterday and jim sullivan,who is the director of channel sales and they want to terminate the relationship between the companies.i want to let you know.leave me a voice mail and let me know that you did get in fact this message,i do want you to be surprised when the letter comes from our legal.ok i try to give you a ring back again but it is just gon na be a lit sic tough to reach for the next couple of days.
lantec and lantec brazil argue this message could reasonably be viewed as an anticipatory repudiation of the original equipment manufacturer agreements.
a repudiation occurs when a party to a contract makes an overt communication of intention or an action which renders performance impossible or demonstrates a clear determination not to continue with performance.uniform commercial code cmt.t o constitute a repudiation,a party language must be sufficiently positive to be reasonably interpreted to mean that the party will not perform.scott majors,utah quotation marks and alterations omitted.see also utah code ann.mere expression of doubt as to a party willingness or ability to perform is not enough to constitute a repudiation.restatement second of contracts cmt.b.anticipatory repudiation requires more than statements revealing a party does not want to perform the contract or has misgivings about the contract.hurwitz david richards,utah.
viewing palmeri voice message in the light most favorable to lantec and lantec brazil,we conclude the message was not definite enough to serve as an anticipatory repudiation.the message only states two novell executives wanted to terminate novell relationship with the lantec companies.nowhere in the message does it state novell would not perform its duties under the original equipment manufacturer agreements.
retraction 
even if the voice mail message had been definite enough to act as a repudiation,the undisputed facts show novell subsequently reaffirmed the agreements.utah law provides a repudiating party can retract its repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation canceled or materially changed its position or otherwise indicated that it considers the repudiation final.utah code ann.a party may retract by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform.utah code ann.
after receiving the telephone message,thoillier sent novell a letter stating i am writing this letter to confirm your termination of the original equipment manufacturer agreement s.novell responded with a letter stating i must take exception to a comment made in your letter.y ou referred to novell termination of the lantec agreement s.those agreement s can only be terminated in writing and with appropriate notice.on appeal,lantec and lantec brazil argue the notion that novell could not repudiate unless it terminated the contract s in writing was simply nonsensical and poorly reasoned.assuming termination did not need to be in writing,the letter nevertheless shows novell did not intend to terminate the agreements.further showing novell commitment to the agreements,the letter established a meeting between novell and the lantec companies on may,in las vegas.in closing,the letter reaffirmed,novell is willing to consider any reasonable proposal with respect to the a greement s to make th ose agreement s workable for lantec,mutual termination of the agreement s,restructuring of payment terms,reduction of volume commitment.i think you will find novell to be very accommodating on this issue.
novell actions following the reaffirming letter also demonstrate a commitment to the original equipment manufacturer agreements.in may,the parties met in las vegas to discuss the agreements.the undisputed outcome of the meeting was that t he parties did not reach any agreement as to their respective rights and duties under the lantec original equipment manufacturer a greement s,but that the lantec companies would evaluate their business relationship with novell.
consequently,we conclude the undisputed material evidence shows novell successfully retracted any repudiation of the original equipment manufacturer agreements.
alleged threat 
in their appellate brief,lantec and lantec brazil argue a threat made by tom pesut immediately following the las vegas meeting raised a clear disputed fact about novell intention to repudiate the original equipment manufacturer agreement s.according to a portion of an affidavit submitted by marcello thoillier,pesut,a novell executive,said if the lantec companies opposed the merger novell would immediately sever its relationship with these companies and put them out of business.lantec and lantec brazil argue the alleged threat belied the notion that novell intended to continue doing business with lantec.
the district court did not consider whether the alleged threat created a material issue of fact.instead,the district court struck the portion of thoillier affidavit pertaining to the threat because the court found it was an attempt to create a sham issue of fact.the court noted thoillier was extensively deposed over a period of several days on the same subject matters which form the bases for his affidavit.the court determined the relevant allegation conflicts with thoillier prior deposition testimony regarding the meeting.
we review a district court decision to exclude evidence at the summary judgment stage for abuse of discretion.sports racing,sports car club,cir.under this standard we will not disturb the district court decision unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.united states ortiz,cir.
there is authority for the proposition that in determining whether a material issue of fact exists,an affidavit may not be disregarded because it conflicts with the affiant prior sworn statements.in assessing conflict under these circumstances,however,courts will disregard a contrary affidavit when they conclude that it constitutes an attempt to create a sham fact issue.
franks nimmo,cir citations omitted.in deciding whether an affidavit is an attempt to create a sham issue of fact,the relevant factors are whether the affiant was during his earlier testimony,whether the affiant had access to the pertinent evidence at the time of his earlier testimony or whether the affidavit was based on newly discovered evidence,and whether the earlier testimony reflects confusion which the affidavit attempts to explain.id.
lantec and lantec brazil argue affidavit references to the alleged threat did not directly contradict thoillier deposition testimony.according to their argument,counsel for novell never asked thoillier about his meeting with pesut.instead,thoillier deposition testimony only concerned the may meeting in las vegas with novell officials and counsel for the lantec companies and novell.according to the affidavit,pesut threat came not in the scheduled meeting,but in a private conversation immediately following the meeting.
after reviewing the deposition and affidavit,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling parts of the affidavit contradicted thoillier deposition testimony.during the deposition thoillier was specifically asked whether mr pesut was receptive to a discussion about continuing novell association with the lantec companies.thoillier answered he did not recall these exact words.counsel for novell then asked whether novell had communicated that as far as it was concerned,it was prepared to go ahead with the original equipment manufacturer agreements.thoillier said it was discussed.searching for further clarification,counsel for novell asked to identify the result of the meeting.thoillier admitted lantec and lantec brazil were supposed to decide whether they wanted to modify their agreements with novell and then schedule another meeting with novell.nothing in the deposition questioning suggested thoillier should limit his answers to discussions occurring when all of the people attending the meeting were present.during his deposition,thoillier never mentioned any threats from pesut.consequently,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding the portions of the affidavit related to the alleged threat were contradictory.
lantec and lantec brazil also argue the relevant portion of the affidavit was not intended to create a sham issue of fact.they point to the deposition testimony of lancompany chief financial officer,ovidio rovell,who testified thoillier told him of pesut alleged threat.novell conducted rovell deposition before thoillier.because rovell testimony of thoillier hearsay statements gave novell prior notice of the alleged threat,lantec and lantec brazil argue the affidavit can not be viewed as an attempt to fabricate a disputed factual issue.
while it is true novell had notice of the alleged threat,we can not conclude the district court abused its discretion when other factors suggest the affidavit was intended to create a sham issue of fact.first,thoillier was represented by counsel and during his deposition.see franks,at.second,because the alleged threat is not newly discovered evidence,there is no question thoillier should have known about the alleged threat at the time of the deposition.see id.third,there is nothing in the deposition testimony reflecting any level of confusion or uncertainty concerning thoillier testimony requiring clarification or explanation.see id.given these circumstances,we do not have a definite and firm conviction the district court exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in striking the portions of thoillier affidavit related to the alleged threat.consequently,we will not consider whether the alleged threat would have raised a material issue of fact.
in short,we conclude novell was entitled to summary judgment on the claims involving the original equipment manufacturer agreements.palmeri telephone message was not definite enough to amount to a repudiation of the agreements.even assuming otherwise,the record shows novell subsequently sent a letter reaffirming the agreements and acted in accordance with the reaffirmation at a subsequent meeting.aside from properly stricken portions of an affidavit,lantec and lantec brazil have not directed us to any portion of the record suggesting otherwise.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the breach of the original equipment manufacturer agreement claims.
iii.the alleged message handling system oral agreement 
lantec and lantec brazil next argue novell breached an oral agreement regarding messaging handling system.according to the verified complaint,novell agreed to provide 
increased marketplace exposure approval and promotion of the manufacturer messaging applications competitive advantages in the messaging applications marketplace because of association with netware opportunity for direct input to novell concerning the growth and development direction of message handling system heavy support and promotion of message handling system as the dominant network operating system messaging transport agent and promotion of message handling system for many years to come and freedom from the fear or competition with the network operating system or messaging transport agent.
in return,lantec and lantec brazil contend they agreed to join in and actively but not financially support the message handling system alliance convert existing products to message handling system migrate exclusively to the message handling system engine for development of future messaging applications and promote netware as the network operating system of choice for all messaging applications.they believe novell broke these promises by merging with wordperfect,manufacturing groupwise,and failing to develop message handling system and global message handling system after the merger.
the district court granted novell motion for summary judgment.the court stated lantec and lantec brazil rely exclusively upon the allegations of their verified amended complaint to show the existence and terms of the alleged message handling system oral agreement.the court concluded lantec and lantec brazil had not produced specific evidence to show the existence of the alleged oral message handling system agreement.
unsatisfied,lantec and lantec brazil filed a motion for reconsideration arguing they should have been allowed to rely on their verified complaint at the summary judgment stage.in ruling on the motion,the court recognized that verified complaints can sometimes be used to avoid summary judgment.the district court,however,determined the relevant paragraphs of the complaint could not be treated as an affidavit because they did not relate to facts within thoillier personal knowledge.the court further stated the factual allegations relied upon for this motion are conclusory for example,the complaint lack s specific details of who made the alleged promises on behalf of novell.for these reasons,the district court also denied the motion for reconsideration.
on appeal,lantec and lantec brazil argue the district court erred in refusing to consider the averments in their amended verified complaint as evidence of the contract.they believe the verified complaint shows genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.
w e review a district court decision to exclude evidence at the summary judgment stage for abuse of discretion.sports racing,at.under this standard,we will not disturb a district court ruling unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.ortiz,at.
a district court may treat a verified complaint as an affidavit for purposes of summary judgment if it satisfies the standards for affidavits set out in rule e.conaway smith,cir.according to rule e,an affidavit must be made on personal knowledge,shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence,and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.e.furthermore,a district court need not treat a verified complaint as an affidavit if the allegations contained in the pleading are merely conclusory.conaway,at.see adler stores,cir the conclusory allegation in plaintiff complaint,although verified,are of little help in carrying her burden under rule e.sheinkopf stone,cir holding a trial court must disregard conclusory allegations in a verified complaint when considering a motion for summary judgment.
we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider the amended verified complaint as an affidavit for summary judgment purposes.we agree the allegations in the complaint were conclusory and the district court was,therefore,free to disregard these allegations.this case is similar to mitchael intracorp,cir,where we stated an affidavit was conclusory,vague,lacking in foundation and was insufficient to support the conclusion an agreement had been formed.id.at.in mitchael,the affiant fail ed to state how he learned of the agreement,who exactly represented the other companies,how he could speak for what they wanted or needed,when this agreement or understanding was formed,and how it was to operate.id.here,thoillier averments in the complaint do not reveal who represented novell in making the oral contract.he did not state where or how the agreement was communicated and explains only that the agreement was reached in approximately june.with respect to the formation of the alleged message handling system oral contract,the amended verified complaint did little more than state a legal conclusion as to the terms of the contract.thus,we hold the district court was within the bounds of permissible choice in concluding the verified complaint was conclusory and refusing to consider the complaint as an affidavit.
lantec and lantec brazil do not direct us to portions of the record,other than their verified complaint,to support the alleged breach of the message handling system oral contract.this is so even though thoillier provided an extensive deposition and a supplemental affidavit.because lantec and lantec brazil have not provided record citations,we need not sift through the record in an attempt to find evidence of the alleged oral contract.see gross burggraf constr,cir.for these reasons,the breach of the message handling system oral contract claim fails.
iv.promissory estoppel 
the lantec companies next appeal the district court grant of summary judgment on their promissory estoppel claim.they argue,under the doctrine of promissory estoppel,novell should be held to its promises novell would never compete in the applications market developers who agreed to work with novell would be given access to technical information necessary to write applications for netware and those developers would profit by designing applications solely for netware.the lantec companies allege they relied on these promises to their detriment and should therefore be compensated.
the district court held novell was entitled to summary judgment because the lantec companies had not presented any evidence to support their contention novell made enforceable promises to the lantec companies.it pointed out thoillier candidly admits he ca recall any occasion when a representative of novell ever said that novell would never,ever enter the applications business.as to the other alleged promises,plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence of such promises other than the allegations in their amended verified complaint.thus,the district court concluded,t his is a case where plaintiffs rely on their subjective understanding of alleged vague and nonspecific conversations with novell representations.this is not sufficient to support a promissory estoppel claim.
the lantec companies first argue the district court improperly disregarded the amended verified complaint in reaching its determination.in our prior discussion of the alleged message handling system oral contract,we rejected the argument that the district court acted inappropriately in refusing to consider portions of the amended verified complaint relevant to the oral contract claim.here,we conclude the portion of the complaint related to the promissory estoppel claim is similarly conclusory.the complaint does not reveal which of novell officers or employees made the alleged promises nor does it reveal when,where,or how the promises were communicated.instead the complaint merely recites the alleged promises and concludes novell made the representations and promises with the knowledge and intention that lantec and lantec brazil would detrimentally rely on such representations and promises.the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider these conclusory allegations as an affidavit.see conaway,at.
the lantec companies have not directed us to any portion of the record,other than their complaint,to support their claim novell promised to give developers technical information.likewise,they have not provided citations to the record to support their claim novell promised developers would profit by designing applications solely for netware.because these alleged promises have no support in the record,the district court properly dismissed them.
the lantec companies have,however,directed us to portions of the record to support their claim novell promised to never enter the applications business.therefore,we must decide whether this evidence supports a promissory estoppel claim.we conclude it does not.
under utah law,the elements of promissory estoppel are 
the promisee acted with prudence and in reasonable reliance on a promise made by the promisor the promisor knew that the promisee had relied on the promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person the promisor was aware of all material facts and the promisee relied on the promise and the reliance resulted in a loss to the promisee.
simplot sales king int l,utah quotation marks and alterations omitted.t he alleged promise must be reasonably certain and definite,and a claimant subjective understanding of the promissor statements can not,without more,support a promissory estoppel claim.nunley westates casing,utah.see also simplot,at.
the lantec companies argue the district court improperly disregarded deposition testimony from thoillier,deposition testimony from two independent software developers,and internal novell documents.we will begin our analysis with thoillier testimony.the lantec companies direct us to a portion of thoillier deposition.it states 
q the allegation is made novell promised developers,including lantec and lantec brazil,that novell was only in the business of marketing,distributing netware and would never compete with such developers in the netware applications market.were you ever present when such representations were made 
thoillier continued,saying novell employees jared blauser,roy olsen,and ray noorda all made such promises.
but this is not the end of thoillier testimony.upon further questioning,thoillier retreats from the position he heard specific promises novell would not enter the applications business.when asked specifically what novell said,thoillier answered 
it was the same speech.we are in the application business.we are not in sorry,we are in the operating systems business.we are not in the application business.we fact,the whole industry talks about novell being the switzerland of the software.that why novell partnered with so much sic.that why you have so may application vendors that began to develop for novell networks.
while this statement supports the proposition novell was not then in the applications business,it does not show a certain and definite promise not to enter the applications business.in fact,thoillier eventually admitted he could not recall an instance where novell promised it would never enter the applications business.
q do you recall any occasion when any novell officer or director or employee in your presence said under no circumstances,or words to that effect,will novell get in the applications business 
a i do recall.i just recall until such a time as the merger happened the speech was the same.novell was not going to enter into the application business until the time the merger happened.and then everyone was,even the novell employees were all speechless.
q but you do not recall an occasion where novell anyone associated with novell ever said novell,under no circumstances,will ever get into the applications business is that true 
a no.i do recall.
thoillier testimony established only that novell had stated it was not in the applications business.this is not a clear and definite promise.furthermore,to the extent thoillier deposition claims a promise,it is only his subjective understanding of novell statements that is insufficient to support the claim novell promised it would not enter the applications business.
in addition to thoillier testimony,other lantec employees testified they could not recall any instance where novell clearly stated it would never enter the applications business.the lantec companies never produced an employee or officer of any kind who heard novell make a clear or definite promise novell would not enter the applications business.we can not see how,as a matter of law,the lantec companies could reasonably rely on a promise when nobody at the lantec companies can recall novell specifically making that promise.
nevertheless,we turn to other evidence offered by the lantec companies.they direct us to the testimony of two independent software developers who were making applications for use with message handling system.one developer testified novell repeatedly said it was not in the applications business.t he phrase that i kept hearing from novell people was that we are not in the do develop applications.we develop the network operating system or as they call it,the plumbing.again,this testimony,at most,establishes the fact novell was not initially in the applications business,but does not show novell promised it would never enter the applications business.other similar testimony is,likewise,unhelpful to the lantec companies argument.
finally,the lantec companies direct us to internal novell documents written by jeff callo,a novell employee.novell argues these documents were not part of the record below when the district court granted summary judgment and lantec can not rely upon them now.the lantec companies do not respond to this argument in their reply brief.after reviewing the copies of the summary judgment motion and response provided as part of the record on review,it appears these documents,while referenced in the lantec companies brief,were not presented to the district court.our examination on review is confined to an examination of materials before the lower court at the time the ruling was made.allen minnstar,cir quotation marks and alterations omitted.we will not reverse the grant of summary judgment based on evidence not before the district court.id.quotation marks and alterations omitted.consequently,we will not consider the documents written by callo.
in sum,we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the promissory estoppel claim.the lantec companies are not entitled to rely on their conclusory verified complaint.they have offered no additional evidence on their claim novell promised it would provide technical information or their claim novell promised the lantec companies would profit by developing message handling system applications.in addition,the lantec companies failed to produce any evidence of a clear and definite promise novell would never enter the applications business.further,the lantec companies reliance on any promise was unreasonable when they could not produce a single officer or employee who remembered hearing the promise.
antitrust claims 
having resolved the contract and promissory estoppel claims,we turn to the antitrust claims.in their complaint,the lantec companies alleged the merger was an unlawful vertical merger because it lessened competition in the groupware for netware market in violation of novell contracted,combined,and conspired to unreasonably restrain trade and commerce in violation of novell monopolized,attempted to monopolize,and conspired with wordperfect to monopolize the groupware for netware market in violation of and novell unlawfully used its monopoly power in the network operating system market as leverage to gain a competitive advantage in the groupware for netware market in violation of the lantec companies also brought identical claims under utah antitrust statutes.see utah code ann,
prior to trial,the district court granted novell motion to dismiss the antitrust claims brought by lancompany and lantraining finding the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.neither lancompany or lantraining appealed this ruling.
the case proceeded to trial on the antitrust claims brought by lantec and lantec brazil.after lantec and lantec brazil presented their case,novell moved for judgment as a matter of law.lantec,d at.the district court granted the motion concluding the antitrust claims should fail because lantec and lantec brazil failed to establish the existence of the alleged groupware for netware market lantec and lantec brazil failed to produce evidence of any conspiracy between novell and wordperfect and lantec and lantec brazil failed to produce evidence of antitrust injury.id.at.in their appeal,lantec and lantec brazil challenge each of these conclusions.
we review the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo,using the same standard as the district court.baty willamette,cir.according to the federal rules of civil procedure,i f during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue,the court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party.a.judgment as a matter of law is warranted only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the party opposing the motion.baty,at quotation marks and citation omitted.we must,however,affirm the grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of novell if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis with respect to a claim under the controlling law.id.quotation marks and alterations omitted.with this standard in mind,we will examine each of the district court conclusions.
relevant market 
lantec and lantec brazil argue they produced evidence sufficient to establish a groupware for netware market.we disagree.
the relevant market is a market relevant to the legal issue before the court.scfc ilc,visa usa,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.in order to prevail on all their antitrust claims,except the conspiracy to monopolize claim lantec and lantec brazil must establish the relevant market.united states du pont de nemours,d holding d etermination of the relevant market is a necessary predicate to a finding of unlawful merger under tv communications network,turner network television,cir holding a unreasonable restraint of trade claim requires proof the defendant entered a contract,combination or conspiracy that unreasonably restrains trade in the relevant market emphasis added full draw prods.easton sports,cir holding monopolization and attempted monopolization claims under require proof of the relevant market catlin washington energy,cir holding leveraging claims under require proof of the relevant primary and secondary markets 
in this case,lantec and lantec brazil bear the burden of defining the relevant market.see tarabishi mcalester reg l,cir.the relevant market is made up of the product at issue and available substitutes for that product.see visa usa,at.in defining the relevant market,two aspects must be considered the product market and the geographic market.rural,feist publ ns,cir.in this case,we divide our discussion of lantec and lantec brazil evidence of a worldwide groupware for netware market first into expert testimony and then into lay testimony.
expert testimony 
lantec and lantec brazil argue the testimony of their economic expert,john beyer,is sufficient to establish the groupware for netware market.beyer testified the relevant market was groupware for netware users.after hearing beyer testimony at trial,the district court found the testimony lacked foundation,was unreliable,and should be excluded in its entirety.the district court concluded beyer did not employ in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes an expert in the field of economics and industrial organization.specifically,the court stated beyer used unreliable data did not understand computers or the computer market testified the relevant market was determined by consumer purchasing patterns but did not conduct or cite surveys revealing consumer preferences did not calculate the of demand to determine which products were substitutes changed his opinion from the opinion he gave in an earlier expert report and did not address changes in the computer market.further,the district court found portions of beyer testimony were in nature and would not assist the jury.we agree with the district court assessment.
federal rule of evidence governs the admissibility of expert witness testimony.under rule,expert testimony is admissible if it will assist the trier of fact and if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.id.daubert merrell dow,d,outlines the framework a district court should use in determining whether to admit evidence under rule.
under daubert,courts measure reliability of scientific evidence by considering whether the technique can and has been tested whether the technique has been subjected to peer review the known or potential error rate of the technique the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique operation and whether the technique has gained general acceptance in the scientific community.
united states call,cir citing daubert,at,cert.denied,d.we review de novo whether the district court properly followed the framework set forth in daubert.id.at.if,however,the district court correctly applied the daubert standards,we may reverse only if we find the district court abused its discretion.id.
from its order,it is clear the district court followed the daubert framework.therefore,we look to see whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding beyer testimony.after reviewing beyer testimony,we conclude the district court order excluding the testimony is thorough and.we see little benefit in reproducing the reasoning from the district court order.
we will,however,comment on one particularly troubling aspect of beyer testimony.throughout his testimony,beyer relied heavily on his personal experience as president of a consulting firm which installed a new network operating system.before lantec and lantec brazil hired beyer as an economic expert,his consulting firm was looking for a new network operating system.in an effort to make an informed purchase,beyer spoke with the technology experts at two or three other consulting firms in the washington,area.lantec and lantec brazil characterize beyer limited personal experience as reliable and scientific interviews.in reality,beyer attempted to spin anecdotes from a handful of personal conversations with firms in a limited geographic area into evidence of a worldwide product market.these conversations are not sufficient facts or data to support beyer conclusions.the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding beyer testimony.
lay testimony 
lantec and lantec brazil argue e ven without beyer testimony,there was more than sufficient evidence for the jury to find the existence of the groupware for netware market.
the district court held lantec and lantec brazil had not produced sufficient lay testimony or other evidence to establish a relevant market.lantec,d at.it concluded lantec and lantec brazil had not presented evidence to support the groupware for netware product market because they did not present evidence on the costs of the various products or of how the consumer would react to a price increase in such costs,there is no evidence of price sensitivity.there is no evidence of consumer preferences.id.at.the district court also held the skimpy evidence of lantec and lantec brazil own experiences was not sufficient to support a geographic market.id.at.
in their opening brief,lantec and lantec brazil argue the district court impermissibly weighed evidence and made credibility determinations in holding as a matter of law that lantec failed to establish the existence of the groupware for netware market.lantec and lantec brazil point to novell documents stating novell belief customers wanted groupware tightly integrated with netware.they further claim lantec marketing firm recognized the existence of the groupware for netware market and advised lantec to focus on the submarket of groupware made for netware.
while lantec and lantec brazil offered lengthy arguments as to how the record supports their definition of the product market,their opening brief did not challenge the district court conclusion that they had not proven a geographic market.novell responded to lantec and lantec brazil opening brief by arguing lantec and lantec brazil had waived any appeal of the district court ruling on the geographic market.only then,in their reply brief,did lantec and lantec brazil argue the worldwide geographic market was established.
we are under no obligation to address the district court geographic market ruling because lantec and lantec brazil did not raise the issue in their opening brief.see stump,at.since proof of relevant market requires evidence of both a product market and a geographic market,feist,at,we can affirm the district court decision simply because lantec and lantec brazil failed to properly appeal the geographic market ruling.
even if lantec and lantec brazil had properly raised their argument against district court ruling on the geographic market,their definition of a worldwide geographic market fails.the geographic market consists of the area of effective competition.bacchus,arvin,cir.it is the narrowest market which is wide enough so that products from adjacent areas can not compete on substantial parity with those included in the market.westman comm hobart int l,cir quotation marks and alterations omitted,cert.denied,d.the size of the relevant geographic market depends on a number of factors,including p rice data and such corroborative factors as transportation costs,delivery limitations,customer convenience and preference,and the location and facilities of other producers and distributors.harris young,marquette,cir.see also kaplan burroughs,cir.
lantec and lantec brazil have not pointed us to any facts in the approximately pages of record that specifically address price data,the location and facilities of other producers,or any of the other factors cited by courts as relevant to determining the relevant geographic market.instead,lantec and lantec brazil claim they presented evidence sufficient to establish a worldwide geographic market because lantec established that it sold xpost,its first groupware product,around the world.they also state they established that lantec intended to sell xpostware around the globe as evidenced by the numerous domestic and foreign distribution contracts it negotiated.
neither of lantec and lantec brazil arguments is effective.first,under lantec definition of groupware products containing and one other messaging application,xpost is not groupware.xpost consisted solely of an application.consequently,sale of xpost in several different international markets can not establish a worldwide groupware market second,the fact lantec and lantec brazil were,through distributorship agreements,attempting to sell their products in several different countries is not,by itself,helpful.t he geographic market is not comprised of the region in which the seller attempts to sell its product,but rather is comprised of the area where his customers would look to buy such a product.tunis.ford motor,cir.see also morgan,strand,wheeler biggs radiology,cir holding where the plaintiff company competes does not define the relevant geographic market.
because lantec and lantec brazil have not properly appealed the district court determination of the geographic market and,in any event,did not introduce evidence from which a jury could find a worldwide market,we need not consider whether they introduced evidence sufficient to establish a groupware for netware product market.we,therefore,affirm the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law on the unlawful vertical merger claim,conspiracy to restrain trade claim,monopolization claim,attempted monopolization claim,and leveraging claim.
ii.conspiracy 
having affirmed the dismissal of the other antitrust claims,we must now consider whether lantec and lantec brazil have established their conspiracy to monopolize claim brought under.according to tenth circuit case law,a conspiracy to monopolize claim requires proof of the existence of a combination or conspiracy to monopolize overt acts done in furtherance of the combination or conspiracy an effect upon an appreciable amount of interstate commerce and a specific intent to monopolize.tv communications network,at quotation marks and citation omitted.
