five carbonated soft drink bottlers with franchises to distribute royal crown cola in various territories within the region a four state region including parts of arkansas,louisiana,and texas where the three borders meet,and also nearby southeast oklahoma sued the company and several distributers of both and dr pepper in the same area for using calendar marketing agreements cmas with retailers to unreasonably restrain trade,monopolize the market,and attempt and conspire to monopolize the market in violation of the texas free enterprise and antitrust act of tfeaa and the antitrust laws of the other three states.the district court rendered judgment on the jury verdict for the plaintiffs,awarding damages incurred throughout the region and permanently enjoining,in specified counties in each of the four states,certain conduct that it determined to be anticompetitive.the court of appeals affirmed 
we address two issues.one is whether texas courts can adjudicate and remedy an anticompetitive injury occurring in another state,either under the tfeaa or the law of that state.we hold that the tfeaa will not support extraterritorial relief in the absence of a showing that such relief promotes competition in texas or benefits texas consumers.we also hold that texas courts,as a matter of interstate comity,will not decide how another state antitrust laws and policies apply to injuries confined to that state.the other issue is whether the plaintiffs have shown substantial harm,real or threatened,to competition in the relevant market as a result of the defendants conduct.we conclude that there is no evidence of such harm and that the lack of evidence is fatal to all of the plaintiffs claims.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals,dismiss the plaintiffs claims of injury occurring in other states,and render judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing on their claims of injury occurring in texas.
dr pepper,royal crown cola,and other carbonated soft drinks csds are distributed wholesale by bottlers and sold retail to the public in supermarkets,convenience stores,small grocery stores,and other outlets.in the region in the,the bottler,enterprises,and five of its affiliates collectively cce also distributed dr pepper and held about percent of the market for nationally branded csds worldwide,enterprises,was responsible for percent of sales.the bottler had about percent of the market,leaving five royal crown cola franchisees with the remainder.each of the five rcc franchisees was restricted to operating in an assigned territory some of which overlapped one,harmar bottling company,in texas and oklahoma two,beverages,and bolls distributing,in texas and arkansas one,hackett beverages,in arkansas only and one,royal crown bottling,in louisiana only none of the five operated entirely within texas,and two operated entirely outside texas.
these five rcc franchisees sued cce and the company,which manufactures collectively,coke,complaining of their use of cmas with csd retailers in the territories plaintiffs served.the rcc franchisees also sued the manufacturer of,the company,its parent,pepsico,and two bottlers,but these defendants settled before trial,and therefore we do not discuss the allegations against them.generally speaking,a cma provides that during stated periods of time a retailer will promote a wholesaler products in preference to competing products in exchange for payments and price discounts from the wholesaler.
for csds,price and prominent retail display are critical marketing factors.thus,the promotional preferences called for in cmas used by csd wholesalers include outside and advertising,prominently located displays in impulse zones such as near checkout stands where purchase decisions are often made,enlarged shelf and cooler space,and reduced prices.typically,cmas do not prohibit retailers from selling competing products but do require more favorable promotion of the wholesaler products and limited or no promotion of competing products.cmas may also require retailers to price the wholesaler products below competing products,even if the differential is achieved by pricing competing products higher than they otherwise would be.cmas typically cover only specific time periods during the year,not the entire year,and are terminable at will by either the retailer or the wholesaler.retailers receive price discounts and direct payments and bonuses for their promotional efforts.
the rcc franchisees concede,as they must,that cmas are used throughout the country and have repeatedly withstood antitrust challenges and that cmas,including cmas previously used by coke,are not in themselves.but they complain that coke used cce dominant position in the region aggressively to negotiate cmas with terms that suppressed competition from other bottlers.specifically,the rcc franchisees complain,and the evidence shows,that in the region 
coke had cmas with most retailers,including virtually every major retailer other than,since most could not afford to refuse a cma with coke given the market dominance of and dr pepper.
coke cmas generally covered weeks per year,even though their cmas in other areas often covered only weeks.
coke cmas prohibited or limited retailer advertising of competing national brands during the covered periods.
coke cmas sometimes required retailers to price featured packages cans,for example below competing products during a promotional period,or to always price certain packages below competing products sometimes requiring prices as much as cents less per ounce,even when competitors wholesale prices were below cce,so that retailers had to charge higher prices for competing products than they otherwise would have in order to comply with the cmas.
for a few retailers,coke cmas paid bonuses for not carrying competitive flavors of root beer and orange and grape drinks at all,thus driving competing products from stores in some areas and allowing cce to raise the prices of its drinks.
cce increased its prices at times in some locations,even though sales were increasing.
some of coke cmas required that in refrigeration units its products be displayed in horizontal sets at level so as to be most easily seen by consumers,and that no other refrigerated products be located near a store area.
although coke did not require retailers to give its products more shelf space,refrigerated area,or floor displays than was commensurate with its percent share of the csd market,it sometimes required that part of that space be used for soft drinks sold by cce that had no market share at all like barq root beer versus a w,minute maid orange and grape drinks versus sunkist and welch,and sprite versus.this left little space for competing drinks.
because of the limited retail display space,the rcc franchisees could not introduce two other products,rc edge and diet rite,into the market without diverting space already occupied by their other products.
bottlers had no difficulty getting shelf space at,where there were no coke cmas,and often sold for more than competing csds,reflecting the difference in the wholesale prices.
an economist testified for the rcc franchisees that coke use of cce market share to force retailers into cmas inhibited competition and negatively impacted the rcc franchisees sales he also testified that coke was monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the csd markets served by the parties and,if left unchecked,would succeed but he offered no opinion on how the cmas affected price and output in any relevant market as a whole and made no attempt to quantify to what extent,if at all,coke had foreclosed competition in the relevant markets.
coke offered evidence that the promotional efforts encouraged by their cmas resulted in higher volumes of csds sold and lower prices generally,that the rcc franchisees products were available in all areas to any consumers who wanted them,and that the rcc franchisees could have attempted to negotiate cmas with retailers or increase their own promotional efforts but intentionally chose not to do so.there was also evidence that cce competed vigorously with the bottlers.but the jury found none of this evidence persuasive.
the rcc franchisees alleged that throughout the coke had engaged in an unreasonable restraint of trade and had monopolized,attempted to monopolize,and conspired to monopolize the csd market in their exclusive territories in the region,all in violation of the tfeaa and the antitrust laws of arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma.coke did not dispute the rcc franchisees assertion that the laws of the other three states were identical to texas law,and accordingly the district court presumed they were.the court did not define the relevant geographic market for the jury but instructed the jury that they could consider various factors in determining the relevant market or markets.the jury found that cce had engaged in monopolization or attempted monopolization,that cce and the company had engaged in an unreasonable restraint of trade and a conspiracy to monopolize,that cce and the company had acted willfully or flagrantly,and that in so doing cce and the company had wrongfully interfered with the rcc franchisees existing and future business relationships with retailers.the jury was asked to find actual damages for both antitrust and tortious interference claims,including past and future lost profits and lost franchise value,separately as to each of the five rcc franchisees.for the three operating in two states,the verdict did not distinguish between damages incurred inside and outside texas.the court trebled the total actual antitrust damages of as required by statute credited paid by the pepsi defendants in settlement,and rendered judgment against coke for,plus attorney fees.the court also enjoined coke from prohibiting any retailer from engaging in any form of advertisement or promotion of any nationally branded csd,prohibiting any retailer from displaying or placing cold equipment for any nationally branded csd,prohibiting any retailer from selling any nationally branded csd or flavor,requiring or suggesting that any retailer use horizontal sets,or requiring or suggesting any retailer use a ratio to allocate space in cold equipment,through any contract or incentive program,in any county or parish where the rcc franchisees operated,in arkansas,louisiana,oklahoma,and texas,for a period of seven years.the text of this broad and detailed injunction is set out in the appendix 
the court of appeals affirmed it rejected coke argument that the district court should not have awarded damages and injunctive relief under the tfeaa for conduct that occurred outside texas.quoting from section of the act,the court concluded that t he language of the texas statute is clear in its intent to cover monopolistic practices in commerce occurring wholly or partly within the state of texas.further,because cmas had been executed in texas and provided that texas law would govern disputes,the court stated that coke could not avoid the protections to texas consumers provided by that same law.the court did not explain how texas consumers were protected by relief granted the rcc franchisees for coke conduct in other states.alternatively,the court determined that the judgment could be based on the rcc franchisees alleged violations of arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma antitrust statutes,and absent any contention that those statutes differed from texas law,we presume that the laws of those states are the same as ours.
with respect to liability,the court rejected coke argument that the absence of any evidence showing a foreclosure of competition in any relevant market was fatal to each violation claimed by the rcc franchisees.the court did not take issue with coke assertion that such evidence was lacking but reasoned instead that liability could be based on evidence that enforcement of any of several cma provisions ranging from limitations on shelf space and placement,to advertising requirements and limitations on both external and advertising of competitors products,to provisions,to pricing requirements that ensured coke products would have a price advantage over other soft drinks could be read to restrict trade and impact competition the court concluded simply that a lthough any one of the se factors might be insufficient to allow the jury to conclude coke had acted to restrain trade,due to the numerous factors presented in evidence,it is not appropriate to take this determination out of the hands of the jury.as for the rcc franchisees monopolization claims,the court rejected coke argument that there was insufficient evidence to define the relevant geographic market,and held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find monopolization,citing testimony that a bottler with percent market share could impose its market terms on retailers,that at least one retailer felt compelled to accept cma terms and that coke targeted one bottler with the intention of taking it out of competition 
we granted the petition for review in this court,as in the court of appeals,coke raises a number of issues.we find it necessary to address only two.
coke argues that the district court could not entertain an action for damages and injunctive relief based on injury that occurred in other states,either as a violation of the tfeaa or as a violation of the other states laws.in effect,the argument challenges the district court jurisdiction over the rcc franchisees claims of injury outside texas.coke does not argue,and therefore we do not consider,whether such an action would interfere with interstate commerce in a way prohibited by the united states constitution we consider only the reach of the tfeaa and whether a texas court will enforce the antitrust laws of other states.
the rcc franchisees answer that the injuries they incurred outside texas were actionable under the tfeaa because those injuries resulted from coke conduct within texas,specifically,its business and policy decisions made at its offices in texas and contract negotiations often handled in texas,and because use of cmas throughout a regional market that extended into texas harmed consumers in texas by affecting their ability to obtain the benefits of competition.in any event,the rcc franchisees contend,they were entitled to sue in texas for violations of the antitrust laws of arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma.we take up each of the rcc franchisees arguments in turn.
a principle of federalism is that n o state can legislate except with reference to its own jurisdiction.in a case in which the missouri supreme court held void a contract that was invalid under its state law but valid under the law of new york,where it was made,the united states supreme court reversed,explaining 
it would be impossible to permit the statutes of missouri to operate beyond the jurisdiction of that state and in the state of new york and there destroy freedom of contract without throwing down the constitutional barriers by which all the states are restricted within the orbits of their lawful authority and upon the preservation of which the government under the constitution depends.this is so obviously the necessary result of the constitution that it has rarely been called in question and hence authorities directly dealing with it do not abound 
but obvious and necessary though the principle may be,it is an abstraction without easy application in a freely mobile society.a dispute may have contacts with multiple states whose laws differ,and the choice of which state law will govern necessarily gives that law some extraterritorial effect 
it is an especially sensitive matter for a jurisdiction to extend its laws governing economic competition beyond its borders.such laws necessarily reflect fundamental policy choices that the people of one jurisdiction should not impose on the people of another.in the international context,the united states supreme court recently refused to allow an action under the sherman antitrust act for outside the united states,even if that had domestic effect required for a statutory exception,when its adverse foreign effect was independent of its adverse domestic effect,and that independent foreign effect was the sole cause of the injury at issue the supreme court reasoned 
no one denies that america antitrust laws,when applied to foreign conduct,can interfere with a foreign nation ability independently to regulate its own commercial affairs.but our courts have long held that application of our antitrust laws to foreign anticompetitive conduct is nonetheless reasonable,and hence consistent with principles of prescriptive comity,insofar as they reflect a legislative effort to redress domestic antitrust injury that foreign anticompetitive conduct has caused.
but why is it reasonable to apply those laws to foreign conduct insofar as that conduct causes independent foreign harm and that foreign harm alone gives rise to the plaintiff claim why should american law supplant,for example,canada or great britain or japan own determination about how best to protect canadian or british or japanese customers from anticompetitive conduct engaged in significant part by canadian or british or japanese or other foreign companies we can find no good answer to the question 
similarly,within our federal system one may ask why should texas law supplant arkansas,louisiana,or oklahoma law about how best to protect consumers from conduct and injury in those states or to put the shoe on the other foot,why should another state law supplant texas law about how best to protect consumers from conduct in texas there is no good answer.
this is particularly true when the conduct complained of is not a type widely regarded as per se,as for example horizontal is but is instead thought to impair competition in some instances and enhance it in others,like the vertical marketing restraints in this case the principle of federalism that requires states to respect each others divergent laws on the former type of conduct,even when there is stronger consensus about its effects,is especially compelling when only the latter type of conduct is involved and there is wide room to disagree.one state legislature can not dictate to other states what can and can not be tolerated in economic competition.this is so obviously the necessary result that it needs no supporting authority.
we need not decide exactly how this principle limits the extraterritorial effect the texas legislature could give its antitrust laws.we conclude,as a matter of statutory construction,that the legislature did not intend for the act to be enforced as it has been is,by awarding damages and injunctive relief for injury that occurred in other states.we start with the principle that a statute will not be given extraterritorial effect by implication but only when such intent is clear 
the rcc franchisees argue,and the court of appeals held,that two provisions of the tfeaa clearly show that it can be enforced outside texas.
one,section b,states 
no suit under this act shall be barred on the grounds that the activity or conduct complained of in any way affects or involves interstate or foreign commerce.it is the intent of the legislature to exercise its powers to the full extent consistent with the constitutions of the state of texas and the united states 
the rcc franchisees argue from this provision that since a plaintiff is not precluded from suing under the act merely because interstate commerce is affected or involved,a plaintiff is therefore entitled to sue merely because interstate commerce is affected or involved.the argument is obviously lacking in logic.section b removes a defense to suit to the extent it can constitutionally do so it does not create a basis for suit.the mere involvement of interstate commerce does not permit a defendant to escape suit,but neither does it permit a plaintiff to sue.coke contends that the act does not afford an action for redress of injury that occurs outside texas,whether interstate commerce is affected or not.section b simply does not speak to that contention.
the other provision on which the rcc franchisees rely is section,which states 
the purpose of this act is to maintain and promote economic competition in trade and commerce occurring wholly or partly within the state of texas and to provide the benefits of that competition to consumers in the state.the provisions of this act shall be construed to accomplish this purpose and shall be construed in harmony with federal judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes to the extent consistent with this purpose 
in the rcc franchisees view,as long as relief provided by the act will promote competition in texas commerce,the same relief can extend to conduct in arkansas,louisiana,oklahoma,or anywhere else in the world to promote competition there.that construction of the provision is simply unreasonable.what the act says,rather plainly we think,is that it is to be used to promote competition in texas,even if the trade or commerce involved extends outside texas it does not say that it is to be used to promote competition outside texas as long as the trade or commerce involved extends into texas.this is consistent with section b,which indicates that the act purpose of redressing injury in texas is not to be defeated merely because the injurious conduct also occurred in other states.the provision does not extend the act purpose to promoting competition outside texas,as by remedying extraterritorial injury,which would provide no benefit to consumers in the state.the rcc franchisees do not argue that compensating them for injury suffered in arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma will promote competition in texas or benefit texas consumers,and we do not see how they could on the record in this case.rather,the rcc franchisees argue only that because coke engaged in the same conduct in texas and the other states and caused the same type of injury throughout the region,the act affords relief for injury outside texas.it does not.
the fact that coke made decisions in texas regarding the cmas used in other states,negotiated some of those cmas in texas,and used the same cmas in texas does not bring redress of the resulting injury in the other states within the tfeaa purpose.competition in texas markets is not maintained or promoted,nor are texas consumers benefited,by enjoining coke from engaging in such conduct with respect to markets outside texas or by awarding the rcc franchisees damages incurred in their operations outside texas.
the tfeaa does not,in clear language,afford a cause of action for injury outside the state,and we will not imply one.this construction is consistent with the requirement of section that the act be construed in harmony with federal judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes to the extent consistent with its purpose.the sherman antitrust act is a comparable federal antitrust statute and the united states supreme court has construed it to reach conduct outside our borders only when the conduct has an effect on american commerce.
the court of appeals further justified extraterritorial enforcement of the tfeaa in this case because coke provided in cmas that texas law would govern disputes.even if we assume that parties could agree to an extraterritorial enforcement of the tfeaa,and it is not at all clear to us that they could,the disputes in this case are not among the contracting and csd among coke and the rcc franchisees,competing bottlers who had no agreement about what law would govern their disputes.
having concluded that the rcc franchisees complaints of extraterritorial injury were not actionable under the tfeaa,we turn to their argument that such injury was actionable under the laws of the states in which injury occurred.long ago we observed that in c ases in which a right given by the statute of one state is sought to be enforced in the court of another,in which laws exist giving a like right under the same facts,it seems to be generally held that courts of the latter state will recognize and enforce the right given by the statutes of another state.or as the united states supreme court has stated,where the statute of the state in which the cause of action arose is not in substance inconsistent with the statutes or public policy of the state in which the right of action is sought to be enforced,the forum court will allow the action the rule is largely one not of constitutional necessity but of interstate comity,a principle of mutual convenience whereby one state or jurisdiction will give effect to the laws and judicial decisions of another.the united states supreme court has explained that 
the full faith and credit clause does not require the enforcement of every right conferred by a statute of another state.there is room for some play of conflicting policies a state may,on occasion,decline to enforce a foreign cause of action.in so doing,it merely denies a remedy,leaving unimpaired the plaintiff substantive right,so that he is free to enforce it elsewhere 
the forum court may decline to entertain an action based on another state statute if the enforcement of the right conferred would be obnoxious to the public policy of the forum,or the liability imposed is deemed a penal one.
the rcc franchisees have not attempted to show that the antitrust statutes of arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma give a like right under the same facts as texas law or are not in substance inconsistent with the tfeaa or public policy in this state.they simply contend that these other states laws must be presumed to be identical to texas law because coke has made no assertion to the contrary.it is true that texas courts can presume that the determinative law of another state is the same as texas law absent proof or argument to the contrary but no such presumption can be applied here,in light of the policy directive incorporated in the tfeaa.as noted above,section states that the act shall be construed to accomplish its purpose,which is to maintain and promote economic competition in trade and commerce occurring wholly or partly within the state of texas and to provide the benefits of that competition to consumers in the state.we will not presume that arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma antitrust law is identical to the tfeaa,because we would then be required to construe that law to redress the rcc franchisees injury from coke conduct in those states to maintain and promote competition in texas and provide the benefits to texas consumers.since,as we have seen,the injury in those states was independent of injury in texas,this would obviously be nonsensical,not to mention a significant imposition on our sister states.nor can we take a less strict approach and replace texas in section statement of purpose with the names of each other state,because that would require us apply the law to the rcc franchisees claims of injury in the other states so as to maintain and promote competition in each of those states and provide its benefits to their consumers,respectively.for a court in one state to undertake to determine what would benefit competition and consumers in another state would pose a significant affront to the interstate comity sister states should accord each other in our federal system.
this difficulty can not be avoided by ignoring section altogether.it states what is otherwise apparent,that enforcement of antitrust laws like the tfeaa must serve economic policy that has broad public impact,about which there can be considerable disagreement among jurisdictions in a case like this one.when antitrust law was much younger,justice cardozo observed 
there are some rules of private law which have been shaped in their creation by public policy,and this,not merely silently or in conjunction with other forces,but avowedly,and almost,if not quite,exclusively.these,public policy,as determined by new conditions,is competent to change.i take as an illustration modern decisions which have liberalized the common law rule condemning contracts in restraint of trade the field is one where the law is yet in the making or better perhaps in the remaking.we can not doubt that its new form will bear an impress of social needs and values which are emerging even now to recognition and to power 
the united states supreme court has more recently observed that varying times and circumstances give antitrust law changing content we do not think that the courts of one state should determine for another state the economic theory and social needs and values that provide content to its antitrust laws.
the rcc franchisees claims under arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma law affect not only the parties to the case who operate there but consumers in parts of each of those states.the general rule that a state will enforce a right created by another state statute is intended to foster interstate comity the rule may be reflected in the forum own statutes,as it is in the texas wrongful death act,for example,which allows a cause of action for nonresidents and for death outside the state and provides that t he court shall apply the rules of substantive law that are appropriate under the facts of the case including another state statutes.the rule helps assure stability and predictability in commercial transactions when the forum court is called upon to apply another state version of the uniform commercial code in such instances,interstate comity is respected by a forum court enforcement of another state statutes.but when the forum court must determine policies that broadly impact the public of another state in order to adjudicate rights claimed under that state statutes,interstate comity is protected by abstention,not enforcement.
although cases abound in which courts allow actions under other states statutes,the parties have not cited one in which a court either allowed or disallowed an action under another state antitrust statutes,even though many states,like texas,enacted antitrust laws more than a century ago.the issue is not likely to have arisen,we think,because a court refusal to entertain an action based on another state antitrust law does not deprive the plaintiff of a forum.one would ordinarily suppose that the plaintiff would sue in the courts of the state where the injury occurred,which will have jurisdiction over the defendant by virtue of its conduct in the state.there is no reason to believe the arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma courts would not have jurisdiction over the conduct in issue here.alternatively,the plaintiff could sue in federal court for violation of federal antitrust laws,on which most state laws are based,and try to pursue pendent state law claims in these circumstances,it is not necessary for interstate accommodation that a state antitrust laws be enforced in the courts of another state.
the dissent argues that the trial court application of other states antitrust laws is merely a matter of choice of law with no jurisdictional implications.but the issue is not whether antitrust claims involving actors,conduct,and public injury all in another state should be governed by that state law or texas law.that decision would be relatively simple the other state law should govern.rather,the issue is whether a texas court can or should enforce law that is so so as to affect the economy of another state.principles do not address that issue.
the dissent also suggests that whether a state court should adjudicate a case based on another state antitrust law is better determined by principles of forum non conveniens,a venue matter that is waived if never requested.we are not persuaded that forum non conveniens is merely a venue matter.a texas statute governing wrongful death,survival,and personal injury actions requires courts,on a proper written motion,to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of forum non conveniens when,inter alia,the claimant is not a legal resident of the state and,irrespective of whether this doctrine is jurisdictional,it is not an apt framework for analyzing the issue before us.while an important consideration for forum non conveniens is the public interest in having a matter decided where it arises,a concern with jurisdictional overtones,the doctrine tends to focus on the practicalities of litigating in one place or another,such as the availability of evidence,the convenience of the parties,and the imposition on the chosen forum resources here,the parties do not argue that it would have been more convenient to try this case in one of the other states a few miles away.the issue is not whether it is convenient for a texas court to apply another state antitrust law to an extraterritorial injury,but whether it is proper,as a matter of comity,for a texas court to do so.
the dissent stresses that not only are the antitrust laws of arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma presumptively the same as texas law for purposes of this case,these states statutes are virtually identical to texas statute,which is not surprising,given that they are all modeled on federal law.but it is precisely this characteristic that raises the issue of their applicability in a texas court like federal law,economic theory and social needs and values give them changing content.because of the importance of policy in determining and enforcing antitrust laws,we think a state antitrust laws should be applied by its own courts.the dissent worries that this makes antitrust enforcement inefficient,especially in a case like this where market conduct is alleged to have straddled state lines.but if the rcc franchisees had wanted efficiency,they could have sued in federal court under federal antitrust laws.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court should not have entertained the rcc franchisees claims under arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma law.
we are left with the rcc franchisees claims of injury in texas from coke use of cmas in violation of the tfeaa.coke argues that the claimed violations require proof of harm a substantial foreclosure of competition or a pervasive,adverse impact on price,output,or choice but that there is only evidence of harm in relatively isolated instances and no evidence of substantial foreclosure or effect in any relevant market.coke concedes that cce had a percent share of the csd markets in the region,but it contends that competition in the csd markets in that region was always vigorous and that the rcc franchisees individual businesses suffered from too much competition,not too little.the rcc franchisees agree that evidence of market harm is required to prove an unreasonable restraint of trade,and to a lesser extent,they say,monopolization,but they argue that such evidence is not necessary to prove an attempt or conspiracy to monopolize.in any event,the rcc franchisees contend,the record contains evidence of market harm sufficient for liability.
in analyzing these contentions,we must,as we have noted,construe the tfeaa in harmony with federal antitrust caselaw to promote competition for consumers benefit because our own caselaw is limited,we rely heavily on the jurisprudence of the federal courts.the rcc franchisees never argue that the vertical marketing restrictions imposed by the cmas are unlawful per se,leaving us with the rule of reason to determine whether those restrictions amount to an unreasonable restraint on competition.as the united states supreme court has stated 
although vertical agreements on resale prices have been illegal per se since miles medical john park sons,we have recognized that the scope of per se illegality should be narrow in the context of vertical restraints.in continental,gte sylvania,d,we refused to extend per se illegality to vertical nonprice restraints we noted that especially in the vertical restraint context departure from the standard must be based on demonstrable economic effect rather than upon formalistic line drawing.we concluded that vertical nonprice restraints had not been shown to have such a pernicious effect on competition and to be so lacking in redeeming value as to justify per se illegality.rather,we found,they had real potential to stimulate interbrand competition,the primary concern of antitrust law.
the extensive record in this case is replete with evidence that coke used its dominant market position to extract from retailers agreements with terms it might not otherwise have been able to obtain to promote its products with more favorable advertising and store displays and lower prices.unquestionably,coke cmas could have had anticompetitive and monopolistic effects.the court of appeals concluded that the jury was therefore entitled to infer that the cmas did have such effects but to allow such an inference violates the rule of reason analysis that must be applied to such conduct.there must be evidence of demonstrable economic effect not just an inference of possible effect.
there is no evidence quantifying the effect of coke cmas in any relevant evidence,for example,that the cmas had the effect of foreclosing a specific percentage of competition in any relevant market.but the rcc franchisees contend that no such evidence was required.they argue that to the extent they were required to show market foreclosure,evidence that it was substantial was sufficient but even if market foreclosure need not have been quantified by a specific percentage,there is no evidence that it was substantial.the evidence is only that the cmas promoted coke products over its competitors and made it more difficult for them to compete.further,while there is evidence that sometimes retailers priced some packages of csds higher than they would have so that they could meet their agreements to price and dr pepper lower,consumers could have avoided the effect by going down the street to another store.there is no evidence that such isolated instances impacted consumers throughout any exclusive territory,much less throughout the region.while consumers may have paid more on occasion in a particular store,there is no evidence that coke cmas caused consumers to pay higher prices generally.
the rcc franchisees argue that even if they failed to show market harm,that failure was not fatal to their claims of monopolization,attempted monopolization,and conspiracy to monopolize.since coke does not dispute that it has a percent market share in the region,which is sufficient evidence to support a jury finding of monopoly power to prove monopolization the rcc franchisees were required to show only the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historical accident.but this requires evidence of some harm to competition in the market,which is missing in this case.for the same reason,the rcc franchisees claim of conspiracy to monopolize must fail and to prove attempted monopolization,the rcc franchisees were required to show that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.again,since there is evidence only that coke cmas could have had an adverse effect on competition in a relevant market,not that they actually did,existence of the cmas alone can not prove coke engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct.
because the rcc franchisees failed to prove an antitrust violation,their claim for tortious interference with a business relationship must also fail.such a claim can not survive without an antitrust violation because tortious interference with a business relationship requires proof of independently tortious or unlawful conduct and rcc franchisees expressly state here that they did not plead tortious interference with contract.
we agree with the rcc franchisees that coke use of cmas store by store and area by area can not be viewed in isolation but must be seen as a whole in assessing their impact on the market by the same token,the effects can not be viewed in isolation but must be assessed with respect to the relevant markets there is no evidence any relevant market claimed by the rcc franchisees was harmed by coke cmas.
remarkably,the dissent would hold coke liable for per se violations of the antitrust fixing,group boycott,and advertising though the rcc franchisees do not themselves allege that any of coke conduct was a per se violation.no court in the cases that have been brought to our attention has concluded that vertical marketing agreements like coke cmas,by themselves,violate antitrust laws under a analysis and no court of which we are aware has held that a defendant is liable for a per se violation of the antitrust laws that the plaintiff never alleged.doubly unprecedented,the dissent requires no further answer.
accordingly,the court of appeals judgment is reversed.the rcc franchisees claims of injury occurring in other states are dismissed.on their claims of injury occurring in texas,judgment is rendered that the rcc franchisees take nothing.

after buying up distributors of the leading soft drink brands in the area,coke began demanding that retailers stop advertising competing brands,stop selling some of them,and artificially raise the prices of the rest.retailers who refused to play along were punished with higher wholesale prices only a behemoth in its own right successfully refused.
there is a line between competing and bullying,and the jury found that coke crossed it.as evidence in the record would allow reasonable jurors to reach that conclusion,i would not render judgment to the contrary because the court does,i respectfully dissent.
choice of law is not jurisdictional 
this suit concerns competition in counties,of which are in texas.the court vacates most of the jury verdict because it concerns counties outside texas,holding that texas courts have no jurisdiction of such claims.this jurisdictional ruling is unprecedented.
i agree texas law can not extend beyond the limits of our sovereignty can not punish foreign conduct that was legal where it occurred can not govern foreign conduct that has no effect here and can not regulate prices in foreign stores merely because texans might shop there but this verdict was not limited to texas law.
the bottlers asserted texas law applied,but pleaded alternatively that the laws of arkansas,louisiana,and oklahoma outlawed the same conduct.they asserted that our neighbors antitrust laws were the same as our own,and coke never denied it.the jury simply found that coke unreasonably restrained trade and monopolized the relevant markets.unless our sister states define monopolies or restraints of trade differently than we do,it makes no difference whether the jury findings were based on texas law or some other 
the trial court punitive damages question did ask jurors if coke wilfully and flagrantly violated texas antitrust laws,and part of its prolix instructions defined trade and commerce as economic activity undertaken in whole or in part for the purpose of financial gain involving or relating to any goods or services within the state of texas.but in conducting a proper analysis,we must first decide whether texas law conflicts with the laws of other interested states,as there can be no harm in applying texas law if there is no conflict.unless there is some conflict between the antitrust laws of arkansas,louisiana,oklahoma,and texas,we can not reverse the jury verdict,as these two brief references to texas made no difference 
instead of resolving this issue with rules,the court treats it as a jurisdictional defect.until today,no one has ever suggested the trial court had no jurisdiction of this case.certainly not pages of briefing never mention subject matter and never once challenge the trial court jurisdiction.coke instead argued below and argues here that texas law does not apply to competition in markets outside texas that is a issue,not one of jurisdiction.
the distinction is important because issues unlike jurisdictional issues can be waived,as coke has done here.coke maintains that it objected to the application of texas law,but concedes that it never requested the application of any other state laws or offered proof of any of them.while the trial court could have judicially noticed those laws,it was not required to do so under rule of the texas rules of evidence when a party fails to request judicial notice of the law of another state as permitted under rule,texas courts will simply presume that the law of the other state is identical to texas law.
this presumption is much older than rule itself.we stated in that i n the absence of proof the court will presume the law of another state to be the same as the law of this state there could hardly be a clearer rule in the history of texas jurisprudence this court has decided literally dozens of cases on precisely this presumption so has our sister court in criminal cases by failing to prove that texas law conflicts with the laws of arkansas,louisiana,or oklahoma,coke has waived any claim that their laws and our laws are not the same.
that is,until today.although rule says a court shall take judicial notice upon request and may do so on its own motion,the court now says that is jurisdictional at least sometimes so trial courts must analyze it in every case.if they do not,appellate courts may not bother looking for conflicts either though rule appears to allow it and simply presume they are different.not only does this reverse dozens of our own cases and our own rules of evidence,it allows appellate judges to dismiss jury verdicts on notice or they think verdicts dictate to other states what can and can not be tolerated.
in this case,the court new presumption turns out to be wrong.there is a very good reason why coke never offered the laws of any other state at trial or on appeal they all look alike.this is not surprising because most state antitrust laws are patterned on federal antitrust laws as the laws applicable here show 
federal law 
every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is hereby declared to be illegal every person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,or combine or conspire with any other person or persons,to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,shall be deemed guilty of a felony 
every contract,combination,or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is unlawful.it is unlawful for any person to monopolize,attempt to monopolize,or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce 
louisiana law 
every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce in this state is illegal.no person shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,or combine,or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce within this state.
oklahoma law 
every act,agreement,contract,or combination in the form of a trust,or otherwise,or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce within this state is hereby declared to be against public policy and illegal.it is unlawful for any person to monopolize,attempt to monopolize,or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce in a relevant market within this state 
despite these manifest similarities,the court says we can not presume that our neighbors laws are the same as our own because then we would have to presume that their laws were intended to protect competition in texas,as our laws are.this is both unprecedented and unfair.texas abandonment to generally intended to govern affairs in texas if the historic presumption required a showing that our sister states also intended to govern such affairs in texas,it would never have been used.it is one thing to presume texas laws are limited to texas,but quite another to presume foreign laws are limited to texas too.
the court justifies all this on the basis that interstate comity requires abstention.when there is parallel state and federal litigation c omity or abstention doctrines may,in various circumstances,permit or require the federal court to stay or dismiss the federal action in favor of the litigation.but we have never adopted an abstention doctrine for disputes that cross state lines,and for several reasons should not start now.
first,we are not federal courts,and there is no parallel state litigation.texas courts have generally considered comity only when there is a conflict between litigation in our courts and litigation elsewhere there is no such conflict here.
second,federal abstention applies only to difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case until today,we have not hesitated to decide cases concerning robbery income taxes alimony and child custody on the presumption that a sister state laws were the same as our own.and at least two texas courts have done so in antitrust cases even if the parties did not cite to them.but now,unaccountably,soft drink sales present a policy problem of such substantial public import that no texas court is competent to consider them.as the common law and common cases often reflect fundamental policy choices,it is unclear after today decision what other claims against texas residents can not be brought in texas courts.
third,today decision is inconsistent with federal law.the sherman act does not apply to conduct affecting only foreign markets because congress passed a specific amendment saying so something the texas legislature has not done.the federal amendment was required so american businesses could compete in foreign markets,many of which allow,monopolizing,and so on which interstate commerce does not.and the supreme court has specifically held that applying american antitrust law extraterritorially is not a jurisdictional problem and that american courts should defer to foreign antitrust laws only in cases of an unavoidable conflict we are supposed to construe texas antitrust laws in harmony with federal judicial interpretations,but today the court calls its own tune.
finally,and perhaps most important,the texas antitrust statute specifically precludes judicial abstention.the statute plainly applies to trade and commerce occurring wholly or partly within the state of texas,and the legislature stated in no uncertain terms that it intended texas antitrust laws to govern commerce crossing state lines to the absolute limit of constitutional law 
no suit under this act shall be barred on the grounds that the activity or conduct complained of in any way affects or involves interstate or foreign commerce.it is the intent of the legislature to exercise its powers to the full extent consistent with the constitutions of the state of texas and the united states 
because neither coke nor the court suggests that the judgment here is unconstitutional,we can not prudentially abstain from deciding this case without ignoring the legislature express intent.
on occasion,comity and choice of law may suggest that a texas court should dismiss a claim in favor of a foreign forum under principles of forum non conveniens but that is a matter of venue rather than jurisdiction and thus is waived if never requested.moreover,other public and private interest factors must be balanced in that decision,factors that coke never addresses.we should not reduce a doctrine this old to two factors favoring one party.
nor should we make antitrust law inefficient,as its goal is the opposite.if state antitrust laws are a jurisdictional matter,separate suits will have to be brought in each state,even if as here they involve the same contracts,the same conduct,and the same parties.and no state court will have jurisdiction if a market straddles a state line,as many do.
the court suggests that the bottlers should have filed in federal court.but texas federal courts use the same jurors,identical statutes,and the same federal caselaw as do texas state courts it is hard to see why one imposes on our sister states any more than the other.of course,federal courts can impose federal law across state lines,but the question here is who can impose arkansas or louisiana law on a texas business it is hard to see why federal courts are more qualified to do that.moreover,federal courts already have exclusive jurisdiction of federal antitrust claims if they also have exclusive jurisdiction of most state antitrust claims,it is hard to see why so many state legislatures went to the trouble.
the region is not a legal land some law must apply even if texas law does not.coke may not escape liability by merely objecting to the application of texas law it had the burden of proving a conflict of laws that prevented the application of texas law.by failing to do so,it waived any complaint.
ii.coke conduct is not legal 
the court renders judgment against the bottlers despite the jury verdict to the contrary,holding they did not prove coke harmed competition rather than its competitors.but several of coke activities in the market were so anticompetitive that federal courts would not require such proof,and we should not either.
on its face,texas law like the sherman act prohibits all monopolies and agreements in restraint of trade.but consistent with federal law,the texas act was intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints or illegal monopolization as a result,most claims under the act should be analyzed under a rule of reason that takes into account the relevant market and industry conditions before and after the restraint,and the history,nature,and effect of the defendant conduct 
but some restraints are so anticompetitive and unjustifiable that they are deemed unlawful per se,and require no proof that competition has been harmed in a particular case w hen a particular concerted activity entails an obvious risk of anticompetitive impact with no apparent potentially redeeming value,the fact that a practice may turn out to be harmless in a particular set of circumstances will not prevent its being declared unlawful per se.in such cases,no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality.among the practices which the courts have heretofore deemed to be unlawful in and of themselves are price fixing,division of markets,group boycotts,and tying arrangements.
i agree with the court that coke did not violate antitrust laws by paying for prime locations in retail stores,or shelf space equal to its market share.such deals are commonplace,and antitrust law does not require coke to assist its competitors there was no evidence here that the bottlers ever tried to purchase prime locations,or that they would have failed had they done so.these claims were subject to a analysis,and fail for lack of proof that they affected prices or competition in the market as a whole 
but the jury could have concluded from the evidence that coke did far more than this.the court declines to address any per se violations because the bottlers assert only violations under the rule of reason.but these are not separate causes of action they are analytical categories used to decide whether conduct may be presumed to be anticompetitive,or must be shown to be so deciding which applies is a question of law for the court so if the lower courts applied or the parties argued the wrong one,we may reverse only if it resulted in an erroneous judgment here,the bottlers alleged and the jury found that coke unreasonably restrained trade and monopolized markets if there is evidence to support that verdict under either or analysis,we could not ignore it even if the bottlers had filed no briefs at all.
price fixing 
in some markets in the region,coke required that retailers price all other soft drinks higher than its own.indeed,coke sometimes specified that competing products had to be priced at least cents higher than coke.coke could lower its prices to beat the competition,but paying retailers to raise its competitors prices is,pure and simple,and it has been illegal for a long time.
for many years,all agreements were deemed unlawful per se indeed,they were the archetypal example of a practice without redeeming competitive value 
in the supreme court made an exception for vertical agreements fixing maximum prices,subjecting them to a analysis as the court noted,a price ceiling keeps consumer prices low,and thus does not generally threaten competition but a price floor keeps prices artificially high,and so remains illegal per se because coke contracts fixed minimum prices,there is no question they fall in the latter category.
coke argues there was no evidence that all soft drink prices in the region increased.but while the bottlers presented contrary evidence which we must presume the jury credited,the main problem is that coke agreements were illegal even if they lowered prices,as it is no defense to that the prices fixed were reasonable 
coke also argues that is not illegal without a specified resale price.but agreement on a specific price is not required an agreement that sets a floor on prices is illegal per se even if that floor sometimes varies 
it can be argued that fixing minimum prices is sometimes procompetitive,as when a supplier wants dealers to furnish services they could not afford without a guaranteed margin but there is no evidence this is the case with soft drinks moreover,coke agreements sought to control not its own prices but those of its competitors.as the sole purpose of these agreements was to keep the price of all competing soft drinks higher than they otherwise would have been,they were illegal per se.
in a number of its agreements with convenience stores,coke gave retailers a discount on drinks if retailers promised not to carry competitors to its new root beer,orange,and grape drinks.this is a boycott there was evidence a jury could credit and we must presume they did that once coke obtained an agreement,it typically raised its prices.this is anticompetitive.
some boycotts are illegal per se,while others are subject to a analysis.generally,when boycotts cut off access to a market necessary to enable the boycotted firm to compete,are orchestrated by a firm with a dominant position in the relevant market,and are not justified by plausible arguments of efficiency or competition,then a per se rule applies on the evidence introduced at trial,reasonable jurors could have concluded that coke met all three requirements.
generally,only horizontal boycotts are illegal per se,as a single customer may always choose to change suppliers or vice versa but horizontal agreements need not be instigated by competitors they can be imposed by dominant firms above or below them.thus,for example,when a retailer persuaded its manufacturers not to sell to the retailer small competitor,the supreme court used a per se analysis,rejecting as a matter of law a defense that the boycott did not hurt competition but only one competitor similarly,when a group of stores persuaded dress designers and manufacturers not to deal with stores carrying competing designs,the supreme court used a per se analysis,refusing to consider evidence that the boycott was reasonable and procompetitive 
even if coke conduct were considered a vertical boycott and the rule of reason applied,no elaborate industry analysis would be required to demonstrate the anticompetitive nature of these agreements.absent some countervailing procompetitive virtue an agreement limiting consumer choice by impeding the ordinary give and take of the market place,can not be sustained under the rule of reason.there may be good business reasons to limit soft drink brands in airplane cabins or franchises,but there is no evidence that is true of the supermarkets and convenience stores here.while businesses may generally make vertical agreements about whose products to carry without proffering a business reason,a monopolist like coke can not impose such a regime when it makes an important change in a pattern of distribution that had originated in a competitive market and had persisted for several years.coke advances no credible argument for the proposition that giving consumers fewer choices enhanced competition 
advertising ban 
in many of coke agreements,retailers had to agree not to advertise any other soft and or outside the store,in circulars,banners,or signs of any kind,or even signs that merely stated the price.
this ban too is illegal per se a concerted and effective effort to withhold or make more costly information desired by consumers for the purpose of determining whether a particular purchase is cost justified is likely enough to disrupt the proper functioning of the mechanism of the market that it may be condemned even absent proof that it resulted in higher prices.there is an exception for bans on for professional services,which are subject to analysis because consumers do not have the expertise to compare the quality of services offered but that,of course,is not the case with soft drinks.
coke only proffered justification for the ban on advertising is that it did not want a competitor ads covering up its own.in the first place,some of the ads banned such as newspaper ads and circulars were paid for by the retailers,not coke.moreover,coke agreements did not demand that its ads be merely the first or the largest or the most visible ads,but the only ads.it is hard to imagine any procompetitive reason for banning competing ads,and coke does not offer any.
finally,coke argues that with the exception of the advertising ban,the above activities were isolated practices in a few markets involving a few brands for short periods of time.but a monopolist can not corner the market illegally by doing so a little bit at a time.
under the texas act,like the sherman act,a monopoly claim has two elements monopoly power in the relevant market and willful acquisition,maintenance,or use of that power by predatory means or for predatory purposes as coke did not contest the first,we review the record only for the second.
the coke distributor here is an international corporation accounting for percent of coke worldwide sales.it does not contest that its percent market share gave it monopoly power in the region it required agreements from every retailer in the region except,and the jury could have credited evidence that it punished retailers who refused with prohibitive wholesale prices.unlike similar agreements in other parts of the country,coke agreements in the region were perennial,covering to percent of every year,and extended annually.as coke concedes,these special marketing agreements were unlike those that it used in the rest of the nation,or those that have been approved by other courts these facts,plus the nature of the agreements noted above,are sufficient to support a jury verdict of monopolization 
it was neither necessary nor sufficient for the bottlers to show that coke charged monopoly prices.monopoly pricing is not illegal indeed,it plays an important role in competition,initially by inducing innovation,and later by attracting new competitors illegal monopolization may exist even though a combination may temporarily or even permanently reduce the price of the articles manufactured or sold.
nor did the bottlers have to declare bankruptcy to prove their monopolization claim instead,they only had to prove that coke practices adversely affected competition without a legitimate business justification that they did.
even under a analysis,it would not be up to us to decide whether coke agreements were predatory.as we are reviewing a jury verdict,we must interpret the entire record in the light most favorable to the bottlers and give them the benefit of all inferences the evidence fairly supports t he primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect interbrand competition.even if soft drink sales grew overall,agreements expressly intended to raise prices and reduce consumer choices harm competition jurors were entitled to conclude that coke agreements were,in several respects,intended to accomplish just that.
evidence of perfectly legitimate conduct is no evidence of an antitrust violation like federal law,texas law does not give jurors carte blanche to insist that a monopolist alter its way of doing business whenever some other approach might yield greater competition.but if a dominant competitor can use its market power to control its competitors prices,advertising,and access to the court holds they is hard to see what is left of texas antitrust law.
the jury found that the bottlers damages totaled.coke argues this figure is inflated because the bottlers did not segregate damages attributable to coke rather than pepsi with whom they settled.further,coke argues that by simply assuming the bottlers sales would have grown at the national average for all soft drinks,it was required to compensate the bottlers not only for illegal conduct,but also for legal conduct or anything else that caused their sales to grow less than the national average.
the united states supreme court has said little about calculating damages in antitrust cases,except that verdicts should not be based on speculation or guesswork that defendants should not profit because their own wrongs prevent a more precise computation and that plaintiffs may use estimates and analyses to calculate a reasonable approximation of damages as it may be impossible to prove what markets would have done absent illegal conduct,several federal circuit cases do not require a showing of the harm caused by individual acts and in at least one case,lost profits were awarded on the assumption that national sales trends would have applied locally 
but the problem here is that much of the conduct the bottlers emphasized at discounts for favorable shelf and display not illegal at all.by mixing valid and invalid elements of damages in a single award over coke objection,we can not tell whether the jury based its award on legal or illegal conduct when the damages evidence included both proper and improper items,remand is required to allow segregation of the two 
iii.conclusion 
unlike most other statutes,the antitrust laws are like the common law in that varying times and circumstances may give them changing content.although texas has had its own antitrust statutes since,the legislature adopted the current law in to give texas courts broader powers and greater flexibility in addressing new economic and business conditions we have addressed the amended law only rarely,and never found a violation of it it is a shame the court does so again today,allowing a monopolist to fix prices,ban consumer ads,and remove competing products.
because higher prices and fewer choices injured competition in the region,not just coke competitors,i would remand for the bottlers to establish their damages.because the court does not,i respectfully dissent.
