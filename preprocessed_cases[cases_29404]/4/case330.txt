plaintiff douglas jennings designed an aftermarket dashboard is,a molded shape that fits over an automobile instrument panel.hoping to make money from his design through manufacturing and selling his bezels in the auto parts aftermarket and to forestall copycats,jennings applied to the patent and trademark office pto for a patent.as part of her review of jennings application,the patent examiner contacted defendants auto meter products,auto meter,gauge works,llc gauge works,and gregory day to inquire whether the bezel they were selling was on sale or publicly available before jennings applied for his patent.jennings believes that the defendants,in response to the examiner inquiries,fraudulently misled her into believing that jennings was not in fact the inventor of the bezel.
in addition to continuing to pursue his patent application,jennings filed this action against the defendants under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,a d,as well as its indiana counterpart.rico fit the bill,in jennings opinion,because the defendants were engaged in the type of unfair competition that one would expect from a mafia family or narcotics cartel.his complaint alleged that the defendants had commandeered the pto through a pattern of racketeering activity by flooding it via mail and wire transmissions with false information in order to deny jennings a patent and thereby exploit the market for the bezel without compensating jennings for use of his invention.in addition to his federal and state rico theories,jennings asserted various grounds for recovery under indiana state law,such as unauthorized control of his property,conversion,and fraud.
the defendants moved to dismiss on various grounds.they argued that the rico counts failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,see fed.civ.b,because jennings had not adequately alleged a pattern of racketeering activity.they also maintained that the claims were unripe,because jennings patent application was still pending before the board of patent appeals and interferences bpai at the time.defendants also moved to disqualify jennings attorney,claiming that he was a necessary fact witness under indiana rule of professional conduct.a magistrate judge granted the defendants rule b motion,stayed the claims,and granted the motion to disqualify jennings attorney.after a joint motion by the parties,the court issued a final judgment dismissing all claims.for the following reasons,we affirm the dismissal of all claims.because we have resolved jennings appeal this way,we have no need to reach the issue.
briefly,a dashboard bezel is the structure that surrounds the instrument gauges on a car dashboard and holds the gauges in place.jennings bezel replaces a car original dashboard bezel.more than that,it improves the bezel,because it has room for more automotive gauges than were included in the original design of the car and it still allows the driver to see the entire panel of instruments.in early,jennings advertised and sold his product on the internet at www.clubsi.com.he alleges that sometime in january nine months before he applied for his,the president and sole owner of gauge works,noticed the bezel for the first time on www.clubsi.com and decided to manufacture and sell a nearly identical one of his own.day and his company partnered with auto meter,a wholesaler of aftermarket auto parts,to distribute an aftermarket dashboard bezel that jennings claims was simply a replica of his bezel.auto meter,day and gauge works first displayed their bezel at a trade show known as the sema international auto salon,which was held at the end of march in pomona,california.seven months later,on october,jennings filed an application for a utility patent on his bezel.
according to jennings,the defendants then began engaging in a series of fraudulent acts aimed at corrupting his patent application and sabotaging his ability to establish himself as the inventor of his aftermarket dashboard bezel.in the course of reviewing jennings patent application,the patent examiner contacted auto meter requesting evidence that the aftermarket bezel was on sale or publicly available before october.auto meter referred the examiner to day,who told the examiner on october,that he,not jennings,was the inventor of the bezel that was the subject of jennings patent application.because jennings believes that day was lying,and the conversation occurred on the telephone,jennings asserts that the communication was an act of wire fraud.jennings also claims that day subsequently contacted auto meter,and the two parties conspired to fabricate a product flyer purportedly for the sema show,to demonstrate that the bezel was indeed publicly available before the date on which jennings filed his application.the date of first public use matters,as inventors have only one year after that date in which to file a patent application.see b.the allegedly fraudulent flyer identified auto meter bezel and displayed a date of october.on october,auto meter faxed the contested document to the examiner.jennings asserts that this too was an act of wire fraud.the examiner relied on the product flyer in concluding that the aftermarket dashboard bezel was prior art under a,and on that ground she rejected jennings patent claims in an office action issued on november.
in response to the office action,jennings furnished the patent office with evidence that he had invented his bezel before january.following up on this information,the examiner again contacted auto meter seeking additional evidence that its bezel was publicly available before june.auto meter in turn contacted day and gauge works and relayed to them its recent conversation with the examiner.jennings claims that the group of defendants then agreed to fabricate a second false product flyer,which showed that day bezel was in fact available to the public prior to june,even though they knew that it was not until at least early that they first began manufacturing the bezel.the second flyer was mailed to the pto sometime between april,and august,another purported act of mail fraud.the examiner issued a second office action,mailed on august,once again rejecting jennings patent claims,this time relying on the flyer,which established fraudulently according to jennings that day bezel was available in june.
on september,jennings attorney,paul maginot,attempted to convince the examiner in an interview that she had relied on false information in rejecting jennings claims.the examiner was not persuaded she issued a final office action on february,rejecting jennings application and again referring to auto meter second product flyer as her basis for concluding that the product was previously available to the public.jennings appealed the ruling to the bpai.since this case was argued,the court has been informed that the bpai has reversed the examiner decision,finding both substantive and procedural problems with the flyer submitted by auto meter.we are not aware,however,of any further developments in the pto,and in particular,the record does not reflect that jennings application has either been granted or denied.nor has jennings withdrawn his appeal,even though it appears that the procedures that the pto furnishes for contesting adverse decisions may be working perfectly well for him.nothing that has happened renders the present case moot,however,and so we proceed with our decision.
in an effort,jennings says,to address the delay in the examination and issuance of his patent,he filed a request for voluntary publication of his patent application in order to obtain provisional rights in his application under d.while the request was ultimately accepted by the pto,the wheels did not turn quickly enough to satisfy jennings.he claims that a number of companies nonetheless declined the invitation to consider a reasonable royalty for jennings intellectual property because the claims of the bezel patent application currently stand rejected in the pto.
after filing his request for voluntary publication,jennings,through his lawyer,sent a letter to gauge works expressing his doubts about the product flyer that gauge works had submitted to the examiner showing that the bezel was available before june.gauge works responded on september,with its own letter stating that it believed that the flyer,which stated that the bezel would be available in june without specifying the year,was intended to indicate that the bezel would be available to the public in june,contrary to the examiner interpretation that the flyer showed the bezel would become available in june.additionally,to bolster its contention that jennings did not himself invent the bezel,gauge works included with its letter a discussion about and photographs of a bezel manufactured by mitsubishi and made available in the spring of,which gauge works claimed constituted prior art to jennings bezel.jennings counters that mitsubishi bezel is substantially different from his bezel,that it therefore does not constitute prior art,and that by knowingly misrepresenting it as such in its mailing,gauge works was perpetuating its schemes.indeed,jennings characterizes auto meter letter of october,to him stating that auto meter agreed with gauge works position as yet another fraudulent mailing.
while the parties quarreled over the validity of jennings application,day filed his own design patent application regarding the same bezel in the pto on november,days after he had spoken with the examiner regarding jennings utility patent application.jennings alleges that day and gauge works fraudulently conspired to name day as the inventor in an effort to cover up the misrepresentations made to the examiner during the telephone conversation of october.according to jennings,the fraud continued throughout the pto evaluation of day design patent.the examiner was never given evidence that day had seen jennings bezel on the internet in january or that the bezel was displayed at the sema trade show.allegedly,the examiner knew nothing about the product flyer that auto meter submitted during jennings patent application process.jennings asserts that filing the design patent application without disclosing all of this relevant evidence constituted another act of mail fraud.on october,day was issued a design patent on the bezel day patent remains in effect.
as we noted at the outset,jennings decided to bring this suit under rico and related theories,believing that he was one of many victims of a conspiracy by the defendants to defraud the public by manipulating pto proceedings.the district court,however,found that jennings had failed to plead the requisite acts and continued criminal activity as required by rico,and it therefore dismissed the federal and state rico claims under fed.civ.b.in the area of antitrust law,the supreme court recently summarized a plaintiff pleading obligations as follows 
while a complaint attacked by a rule b motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations,a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle ment to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact 
bell atlantic twombly,d.for a plaintiff seeking to pursue a claim asserting that an antitrust conspiracy existed,the court requires a complaint with enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that an agreement was made.id.at.
congress passed rico in an effort to combat organized,criminal activity.midwest grinding,spitz,cir.although c provides a private civil action to recover treble damages for violations of rico substantive provisions,sedima,imrex,d,the statute was never intended to allow plaintiffs to turn state law fraud claims into federal rico actions.midwest grinding,at.in order to establish a violation of c,on which jennings relies in part,a plaintiff must show the following four elements by a preponderance of the evidence conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.sedima,at.a pattern of racketeering activity consists,at the very least,of two predicate acts of racketeering committed within a period.midwest grinding,at.in order to curb widespread attempts to turn routine commercial disputes into civil rico actions,id.at,courts carefully scrutinize the pattern requirement to forestall rico use against isolated or sporadic criminal activity,and to prevent rico from becoming a surrogate for fraud actions properly brought under state law.id.to fulfill the pattern requirement,plaintiffs must satisfy the continuity plus relationship test the predicate acts must be related to one another the relationship prong and pose a threat of continued criminal activity the continuity prong.id.citing,northwestern bell telephone,d.
we can assume that the acts here are related the question is whether jennings can show continuity.as the supreme court explained in,the continuity requirement exists to give effect to congress clear intention that rico target criminal behavior,at,as opposed to more discrete acts of fraud.continuity can be both a concept.midwest grinding,at quoting,at.continuity,which is all that is even arguably present in this case,refers to criminal behavior that has come to a close but endured for such a substantial period of time that the duration and repetition of the criminal activity carries with it an implicit threat of continued criminal activity in the future.midwest grinding,at.an period,in contrast,is a course of criminal activity which lacks the duration and repetition to establish continuity.midwest grinding,at.a rico plaintiff may satisfy the continuity requirement by showing past conduct which by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.id.quoting,at.
in morgan bank of waukegan,cir,this court held that in determining whether there is continuity,r elevant factors include the number and variety of predicate acts and the length of time over which they were committed,the number of victims,the presence of separate schemes and the occurrence of distinct injuries.id.at.the court cautioned that the mere fact that the predicate acts relate to the same overall scheme or involve the same victim does not mean that the acts automatically fail to satisfy the pattern requirement.id.at.the requirement of a pattern of racketeering activity is a standard,not a rule,and thus its determination depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case,with no one factor being necessarily determinative.id.we evaluate the allegations with the goal of achieving a natural and commonsense result,consistent with congress concern with criminal conduct.roger whitmore auto,lake county,illinois,cir.
evaluating this complaint as twombly instructs and paying attention to the way in which the factual allegations correspond to the legal requirements we have outlined,we have no trouble concluding that jennings has not presented a rico case.although jennings alleges a slew of predicate racketeering acts that he claims were aimed at corrupting pto proceedings in his words,an assault on the patent office,at root this is a dispute over who invented an aftermarket dashboard bezel.even if the defendants may have used misleading tactics in their various efforts to obtain the rights to the product a point on which we take no position,the case lacks any of the hallmarks of a rico violation.there is no pattern of fraudulent or racketeering behavior.the state courts and the pto itself have ample tools to correct any individual instances of fraud or other misconduct.
consideration of the morgan factors shows why this is so.the duration of the alleged racketeering activity is perhaps the most important element of rico continuity.roger whitmore,at.here,the defendants conduct spanned an insubstantial amount of time.their alleged fraudulent behavior began on october,when day first accepted the telephone call from the examiner.according to the complaint,the last communication with the pto occurred as late as august,fewer than ten months after the alleged racketeering activity began.
implicitly conceding that ten months is potentially too short,jennings urges us to
