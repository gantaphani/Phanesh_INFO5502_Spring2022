a federal jury found christopher beaver guilty of participating in a conspiracy,and making false statements to a federal law enforcement agent who was investigating that conspiracy,a.beaver challenges his convictions on appeal,arguing that the government failed to prove at trial that a conspiracy existed,that he joined the conspiracy,or that he made false statements.we affirm.
in october,gary matney,a manager at the indianapolis office of prairie material concrete,approached the federal bureau of investigation to report the existence of a conspiracy involving several of prairie material competitors.according to matney,prairie material was being pressured to join the conspiracy,a claim that led the fbi to investigate the pricing activities of five concrete producers in the indianapolis metropolitan area shelby materials,builder concrete supply,irving materials,hughey,and,which does business as beaver materials.the investigation reached a turning point on may,when fbi agents executed search warrants on the five companies,and interviewed the companies corporate officers and employees regarding the existence of the conspiracy.information recovered at that time substantiated many of matney claims,and set into motion a chain of events that would mark the demise of the scheme.shelby materials,richard haehl,immediately admitted his criminal conduct and offered to help the government investigate the cartel the government,in turn,granted haehl amnesty conditioned on his continued cooperation and,if required,truthful testimony at trial.shortly thereafter,the government charged builder concrete,irving materials,and hughey,and their respective corporate officers,gus butch nuckols,price irving,and scott hughey with participating in the scheme.nuckols,irving,and hughey eventually admitted their roles in the conspiracy and entered into plea agreements,in which they,too,offered to help the government investigate the cartel and testify truthfully at trial if called.
upon enlisting the cooperation of haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey,the government sought an indictment against beaver materials and its corporate officers.the government efforts paid off in april,when a federal grand jury returned a indictment against beaver materials,ricky company commercial sales christopher operations manager.two of the counts were directed at christopher.first,the indictment charged christopher with participating in a conspiracy in violation of of the sherman antitrust act.specifically,the indictment alleged that he met with competitors at a horse barn owned by gus nuckols,iii butch nuckols,president of builder concrete and supply,at which they agreed to increase prices,limit discounts,and implement surcharges carried out and enforced their agreement and attempted to conceal the conspiracy.see.the indictment also charged christopher with making false statements regarding his participation in the conspiracy to an fbi agent who investigated it.see a.unlike their alleged cohorts,christopher,ricky,and beaver materials eschewed plea agreements and instead exercised their rights to a jury trial,at which the three were tried jointly the evidence introduced at trial,which we review in a light most favorable to the government,see united states andreas,cir,was as follows 
the government presented the testimony of haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey,who each provided details as to the origins of the conspiracy and christopher beaver role within the scheme.the men explained that,at the turn of the century,the market in the indianapolis area was extremely competitive.the market was primarily occupied by eight concrete producers that often vied for the same customers by bidding on their construction projects.the companies bidding and pricing processes were largely uniform.at the beginning of construction season in the spring of each year,the producers would send price lists to potential clients to inform them of the lowest possible rates at which they could provide concrete.the price lists usually featured five dollar amounts that went into the calculation of the quoted price.first,there was the base,as it was called,the gross the desired amount of a particular mix of concrete.next,the price list provided the available discount off the gross price for promptly submitting payment the price list then deducted this discount,which yielded the net price.but the producers net prices were identical more often than not,so to distinguish themselves and undercut their competition the producers would include a fourth dollar amount on the price list an additional discount from the net price.the producers would then calculate and quote to potential clients the resulting discounted net price as the lowest price at which they could provide the concrete.but as the competition for customers grew over the years,the producers offered increasingly larger discounts that,in turn,depressed the market value of concrete,and,consequently,reduced the producers overall profits.
the four men each continued that,in july,nuckols decided that it was time to address the falling market value of concrete.he accordingly organized a meeting at his horse barn in fishers,indiana,of corporate officers of area concrete producers so they could discuss methods of getting the price up.the meeting was attended by,among others,haehl,irving,hughey,and beaver materials representative,ricky beaver.all those present discussed ways in which they could stabilize the market,leading someone it is not exactly clear who to propose a limit on each producers discount for a cubic yard of concrete the limit,in turn,translated to a limit of per cubic yard.although no vote was taken on the proposal,no one in attendance objected to it,nor did anyone refuse to impose the limit as haehl described it,nobody objected,nobody disagreed,nobody walked away.indeed,each witness testified that he left the meeting with the firm understanding that an agreement to limit discounts had been reached.
however,each of the four stated,the members of the concrete cartel did not always abide by their agreement.this periodic cheating contributed to the continuing downward spiral of concrete market prices,despite the cartel efforts.as a result,individual members of the cadre separately met with each other at various times and locations to shore up the plan.but when those meetings failed to raise the price of concrete,nuckols and hughey called a second meeting of the entire cartel in may,this time at the signature inn in fishers.every company participating in the cartel was represented,and,again,nuckols,haehl,irving,hughey,and ricky beaver attended.the purpose of the meeting was,as haehl described it,to just reaffirm the agreement to limit their discounts at.just like at the earlier meeting at nuckols horse barn,no one objected to imposing the limit.moreover,those in attendance all agreed to a method of enforcing the limit if they became aware that another cartel member was offering a discount greater than,they would confront that producer about his cheating.and based,in part,on this plan,the meeting at the signature inn ended with haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey each believing the attendees had reaffirmed the discount limit.
the four witnesses each continued to testify that in the days after the meeting at the signature inn,they attempted to enforce the limit by contacting those producers whom they believed were cheating on the cartel agreement.in fact,each man stated that,at one time or another they either confronted someone whom they believed was cheating,or were themselves accused of cheating.nevertheless,their efforts to police the scheme proved incapable of reversing the downward spiral of concrete prices as nuckols testified,in the days following the meeting our prices just were not doing well and they were going in the gutter.so nuckols arranged another meeting at his horse barn in october to discuss the discount limits further.haehl,irving,and hughey again attended,but this time ricky beaver did not as it turned out,ricky had not accurately conveyed the details of the agreement to the appropriate individuals at beaver materials.as price and hughey elaborated,beaver materials underbid hughey,on two separate occasions after the july meeting,causing hughey to telephone christopher beaver directly and ask him if beaver materials was cheating.christopher,according to hughey,denied that was the case,and stated that he was at the discount that was established in the agreement with everyone.but,apparently,ricky was confused about that discount,leading him to provide christopher with the wrong information,and,in turn,causing beaver materials to quote prices in dereliction of the agreement.therefore,to avoid the potential for any further confusion,christopher took over representing beaver materials.
the four each further testified that the october began with hughey bemoaning the fact that no one was abiding by the agreement,and urging those who did not want to follow the agreement to leave the meeting.hughey recounted his exhortation you know,guys,this thing is not being adhered to.and we need to decide are we going to agree on this and do what we say we going to or just walk on out of here.but no one walked out.instead,hughey lecture spurred a discussion among all the christopher which they again reassured one another that they each would limit their discounts to off of the net price.the discussion did not end there,however.the group also agreed to increase the net price of each cubic yard of concrete by,and by for each cubic yard of concrete.they further agreed to add a collective surcharge for all concrete produced in the winter.moreover,those present reasserted their commitment to police the agreement by confronting apparent cheaters.
just like at the two earlier meetings,haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey each stated that they understood that the attendees at the october meeting agreed to limit their discounts to,in addition to adopting additional pricing restraints.no one present at the beaver to the limit.even more,hughey testified,christopher volunteered to contact the manager at american concrete,another indianapolis producer that was not represented at the meeting,and get him the message on what we agreed on.
after each of the four testified,the government presented the testimony of several fbi agents who recounted the agency investigation into the concrete cartel.as relevant here,special agent neil freeman testified that when the fbi conducted its searches and interviews on may,he questioned christopher beaver regarding the existence of the conspiracy different fbi agents simultaneously interviewed ricky beaver and allyn beaver,christopher father and company president.during their conversation,christopher stated that he had been employed by beaver materials for years,and that in the last couple years he had become more involved in the pricing of the company products because he would soon be replacing his father as president.when freeman asked christopher if he had attended any meetings at nuckols horse barn,christopher answered,no.christopher also stated that he did not know of any other employee of beaver materials having attended such a meeting.he further told freeman that he saw beaver materials competitors only when attending meetings of the industry trade group,the indiana association.in all,freeman stated,christopher denied being involved with any kind of discussion of price fixing,and further disavowed ever meeting with any of the competing producers to discuss pricing and discount agreements.
the government rested its case after it presented the evidence regarding the origins of the conspiracy,christopher beaver participation,and his statements to special agent freeman.christopher then moved for a judgment of acquittal on the basis that the government had failed to introduce any kind of evidence that would indicate that christopher joined the conspiracy.see.a.after the district court denied the motion,christopher presented the testimony of his sole mosely,who worked at beaver materials from until as a concrete salesman.mosely testified that,during his time as a salesman,christopher never told him how to price concrete.however,mosely also stated that he knew that christopher attended a price fixing meeting at butch nuckols horse barn.
beaver materials,on the other hand,presented the testimony of allyn beaver and charles sheeks,beaver materials corporate counsel.allyn testified that christopher beaver had some influence over the company prices,including the authority to authorize certain discounts.allyn also stated that he was unaware of any agreement between beaver materials and its competitors,though he did know that ricky beaver had been communicating with some of the other area concrete producers.moreover,allyn testified that he knew that christopher had attended the october meeting at nuckols horse barn,that christopher told him that those in attendance talked about prices,and that the way that the meeting was going,it seemed like that the attendees must be doing this all the time.however,allyn did not know whether christopher entered into any agreement with beaver materials competitors.
sheeks then testified that the day after the fbi conducted its interviews,he met with christopher beaver,ricky beaver,and allyn beaver at beaver materials corporate office.there,christopher and ricky told sheeks that they lied to the fbi about their presence at the meetings at nuckols horse barn.in response to this news,sheeks sent a letter to the department of justice on may,in which he stated only that o ne of the employees of my client made a misstatement to one of your agents to the effect he had not attended a meeting at what has been referred to as butch barn.he did,in fact,attend the meeting.
after the defense rested the district court submitted the case to the jury,which found christopher beaver guilty on both the and counts christopher then renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal,see.c,challenging the evidence supporting his conviction,but not his conviction for making false statements.after the court denied the motion,it sentenced christopher to months imprisonment.
ii.analysis 
christopher beaver raises two arguments on appeal.first,he argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because,he asserts,the government failed to prove at trial that a conspiracy existed,or that he participated in the conspiracy.christopher also challenges his conviction by asserting that the government failed to prove that the lies he told to special agent freeman were material as a matter of law.we address these arguments in turn.
a.the existence of,and christopher beaver participation in,the conspiracy 
to prevail on his argument that the district court erred by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal,christopher beaver must show that the court incorrectly concluded that there was sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction under the sherman antitrust act.see.a andreas,at.although we review christopher argument de novo,see united states,cir,he faces a nearly insurmountable burden on appeal,united states jackson,cir quoting united states moore,cir.viewing the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government,we will overturn christopher guilty verdict only if the record contains no evidence,regardless of how it is weighed,from which the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty.see andreas,at quoting united states agostino,cir.
christopher beaver attempts to shoulder this burden by arguing that the government failed to prove that the concrete producers agreed to restrict their discounts on the net prices of concrete.specifically,he contends that the evidence at trial showed that no person voiced their assent to the supposed conspiracy.thus,according to christopher,the government failed to establish that the producers entered into an agreement in the first place 
to prove a violation of of the sherman antitrust act,the government had to introduce evidence showing that the concrete producers conspired to restrain trade,see united states oil.andreas,at united states hayter oil,cir,by agreeing to fix the price of concrete through limiting their discounts,see texaco,at.kahan lessin,at united states am.radiator standard sanitary,cir.although the existence of such an agreement is the essence of the government conspiracy allegation,see united states consol.packaging,cir see also nelson pilkington,cir,the government did not need to show that the producers reached a formal agreement to limit their discounts,am.tobacco united states.see also united states whaley,cir.rather,the government was required only to establish that the concrete producers had a tacit understanding based upon a long course of conduct to limit their discounts.united states beachner constr,cir see also andreas,at monsanto serv,d t he antitrust plaintiff should present direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the manufacturer and others had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.quoting edward sweeney sons,texaco,cir.
the government introduced ample evidence at trial that showed that the concrete producers shared a tacit understanding that they were to limit their discounts collectively.in fact,the trial record is replete with details regarding the cartel meetings in july,may,and october,at which the producers discussed the limit,policing the limit,and other price restraints.haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey each testified that,beginning in july,the entire cartel met on at least three occasions with the known purpose of addressing the falling price of concrete.during each of those meetings,the competitors discussed the ways in which they could stabilize the market,leading to the proposed limit.and although no formal vote was taken on the discount limit,no one disagreed with the proposal or stated that he would not participate in the scheme.indeed,when hughey gave the producers the opportunity to oppose the arrangement and leave the conspiracy,nobody objected,nobody disagreed,nobody walked away.instead,the producers discussed additional methods of aligning their pricing practices,such as instituting general price increases and a winter surcharge.and based on these meetings and related discussions,haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey each understood that an agreement was reached.see andreas,at beachner constr,at.
moreover,haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey each testified that the concrete producers communications were not limited to the july,may,or october meetings they also enforced the discount restraint by confronting those who were cheating on the cartel.each witness also testified that,on various occasions,they either confronted someone whom they believed was cheating or were themselves accused of cheating.hughey likewise stated that on two separate occasions christopher beaver reassured him that beaver materials was abiding by the discount limit.in the face of this evidence,christopher assertion that no person voiced their assent to the supposed conspiracy rings hollow.such assent was voiced when the either confronted others about cheating on the cartel,or reassured christopher they were abiding by the agreement.see beachner constr,at in re high fructose corn syrup antitrust,cir stating that conspiracy can be proved by actual,verbalized communication.
christopher beaver asserts,however that the concrete producers occasional cheating on the discount limit shows that no agreement was ever reached.but this argument is illogical certainly christopher would agree that a breach of contract does not mean that the parties never entered into the contract in the first place.and the argument is also beside the point because of the sherman antitrust act does not outlaw only perfect conspiracies to restrain trade.it is not uncommon for members of a conspiracy to cheat on one another occasionally,and evidence of cheating certainly does not,by itself,prevent the government from proving a conspiracy.see,andreas,at stating that cheating cartel members did not negate conspiracy united states misle bus equip,cir government witnesses testified that although the defendant occasionally cheated his by bidding lower than was agreed,he reached mutual understandings with the other participants about prices and usually adhered to the prices and market allocations upon which they agreed.united states foley,cir since the agreement itself,not its performance,is the crime of conspiracy,the partial of the defendant company does not preclude a finding that it joined the conspiracy.citations omitted.thus,we can not say that the producers occasional cheating prevented the government from sufficiently proving that they conspired to fix the price of concrete.
christopher beaver continues his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his conviction by arguing that the government failed to show that he personally participated in the cartel.in christopher view,the testimony of haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey implicating him in the conspiracy was not credible because no two competitors said anything as a whole which would corroborate the testimony of the others.but this argument fails from the start.we will not the jury credibility decisions in evaluating christopher challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,united states,cir united states henderson,cir,even if his claims were uncorroborated,see united states crowder,cir.
but the credibility of haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey aside,their testimony sufficiently implicated christopher beaver in the conspiracy.specifically,each man testified that christopher was present at the october meeting at nuckols horse barn participated in discussions on how to limit the price of concrete did not object to the limit agreed to confront other conspiracy members if he found them cheating on the agreement and agreed on additional pricing constraints.moreover,hughey testified that,at the meeting,christopher volunteered to contact the manager at american concrete and get him the message on what we agreed on.
looking beyond the testimony of haehl,nuckols,irving,and hughey,the uncontradicted evidence regarding christopher beaver responsibilities at beaver materials further bolsters the jury conclusion that he participated the conspiracy.christopher admitted to special agent freeman that,as operations manager,he was involved in the pricing of the company products,a role that would have allowed the jury to infer that christopher was able to effectuate the limit.this inference is further supported by hughey testimony that he spoke with christopher personally on two occasions,and that during those conversations christopher reaffirmed beaver materials commitment to the discount limit.and the testimony of both mosely and allyn beaver failed to contradict the evidence of christopher involvement.both men stated that they knew that christopher had met with competitors at nuckols horse barn in october,and allyn further stated that christopher told him that pricing was discussed at that meeting.we thus can not say that the government failed to prove that christopher participated in the conspiracy,or that the district court erred by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal.see andreas,at.
christopher beaver false statements 
christopher beaver next challenges his conviction under a for falsely stating to special agent freeman that neither he,nor beaver materials,participated in the conspiracy.specifically,christopher argues that the government did not prove that his statements were material as a matter of law.as he explains,the government needed to show at trial that his statements to freeman were material,see a united states moore,cir,meaning that the statements had the tendency to influence,or were capable of influencing,the fbi investigation of the conspiracy,see united states brantley,cir united states di fonzo,cir united states fernandez,cir explaining materiality in context of federal statutes,and according to christopher,his false statements could not have influenced the fbi investigation because his attorney,sheeks,contacted the department of justice to correct the statements before they could lead the fbi astray.
before we weigh the merits of christopher beaver argument,however,we must take a moment to alleviate the confusion that apparently exists regarding his challenge.specifically,christopher mischaracte
