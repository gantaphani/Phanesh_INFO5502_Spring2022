are firms that have indirectly purchased rail freight service from one or more of the defendant railroads.the traffic moves under contracts that,pursuant to,are generally not subject to challenge before the surface transportation board stb or board plaintiffs allege that since the railroads conspired to impose fuel surcharges on the freight in a way that raised the shipping rates above competitive levels.plaintiffs seek a judicial remedy for contract traffic that would remedy that the board gave common carrier traffic in rail fuel surcharges,ex parte,wl,but which it explicitly withheld from contract traffic,see id.at.
plaintiffs antitrust allegations are part of at least eighteen separate class actions,consolidated before the district court,involving various putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers of rail freight services.in re rail freight fuel surcharge antitrust,d.the direct purchasers raise only federal antitrust claims,which are still pending before the district court.id.at.the indirect purchasers sought injunctive relief for their antitrust claims under federal law in addition,in order to secure damages precluded under federal law,see illinois brick illinois,d,they asserted various state law claims under theories of antitrust,consumer protection,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment and disgorgement of profits.
the district court dismissed the indirect purchasers state law claims as preempted by the interstate commerce commission termination act of,iccta in re rail freight fuel surcharge antitrust,d at.in the district court view,permit ting plaintiffs to pursue their state law claims would require the application of different state antitrust and consumer protection laws to decide what defendants fuel surcharges should have just the patchwork of railroad regulation that iccta sought to preempt.id.at.the district court allowed the indirect purchaser plaintiffs to pursue their federal antitrust claim for injunctive relief,id.at,a claim still pending along with that of the direct purchasers.at the request of the parties,the court entered a final judgment for defendants on the state law claims under.b,thereby enabling an immediate appeal that would otherwise have been impermissibly interlocutory.this appeal duly followed.
the statute express clause obviously is the best available reflection of congress intent on the subject.sprietsma mercury marine,d.the section reads as follows 
the jurisdiction of the board over 
transportation by rail carriers,and the remedies provided in this part with respect to rates,classifications,rules including car service,interchange,and other operating rules,practices,routes,services,and facilities of such carriers and 
the construction,acquisition,operation,abandonment,or discontinuance of spur,industrial,team,switching,or side tracks,or facilities,even if the tracks are located,or intended to be located,entirely in one state,
is exclusive.except as otherwise provided in this part,the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal or state law.
b.in this opinion,we will refer to the first sentence ending with is exclusive as the exclusive jurisdiction clause,and to the second sentence beginning with except as otherwise provided as the exclusive remedies clause.
in an argument that would,if it were sound,likely apply to all elements of their statutory analysis,plaintiffs invoke the following sentence uttered by the board when congress removed rail transportation contracts from the board regulatory purview,it expressly stated that not only state contract laws but also federal and state antitrust laws would apply fully to those agreements.city power light union pac,wl,at.plaintiffs argue in a footnote that we should defer to this statement under chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
lest there be any confusion on the point,we note at the outset that congress did not expressly state what the board said it had.the board in fact cited only the house committee report,which on the page referred to by the board merely stated,if behavior is alleged,under this section,the antitrust laws are the appropriate and only remedy available.comm.on interstate foreign commerce,staggers rail act of,at,as reprinted in.
in any event plaintiffs conclusory assertion that we owe the statement chevron deference encounters insuperable hurdles.first,we several times noted that whether an agency decision against preemption of a state or local law receives chevron deference is an open question in this circuit.see riffin surface transportation,albany eng g ferc.yet plaintiffs offer no argument on the question we commonly treat such an omission as a waiver.see,united states hughes.the supreme court recent treatment of the issue in wyeth levine,d,declaring that agencies have no special authority to pronounce on preemption absent delegation by congress,id.at,which several circuits have invoked in declining deference,see,franks inv.union pac,cir barrientos morton llc,cir,obviously puts the chevron deference claim in further doubt.
but assuming in plaintiffs favor that agencies are due chevron deference for their rulings on preemption of state law,the board inaccurate remark in kansas city power light would not be due such deference.the board was engaged in resolving whether it had jurisdiction over a shipper complaint it would if the rates in question were common carrier tariff rates subject to d id,but would not if they were contract rates under.because the rates fell into the common carrier classification under board precedent,and the parties had reasonably relied thereon,it found jurisdiction but started a rulemaking to clarify the boundary between the two.it made the quoted observation about state antitrust claims only to illustrate the undisputed proposition that the classification had consequences.such a dictum is plainly not entitled to chevron deference.see united states mead,d.what we have just said also disposes of any possible claim that we owe the remark deference under skidmore swift.
thus we address the parties arguments de novo.
plaintiffs object to the district court preemption decision on two principal grounds.first,they say that b preemption provisions do not apply at all to freight transported pursuant to private contracts that are not generally subject to challenge before the board.second,they say that even if those provisions apply to such transportation,the state law remedies they seek are not remedies with respect to regulation of rail transportation and are therefore not the sort of remedies that b preempts.
plaintiffs argument that the preemption language of b does not apply to freight transported under private rail contracts has two related aspects first,in plaintiffs view,only the exclusive remedies clause is relevant to iccta preemption analysis they criticize the district court for relying on cases discussing the exclusive jurisdiction clause to support its preemption holding,noting that the clause does not use the word preemption.second,the exclusive remedies clause has an express provision for exceptions as otherwise provided in this part,and plaintiffs argue that their state law claims fall within that exception.we will start with c provision of an exception 
a contract that is authorized by this section,and transportation under such contract,shall not be subject to this part,and may not be subsequently challenged before the board or in any court on the grounds that such contract violates a provision of this part.
the exclusive remedy for any alleged breach of a contract entered into under this section shall be an action in an appropriate state court or united states district court,unless the parties otherwise agree.this section does not confer original jurisdiction on the district courts of the united states based on section or of title,united states code.
plaintiffs read c as taking private contracts completely outside the federal regulatory regime and as permitting plenary state regulation of freight moving under such contracts.this is a plainly erroneous reading.the provision merely limits the board authority over the terms of private contracts the limitation was imposed as part of surface freight deregulation legislation adopted over the past several decades.it was not intended to restore any regulatory authority to the states.
both the exclusive jurisdiction clause of the provision now found in b,and the rule removing private contracts from federal regulation,were originally added to the as part of the staggers rail act of.see,stat,originally codified at i,now codified as amended at c private contracts id.c,stat.at originally codified at d,now codified as amended at b preemption.contrary to plaintiffs assertions that federal preemption of state remedies was first introduced in,see appellants br.at asserting that u nder the interstate commerce act remedies were not exclusive,but rather cumulative,in fact the staggers act exclusive jurisdiction clause gave preemption of state remedies an explicit statutory basis.terminal packaging consolidated rail,cir so holding,but noting that longstanding judicial interpretations of act legislation also had much preemptive effect.
indeed,courts found many state laws respecting rail transportation to be preempted following the staggers act even though it contained only the exclusive jurisdiction clause and not a separate exclusive remedies clause such as exists today.thus terminal packaging held,since d,as illuminated by legislative history,makes clear that the only remedies regarding rail rates are those provided by federal statutes,the savings clause,which preserved common law e xcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle,has no application to this case.gendron chi.transp,finding a state law challenge to a transfer of a rail line approved by the icc as preempted where granting plaintiffs the legal and equitable relief they seek would have impermissibly interfere d with the icc broad authority over rail line transactions and citing inter alia former d for the proposition that t he icc jurisdiction to approve or to condition approval of rail line transactions like the one challenged here is exclusive and plenary see also,at,as reprinted in,s ince,former section d predecessor of the current exclusive jurisdiction clause and b a provision dropped in,providing for limited state regulation under strict icc supervision,with respect to rail transportation,had already replaced the former standard of cumulative remedies with an exclusive federal standard,in order to assure uniform administration of the regulatory standards of the staggers act.people conrail,d,arguing that former d merely provides that to the extent of the jurisdiction conferred by the commerce act,the icc and state authorities have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to transportation by rail carriers but the context was a claim that the staggers act preempted state environmental regulation,an issue which,as we explain below,is quite distinct from regulation of relations.
this pulls both legs out from under plaintiffs argument that b exclusivity provisions do not apply to the contract traffic in question.the exclusive jurisdiction clause and the cases construing it are relevant to the present issue,and exception,whatever its ultimate effect,leaves b applicable to contract traffic.
the current provision largely removing private contracts from federal regulation c also had its genesis in the staggers act.railroads were authorized to enter into such contracts,and required to file them with the icc,consistent with tariff rules to be developed by the commission so as to make their essential terms available to the public.the staggers act directed the commission to approve such contracts except in very limited circumstances.see,stat.at originally codified as amended at,now codified as amended at.once so approved,a contract could not be challenged for violation of this subtitle subtitle iv,governing economic regulation of railroads.id.at,originally codified at i,now codified as amended at c.congress intended in to clarif y the status of contract rate and service agreements in an effort to encourage carriers and purchasers of rail service to make widespread use of such agreements,at,as reprinted in.at.in its rail fuel surcharges decision,the board said that left the icc with no authority to regulate rail rates and services that are governed by a contract.wl,at.
summarizing the staggers act impact on the overall role of state law,the conference report said the remedies available against rail carriers with respect to rail rates,classifications,rules and practices are exclusively those provided by the interstate commerce act,as amended,and any other federal statutes which are not inconsistent with the interstate commerce act.no state law or federal or state common law remedies are available,at emphasis added,as reprinted in.at.discussing the new private contracts provision,the report noted,the existing federal antitrust laws apply to this section,see id.at,as reprinted in at,suggesting by negative inference that state antitrust laws generally did not apply.by that stage,then,congress had clearly preempted state regulation of rail transportation,both for freight and freight moving under private contracts.
we then must consider whether any of the changes wrought by the iccta itself reduced the scope of staggers act preemption.they did not.the iccta did add the exclusive remedies clause to,along with the caveat that it would apply e xcept as otherwise provided in this part.but,as we said earlier,this provision was merely a reorganization of law,under which federal remedies with respect to rail transportation were already exclusive,subject to parties rights to contract enforcement,at,as reprinted in at s ince,former section d and b,with respect to rail transportation,had already replaced the former standard of cumulative remedies with an exclusive federal standard,in order to assure uniform administration of the regulatory standards of the staggers act.plaintiffs view would require us to infer that the addition of the general e xcept as otherwise provided in this part clause somehow converted c provision for private contracts into a new source of state regulatory authority.see c originally codified prior to amendment at i.they offer no reason supporting such a transformation.
the iccta,to be sure,altered the context slightly,but entirely in a deregulatory direction,making it most improbable that congress intended to invite state regulatory authority into the picture.first,congress further narrowed the authority of the regulatory agency now the stb to regulate private contracts,principally by eliminating certain procedures that allowed rather limited challenges before the old icc.see,at,as reprinted in at describing the eliminated procedures as very limited and seldom utilized.but there was no change in c provision that contract rail transport shall not be subject to the provisions of the act,meaning that the act did not effect any substantive change on that score.see,a,stat.at codified at c.
further,in one respect congress explicitly expanded the scope of preemption it deleted from the exclusive jurisdiction clause any reference to state authorities and the associated certification procedures.see,c,stat.at originally codified at d,now codified as amended at b the jurisdiction of the commission and of state authorities to the extent such authorities are authorized to administer the standards and procedures of this title pursuant to this section and section b of this title over transportation by rail carriers,and the remedies provided in this title with respect to the rates,classifications,rules,and practices of such carriers,is exclusive.this of course was a de regulatory,as plaintiffs would have us believe,an invitation to states to fill the regulatory void created by federal deregulation.see,at the bill would also eliminate federal certification and review procedures for state regulation of intrastate rail transportation.however,nothing in this bill should be construed to authorize states to regulate railroads in areas where federal regulation has been repealed by this bill.
in short,the iccta left the exclusive jurisdiction clause in full force,supp
