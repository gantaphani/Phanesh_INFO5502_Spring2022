this appeal,raising an interesting res judicata issue,grows out of two law suits between essentially the same parties avx corporation and avx limited collectively,avx,and cabot corporation cabot avx makes electronic components and other products in which the metallic element tantalum is sometimes employed.cabot purchases tantalum,converts it into powder or wire,and sells these products to manufacturers such as avx.
because the present case was resolved on a motion to dismiss,we accept as true the allegations in avx complaint.aulson blanchard,cir.in early,avx and cabot,who had done business for some time,signed a letter of intent to enter into a tantalum purchase agreement.later in the year,as the market for tantalum tightened,the parties signed a final agreement effective january,with quantity and price terms less favorable to avx than those contemplated by the letter of intent.
in july,avx corporation sued cabot and a cabot affiliate in the federal district court in massachusetts,charging them with unlawful price discrimination under the price discrimination act,and asserting claims under massachusetts law one aim of the suit was to invalidate the agreement and to have the letter of intent treated as a binding contract.although the complaint asserted diversity jurisdiction,avx corporation and cabot corporation are both delaware corporations,precluding diversity.nevertheless,the count is within the district court original jurisdiction,and the state claims were potentially within the court pendent jurisdiction,id.
on february,the court held a hearing on a motion by cabot to dismiss the action,during which the district judge agreed with cabot that the claim and one of the six state counts had to be dismissed for failure to state a claim.specifically,the court found that the complaint allegations did not include all necessary elements of a claim,although it said that avx could try to repair the pleading deficiency.the court also found that avx limited was a necessary party and instructed avx that it must amend the complaint to include avx limited if it wished to move forward,giving avx thirty days to file any desired amendment.
within thirty days avx filed an amended complaint,joining avx limited as a plaintiff and setting forth its state law claims but no federal counts.cabot responded by moving to dismiss for lack of federal jurisdiction,and shortly thereafter cabot filed a declaratory judgment action against avx in massachusetts superior court seeking to have the state court declare the agreement valid.then,before the district court took any further action,avx and cabot filed a joint stipulation of dismissal under.a ii dismissing this action without prejudice 
back in state court,avx subsequently asserted,as counterclaims,the state law claims asserted in its original federal court complaint.after a delay,avx then sought to add to its counterclaims an additional count alleging violations of the sherman and clayton acts,as well as state antitrust laws.this claim asserted that cabot used its monopoly power over certain tantalum products to force avx to purchase other tantalum products that it did not antitrust parlance,a classic tying violation.once again,avx targeted the purchase agreement signed in late.
after the superior court denied the motion to courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal antitrust claims,see inv.lake shore.ry.avx filed the present law suit against cabot in federal district court,presenting the same sherman and clayton act claim it had asserted in its proposed amended counterclaim.the case was transferred to the same district judge who had presided over avx original action.in due course,the district court dismissed the new complaint on res judicata grounds.
the district court found that the case met the test for federal claim preclusion set forth in in re iannochino,cir it said that the original rule b dismissal of the claim was a final judgment on the merits that the new sherman and clayton act claim was sufficiently related to the claim to invoke res judicata and that the parties to the two federal actions were the same.avx now appeals to contest this ruling.our review is de novo.porn grange mut.ins,cir.
the rules for res judicata,where a federal court is considering the effect of its own prior disposition of a federal claim on a newly brought federal claim,are a matter of federal law.apparel art int l,amertex enters,cir.the rules have developed through judicial decision,drawing on common law res judicata doctrine as it has developed over time.this case does not involve collateral estoppel or issue preclusion but rather the branch of res judicata known as merger and bar or claim preclusion.
traditional merger and bar doctrine prevents a party from asserting a claim previously decided on the merits by a final judgment in another case between the same parties or their privies the claim is deemed merged into the prior judgment if the plaintiff had won or barred by it if the plaintiff had lost.see restatement second of judgments cmt.a merger id.bar.ordinarily,a dismissal for failure to state a claim is treated as a dismissal on the merits,and there is abundant case law to this effect,united states ex rel.karvelas,cir,cert.denied,d hernandez,cir,cert.denied,d.
in the vocabulary,a price discrimination claim under the act would not be the same claim as monopolization or tying claims under the sherman and clayton acts,because the claim has quite different elements that must be proved to make out the claim.so one might expect that claim preclusion would not operate in the present case.however,as a result of case law development,identity of claims in the sense is no longer a precondition to federal claim preclusion.in most situations involving federal claims,it is now enough to trigger claim preclusion that the plaintiff second claim grows out of the same transaction or set of related transactions as the previously decided claim.aunyx canon,cir,cert.denied,d kale combined ins.of,cir,cert.denied,d.the implicit rationale is that for the sake of efficiency,all such claims should be brought together,if this is possible.in short,the res judicata doctrine functions not only in its traditional role of preventing repeat claims,but has become a compulsory joinder requirement for closely related claims.compare.a.
in this case,there is a substantial argument that the sherman and clayton act claim grows out of the same transaction or set of transactions as the claim the district court so found,although avx contests the ruling,and both complaints focus on the same contract.we bypass the same transaction issue because we conclude that the district court february,dismissal of the count was not a final judgment and that the entire action was ultimately disposed of by stipulation without prejudice.
the first requirement for claim rules may be somewhat different for issue preclusion,see restatement second of judgments cmt.that there be a final judgment in the prior case.id.in this instance,the district judge in the original federal action announced from the bench his decision to dismiss the count and one state count but a number of state claims were left pending,quite apart from the leave given to amend the claim within thirty days.at no point did the court enter a final judgment as to all of the claims,or a partial final judgment as to the claim.b.
the order from the bench patently did not constitute a final judgment for purposes of the statutes and rules governing the timing of appeals from final judgments.ordinarily,a judgment is not final unless it disposes of all claims against all parties,although it is possible to have a partial final judgment as to some claims or some parties under.b.in a few instances,the statutes or doctrine also permit interlocutory appeals,preliminary injunctions and certified controlling questions of law,but no such exception is applicable here.
in each of the cases cited by the district court and by cabot for the proposition that rule b dismissals have effect,the dismissal disposed of an entire complaint,not just some subset of the plaintiff claims.see karvelas,at,at isaac schwartz,cir decided under massachu
