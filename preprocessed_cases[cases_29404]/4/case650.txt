when the loans matured and pergola did not pay them off,nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings were instituted.before the foreclosure process was complete,the hyneks purchased the loans from polo and aztec financial.
the wilsons filed the instant action against coast,polo fund and the hyneks,alleging that that they had resisted putting up their residence as additional security,but that they did so because a representative of coast and polo fund,joe monte,orally represented to them that in the event of a foreclosure,the lender would first foreclose on the vacant land and,only if there were a deficiency,would the lender foreclose on their residence the residence would be released once they provided polo fund with an appraisal showing the vacant land to be worth at least million and the loan documents would guarantee and provide that the residence would only be foreclosed upon if there were a deficiency after the foreclosure of the vacant land.the complaint alleges that they signed the loan documents based upon monte representations.the complaint further alleges that the hyneks conspired with the other defendants to foreclose on the residence.
defendants filed a series of demurrers,which,after the second demurrer,left only causes of action for unfair business practices under business and professions code section all undesignated statutory references are to the business and professions code and intentional infliction of emotional distress in the wilsons second amended complaint.the court sustained the defendants demurrers to these remaining causes of action without leave to amend.
on appeal,the wilsons contend the court erred in sustaining the demurrers to their second amended complaint because their unfair business practices claim was properly pled and their emotional distress cause of action was also properly pled.the wilsons also contend they should be given leave to amend because the notice of default recorded during the foreclosure process was defective because it was recorded by the wrong entity.we affirm.
