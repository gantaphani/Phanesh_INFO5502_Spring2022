rakesh wahi,appeals the district court judgment dismissing his numerous state and federal claims brought against charleston area medical center,camc regarding the suspension of his medical privileges.the district court concluded most of wahi claims were barred because camc qualified for immunity from suit under the health care quality improvement act hcqia or the act,et west.for this reason,and because the district court found wahi other claims failed on the merits,the court awarded camc and glenn crotty summary judgment.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
camc is a hospital operating in charleston,west virginia.wahi,who is licensed to practice medicine in west virginia,began working as a surgeon at camc in january.the following year,wahi started his own practice,but retained clinical privileges at camc.around the same time,he began discussions with a beckley,west virginia medical group about the possibility of associating with them.in november,camc temporarily suspended wahi hospital privileges and,as required by statute,it notified the national practitioner data bank npdb of wahi suspension.camc later reinstated wahi clinical privileges on a provisional basis.following wahi reinstatement,camc received reports of and investigated several allegations that wahi violated the terms of his provisional clinical privileges,which again resulted in temporary suspensions of wahi privileges in and.from to,camc,as required by statute,reported wahi to the npdb a total of five times,although the exact nature of each of the reports before is not in the record.these prior suspensions and investigations are not at issue in this appeal.
at the time of the events in question,wahi was exercising provisional privileges at camc,and had requested reappointment for an additional year ending february.in may,the camc credentials committee credentials committee recommended that wahi request be granted,but that his privileges remain restricted as currently in place with intensified review as outlined in the medical staff procedures manual.
by letter dated july,the credentials committee notified camc chief of staff,redacted,that it was rescinding its earlier recommendation to renew wahi provisional clinical privileges this decision was made after receiving information that wahi performed a redacted,which he was not permitted to do under the terms of his provisional clinical privileges.the credentials committee had also been apprised that wahi failed to notify camc,as required by the,that he had voluntarily relinquished his clinical privileges at another hospital.the credentials committee requested an investigation and appropriate suspension of wahi clinical privileges in light of this new information of wahi continued failure to comply with the terms of his provisional clinical privileges.the credentials committee informed redacted that its recommendation had not been communicated to the camc board of trustees,and that wahi would be given the opportunity to meet with them prior to any final recommendation.
by letter dated july,redacted informed wahi that he had been requested to investigate the two claims raised in the credentials committee letter.redacted asked wahi to respond to each of the allegations in writing as soon as possible.attached to the letter were the relevant portions of the bylaws pertaining to the alleged violations.
between july and july,in addition to meeting with redacted to discuss the july letter requesting additional information from wahi,wahi wrote to redacted,redacted,and the chairman of the credentials committee in order to provide an explanation of the events surrounding the allegations against him.the credentials committee scheduled a meeting with wahi for august,to review his performance and consider his application,which was later rescheduled for august,at wahi request.
on july,redacted summarily suspended wahi hospital privileges at camc.by letter on the same date,camc formally notified wahi that his clinical privileges were hereby summarily suspended pursuant to section,grounds for summary suspension of the procedures manual,for the best interest of patient care.his suspension was to continue until resolution of wahi request for reappointment and any,if requested,has been completed.a copy of article iii of the procedures manual was attached to the letter,and wahi was informed that he may wish to avail himself of any rights available to him under article iii.
from the time of his suspension through the credentials committee meeting,wahi engaged in ongoing correspondence and discussions with camc regarding preparation for that meeting and his application to renew clinical privileges.see.on august,the credentials committee met and wahi testified,providing his response to the allegations against him.the credentials committee recommended denying wahi application for reappointment in a detailed august,letter.by a separate letter,also dated august,camc informed wahi of the denial of his request for reappointment of his clinical privileges and of his right to a hearing regarding this decision under article iii of the procedures manual.
on september,wahi,by counsel,requested a hearing regarding both his suspension and the decision not to renew his clinical privileges.on september,camc reported wahi summary suspension to the npdb,and to the west virginia board of medicine.
correspondence during the next several months indicates discussions between wahi and camc regarding wahi access to his medical assurance file,his dislike of the composition of the hearing panel,and other aspects of the conduct of a hearing.camc repeatedly asked wahi to provide a series of convenient dates for the scheduling of the requested hearing.wahi has never provided camc with any dates on which he would be available for a hearing,and a hearing date was never set.
in november,wahi filed a complaint in west virginia state court requesting that the court intervene in the camc peer review process,declare certain of camc actions invalid,require camc to withdraw its reports to the npdb and state board of medicine,and require a hearing that satisfied wahi various demands.the west virginia court ultimately dismissed the action on december,after concluding that wahi was not entitled to the relief he sought because the peer review process was still ongoing.it declined to render advisory opinions or accept wahi speculation that he would receive an unfair hearing.
for a while,discussions between wahi and camc continued after the state court case ended,with both parties setting forth various parameters and details of the conduct of a hearing.then discussions halted with the parties never reaching an agreement or conducting or scheduling a hearing.in january,wahi filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia.
the complaint alleged numerous state and federal claims,including violations of the sherman act,against camc and other defendants.camc filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court construed as a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.by order dated october,the district court dismissed the sherman act claims for failure to allege an effect on interstate commerce,but granted wahi leave to amend to remedy that omission.the district court also dismissed all but one of wahi claims against camc,finding utterly without merit wahi assertion that camc acted under color of state law because it reported him to the npdb.lastly,it dismissed wahi state invasion of privacy or wrongful disclosure claim,concluding that a plain reading of the hcqia means that only the information contained in a report to the npdb,and not the mere fact that a report was made,is protected as confidential.
wahi then filed an amended complaint reiterating the claims the district court had not dismissed in its october order,and amending the sherman act claims to include allegations of an effect on interstate commerce.wahi amended complaint alleged the following claims conspiracy,in violation of the sherman act,monopolization,in violation of the sherman act,west supp breach of contract and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing conspiracy to deny his constitutional right to due process,in violation of west defamation and violation of his civil rights under west wahi also sought a declaration that the reports made by camc to the npdb are invalid and contrary to law,the removal of camc derogatory reports concerning wahi from the npdb,the reinstatement of wahi hospital privileges,actual and punitive damages,attorneys fees,and costs.wahi overarching contention was that camc decisions to suspend him and deny his application for reappointment were taken in bad faith to prevent competition by monopolizing the field of cardiac surgery in the region and to prevent him from practicing medicine.
by order dated september,the district court granted motions by camc and crotty for summary judgment on all counts.wahi charleston area med,d.the court held that camc qualified for immunity under the hcqia from all of wahi claims for damages.in so doing,it analyzed each of the four components that a professional review action must possess in order to qualify for immunity,as set forth in a,and concluded that camc fulfilled each requirement.id.at.regarding the fact that camc never held a hearing regarding wahi suspension,the district court found 
that the evidence offered by wahi is insufficient for a reasonable jury to find that camc failed to fulfill its obligations under a by a preponderance of the evidence.the overwhelming evidence is that camc acted in an objectively reasonable manner in light of the totality of the circumstances in this case and took sufficient measures to ensure wahi received adequate notice of any hearing or meeting that was to occur in the proposed actions against him.the many letters between the parties illustrate the hospital attempts to set a hearing at wahi request and give him notice of the hearing.wahi was represented by counsel throughout the process and in the end,he was informed and fully aware of his rights,the hospital policies,and the charges and evidence the hospital had against him.the hospital responded promptly when wahi requested a hearing be scheduled.
id.at.the district court concluded the hcqia immunity protected camc against wahi claims for violations of the sherman act,breach of contract and defamation.id.at.recognizing that the hcqia does not afford immunity from claims for injunctive relief,the district court dismissed those claims based on its conclusion that wahi fail ed to make any argument or allege any facts that would entitle him to injunctive relief.id.at.the district court recognized that the hcqia does not provide immunity from claims alleging civil rights violations,but granted camc summary judgment on wahi conspiracy to deny due process claim because wahi did not offer even a scintilla of evidence that there was communication between camc and the board of medicine beyond that required by law.id.accordingly,the district court awarded summary judgment to camc and dismissed wahi case with prejudice.id.
wahi noted a timely appeal,and we have jurisdiction under west.
on appeal,wahi primary argument is that the district court erred in holding that camc was entitled to immunity under the hcqia even though camc summarily suspended wahi without notice or a hearing.wahi also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claims seeking injunctive relief because the hcqia only provides immunity from suits for damages.in addition,wahi challenges the district court determination that camc was not a state actor and therefore was not amenable to suit under.lastly,wahi asserts the district court erred in dismissing his state law defamation,breach of confidentiality,and breach of contract claims.we address each argument below.
hcqia immunity 
wahi asserts the district court erred in determining camc was entitled to immunity under the hcqia because camc never held a hearing regarding wahi suspension,and therefore did not satisfy the requirements for claiming immunity under the act.br.appellant reply br.however,we conclude the district court did not err in determining camc was entitled to immunity under the particular facts of this case.
the hcqia provides a professional review body with immunity from damages whenever a professional review action is taken 
in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care,
after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter,
after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances,and 
in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts and after meeting the requirement of paragraph.
a west.a professional review action shall be presumed to have met the preceding standards necessary for immunity unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.id.
due to the presumption of immunity under the hcqia,a court applies an unconventional standard in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate whether a reasonable jury,viewing all facts in a light most favorable to wahi,could conclude that he had shown,by a preponderance of the evidence,that camc actions fell outside the scope of section a.gabaldoni washington county hosp.ass n,cir.in determining whether a health care entity has met these four requirements,the court applies an objective test that looks to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the action satisfies the a provisions.imperial suburban hosp.ass n,cir.
in a footnote in his opening brief,wahi contends that even though the primary focus of this appeal is the failure of camc to schedule a hearing,as required under subsection of a,the first,second and fourth prongs of the test for immunity under the hcqia were also not met.br.appellant.other than this declarative sentence,wahi fails to raise any argument to support his claim that the first,second,and fourth prongs of the subsection a immunity criteria were not met federal rule of appellate procedure a a requires that the argument section of an appellant opening brief must contain the appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.because wahi has failed to comply with the specific dictates of rule a a,we conclude that he has waived his claims as to the first,second,and fourth requirements of the subsection a hcqia immunity test on appeal.see baltimore boulevard,at involving predecessor to federal rule of appellate procedure a a.accordingly,our review regarding the immunity issue is limited to whether the district court erred in determining that wahi did not overcome the presumption that camc satisfied the requirements of subsection a.
a health care entity is deemed to have met the adequate notice and hearing requirement of a when it satisfies the safe harbor provisions of b.wahi argues that because camc failed to follow the provisions of subsection b,it does not qualify for immunity under the hcqia.however,as the district court properly recognized,following the provisions of subsection b is but one way a health care entity can comply with the requirements of subsection a.while a health care entity is deemed to have met the subsection a immunity requirements by following the safe harbor provisions of subsection b,those provisions are not exclusive.f ailure to meet the conditions described in subsection b shall not,in itself,constitute failure to meet the standards of subsection a.b.therefore,wahi argument that camc is not entitled to immunity,as a matter of law,because it did not comply with all of the provisions in subsection b,fails under the plain language of the statute.
wahi next asserts that camc is not entitled to immunity because it failed to satisfy the exceptions from immunity carved out in c.wahi contends that since camc summarily suspended him for more than days without first finding that he posed an imminent danger to his patients and without conducting a investigation,camc can not claim immunity under the hcqia.wahi misreads the statute.subsection c sets forth limited circumstances in which a health care entity can act with immunity without satisfying all of the conditions in subsection a.subsection c provides in pertinent part 
for purposes of section a of this title,nothing in this section shall be construed as 
requiring the procedures referred to in subsection a of this section 
a where there is no adverse professional review action taken,or 
b in the case of a suspension or restriction of clinical privileges,for a period of not longer than days,during which an investigation is being conducted to determine the need for a professional review action or 
precluding an immediate suspension or restriction of clinical privileges,subject to subsequent notice and hearing or other adequate procedures,where the failure to take such an action may result in an imminent danger to the health of any individual.
subsection c thus sets out distinct ways in which a health care entity can be immune under the hcqia without having complied with the usual requirements for claiming immunity.wahi would have us read the statute by ignoring this clear purpose and instead find that the hcqia immunity is barred by failing to meet one of the subsection c prongs.to the contrary,subsection c presents additional routes to hcqia immunity beyond that set forth in subsection a.although wahi may be correct that the facts show camc can not assert immunity based on c or c,the only significance is that camc must meet the usual standard of qualifying for immunity set forth in subsection a 
under subsection a,a health care entity seeking hcqia immunity must act after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances.a emphasis added.stated in the disjunctive,the statute contemplates two independent avenues by which the subsection a immunity prong may be obtained.the first avenue,adequate notice and hearing procedures,is not at issue in the case at bar.camc makes no claim under that prong and the district court did not consider it.what camc argues,and the district court held,is that the unique circumstances in this case show that wahi received other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances,and entitle camc to the hcqia immunity.
wahi cites the legislative history of subsection a to assert that the other procedures undertaken by a health care entity must nonetheless include a hearing.in particular,wahi relies on this language from the house report recommending the adoption of the hcqia 
the due process requirement,subsection a,can always be met by the procedures specified in subsection b if other procedures are followed,but are not precisely of the character spelled out in subsection b,the test of adequacy may still be met under other prevailing law.the committee is aware,for example,that some courts have already carefully spelled out different requirements for certain professional review activities or actions,such as procedures for decisions regarding applicants for clinical privileges at a hospital.in those situations,compliance with applicable law should satisfy the adequacy requirement even where such activities or actions require different or fewer due process rights than the ones specified under subsection b.in any case,it is the committee intent that physicians receive fair and unbiased review to protect their reputations and medical practices.
at,as reprinted in.nothing in this legislative history alters the conclusion that a health care entity can satisfy subsection a without providing a formal hearing,as contemplated in the safe harbor provisions,depending on the circumstances of a particular case.rather,congress that expressed by the plain language of the that a physician be afforded adequate and fair procedures with regard to professional review actions,which could be something other than a formal hearing in some circumstances.if this were not so,congress would have no reason to have included the other procedures appropriate under the circumstances language contained in the statute in contrast to the specific notice and hearing language.
wahi also contends that camc failure to follow some of the procedures outlined in its bylaws and procedures manual proves camc did not satisfy subsection a under the alternative prong.however,as the court of appeals for the fifth circuit recently observed,
hcqia immunity is not coextensive with compliance with an individual hospital bylaws.rather,the statute imposes a uniform set of national standards.provided that a peer review action complies with those standards,a failure to comply with hospital bylaws does not defeat a peer reviewer right to hcqia immunity from damages.
poliner.health,cir see also meyers healthcare,cir.nothing in the subsection a phrase such other procedures as are fair under the circumstances mandates compliance as the sine qua non for immunity,although from a practical standpoint,compliance may often be proof of such procedures in many cases.
having concluded that camc was not required to hold a formal hearing as a mandatory condition precedent to satisfying subsection a,we now examine whether the district court properly determined camc provided wahi with such other procedures as are fair under the circumstances.we begin that review by underscoring the unique procedural posture upon which summary judgment for a health care entity is measured under the hcqia,as the district court properly summarized 
in applying the test outlined in a,we begin with the presumption that the hospital has met the necessary standards for immunity unless this presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.a.the applicable standard is one of objective reasonableness,viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances.freilich upper chesapeake health,cir quoting imperial suburban hosp.ass n,cir.reasonableness standards have been consistently upheld in the context of qualified immunity.freilich,at.
wahi,d at.we find no error in the district court determination that wahi failed to rebut the presumption that camc actions satisfied the statutory requirement when the totality of the circumstances are viewed in an objectively reasonable manner.
redacted informed wahi of the allegations from the credentials committee by letter dated july and further discussed them in a meeting with him on july.moreover,wahi apparently learned of the unauthorized surgery allegation against him even prior to redacted letter because on july,he wrote to redacted stating he understood questions had arisen regarding his decision to perform the procedure,explaining his decision to perform the contested procedure,and setting forth why he believed it fell within his clinical privileges.although redacted july letter does not mention a possible suspension,it does state that camc would be investigating the claims that wahi had again exceeded his authority under his provisional privileges and not complied with the camc bylaws when he failed to notify camc that he had relinquished his privileges at another hospital.wahi had previously been suspended at least three times for violation of his privileges and was not unaware of the consequences.
redacted also informed wahi that he should respond in writing as soon as possible and address his reappointment before the credentials committee at the august,hearing,which was rescheduled for august at wahi request.over the next two weeks,wahi wrote to redacted and redacted several times,addressing the charges in writing,and providing documents supporting his position that he had not violated the conditions of his clinical privileges.he also requested access to certain records prior to or during the credentials committee meeting,and.the record shows that camc provided wahi with notice of the most recent allegations against him,and an opportunity to respond to those allegations.camc complied with its procedures manual in this regard.
camc suspended wahi medical privileges by a letter dated july,from redacted,which recited the best interests of patient care as the reason for the action.however,the record does not support wahi contention that camc did not inform him more specifically of the reasons for his suspension.on july,redacted and redacted met with wahi to inform him of the suspension pending the credentials committee review of his application for reappointment.redacted memorandum of that meeting recites that they informed wahi that the credentials committee and board of trustees both recommended he be suspended.redacted cited wahi inability to follow procedural guidelines outlined by the committee and the board of trustees which ensures adequate care and safety of patients,and also told wahi that when he met with the credentials committee,he should be prepared to defend his lack of adherence to the limitations on his privileges as well as his absence of notification of suspension from francis hospital.the suspension letter reiterated the rights due wahi under article iii of the procedures manual for a hearing to challenge that action,and attached a copy for his use.
the credentials committee then afforded wahi,by letter of august,the opportunity to review the file for the august meeting for the timeline of events surrounding his privileges at camc.the letter also emphasized to wahi that 
this meeting is your opportunity to present the committee with additional information that is pertinent to its evaluation of your ethical behavior,clinical competence and clinical judgment in the treatment of patients compliance with hospital policies and the medical staff bylaws and rules and regulations behavior in the hospital,your cooperation with medical and hospital personnel as it relates to patient care or the orderly operation of hospital,and your general attitude toward patients,the hospital and its personnel use of the hospital facilities for your patients your physical and mental health your capacity to satisfactorily treat patients as indicated by the results of the hospital quality assessment activities or other reasonable indicators of continuing qualifications your satisfactory completion of such continuing education requirements as may be imposed by law,the hospital or applicable accreditation agencies and other relevant findings from camc and the medical staff quality assurance activities.
copies of relevant portions of camc procedures manual were attached to the letter.a separate letter informed wahi how the meeting would be conducted,and set out wahi rights regarding the meeting.
the credentials committee met on august.wahi appeared before it and presented his case.the committee concluded it was unable to identify evidence that wahi clinical competence and professional judgment are sufficient to recommend that he be reappointed to the medical staff.in particular,the committee cited the following 
failure to comply with and repeated violation of clinical privileges of the bylaws,including 
failure to obtain a proctor when required to do so 
failure to obtain a second opinion when required to do so 
performance of an operative procedure for which he did not have privileges.
marginal indications for operative procedures 
poor in the care of some patients 
multiple incident reports surrounding bizarre professional behavior and inappropriate personal behavior among nursing staff 
failure to comply with responsibilities set forth in the camc bylaws,including providing proper quality of care,maintaining proper medical records,and notifying camc of the loss of clinical privileges at any other hospital and 
failure to keep a current,complete,and timely record of patient care and of the medical staff rules and regulations.
on august,wahi received the credentials committee report and was once again notified of the rights provided in article iii and that he had days to request a hearing.the letter also informed wahi his suspension remained in effect until the camc board of trustees acted on his reappointment.on september,wahi,by counsel,timely requested a hearing as well as a witness list and a number of specified documents.
on october,camc notified wahi of the members of the hearing panel and asked wahi to work with the presiding officer to schedule and conduct the hearing in accordance with article iii,and again forwarded wahi the procedures manual.camc did not give wahi a specific witness list but afforded his counsel access to some of the files requested in the september,letter.camc repeatedly requested that wahi provide available dates for his hearing because the hearing will take a number of days and it was important to select dates well enough in advance that all involved parties can clear their schedules.in over years since his request for a hearing,wahi has yet to provide camc with any dates when he would be available for a hearing.
during the following year,the parties negotiated over how the hearing would be conducted.wahi objected to the composition of the panel,its presiding officer and the use of any incident or discipline during his medical practice at camc that he did not address at the august,credentials committee meeting.and while camc had opened many of its files to wahi and his counsel,some items wahi had requested had not been disclosed due to privacy disagreements,which had not been resolved.the parties also attempted to negotiate a resolution of the matter,including withdrawing wahi suspension based on a written statement of the basis for camc actions.however,the parties were unable to reach an agreement.
on november,wahi filed an action in the west virginia state court to enjoin his requested hearing unless camc met his.wahi asked the state court to order,inter alia,that his method of selection for the hearing panel be used,that no matters of wahi medical practice at camc be considered at the hearing except those mentioned in redacted july,letter,and that the court maintain jurisdiction over the administrative hearing.
the state court rejected wahi arguments and dismissed the complaint,stating wahi arguments were speculative and i t would be premature for the court to make any determination as to whether or not the notice given to wahi satisfies the fair procedures requirement.furthermore,the court noted that the composition of the hearing panel was in conformity with camc procedures manual,and that any objections about the hearing panel or the evidence to be considered should be raised before the hearing panel.the court entered its final order of dismissal on december.
in the meantime,the west virginia board of medicine filed a complaint against wahi on september,and set a hearing to determine whether disciplinary action should be taken against wahi license to practice medicine.wahi and the board of medicine engaged in protracted litigation,which included wahi unsuccessful attempt to halt the proceedings by seeking a writ of prohibition against the board of medicine from the supreme court of appeals of west virginia.on november,the proceedings were dismissed,without a final disposition on the merits of the allegations.wahi made no effort during this time period to pursue a hearing at camc.while camc argues this was a deliberate choice by wahi to prevent a hearing that would create a record that could affect the board of medicine proceedings,the district court made no finding in that regard,camc assigns no error to the lack of a finding,and we therefore do not consider it.the next action in time was the filing of wahi complaint in the district court.
lastly,in considering whether the procedures provided by the health care entity are fair under the circumstances,the july allegations against wahi can not be considered in a vacuum.these allegations were simply the latest in wahi tumultuous history with camc,as the august,credentials committee letter set forth.since his reappointment in,wahi had been the subject of numerous reports and complaints calling his professional competence and conduct into question.the record shows that these complaints arose from a multitude of discrete incidents,were made by different individuals,and were known to wahi.after all wahi had been through the suspension process previously at camc,including the prior reports to the npdb.camc investigated and imposed restrictions,including temporary suspensions,as a result of those investigations.wahi was aware of the consequences for failing to abide by the bylaws and procedures manual.he was not a offender who was unfamiliar with the responsibilities of his position at camc or the consequences for his failures in july.
while camc path to immunity in this case is not a recommended model,it must be evaluated considering all the events which transpired,not just those wahi views as favorable to him.had camc simply set a prompt hearing,whatever wahi objections and efforts to stop it,camc may have been within its rights to do so and may have met the first prong of subsection a.similarly,camc should have followed its bylaws and the procedures manual,and provided wahi a witness list,even if it had to be later supplemented.however,these failures by camc,when viewed in the totality of the circumstances against a measuring stick of objective reasonableness,do not show wahi met his burden of proof to rebut the presumption of immunity under the hcqia.wahi was on notice of the many charges against him,including the detailed credentials committee report of august.he was repeatedly notified of his rights and given multiple copies of documents explaining these rights.he was repeatedly asked for dates for a hearing.while camc attempted to accord wahi a hearing in conformity with the procedures manual,wahi seemed more intent on forestalling a hearing than having one.
had wahi proceeded to a hearing,any complaint about the inadequacy of notice,defective witness list or discovery,the composition of the hearing panel,the conduct of the hearing,or other relevant issues could have been addressed and subjected to judicial review.in the face of wahi recalcitrance,it is at the least disingenuous to now claim his right to a hearing was infringed when he has done all he could do not to have a hearing.viewing the totality of these circumstances in an objectively reasonable manner,we can not conclude that the district court erred in determining wahi failed to rebut the presumption that camc afforded him other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances.we therefore affirm the district court holding that camc is entitled to immunity under the hcqia.
injunctive relief 
wahi also contends the district court erred in awarding summary judgment as to his claims for injunctive relief because a lthough the hcqia immunize d camc and crotty from claims for monetary damages,that statutory immunity does not apply to injunctive relief.br.appellant.he asserts he has satisfied the requirements for obtaining an injunction requiring camc to provide him a hearing and remove his name from the npdb list because he can not acquire gainful employment so long as his name is on the npdb list,monetary damages will not restore his ability to practice,and the public possesses a strong interest in ensuring hospitals abide by the law.br.appellant reply br.
the hcqia only provides immunity from suits for damages.a see imperial,at.the district court expressly recognized this limitation,and it did not base its decision that wahi was not entitled to injunctive relief on camc immunity under the hcqia.instead,it concluded wahi fail ed to make any argument or allege any facts that would entitle him to injunctive relief.wahi,d at.
the district court did not err in this determination.in order to pursue injunctive relief to redress his,breach of contract,and defamation claims,wahi must have a viable claim that camc committed a wrong.
a remedy must be tailored to a violation and the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.remedies,in other words,do not exist in the abstract rather,they flow from and are the consequence of some wrong.at its most basic,this principle limits the reach of judicial decrees to parties found liable for a legal violation.
see bacon city of richmond,cir quoting swann bd.of,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.wahi has not made the requisite showing for any of the claims for which the district court determined the hcqia immunity applied.the district court provided reasons for awarding camc summary judgment on wahi breach of contract and defamation claims,which wahi has also appealed,and which we discuss below.
lastly,even if wahi succeeded on the merits of his claims,he would not be entitled to the injunctive relief he sought in his amended complaint.wahi amended complaint asked for an injunction directing camc to remove its derogatory reports concerning wahi from the npdb and to reinstate wahi hospital privileges.this relief is not connected to any alleged acts of behavior by camc.
state actor 
wahi asserts the district court erred in determining camc was not a state actor,as that term is contemplated under,and therefore not amenable to suit under that statute br.appellant reply br.to state a claim under,a plaintiff must aver that a person acting under color of state law deprived him of a constitutional right or a right conferred by a law of the united states.see dowe total action against poverty,cir.like the requirement of the fourteenth amendment,the element of excludes from its reach merely private conduct,no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.am.mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d.consequently,t he person charged must either be a state actor or have a sufficiently close relationship with state actors such that a court would conclude that the actor is engaged in the state actions.debauche trani,cir.p rivate activity will generally not be deemed state action unless the state has so dominated such activity as to convert it to state action mere approval of or acquiescence in the initiatives of a private party is insufficient.id.at see also dowe,at.
to support his argument,wahi contends that by reporting him to the npdb,camc essentially decredentialed him,a power that is reserved exclusively to state government and turns camc conduct into state action.br.appellant,reply br.we previously examined,and rejected,a similar argument in modaber culpeper memorial hospital,cir.in that case,we held that a hospital compliance with a virginia statute requiring the hospital to report the revocation of privileges did not authorize state officials to make privileges decisions,or to set forth directions governing the outcome of such decisions,or attach consequences to their results.id.at footnotes omitted.for these reasons,we held the virginia statute did not involve the exercise by a private entity of powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the state.id.at quoting jackson metropolitan edison,d see also freilich,at holding private hospital was not a state actor because the state played no role in the actual decision as to whether or not to terminate or reappoint any particular physician.
similarly,the federal statute requiring a hospital to report credentialing decisions to the npdb does not authorize state officials to make any decisions regarding a physician hospital privileges,nor does it direct the hospital actions thereafter.instead,it simply requires hospitals to report to the npdb adverse professional review action affect ing the clinical privileges of a physician.see.accordingly,we find that the statute does not confer to camc powers traditionally reserved to the state,and it does not turn camc actions into state action for a claim 
defamation claim 
wahi contends that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment on his defamation claim he specifically argues on appeal that wahi was defamed when crotty intentionally disclosed to the local media that camc had reported him to the npdb.br.appellant.this argument,however,was not presented to the district court and appears for the first time on appeal.wahi amended complaint states as the sole basis for his defamation claim that camc amended reports published by camc to the npdb on june,were false and defamatory,per se.wahi contends camc published the defamatory reports to the npdb with reckless disregard for the truth and therefore is liable to wahi for defamation.this is the argument presented and ruled upon by the district court when determining whether hcqia immunity barred wahi from pursuing the claim.see.
wahi defamation claim on appeal is therefore not the one pre
