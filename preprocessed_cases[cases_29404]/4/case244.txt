xcaliber international limited llc xcaliber appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the attorney general of louisiana the state.xcaliber manufactures and sells discount cigarettes.the case presents a challenge to an amendment to the state law implementing the tobacco settlement between the largest manufacturers of cigarettes and most of the states.xcaliber claims that the amendment is preempted by federal antitrust law and violates the equal protection and due process clauses.
since,xcaliber has manufactured tobacco products and distributed them primarily in louisiana,kansas,and oklahoma.louisiana is one of many states that,during the,sued the country largest tobacco manufacturers to recover health care costs related to smoking.in these states signed the master settlement agreement the msa,which settled the litigation between them and four major tobacco manufacturers original participating manufacturers or opms.
the msa released opms from all legal claims initiated by the states.in return,each opm agreed to make annual payments into a collective fund with each opm contribution determined primarily by multiplying an agreed sum that increased each year by each opm respective cigarette market share.the total of all payments was then to be allocated among the states based on a fixed formula,with louisiana receiving approximately percent of the total as its allocable share.the msa also placed various restrictions on each opm.for example,it banned political lobbying restricted trade association activities prevented legal challenges to various state tobacco laws and,prohibited some forms of advertising.
other tobacco manufacturers were later given the opportunity to join the msa.those who did are referred to as subsequent participating manufacturers spms.spms that joined the msa within ninety days were given special treatment,grandfathered in.these exempt spms do not pay a per cigarette amount on current sales until those sales exceed the level of their sales or of their sales.the combination of the opms and spms are collectively referred to as pms,participating manufactures.tobacco manufacturers,like xcaliber,that are not pms are referred to as manufacturers npms.
standing alone,the msa would put pms at a cost disadvantage in comparison to npms since only the pms are required to pay a amount under the terms of the msa.as a result of the msa,pms must raise prices in order to stay profitable at a rate similar to the rate while satisfying their payments under the msa.thus,absent some mechanism to impose similar costs on npms,npms could sell at lower prices and potentially increase their market share.
to neutralize this effect,the msa requires each state to enact legislation,which in louisiana is codified at.the statute requires every npm selling cigarettes in louisiana to either become a pm under the msa terms,or deposit money annually into an escrow account.see.the amount to be deposited is calculated by multiplying the numbers of cigarettes sold in the state by a fixed charge listed in the amended statute that increases over time.see c.the amount is roughly the same as that paid by pms,currently cents per cigarette.the interest accrued on the escrowed funds is paid out to the npm,and the principal is either paid to louisiana to satisfy a future judgment entered against such npm,or returned to the npm if years pass without such a judgment.see c.
until,the statute also contained the following provision 
b to the extent that a npm establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a particular year was greater than the state allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been required to make in that year under the agreement had it been a pm,the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such npm.
c b emphasis added the original escrow provision.the original escrow provision created a loophole.an npm could recover funds that it placed into escrow in a particular state to the extent that those funds exceeded the amount the state would receive from that manufacturer as its allocable share,had the manufacturer been a pm.thus,by concentrating its distribution to just a few states,an npm could recover a greater percentage of the total money it placed into escrow because those states were allowed to retain only their relatively small percentage shares 
in order to close this loophole,louisiana,along with every settling state except missouri,amended the original escrow provision.it now reads 
to the extent that a npm establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow on account of units sold in the state in a particular year was greater than the msa payments that such npm would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a pm,the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such npm.
c b emphasis added the allocable share revocation or asr.the asr establishes a limit on the amount of escrow funds that will be released back to an npm in a particular year.by removing the state allocable share language,the asr limits the release to the amount the npm would have paid as a pm on the same amount of sales,rather than the state allocable share of this amount.for example,if an npm makes half of its total sales in louisiana,under the amendment,the npm will be entitled to a release only to the extent that its escrow deposit exceeds what its msa payment would have been on the number of cigarettes represented by half of its total sales.instead of basing the escrow release on the fiction of national followed by a release based on the state allocable share,the release is tied directly to the number of cigarettes actually sold in the state.
because xcaliber distributes products in only a few states,it formerly utilized the loophole in the original statute,but can no longer do so.according to xcaliber,as a result of the asr,the barriers against npms have been heightened dramatically,and the ability of an npm to compete within a regional market has been destroyed.
xcaliber filed suit against the louisiana attorney general,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief based on violations of the first amendment and the commerce,equal protection,and due process clauses,and the corresponding clauses of the louisiana constitution.xcaliber sought only to prevent the enforcement of the asr.it did not seek to invalidate the entire msa and its implementing legislation.the district court dismissed each claim under rule b.xcaliber appealed and this court reversed and remanded.on remand,xcaliber amended its complaint to add a claim that the asr is in violation of,and preempted by,the sherman act.both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court denied xcaliber motion and granted summary judgment in favor of the state.this appeal followed 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.scottsdale ins.knox park,cir.we view all facts in the light most favorable to the,and affirm only when the evidence show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also coury moss,cir.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the summary judgment evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the.anderson liberty lobby.
xcaliber contends that the sherman act preempts the asr.to determine whether a state statute is preempted by the sherman act,we apply a analysis,as set forth by the supreme court in rice norman williams,first,we inquire whether the state legislation mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases,or places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute.id.at.that is,we ask whether the conduct contemplated by the statute is in all cases a per se violation.id.second,we consider whether the state statute is saved from preemption by the state action immunity doctrine.see id.at citing parker brown.
the only change effected by the asr is to remove the language that tied the escrow release to the state allocable share of tobacco settlement payments under the msa.the asr does not change how much an npm must pay per cigarette,nor does it allow other market participants to change that amount.it only changes how much of the total amount paid is released back to the npm.see.c b 
section of the sherman act,which is the basis of xcaliber complaint,outlaws every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations.section addresses joint action by private parties that restrains trade.see parker,at.while the act is not specific as to which types of conduct it prohibits,courts have found illegal a broad range of actions including monopolization,price fixing,territorial divisions,output restrictions,group boycotts,and refusals to deal.see broad.music,columbia broad,white motor united states,united states griffith,associated press united states,united states oil.these activities are considered pernicious to competition and,with the exception of monopolization,are generally considered per se violations of the antitrust laws.
given the traditional scope of antitrust violations and the limited effect of the asr,we can not say that the asr mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases.on its face,the asr does not force or allow private parties to collude,set prices,divide markets,or in any other manner violate antitrust law.the asr simply alters the amount of money to be refunded to npms by changing how much of the npms annual escrow payments are released.we agree with the tenth circuit,see kt g,at,that nothing in the text of the asr removes from tobacco manufacturers the ability to unilaterally set their own prices for products or determine their output.see also grand river,at sanders,at tritent,at.accordingly,we have little trouble concluding that the asr does not mandate or authorize conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases.rice,at.
likewise,we can not say that the asr places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust law in order to comply with the statute.id.since the asr does not affect pms,the only parties potentially facing irresistible pressure from the asr are npms.although the asr forces npms to charge a higher price for their products to maintain the same level of profitability,it does not pressure them to conspire together to set a specific price,to carve up markets,or otherwise to violate antitrust law.see sanders,at.neither the plain language of the sherman act nor the courts interpretation of it necessarily equate charging a higher price with violating antitrust law.moreover,we do not understand xcaliber to argue that it is somehow pressured into violating the antitrust laws since the only parties affected by the asr are not violating the antitrust lawsindeed,even according to xcaliber,npms are the victims of other parties violations of the antitrust laws rather than the violatorsit follows that the asr does not irresistibly pressure private parties to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute.
xcaliber also contends that the asr violates the sherman act under a hybrid restraint analysis a hybrid violation arises when what appears to be a state administered price stabilization scheme is really a private conspiracy,concealed under a gauzy cloak of state involvement.fisher city of berkeley,citing cal.retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum.although governmental intrusions into the market are generally acceptable,see id.at,n ot all restraints imposed upon private actors by government units necessarily constitute unilateral action outside the purview of.id.at.when the government action grants private actors a degree of private regulatory power,it is a nonmarket mechanism merely enforc ing private marketing decisions and thus not immunized from the antitrust laws.id.at.
the cases that have found violations of the antitrust laws based on hybrid restraints have dealt with situations in which the government gave regulatory authority to private parties.as the ninth circuit has noted,the hybrid restraint cases hinged on a state decision to let producers dictate market conditions to othersfor example,by posting prices that then became legally binding on buyers and other producers.sanders,at referencing fisher,midcal,liquor duffy,schwegmann calvert distillers.here,since the asr establishes a state regulatory scheme that does not require or allow any input from private parties,it can not be classified as a hybrid restraint.see grand river,at kt g,at sanders,at.
although we could conceivably end our preemption analysis at this point,see rice,at kt g,at,we nonetheless address xcaliber immunity argument because neither the first prong of rice nor the hybrid restraint analysis fully captures xcaliber argument.xcaliber alleges that the asr,together with the msa and statutes implementing it,enables and implements an output cartel whose purpose and effect is to protect pm market shares and drive npms out of business,all resulting in raising prices to levels.in effect,xcaliber alleges that the opms are using louisiana to impose a private conspiracy.according to xcaliber,louisiana acted entirely at the behest of the opms,which exercised control over louisiana via the threat of reduced payments under the msa if louisiana refused to enact the asr.
absent some provision for imposing similar costs on npms,the msa would put pms at a competitive disadvantage since,under the msa,pms are required to make payments,which increase their cost of doing business.without the burden of these additional costs,npms would,all things being equal,be able to charge lower prices and increase their market share.with the express purpose of counteracting this effect,see.louisiana passed statutes that effectively require the npms either to raise their prices to cover their escrow payment obligationswhich has the effect of prohibiting the npms from undercutting the pms pricesor to abandon the louisiana market.
thus,we have no doubt that louisiana purposefully sought to increase the costs of npms to a level comparable to those faced by pms the original escrow statute failed to accomplish that purpose,and louisiana passed the asr to rectify the problem.however,the critical issue is not whether louisiana sought to impair the competitiveness of the npms,but whether louisiana runs afoul of federal antitrust law by doing so.
a state statute is not preempted merely because the state scheme might have an anticompetitive effect.cmty.commc ns city of boulder,rice,at kt g,at.if any conflict between a state law and the sherman act meant that the state law were preempted,the states power to engage in economic regulation would be effectively destroyed.exxon governor of.this can not be the case,for as the court has recognized,the function of government may often be to tamper with free markets,correcting their failures and aiding their victims.fisher,at.state police powers and regulatory authority extend legitimately to a range of anticompetitive schemes the asr,like these other regulations,alters the competitive environment for market participants.
as the court noted in parker,t he sherman act makes no mention of the state as such,and gives no hint that it was intended to restrain state action or official action directed by a state.at.the court highlighted that the sherman act applies to persons rather than states and aims to suppress combinations to restrain competition and attempts to monopolize by individuals and corporations.id.however,the court also said that a state does not give immunity to those who violate the sherman act by authorizing them to violate it,or by declaring that their action is lawful.id.citations omitted.
xcaliber alleges that the entire regulatory structure created by the msa,its implementing legislation,and the asr represents a private conspiracy enacted by the legislature at the behest of the opms.that is,the legislature,by passing the legislation,attempted to authorize a private conspiracy that would clearly violate the antitrust laws but for the state involvement 
as evidence that the louisiana legislature acted at the opms behest in passing the asr,xcaliber points to the timing of the legislation,which was passed soon after it began appearing as a talking point in the corporate literature of the opms.see freedom holdings,spitzer,d.xcaliber also points out that louisiana would risk losing substantial amounts of money due under the msa if it refused to pass the asr.xcaliber quotes commentary from the louisiana house floor that the asr had to be passed exactly as written.according to xcaliber,this evidence demonstrates that the asr is plainly not a unilateral,sovereign act,but rather was passed at the insistence of opms in order to continue their control of the market.
xcaliber evidence,however,amounts to little more than speculation.louisiana has articulated its reasons for entering into the msa and how the asr advances its goals.see.the actual effect of the statute seems to bear out the legislature belief that the asr would further its expressly stated goals.the msa has brought about a substantial reduction in cigarette consumption and substantial reimbursements to the states for the public costs of cigarette consumption.by implementing the asr,louisiana has ensured these beneficial achievements are not corrupted by allowing npms to sell cigarettes at prices unburdened by any payment obligation,and potentially to dodge liability by closing up shop and selling elsewhere.louisiana has articulated reasonable goals,linked to its public health needs,that support its decision to pass the asr.
although we recognize that louisiana was under considerable financial pressure to pass the asr,we are extremely hesitant to embrace an argument that depends on our finding that the tobacco lobby captured the louisiana legislature.although pms may have lobbied in favor of passing the asr,it does not follow that the louisiana legislature acted solely at their behest or that lobbying itself can be the basis of a sherman act violation.indeed,in addressing private parties violations of the sherman act,the court has noted that n o violation can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws.eastern presidents conference noerr.the court continued 
w here a restraint upon trade or monopolization is the result of valid governmental action,as opposed to private action,no violation of the act can be made out.these decisions rest upon the fact that under our form of government the question of whether a law of that kind should pass,or if passed be enforced,is the responsibility of the appropriate legislative or executive branch of government so long as the law itself does not violate some provision of the constitution.
id.at internal citations omitted.although we recognize that the doctrine,see noerr,united mine workers of america pennington,is not entirely applicable to the instant case,we nonetheless find that it supports our reasoning.it would be highly incongruous for a private party to be immune from antitrust liability predicated on its attempts to influence the legislature,but for the legislature to run afoul of antitrust law when it passes a statute after lobbying by private parties.see hoover,at w here the action complained of was that of the state itself,the action is exempt from antitrust liability regardless of the state motives in taking the action.
in conclusion,we hold that the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the state on xcaliber sherman act claim.
xcaliber contends that the asr violates the equal protection clause.according to xcaliber,we should review the statute under strict scrutiny because the asr coerces xcaliber into relinquishing its first amendment rights to freedom of speech,association,and petition the basic argument is that the asr makes doing business as an npm so unattractive that it compels npms to join the msa,thereby waiving their first amendment rights.xcaliber also argues that even if strict scrutiny does not apply,the asr nonetheless violates the equal protection clause under review.
xcaliber contends that it presented the district court with sufficient evidence of compulsion to join the msa to be granted summary judgment,or,at the least,to preclude summary judgment for the state.the evidence falls into two broad categories price and.regarding price,xcaliber claims that it demonstrated that npms pay a higher cost per cigarette than pms generally,and a much higher cost than the exempt spms.xcaliber also contends that pms pay less than the amounts they theoretically owe under the msa because they are able to withhold payments based on disputes over adjustments built into the msa.regarding coercion,xcaliber contends that it demonstrated the large scale exclusion of npms from retail outlets based on retailers and distributors unfounded fear of potential liability the greater administrative costs associated with escrow compliance for npms than for pms complying with the msa the inability of npms to dispute and withhold payments,which is a routine practice of pms and the harm flowing from louisiana policy of holding escrow deposits in accounts generating extremely low interest rates.
regarding price,according to the plain language of the asr,xcaliber is entitled to a refund for any amount it deposits greater than the payment it would have made as a pm.see.c b.if xcaliber allegations are true and npms are indeed paying more,louisiana has provided xcaliber with a remedy under the asr.nevertheless,xcaliber has chosen not to pursue that remedy and instead asked us to invalidate the asr on constitutional grounds.under these circumstances,a federal court,properly mindful of fundamental principles of state sovereignty and constitutional avoidance,must be extremely hesitant to strike down a state statute on constitutional grounds when such a drastic remedy may not be necessary.see erznoznik city of jacksonville,w hen considering a facial challenge it is necessary to proceed with caution and restraint,as invalidation may result in unnecessary interference with a state regulatory program.
xcaliber allegations of coercion are undermined by the limited relief it seeks.because xcaliber seeks only to invalidate the asr and not the entire msa statutory structure,the relevant comparison is not simply between npms under the asr and pms.we also must consider how granting the relief sought would remedy the harms of which xcaliber complains.that is,we must also compare npms under the asr with npms under the original escrow statute.having done so,it is apparent that none of the coercion that xcaliber alleges would be remedied by a declaratory judgment that the asr is unconstitutional.even without the asr,npms would still face exclusion from retail outlets,bear greater administrative costs,and be unable to dispute payments.similarly,louisiana would still hold the escrow deposits in accounts generating the same interest rates because the coercion of which xcaliber complains will exist whether or not we declare the asr unconstitutional,we do not consider it an adequate reason for subjecting the asr to heightened constitutional scrutiny.
a statute is only subject to heightened scrutiny on an equal protection challenge if it proceeds along suspect lines or infringes fundamental constitutional rights.see fcc beach commc ns.since we are not persuaded by xcaliber arguments implicating the first amendment,xcaliber equal protection claim is subject to review.id.under review,the asr must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.id.
we agree with the other circuits who have addressed this issue,see grand river,at kt g,at,and hold that the asr does not violate the equal protection clause under review.louisiana has articulated several reasons for passing the msa legislation,see,and explained why the asr is important to furthering the goals of the msa.see id.this explanation is easily sufficient to uphold the asr under review.see kt g,at citing numerous cases that have upheld the msa and its related statutes against equal protection claims.
xcaliber contends that the asr violates the due process clause.relying principally on bell burson,xcaliber argues that a deprivation based on a future,hypothetical finding of judicial liability is an adjudicative deprivation that requires process directed at determining whether the liability actually exists.according to xcaliber,since the asr does not provide any process,it violates the due process clause.
this issue turns on whether the state action prompting the escrow payments is properly characterized as legislative or adjudicative.generally speaking,legislative actions are determinations that affect a wider class of individuals,whereas adjudicative actions involve individualized assessments that affect a smaller number of people in a more exceptional manner.compare inv.state bd.of equalization,with londoner denver,see also jackson court condominiums,city of new orleans,cir united states lulac,cir.
in bell,the court evaluated a georgia statute that suspended an uninsured motorist vehicle registration and driver license when that motorist was involved in an accident,unless the motorist first posted security to cover the amount of damages claimed by the aggrieved parties in the accident reports.the court held that the statute deprived the uninsured motorist of property without due process.see bell,at.the court made clear,however,that i f the statute barred the issuance of licenses to all motorists who did not carry liability insurance or who did not post security,the statute would not,under our cases,violate the fourteenth amendment.id.at.
according to the state,the asr does not offend bell because it imposes a requirement on all cigarette manufacturers that have not settled their potential liability to the state.xcaliber argues that the generally applicable exception does not apply because the escrow provisions are limited to npms.although xcaliber is correct that the asr applies only to npms,it does not follow that the statute is not generally applicable.since the pms have agreed to make payments in exchange for a release from liability,the npms are the only potentially liable parties.the asr generally applies to all npms,the only manufacturers that may in the future be found liable to the state for the damages inflicted by their products.see kt g,at.
the problem in bell was not that liability was generally involved,but that the payments were tied to specific accidents,and therefore to actual liability.under the statute at issue in bell,uninsured motorists were required to post security after they had been in an accident.at.because the posting of security essentially turned on an assessment of the individual fault in causing the accident,liability was an important factor in the deprivation.see logan zimmerman,quoting bell,at.by contrast,the asr requires npms to create an escrow account as a precondition to selling cigarettes in louisiana.although the payout of escrowed funds to satisfy a judgment will ultimately depend on an individualized assessment of liability,the initial depositing of funds does not.put differently,the escrow reserves are not specific to any particular litigation rather,they are legislative preconditions for the privilege of engaging in future cigarette sales in the individual states.grand river,at.
since we conclude that louisiana decision to require npms to make escrow deposits is legislative in character,no further process is required,see jackson court condominiums,at,and xcaliber argument fails.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the state.
if an npm distributed its cigarettes nationally,and its distribution patterns approximated those of the national market,its payment obligations on its national sales would be apportioned percent among the settling states,with the result that something close to percent of its payments would,in the aggregate,be retained under the original escrow provision.however,if an npm were to concentrate its business to a single state,such as louisiana,it would make percent of its sales there and would be able to recoup the payments on all but roughly percent,which is louisiana approximate allocable share.while the pms would be required to continue percent of their payments under the msa,an npm that focused on a single regional area could be virtually exempt from the payments,thereby gaining a competitive advantage.if an npm distributed its cigarettes nationally,and its distribution patterns approximated those of the national market,its payment obligations on its national sales would be apportioned percent among the settling states,with the result that something close to percent of its payments would,in the aggregate,be retained under the original escrow provision.however,if an npm were to concentrate its business to a single state,such as louisiana,it would make percent of its sales there and would be able to recoup the payments on all but roughly percent,which is louisiana approximate allocable share.while the pms would be required to continue percent of their payments under the msa,an npm that focused on a single regional area could be virtually exempt from the payments,thereby gaining a competitive advantage.

xcaliber argues that rice is not the correct standard and cites to other preemption cases that supposedly show that the proper inquiry is much broader.we find xcaliber complaints about rice to be misguided.first,the preemption cases xcaliber cites do not involve the sherman act.because states are permitted to enact legislation that impacts competition without necessarily running afoul of the sherman act,see community communications city of boulder,the preemption analysis under the sherman act is different than the preemption analysis under other statutes.second,even if rice applies only to facial challenges,the point does not help xcaliber because its complaint presents a facial challenge.rather than seeking a private remedy against private parties or an injunction against enforcement of the statute in some specific,limited situation,xcaliber seeks a declaratory judgment that the asr is preempted by the sherman act and an injunction against the enforcement of the asr in all situations.that is,xcaliber claims the asr is unconstitutional under the supremacy clause in its every application.accordingly,we apply the rice per se analysis rather than rule of reason analysis.see rice,at.we also note that the other courts that have considered a claim that the msa or its related legislation is preempted by the sherman act have applied rice.see grand river enters.six nations,beebe,cir kt g att y of state of,cir sanders brown,cir,cert.denied.s m brands,summers,d,aff,fed.app tritent int l,cir freedom holdings,spitzer,reh g denied,cir,on remand,freedom holdings,cuomo,d,appeal docketed,cir.xcaliber argues that rice is not the correct standard and cites to other preemption cases that supposedly show that the proper inquiry is much broader.we find xcaliber complaints about rice to be misguided.first,the preemption cases xcaliber cites do not involve the sherman act.because states are per
