under parker brown,state action is immune from sherman act antitrust liability.this case presents the question of whether a public university,edinboro university of pennsylvania of the state system of higher education the university,and its nonprofit collaborator,edinboro university foundation the foundation,are entitled to such immunity.on defendants motions to dismiss,the district court held that parker immunity automatically applies to the university because the university is an arm of the state.
although dismissal was appropriate,the district court painted with too broad a brush.the university actions are not categorically sovereign for purposes of parker immunity.because of that,we are required to apply heightened scrutiny.we conclude that the appropriate standard is derived from the supreme court decision in town of hallie city of eau claire,which requires anticompetitive conduct to conform to a clearly articulated state policy.we further conclude that,taking the allegations in the amended complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,the university conduct withstands hallie scrutiny.furthermore,because the foundation actions were directed by the university,the foundation is also immune.we will affirm in part on those alternative grounds and remand with the instruction that the amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice.
this case arises out of the need for student housing at edinboro university,a public university located in edinboro,pennsylvania.plaintiffs are private business entities that provide residential housing near the university.according to plaintiffs,the university conspired with edinboro university foundation,a nonprofit entity that conducts fundraising on behalf of the university,to monopolize the market.
public higher education in pennsylvania operates under a series of constitutional,legislative,and administrative mandates.the pennsylvania constitution requires the general assembly to provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to serve the needs of the commonwealth.const.art.iii.the general assembly,in turn,enacted legislation creating the pennsylvania state system of higher education,or passhe.see a.passhe is a body corporate and politic,governed by a chancellor and the board of governors,see id.edinboro university is one of fourteen constituent institutions of the passhe system.id.a.the university is governed by its president and council of trustees.see id.
at issue in this case is the university decision to collaborate with the foundation in order to construct new dormitories called the highlands.in january,the foundation amended its articles of incorporation to authorize borrowing funds to acquire,lease,construct,develop manage real or personal property.am.compl.the foundation then signed a cooperation agreement with the university the university would lease certain property to the foundation in a favorable location,and in turn the foundation would finance,construct,and manage the highlands dormitories.the foundation issued bonds to raise the funds and began construction.
plaintiffs aver that,after construction was completed,the university took anticompetitive measures to ensure that the foundation recouped its investment.since,the university maintained a parietal rule requiring and transfer students to reside for two consecutive semesters.on may,two and years after the first phase of the highlands dormitories opened,the university amended its policy to require certain students to reside for four consecutive semesters or until they complete at least credit hours.
plaintiffs brought suit,asserting that the university and the foundation conspired to monopolize the market in violation of section of the sherman act,the amended complaint states that plaintiffs experienced a decline in business after the university expanded its residency requirement.plaintiffs also aver that this conduct harms students by forcing them to pay higher rates for housing and participate in the university meal plans.
plaintiffs did not sue the university,conceding that the university is an arm of the state subject to immunity under the eleventh amendment instead,plaintiffs sued the foundation and the university president in her official capacity for prospective relief pursuant to ex parte young,
by order dated march,the district court dismissed plaintiffs amended complaint with prejudice on the ground that defendants conduct constitutes state action immune from sherman act antitrust liability under the parker doctrine.see edinboro coll.park apartments edinboro,wl.this timely appeal followed.

we begin with an overview of the applicable law.in parker brown,the supreme court held that the sherman act does not prohibit anticompetitive state action.that ruling embodies the federalism principle that the states possess a significant measure of sovereignty under our constitution.cmty.cmmc ns city of boulder.states may impose restrictions on occupations,confer exclusive or shared rights to dominate a market,or otherwise limit competition to achieve public objectives.state bd.of dental exam rs ftc.without parker immunity,federal antitrust law would impose an impermissible burden on the states power to subordinate market competition to other values a state may deem fundamental.id.
then nearly half a century after parker,the supreme court clarified that immunity is disfavored.ftc ticor title ins.to ensure that the doctrine is appropriately limited,the supreme court has devised three approaches to analyzing a defense ipso facto immunity,midcal scrutiny,and hallie scrutiny.which test applies depends on whether the relevant actor is comparable to a sovereign power,a private business,or something in between.
the doctrine of ipso facto immunity is the least searching.once it is determined that the relevant action is an undoubted exercise of state sovereign authority undertaken by an actor whose conduct automatically qualif ies as that of the sovereign state itself,that conduct is immune without the need for any further analysis.dental exam rs,at see bedell wholesale philip morris,cir.immunity for direct state action applies only when the allegedly anticompetitive behavior was the direct result of acts within the traditional sovereign powers of the state.the supreme court has recognized only two such contexts acts of state legislatures,and decisions of a state supreme court,acting legislatively rather than judicially.hoover ronwin,see parker,at we find nothing in the language of the sherman act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.the supreme court has rejected ipso facto immunity for entities that are state agenc ies for some limited purposes.goldfarb.state bar.
the most searching level of scrutiny derives from the supreme court decision in california retail liquor dealers association midcal aluminum.there,a private party sought parker immunity on the ground that it acted in accordance with state policy.to prevent a private party from casting a gauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a private arrangement,midcal,at,the conduct must pass a rigorous test.first,the state must enact a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed policy permitting anticompetitive conduct and second,the state must actively supervise that conduct.id.at citation omitted.midcal analysis applies where private actors seek to immunize their anticompetitive conduct under the parker doctrine,see,id.at,or where a state agency is deemed functionally private because it is controlled by active market participants,dental exam rs,at.
finally,the supreme court announced an intermediate standard of review in town of hallie city of eau claire.there,it determined that municipalities are exempt from midcal second prong active supervision but must still comply with the first prong conformity with a clearly articulated state policy.id.at.the supreme court observed that the municipality was an arm of the state entitled to a presumption that it acts in the public interest,id.at,the municipality is politically accountable for its anticompetitive policies,id.at,and there is thus little or no danger that the municipality would become involved in a private arrangement,id.at.in dicta,the supreme court has suggested that prototypical state agencies may be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny as a municipality.see id.at in cases in which the actor is a state agency,it is likely that active state supervision midcal second prong would also not be required,although we do not here decide that issue.dental exam rs,at t he municipality in hallie was more like prototypical state agencies,not specialized boards dominated by active market participants.
in sum,the supreme court has established the following principles ipso facto immunity applies to state legislatures and state supreme courts,but not to entities that are state agencies for limited purposes midcal scrutiny applies to private parties and state agencies controlled by active market participants and hallie scrutiny applies to municipalities,and perhaps state agencies.applying those principles to the facts alleged in the amended complaint resolves this appeal.
because the level of scrutiny for immunity turns on the character of the relevant actor,the first step of any parker analysis is to identify the actor that performed the alleged anticompetitive conduct.we conclude that plaintiffs alleged antitrust injury stems entirely from the conduct of the university,and we focus our analysis accordingly.
when beginning a parker analysis that involves a private defendant,it is critically important to determine whether the private defendant caused the alleged antitrust injury bedell,at.in some cases,private defendants independently engage in anticompetitive conduct,such as price fixing,and then seek immunity under the gauzy cloak of state involvement.midcal,at.in such a scenario,full midcal scrutiny is required.id.but in other cases,midcal scrutiny may not be necessary because the private defendant does not act on its own and is merely an adjunct to a government anticompetitive action.if a governmental actor is independently responsible for causing the alleged antitrust injury,once it is determined to be immune,the immunity should be extended to include private parties acting under its direction.zimomra alamo,cir.otherwise,plaintiffs could sue only the private parties and by winning antitrust judgments against them,could thwart state policies as if there were no state i mmunity.bedell,at see also motor carriers rate conference,united states.in massachusetts school of law at andover,american bar association,for example,this court found that a private entity was shielded behind the ipso facto immunity of the state without need for midcal scrutiny because the alleged antitrust injury was caused solely by direct sovereign action,cir.
in this case,plaintiffs allege that the public university and the private foundation conspired to monopolize the market.but the only alleged actions of the foundation amending its charter,issuing bonds,building the dormitories,and managing the property are consistent with participation in a competitive market.the foundation advantage derived entirely from the university decision to expand its residency rule,which required more students to live in dormitories like the highlands.plaintiffs have not identified any independent conduct of the foundation that conceivably restricted competition.see atl.richfield usa petroleum,i njury will not qualify as antitrust injury unless it is attributable to an aspect of the practice under scrutiny.
nor is this a case of hybrid anticompetitive conduct.see bedell,at bedell involved a multistate settlement agreement brokered between the governments of several states and certain tobacco manufacturers.the plaintiffs alleged that the agreement established a cartel whereby private tobacco companies would be permitted to restrict output.this court observed that the alleged anticompetitive conduct was neither purely private nor entirely attributable to the state.id.rather,the alleged antitrust injury derived from a hybrid restraint,which involve d a degree of private action which calls for midcal analysis.id.citing rice norman williams,stevens,concurring.but in this case,there is no comparable degree of private action,such as participation in a cartel,which calls for midcal analysis.id.
we conclude that the foundation was merely acting under the direction of the university.zimomra,at.therefore,if the university is immune,the foundation must be as well.motor carriers,at.sch.of law,at.given that understanding of the foundation role in the challenged conduct,we proceed to analyze how the doctrine applies to the university 
the fundamental question we must decide is which tier of scrutiny applies to the university conduct no further review if the university is ipso facto immune,midcal review,or hallie review.the district court held that the university is ipso facto immune because it is an arm of the state.we disagree.instead,we conclude that hallie review is appropriate because the university is more analogous to a municipality than to a private market participant.
the district court held that the university is ipso facto immune because the university is an arm of the state under the eleventh amendment.but those two immunity doctrines are not coextensive.even if the university were an arm of the state,the university is not sovereign for purposes of parker.unlike the general assembly or the supreme court of pennsylvania,the university can not legislate anticompetitive policies on behalf of the commonwealth.thus,the university decision to expand its residency requirement is not entitled to ipso facto immunity.
sovereign action for purposes of direct parker immunity is qualitatively different from state action in more familiar contexts.bedell,at.while traditional state action can cover 
inadvertent or unilateral acts of state officials not acting pursuant to state policy the term state action in antitrust adjudication refers only to government policies that are articulated with sufficient clarity that it can be said that these are in fact the state policies,and not simply happenstance,mistakes,or acts reflecting the discretion of individual officials.
id.quoting philip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law ed.thus,conduct might be deemed nonsovereign for purposes of parker immunity even if sectors of state government are involved.see dental exam rs,at recognizing that nonsovereign entities can be public or private.in accordance with those principles,the supreme court has recognized ipso facto immunity in two limited contexts state legislation and the decisions of state supreme courts,acting legislatively.hoover,at.the court reserved the question of whether the governor of a state is ipso facto immune,id.at,but as described below,has consistently required heightened scrutiny for subordinate branches of state government.
recently in north carolina state board of dental examiners ftc,the supreme court addressed the status of an agency of the state with the authority to regulate the practice of dentistry in north carolina.at.the dissenting justices would have found ipso facto immunity,providing a simple resolution.see id.at alito,dissenting under parker,the sherman act do es not apply to state agencies the north carolina board of dental examiners is a state agency and that is the end of the matter.
but instead,the court treated the regulatory board as a nonsovereign actor.it began with the familiar principle that s tate legislation and decision s of a state supreme court,acting legislatively are entitled to ipso facto immunity because they are an undoubted exercise of state sovereign authority.id.at majority opinion.but the court declined to apply ipso facto immunity to the agency 
for purposes of parker,a nonsovereign actor is one whose conduct does not automatically qualify as that of the sovereign state itself.state agencies are not simply by their governmental character sovereign actors for purposes of immunity.immunity for state agencies,therefore,requires more than a mere facade of state involvement 
id.at citations omitted.
the supreme court treatment of state agencies in dental examiners continues a long line of similar precedents.as we noted above,the court found that a state bar a state agency by law did not receive ipso facto immunity.goldfarb,at.the fact that the state bar is a state agency for some limited purposes does not create an antitrust shield that allows it to foster anticompetitive practices for the benefit of its members.see also,motor carriers,at the circumstances in which parker immunity is available to state agencies or officials regulating the conduct of private parties are defined most specifically by our decision in midcal.city of lafayette.power light,plurality opinion f or purposes of the parker doctrine,not every act of a state agency is that of the state as sovereign.hallie,at.
applying those principles,we conclude that the university is not entitled to ipso facto immunity.the university is not a sovereign decisionmaker analogous to a state legislature or state supreme court.
when the university amended its policy mandating a longer term of residency,it was not exercising sovereign powers.rather,it was exercising discretion delegated by the pennsylvania legislature,akin to acting as a state agency.see hoover,at closer analysis is required when the activity at issue is not directly that of the legislature or supreme court,but is carried out by others pursuant to state authorization.sch.of law,at applying ipso facto immunity because this case does not involve a delegation of state authority.as such,the university conduct did not represent the sovereign will simply by its governmental character.dental exam rs,at.it follows,a fortiori,that the university fits the definition of a nonsovereign actor for purposes of parker one whose conduct does not automatically qualify as that of the sovereign state itself.id 
the university,in fact,presents an easier case than prototypical state agencies.at most,the university is comparable to a state agency for some limited purposes.goldfarb,at emphasis added.unlike prototypical state agencies,the university authority is limited to managing its own affairs and the affairs of its students,who voluntarily attend.it does not wield regulatory power.thus,by comparison to other divisions of state government that might present closer cases,the university is clearly not sovereign for purposes of parker immunity 
because the university is not a sovereign actor analogous to a state legislature or state supreme court,its pronouncements are not entitled to ipso facto immunity.defendants are p lainly in error in arguing that parker held that all governmental entities,whether state agencies or subdivisions of a state,are,simply by reason of their status as such,exempt from the antitrust laws.lafayette,at.
defendants argue that several of our sister circuits have recognized broad ipso facto immunity for the states executive branches.those cases are distinguishable.
in neo gen screening,new england newborn screening program,cir,the first circuit conferred ipso facto parker immunity on the massachusetts department of public health.in doing so,the court recognized that the status of state boards or commissions is open to dispute,and thus limited its holding to situations where a department is concerned.id.at.likewise,in hawaii,department of transportation,cir,and subsequently charley taxi radio dispatch sida of hawaii,cir,the ninth circuit found ipso facto immunity for the actions of hawaii department of transportation.
because we hold that the university is analogous to a state agency for some limited purposes,goldfarb,at,rather than a department,neo gen,at,our decision does not conflict with those rulings.we continue to reserve the question addressed by those courts whether ipso facto immunity applies to prototypical state agencies or executive officials acting within their lawfully delegated authority.bedell,at we have yet to address whether the acts of executive officials constitute state action that avoids midcal analysis.
finally,defendants rely on saenz university interscholastic league,cir.there,the fifth circuit found parker immunity because the defendant was an integral part of the university of texas at austin,and therefore constitute d a governmental entity outside the ambit of the sherman act.id.at.but saenz predates every development to the parker doctrine we have discussed in this decision.not only does it predate midcal and hallie,but also it predates goldfarb,the first case where the supreme court held that a state agency is not ipso facto immune.simply put,the analysis we are required to apply did not exist at the time saenz was decided.accordingly,we join those courts that have applied modern principles to deny ipso facto immunity to public universities.see,auraria student hous.at the regency,llc campus vill.apartments,llc,cir.porter testing lab.bd.of regents for.agric.mech,cir.seaman duke,wl,at,humana of,bd.of trustees of,wl,at.june,am.bank trust of chi.bd.of regents for regency,supp,see also daniel am.bd.of emergency,supp,university hospitals.
we conclude that the university conduct does not constitute direct sovereign action under the parker doctrine.while the university is a governmental entity,a cting alone,it is not empowered with the sovereign authority to legislate the policy of the state itself.motor carriers,at.
having concluded that ipso facto immunity is inappropriate,closer analysis is required.hoover,at.ordinarily that entails applying midcal rigorous test.but there are instances in which an actor can be excused from midcal requirement.dental exam rs,at.we conclude that this is such an instance because the university is more closely analogous to the municipality in hallie than to a private market participant.
the university is exempt from midcal requirement in accordance with the supreme court reasoning in hallie.
in hallie,the court contrasted the incentives of municipalities and private parties.it observed that,because the municipality was an arm of the state,w e may presume,absent a showing to the contrary,that the municipality acts in the public interest.a private party,on the other hand,may be presumed to be acting primarily on its own behalf.hallie,at.the court then reasoned 
where a private party is engaging in the anticompetitive activity,there is a real danger that he is acting to further his own interests,rather than the governmental interests of the state.where the actor is a municipality,there is little or no danger that it is involved in a private arrangement.the only real danger is that it will seek to further purely parochial public interests at the expense of more overriding state goals.this danger is minimal,however,because of the requirement that the municipality act pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy.once it is clear that state authorization exists,there is no need to require the state to supervise actively the municipality execution of what is a properly delegated function.
we conclude that this reasoning applies squarely to the university.like the municipality in hallie,the university is not a sovereign actor,but is still an arm of the state presumed to act in the public interest.id.at.unlike a private business,the university is more closely aligned with certain governmental interests of the state.id.by advancing the project of higher education a project blessed by the pennsylvania legislature as a valuable public function the university is primarily at risk that it will seek to further p
