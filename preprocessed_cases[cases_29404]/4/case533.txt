jes properties,jes and michael gallagher appeal from the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of united states equestrian federation usef thomas struzzieri,horse shows in the sun,and rose view stables,ltd collectively,hits eugene mische and stadium jumping,collectively,sji and david burton.david burton,burton and sons,and littlewood fences,collectively,the burtons hits,sji and the burtons are referred to collectively as the promoter defendants.the district court concluded that jes and gallagher had failed to raise a triable issue of fact regarding their claim that the usef and the promoter defendants violated section of the sherman antitrust act.we affirm.
since,the united states equestrian federation usef and its predecessor the usa equestrian,usae have governed the sport of amateur equestrianism in the united states.the rules that govern all american equestrian competitions were promulgated originally by the usae.in june,the united states olympic committee usoc,pursuant to the ted stevens olympic and amateur sports act,et.asa,officially appointed the usef as the sole national governing body for the sport ngb.when appointed as the ngb,the usef board of directors adopted the same rules promoted by usae,but with some changes effective in.
the usef consists of private individuals such as professional and amateur,trainers,judges,horse owners and officials amateur sports organizations such as the north florida hunter and jumper association,and promoters who profit financially by holding equestrian competitions.the usef maintains a member board of directors to promulgate the rules of the sport.the board of directors of the usef contains ten members of the community and no less than twenty percent of the voting power is allocated to active equestrian athletes.an active athlete is one who is engaged in equestrian competition or has represented the united states at an amateur international competition within the past ten years.
the ngb rules sanction certain equestrian competitions called recognized competitions,which provide particular benefits to riders and promoters.recognized competitions allow riders to collect points from wins.wins lead to invitations to more prestigious competitions.in addition,recognized competitions award a total prize money amount of or more for the jumper section of the competition.
recognized competitions that are considered a or are the highest rated competitions.they award the most points and in theory attract the best riders.in order to represent the united states at an international level,including the olympic games,athletes must compete in competitions and typically excel in the a or competitions.
all recognized competitions are subject to general rule mileage rule,which was promulgated in by usae known at that time as the american horse shows association and adopted by the usef the mileage rule requires that any recognized competitions held on the same date must be held at least miles away from each other.this is true for all but some northeastern states,which are subject to a radius distance for competitions.the required distance diminishes as the rating decreases.unrated or local competitions on the same date can be held within fifty miles of each other.
under the mileage rule,an competition that was held on a certain date in the previous year receives priority.a promoter may nevertheless obtain usef recognition if all affected competition managements agree in writing to permit the additional recognized competition.this written agreement is referred to as a waiver.stricter still for competitions,the usef requires a waiver for each year and an additional competition can never be closer than ten miles from an established one.however,a promoter may hold an competition elsewhere or on a different date without obtaining a waiver.similarly,a promoter may hold b or competitions.the purpose of the mileage rule appears to be twofold.first,it aims to concentrate elite riders into fewer competitions in order to yield the most competitive international equestrian team possible.second,the rule intends to promote equestrianism nationwide by forcing promoters to hold recognized competitions in more diverse locations.
jes and gallagher are among those usef members who gain financially from promoting equestrian competitions.the promoter defendants also hold competitions for profit.jes,gallagher,and the promoter defendants have conducted usef sanctioned competitions throughout the state of florida.jes,gallagher,hits,and the burtons have also held unrecognized competitions in florida.
in florida,the weather is desirable for equestrian competition in the winter months,december through march.because of the weather,the most lucrative and profitable winter season competitions occur in florida.for the winter seasons of,and,the promoter defendants planned every weekend to hold competitions in florida.the promoter defendants secured these dates and facilities in florida before jes and gallagher.due to the mileage rule,jes and gallagher were unable to secure a date between december and march on which to hold a or competitions in florida.as provided by the rule,jes and gallagher requested waivers from the affected competition managements,the promoter defendants.the promoter defendants denied jes and gallagher requests for waivers.
in,hits and sji granted each other waivers that have been renewed each subsequent year.the reciprocal agreement permitted each promoter to hold usef sanctioned competitions within the mile restriction.
jes and gallagher filed a complaint challenging the mileage rule as a violation of the sherman antitrust act.they also alleged that the promoter defendants committed antitrust violations by granting each other waivers while refusing to grant waivers to jes and gallagher.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the usef and the promoter defendants.it concluded that each defendant was entitled to implied immunity from antitrust liability jes and gallagher lacked antitrust standing jes and gallagher failed to present evidence of concerted action and the rule of reason applied to the usef and the promoter defendants actions,and their actions were not an unreasonable restraint of trade.jes and gallagher timely appeal each of those conclusions.we conclude that the usef and the promoter defendants are entitled to implied immunity.we address standing briefly,but we do not reach the other issues raised by jes and gallagher.
jes and gallagher argue that the district court erred in its determination that they lacked antitrust standing.whether a plaintiff has standing to prosecute an antitrust claim is a question of law.todorov dch healthcare,cir.standing in an antitrust case involves more than the case or controversy requirement that drives constitutional standing.id.citing flast cohen,d.rather,antitrust standing involves an analysis of prudential considerations aimed at preserving the effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.id.
because we conclude that the usef and the promoter defendants are immune from antitrust liability,we need not determine whether jes and gallagher have standing.levine central.med.affiliates,cir.in levine,this court noted 
when a court concludes that no antitrust violation has occurred,it has no occasion to consider standing an increasing number of courts,unfortunately,deny standing when they really mean that no violation has occurred.in particular,the antitrust injury element of standing demands that the plaintiff alleged injury result from the threat to competition that underlies the alleged violation.a court seeing no threat to competition in a case may then deny that the plaintiff has suffered antitrust injury and dismiss the suit for lack of standing.such a ruling would be erroneous,for the absence of any threat to competition means that no violation has occurred and that even suit by the enjoys automatic be dismissed.
