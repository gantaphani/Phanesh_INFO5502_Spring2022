the are employees of caremark.they filed a qui tam action under the false claims act.et.the district court held that subject matter jurisdiction existed but dismissed the complaint on the merits.on appeal,the relators argue that the district court erred in dismissing the case while caremark argues that the case should have been dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction.we conclude that subject matter jurisdiction exists and we affirm the judgment of the district court on the merits.
the united states government,like many employers,provides health insurance benefits to its employees.the government contracts with various private health insurance plans.federal employees are able to choose among these private health insurance plans.both the united states and individual federal employees make premium payments to the plans for the health coverage.
many health plans provide prescription drug coverage as part of their benefit package for the participating federal employees.in turn,a number of these plans contract with caremark to provide the prescription drug benefits provided under their respective plans.caremark ultimately receives payment from the federal government and its employees for the prescription drugs and related services provided under the plans.
the relators,we call them relators,they call themselves whistleblowers,were employed by caremark at two of its prescription drug processing facilities.the relators brought a false claims act suit on behalf of the united states alleging that caremark engaged in six fraudulent schemes failing to provide a credit for returned prescription drugs changing prescriptions without proper approval misrepresenting the savings obtained from its recommendations failing to substitute a generic version of prilosec failing to credit for prescriptions lost in the mail and manipulating the mandatory times for filing prescriptions.
the relators filed their original complaint under seal in december.an amended complaint was also filed under seal in march.in july,the united states attorney office for the northern district of illinois contacted caremark and asked it to cooperate in an investigation of caremark business practices.from october through january,caremark disclosed in excess of pages of documents to the attorney office.these documents included caremark contracts with the health insurance plans serving federal employees,invoices,quarterly reports,caremark internal reports,memoranda and training procedures.in january,the government declined to intervene in this case and the case was unsealed by the district court in february.in april and may,the relators obtained discovery materials from both caremark and the attorney office.
in may,the district court granted caremark motion to dismiss the first amended complaint holding that the complaint failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of rule b.united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,c,wl.may.the relators were granted leave to file a second amended complaint which they did in june.
caremark then argued that case should be dismissed pursuant to the jurisdictional bar contained in e.caremark position was that the relators second amended complaint was based on publicly disclosed information and the relators were not the original source of this information.the district court rejected caremark jurisdictional argument and held that the relators met the requirements of e.united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,c,wl,at.
however on the merits,the district court held that despite increasing in size,the second amended complaint failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of rule.the second amended complaint consisted of paragraphs spanning over pages and also had over pages of attached exhibits.id.at.the district court explained that despite its length,the second amended complaint failed to identify a single prescription through which caremark perpetrated the alleged fraud.nor do they tie a specific fraudulent transaction to an invoice submitted to the government n otice sufficient to satisfy rule b is woefully inadequate where,as here,plaintiffs allege only generalized schemes and fail to specify a single false claim.id.at.
the relators were then given an opportunity to seek leave to file a third amended complaint.however,the district court warned the relators that the case could be dismissed in its entirety if they failed to provide a proposed third amended complaint that complied with the federal rules.the relators then tendered their proposed third amended complaint and sought leave to file the complaint.the district court rejected the proposed third amended complaint holding that it failed to meet the requirements of rule b.united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,c,wl.the district court,pursuant to rule a,denied the relators request to file the new amended complaint and entered a judgment dismissing the case in its entirety.
ii.analysis 
a.the jurisdictional bar of e 
caremark argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,pursuant to the jurisdictional bar set forth in e,because the relators claims are based on publicly disclosed information and the relators are not the original source of this information.the supreme court has recently determined that e is a jurisdictional requirement implicating subject matter jurisdiction and therefore no from caremark is required.rockwell int l united states,d see generally luna united states,cir citing arbaugh y h,d noting that a is not required when a party is contesting subject matter jurisdiction mccready white,cir ensuring the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is the court first duty in every lawsuit.citing steel citizens for a better env t,d.we note that the relators proposed third amended complaint is the controlling document to be considered by this court.w hen a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends the complaint,courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.rockwell.at citing wellness l wellness house,cir boelens redman homes,cir.
title,united states code,section e states 
a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
e.the bar is designed to deter parasitic qui tam actions o nce information becomes public,only the attorney general and a relator who is an original source of the information may represent the united states.united states ex rel.gear emergency med.of illinois,cir.
the inquiry into whether a court may hear a qui tam relator claim has three parts have the allegations made by the plaintiff been publicly disclosed if so,is the lawsuit based upon that publicly disclosed information if so,is the plaintiff an original source of the information united states ex rel.mathews bank of farmington,cir citing united states ex rel.cooper blue cross and blue shield of florida,cir see also gear,at united states ex rel.feingold adminastar,cir.
before we begin the analysis,it should be noted that there are three types of information in the relators possession in this case.first is the relators inside information that they obtained during their work at caremark.second is the information disclosed by caremark directly to the relators.third is the information disclosed by caremark to the attorney office and then passed from the attorney office to the relators 
issue have the allegations made by the plaintiff been publicly disclosed 
a public disclosure exists under e a when the critical elements exposing the transaction as fraudulent are placed in the public domain.feingold,at citing united states ex rel.rabushka crane,cir united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.the point of public disclosure of a false claim against the government is to bring it to the attention of the authorities,not merely to educate and enlighten the public about the dangers of misappropriation of their tax money.mathews,at.
disclosure of information to a competent public official about an alleged false claim against the government is a public disclosure within the meaning of e a when the disclosure is made to one who has managerial responsibility for the very claims being made.id.the more open a public disclosure,the less any specific public official needs to be informed.id.conversely,i f the disclosure is made to precisely the public official responsible for the claim,it need not be disclosed to anyone else to be a public disclosure within the meaning of the act.id.and,of course,disclosure to the government by a qui tam plaintiff of the information on which the complaint is based,as mandated in a,is not public disclosure under e a.id.at.
caremark disclosure of information to the attorney office during the government investigation of caremark business practices qualifies as a public disclosure of the relators allegations.the scope of the investigation involved whether caremark defrauded the federal government through its participation in the federal employee health insurance programs.the attorney is the primary legal representative of the united states within his or her respective district,and would be the public official responsible for bringing criminal or civil claims against caremark on this issue.thus,the relators allegations have been publicly disclosed.
issue is the lawsuit based upon that publicly disclosed information 
a lawsuit is based upon public ly disclose d information when it both depends essentially upon publicly disclosed information and is actually derived from such information.feingold,at quoting mathews,at.caremark notes that our standard conflicts with the standard adopted by the majority of circuits and argues that we should reconsider our position in light of this conflict.
the majority of circuits apply the standard that a qui tam action is based upon a public disclosure when the supporting allegations are the same as those that have been publicly disclosed regardless of where the relator obtained his information.mathews,at quoting united states ex rel.doe john doe,cir citing united states ex rel.kreindler kreindler united tech,cir united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn,united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir wang ex rel.united states fmc,cir united states ex rel.precision koch,cir united states ex rel.cooper blue cross and blue shield of florida,cir see also united states ex rel.paranich sorgnard,cir federal recovery servs.united states,cir united states ex rel.minnesota of nurse anesthetists allina health,cir.in mathews,we declined to adopt the majority standard and instead adopted our current standard from the fourth circuit decision see mathews,at citing,cir.
in mathews,we explained that the fourth circuit standard of based upon is better on the grounds both of plain meaning and public policy.id.the plain language argument is that based upon does not mean similar even identical to but derived from.id.quoting siller,at.the public policy justification is that information which happens to be similar or identical to publicly disclosed allegations or transactions,but which derives from some other source than the public disclosure,is not parasitic,and should not be barred by a provision meant to bar parasitic lawsuits.id.quoting siller,at.
in united states ex rel.mistick pbt housing auth.of the city of pittsburgh,the third circuit analyzed the circuit split and concluded that there was merit on both sides of the split,cir alito.according to the mistick court,although the minority standard was a more faithful plain language interpretation,the interpretation would render the original source exception largely superfluous.id.thus,the circuit split was framed as a clash between two textual arguments concerning the meaning of e a one based on the ordinary meaning of the phrase based upon and one based on the precept that a statute should be construed if possible so as not to render any of its terms superfluous.id.at citations omitted.citing various drafting errors in the statute,the third circuit determined that t he inescapable conclusion is that the qui tam provision does not reflect careful drafting and therefore we are hesitant to attach too much significance to a fine parsing of the syntax.id.at.consequently,it rejected the plain language interpretation of the minority standard and determined the majority standard to be superior.
judge becker dissented from the mistick decision.he noting that traditionally courts defer to the plain language interpretation of statutes,there were several plausible situations in which the plain meaning interpretation would not make the original source clause superfluous,the plain meaning interpretation was consistent with how congress had used based upon in another statute,and the plain language interpretation was consistent with both the false claims act underlying policy and legislative history.id.at becker,dissenting.
we reject caremark invitation to alter our position and reaffirm our adherence to the standard that a lawsuit is based upon public ly disclose d information when it both depends essentially upon publicly disclosed information and is actually derived from such information.feingold,at.in a statutory construction case,the beginning point must be the language of the statute,and when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute meaning,in all but the most extraordinary circumstances,is finished.estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d citing demarest manspeaker,d.both the majority and minority standard have rallied powerful arguments to their respective sides,but the minority standard holds the trump card,the plain language interpretation.we may be in the minority,but we will not jettison a standard when that standard includes an appropriate plain language interpretation of the statute.
returning to the jurisdictional analysis,we must determine whether the relators proposed third amended complaint depends essentially upon publicly disclosed information and is actually derived from such information.feingold,at.the relators proposed third amended complaint will not meet the jurisdictional bar of e if the relators used materials that they received from the attorney office.however,the complaint will meet the jurisdictional requirement if it is only based on other materials such as the relators inside knowledge that they obtained while working at caremark and caremark disclosures made directly from caremark to the relators.
in its review of the second amended complaint,the district court determined that the relators based their complaint on their inside information and information obtained directly from caremark direct disclosure to the relators.thus,jurisdiction was present,according to the district court because there was no evidence of information being used from the attorney office disclosure.of course,the proposed third amended complaint is the controlling document to be considered because the district court has dismissed the second amended complaint on rule grounds,and now the relators seek leave to file their proposed third amended complaint.however,based on the fact that the relators practice has been to build current complaints off of prior complaints,and caremark has not pointed to any indication in the proposed third complaint that the attorney office material was used in any way to construct the proposed complaint,we conclude that the proposed third amended complaint is not actually derived from any publicly disclosed information provided by caremark to the attorney office and then passed onto the relators.
caremark has not pointed to specific items in the complaint that it says comes from the attorney office disclosure.instead,caremark position is that the attorney office disclos
