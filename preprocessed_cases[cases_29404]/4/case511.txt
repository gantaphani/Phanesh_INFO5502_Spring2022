plaintiffs,retail grocery stores operating in the tulsa,oklahoma area,brought this diversity action under the oklahoma antitrust reform act against their local distributor of pepsi and affiliated beverage products and its holding company bottling group and holdings.plaintiffs alleged that bottling group unlawfully discontinued sales to plaintiffs in response to a price discrimination lawsuit plaintiffs had previously brought against bottling group.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of bottling group and holdings.on appeal,plaintiffs primarily challenge the district court definition of the relevant product market.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
background 
plaintiffs are corporations that operate grocery stores,each owned in whole or in part by either steven davis or brian honel.plaintiff brissa,operated by honel and plaintiff plaza redbud operated by davis had purchased pepsi and affiliated beverage products from beverage products corporation bpc,the exclusive distributor of these products in the tulsa area.by,honel and davis had recognized that they were often unable to sell their pepsi products at prices competitive with other area grocery stores.honel and davis compared their invoices from bpc and discovered that bpc had been charging them different wholesale prices for the beverage products it distributed.on january,plaintiffs brissa and plaza redbud sued bpc for price discrimination under oklahoma antitrust laws.
on february,bpc transferred all assets,liabilities,and stock to bottling group holdings,holdings,which the same day transferred the same assets,liabilities,and stock to bottling group,llc bottling group.bottling group is majority owned by holdings,and holdings is indirectly wholly owned by the pepsi bottling group.
on february,bottling group discontinued sales to plaintiffs brissa and plaza redbud because of a distinct decrease in the level of trust between bottling group and each grocery store stemming from the pending price discrimination lawsuit.bottling group has also refused to distribute its products to other plaintiff grocery stores that honel and davis have acquired.plaintiffs therefore have no access,other than retail purchase,to the pepsi and affiliated beverage products distributed by bottling group.
plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against both bottling group and holdings under and of the oklahoma antitrust reform act.stat.tit,et.the complaint alleged monopolization,attempt to monopolize,and conspiracy to monopolize under b and denial of access to an essential facility under c,and requested injunctive relief and monetary damages under.all allegations were predicated on bottling group refusal to deal with plaintiffs following plaintiffs initiation of the price discrimination lawsuit against bpc.
the district court denied plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction and granted summary judgment in favor of bottling group and holdings.the district court held that plaintiffs had not pled a claim under a of the oklahoma antitrust reform act,which prohibits unilateral acts in restraint of trade,and that their claims under b and c of the act failed because plaintiffs had not proven that the beverage products distributed by bottling group comprised a relevant product market.
plaintiffs timely filed this appeal.plaintiffs argue that the complaint stated a claim under a and,in the alternative,that the complaint should have been treated by the district court as constructively amended,under federal rule of civil procedure b,to include a a claim.plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in requiring plaintiffs to offer proof of a relevant product market and,in the alternative,in rejecting plaintiffs narrow definition of the relevant product market.
discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard used by the district court.state of utah babbitt,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we construe the facts and inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.babbitt,at 
whether plaintiffs properly pled a a claim 
the complaint 
a complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.the statement must give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.conley gibson,d.
a plaintiff should not be prevented from pursuing a claim simply because of a failure to set forth in the complaint a theory on which the plaintiff could recover,provided that a late shift in the thrust of the case will not prejudice the other party in maintaining its defense.evans mcdonald,cir.the liberalized pleading rules,however,do not permit plaintiffs to wait until the last minute to ascertain and refine the theories on which they intend to build their case.id.at.this practice,if tolerated,would waste the parties resources,as well as judicial resources,on discovery aimed at ultimately unavailing legal theories and would unfairly surprise defendants,requiring the court to grant further time for discovery or continuances.id.affirming district court determination precluding plaintiff from litigating new legal theory raised for first time in response to defendant motion for summary judgment.
in dunn ewell in re santa fe downs,the complaint cited one section of the bankruptcy act but the plaintiffs attempted to introduce evidence pertaining to a second section,cir.we held that the plaintiffs had not properly stated a claim under that second section.see id.we noted that w e can not say that the incorrect statutory citation was an unimportant detail implicitly corrected by the facts alleged in the complaint.id.a fundamental statutory citation is not a mere fact and,if incorrect,may topple the structure of the complaint,particularly where the citation appears to represent the legal theory upon which the plaintiff relies.id.
in this case,plaintiffs did not mention a in their complaint but referred only to b,c,and plaintiffs allegations focused exclusively on alleged monopolization under b and denial of access to an essential facility under c.plaintiffs failed to mention a,which prohibits unilateral acts in restraint of trade,either in form or in substance.
as in dunn,we can not say that this omission was an unimportant detail.see at.the complaint did not place defendants bottling group and holdings on notice of the need to defend against a a claim,as was demonstrated by defendants failure to offer any defense to a a claim in their initial motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs citation to a in their response to defendants motion did not cure that error.see evans,at.a claim for unilateral acts in restraint of trade is sufficiently distinguishable from either a monopolization or an essential facilities claim that plaintiffs should have mentioned the claim in the complaint.accordingly,the district court did not err in holding that plaintiffs had not pled a a claim in their complaint.
we review a district court denial of a motion to treat the complaint as amended for abuse of discretion.koch koch,cir.federal rule of civil procedure b provides 
when issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties,they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time,even after judgment but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues.if evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings,the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice the party in maintaining the party action or defense upon the merits.the court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.
b.rule b is intended to promote the objective of deciding cases on their merits rather than in terms of the relative pleading skills of counsel.wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed quoted with approval in brandon holt,d.
rule b contains two mechanisms for amending the complaint to conform to the evidence.first,a complaint may be impliedly amended under rule b if an issue has been tried with the express or implied consent of the parties and not over objection.hardin,cir.a party impliedly consents to the trial of an issue not contained within the pleadings either by introducing evidence on the new issue or by failing to object when the opposing party introduces such evidence.koch,at.however,implied consent can not be based on the introduction of evidence that is relevant to an issue already in the case when there is no indication that the party presenting the evidence intended to raise a new issue.moncrief williston basin interstate pipeline,cir.
this mechanism for implying an amendment is not available if the opposing party objects to evidence pertaining to a new claim.dunn,at.instead,upon objection by the opposing party,the party wishing to amend the pleadings must employ the second mechanism of rule b.pursuant to that mechanism,the pleadings may be amended if the party files a motion to amend the complaint and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that it will be prejudiced by the amendment.b.the party must expressly move under rule b for such an amendment.moncrief,at a court may not sua sponte invoke the second portion of rule b.accordingly,when proper objections have been made but no rule b motion has been filed,the lack of prejudice to a party does not provide a basis for an amendment.dunn,at.
in the instant case,plaintiffs referenced a only three times in their motions below or in response to bottling group and holdings motion for summary judgment.each reference involved a mere citation to or quotation of a and was unaccompanied by any evidence that differed from the evidence offered in support of their b and c claims.significantly,bottling group and holdings objected to plaintiffs attempt to raise a a claim on the ground that the claim was not pled in the complaint.in light of this objection,the first mechanism of rule b is inapplicable.see dunn,at.because a court can invoke the second mechanism of rule b only in response to a rule b motion and because plaintiffs filed no such motion,the second mechanism of rule b is likewise inapplicable.see moncrief,at.
accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to treat plaintiffs complaint as amended under rule b to include a a claim.
b.the relevant product market 
the oklahoma antitrust reform act is construed in accordance with federal antitrust law.stat.tit,see also teleco,ford.sections b and c of the oklahoma antitrust reform act both require that the plaintiff prove a relevant market.
under b,i t is unlawful for any person to monopolize,attempt to monopolize,or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce in a relevant market within this state.stat.tit,b.accordingly,to establish liability under b,a plaintiff must first define the relevant market.id.d a see also walker process,food mach.chem,d without a definition of that market there is no way to measure a defendant ability to lessen or destroy competition.smalley emerson cuming,cir to establish sherman act violation for monopolization or attempted monopolization,plaintiff must define relevant market.
under c,it is unlawful for any person in control of an essential facility to unreasonably refuse to give a competitor or customer of an entity controlling an essential facility access to it upon reasonable terms if the effect of such denial is to injure competition.stat.tit,c.pursuant to the statute,an essential facility is a facility which,inter alia,is controlled by an entity that possesses monopoly power.id.d a.monopoly power is the power to control market prices or exclude competition.id.d see also united states du pont de nemours.to prove monopoly power,the plaintiff must first define the relevant market.see walker process,at.
accordingly,both b and c require proof of a relevant market.the relevant market inquiry has two components geographic market and product market.telecor communications,southwestern bell,cir.only the latter is an issue in this appeal.
the supreme court articulated the standard for defining the relevant product market in united states du pont de nemours,at.a relevant product market consists of products that have reasonable interchangeability for the purposes for which they are,use and qualities considered.teleco,at.the interchangeability of products is measured by,and is substantially synonymous with.telecor,at.a market is if rising prices for one product causes consumers to switch to the other product.see also du pont,at.determination of the competitive market for commodities depends on how different from one another are the offered commodities in character or use,how far buyers will go to substitute one commodity for another.
the supreme court has also recognized the existence of submarkets within a larger product market.brown shoe united states,d.the boundaries of such a submarket are defined by such factors as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity,the product peculiar characteristics and uses,unique production facilities,distinct customers,distinct prices,and sensitivity to price changes and specialized vendors.id.the same proof which establishes the existence of a relevant product market also shows or fails to show the existence of a product submarket.aba section of antitrust law,antitrust law developments ed quoting,int l,cir.thus,the general standard articulated in du pont,in conjunction with the specific factors announced in brown shoe,provides the applicable standard for defining the relevant product market.
products of a single manufacturer or brand 
in general,a manufacturer own products do not themselves comprise a relevant product market.aba section of antitrust law,supra.as the supreme court stated in du pont 
w here there are market alternatives that buyers may readily use for their purposes,illegal monopoly does not exist merely because the product said to be monopolized differs from others.if it were not so,only physically identical products would be a part of the market.
at.similarly,we have said that a company does not violate the sherman act by virtue of the natural monopoly it holds over its own product.tv communications network,turner network television,cir holding that tnt is not relevant product market for purposes of sherman act.even where brand loyalty is intense,courts reject the argument that a single branded product constitutes a relevant market.disenos artisticos industriales,work,defining relevant product market as market for high quality decorative giftware,despite intense brand loyalty among some customers for certain brand of porcelain figurine see also grappone,subaru of new england,cir although virtually every seller of a branded product has some customers who especially prefer its product,that fact alone does not show market power emphasis in original.
nonetheless,products of a single manufacturer may in rare circumstances constitute a relevant product market.eastman kodak image technical,d.in eastman kodak image technical services,the supreme court held that the relevant product market must be defined in terms of the choices of products and services available to kodak equipment owners.id.because kodak equipment owners were locked into kodak parts and services,kodak parts and services were not interchangeable with the parts and services of other manufacturers.see id.at.accordingly,only those companies that serviced kodak machines comprised the relevant product market.id 
the supreme court has acknowledged in dicta that the soft drink industry is a prototypical example of an industry in which products are so interchangeable t
