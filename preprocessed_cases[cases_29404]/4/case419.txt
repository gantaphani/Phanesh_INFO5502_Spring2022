united national maintenance is a trade show cleaning company that operates throughout the country.unm has contracts with ges and champion to provide nationwide trade show cleaning services.unm has provided services since in san diego.most of its work in the area is done at the san diego convention center.sdc also offers trade show cleaning services to decorators who use the convention center.in the fall of,an sdc executive approached champion and ges about them hiring sdc personnel to perform trade show cleaning services.both companies declined the sdc proposal.in july,sdc instituted a new cleaning services policy.the policy mandated that sdc would be the exclusive provider of cleaning services staffing.the policy also required that decorators pay sdc one half of all booth cleaning revenue that the decorator received as well as a per hour wage for sdc employees that provided cleaning services.unm continued to perform on its contracts with ges and unm while using sdc personnel to provide the cleaning services.the new requirements significantly increased the costs of performance for unm on its contracts with champion and ges.

under california law,the elements for the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations are a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party defendant knowledge of this contract defendant intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship and resulting damage.pac.gas bear stearns,cal.
after the jury returned its verdict in favor of unm,the district court issued a judgment as matter of law on the basis that the tort of intentional interference only applies to parties that lack any legitimate interest in the underlying contract.the district court heavily relied on dictum from a prior opinion of this court that stated california law has long recognized that the core of intentional interference business torts is interference with an economic relationship by a stranger to that relationship,so that an entity with a direct interest or involvement in that relationship is not usually liable for harm caused by pursuit of its interests.marin tug barge,westport petroleum,cir.
the district court reading of marin tug to add an additional requirement to the tort of intentional interference with contractual relationship is not justified for several reasons.first,under california law,the pertinent economic relationship is the one that exists between the two contracting parties.they are the ones that have a direct interest or involvement in that relationship.id.at.liability for this tort exists to protect the parties to that relationship from interference by a stranger to the agreement.della penna toyota motor sales,u,cal.contractual liability,in turn,protects the contracting parties from the actions of their contractual partners.see applied equip.litton saudi arabia,cal rejecting an attempt to create tort liability under a theory of conspiracy for parties to the contractual relationship.to shield parties with an economic interest in the contract from potential liability would create an undesirable lacuna in the law between the respective domains of tort and contract.a party with an economic interest in a contractual relationship could interfere without risk of facing either tort or contract liability.this result is particularly perverse as it is those parties with some type of economic interest in a contract whom would have the greatest incentive to interfere with it.such a result would hardly serve the established goal of protecting a formally cemented economic relationship from interference by a stranger to the agreement.della penna,at.
second,marin tug represented a hesitant attempt to clarify the unresolved question of the precise type of wrongfulness necessary to trigger liability for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.marin tug,at noting that it proceeded with some trepidation into this area of california law.subsequent to marin tug,california courts have repeatedly held that in california,the law is settled that a stranger to a contract may be liable in tort for intentionally interfering with the performance of the contract.see,reeves hanlon,cal quoting pacific gas,at.in a detailed discussion,the california court of appeal held that marin tug was not extending immunity from contract interference claims to an even broader,more attenuated class of persons.woods fox broad,d.other california court of appeal decisions have reached the same conclusion.see powerhouse motorsports,yamaha motor,d.this court must follow the decision of the intermediate appellate courts of the state unless there is convincing evidence that the highest court of the state would decide differently.owen ex rel.owen united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.sdc points to no convincing evidence that the california supreme court would change its long held position on the potential tort liability of strangers to a contract.see,reeves,at.
third,california courts have repeatedly held that parties with an economic interest in a contractual relationship may be liable for intentional interference with that contract.see applied equipment,at woods,d at company potentially liable for interference in a contract between a subsidiary and several of its employees powerhouse motorsports,d at manufacturer may be liable for interference with a sales contract between a franchise operator and a potential new owner.sdc argues that there are several cases where a party with an economic interest in a contract was prevented from bringing an intentional interference claim.those cases are distinguishable.in mintz blue cross of california,the california court of appeal found that a claim could not arise as the defendant was either a contracting party or its agent.d.there is no suggestion here that sdc was the agent of either champion or ges.in pm group,stewart,the california court of appeal reiterated that a contracting party could not be tortiously liable for interfering with the performance of its own contract thus,by extension,a contracting party could not be held liable for interfering with the performance of subcontracts if that claim hinged on the defendant failure to perform on the original contract.d.unm theory of liability in this case is not based on sdc failure to perform on a contract with champion or ges.
we therefore reverse the district court holding that under california law,sdc can not be held liable for the tort of intentional interference with contractual relationship.the jmol granted on that ground is also reversed.
during trial,the district court rejected sdc request for a legal interpretation of potential conditions precedent in unm contracts with the decorators.the district court held that the model jury instructions on an intentional interference with contractual relationship claim were sufficient the two elements at issue were.that there was a contract between plaintiff and defendant and.that defendant conduct prevented performance or made performance more expensive or difficult.california civil jury instructions.
the fourth element examines whether plaintiff has suffered a disruption or breach of their contractual rights.woods,d at.after the jury returned its verdict,the district court held that a new trial was warranted because he should have legally interpreted unm contracts with ges and champion in order to allow the jury to determine whether they contained relevant conditions precedent to the ability of ges and champion to hire unm for trade show cleaning services.if unm contractual rights were conditioned on the usage policies of sdc,then sdc change in policy determined unm contractual rights instead of disrupting unm performance of the contract.the jury request for clarification on this point indicates the importance of this issue.
unm argues that a contract with a condition precedent may still be a valid,enforceable contract.unm argument focuses on element one of the claim the validity of the contracts between unm and the decorators.california law on this topic is somewhat murky.compare reeves,at no intentional interference claim for employment contracts with scecorp superior court,d,potential claim for contract that was conditioned on regulatory approval.sdc proposed jury instructions,however,focus on the separate element of disruption.for the jury to understand whether unm performance was disrupted required the district court to determine what contractual rights unm possessed.this thus required a legal interpretation of the contract and the trial court correctly concluded that it erred in this case by not doing so.
in cases of instructional error,there is a presumption of prejudice.medtronic,white,cir.unm has provided no argument for why the jury would have reached the same verdict had it been properly instructed.id quoting galdamez potter,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it has failed to rebut the presumption of prejudice.
we therefore affirm the district court holding that it committed instructional error by not interpreting the terms of the contract and that this error constituted prejudicial error that warrants a new trial.
states receive immunity from potential antitrust liability as nothing in the language of the sherman act or its history suggested that congress intended to restrict the sovereign capacity of the states to regulate their economies ftc.phoebe putney health,quoting parker brown.nonstate actors may also receive immunity from the federal antitrust laws if they are carrying out the state regulatory program.id.at.
the supreme court has articulated a test to determine whether nonstate actors are entitled to this immunity first,the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy second,the policy must be actively supervised by the state itself.cal.retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,internal quotation marks omitted.the requirement of active supervision,however,does not apply to the activities of local governmental entities,as they have less of an incentive to pursue their own under the guise of implementing state policies.phoebe putney.at.
in order to pass the test,the anticompetitive effect in dispute should be the foreseeable result of what the state authorized.id internal quotation marks omitted.it is not necessary,however,for a state legislature to expressly state in a statute or its legislative history that the legislature intends for the delegated action to have anticompetitive effects.town of hallie city of eau claire.we review each challenged anticompetitive act to determine whether it was the foreseeable result of what the state authorized.phoebe putney.at city of columbia omni outdoor.in applying the test,the supreme court has distinguished between general grants of either local authority or corporate power and specific delegations of an authority to act or regulate where the displacement of competition is the foreseeable result of what the statute authorizes.omni,at internal quotation marks omitted.only the latter qualifies for immunity.for example,the court has found that georgia grant of general corporate powers to a hospital authority did not also entail an authorization to use those powers in an anticompetitive fashion.phoebe putney.at.by contrast,the test was satisfied when wisconsin expressly allowed cities to limit the municipal provision of sewage services to neighboring unincorporated areas and consequently gave those cities the authority to make the provision of sewage services contingent on annexation of the unincorporated areas.hallie,at.similarly the test was fulfilled by south carolina delegation of zoning authority over local billboards to a city as t he very purpose of zoning regulation is to displace unfettered business freedom in a manner that regularly has the effect of preventing normal acts of competition omni,at.the clear articulation test thus requires both a specific delegation of authority by the state and some indication that the state has affirmatively
