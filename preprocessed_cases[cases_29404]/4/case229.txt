ray dayton dove,pleaded guilty to an information charging that he violated the lacey act,a a,d west,in november and december,by selling or offering to sell black bear gall bladders galls in virginia in violation of ann.michie supp,and placing them in interstate commerce.he also pleaded guilty to an indictment charging that he conspired to sell or offer galls and black bear paws for sale knowing that these items were transported in interstate commerce in violation of the lacey act,a a d b,and ann.michie supp.dove argues on appeal that the district court erred at sentencing in including as relevant conduct his sale of galls to an undercover agent the galls sale because that sale occurred in west virginia,where the sale of galls is legal.dove also challenges the district court estimation of the value of the galls.we vacate dove sentence and remand for resentencing because we conclude that neither dove sale of the galls nor his offer to sell the galls was illegal under virginia law and thus was not properly included as relevant conduct under the guidelines.
dove operated a store in west virginia where he was licensed to deal in furs,hides,deer antlers,and bears.between and,he sold bear galls to bonnie and danny baldwin,both virginia residents.dove delivered the galls to the baldwins in virginia.the baldwins resold the galls to asian customers from northern virginia,washington,and baltimore.in october,agent stump of the virginia department of game and inland fisheries arranged to buy bear galls from dove,representing that he,too,intended to sell the galls to asian customers.dove drove to abingdon,virginia,and delivered eleven galls to stump.in november and december,dove shipped a total of fourteen galls to stump in virginia.in january,a final sale of galls was arranged through a series of telephone calls between stump in virginia and dove in west virginia.dove agreed to weigh,inspect,and put bear tags on each gall,and they agreed on a price and a date and time when stump would come to get them.on january,stump,accompanied by several agents,drove to dove store in west virginia and purchased the galls.
after his guilty pleas,dove objected unsuccessfully to the inclusion of the galls sale as relevant conduct and disputed the probation officers estimation of the value of the galls.the district court included the galls sale as relevant conduct,and,after awarding a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility as well as applying a enhancement for the market value of the galls sold,the district court found a total offense level of under the united states sentencing guidelines,which,in conjunction with dove lack of prior criminal history,yielded a guideline imprisonment range of to months and a supervised release range of two to three years.without the inclusion of the galls sale as relevant conduct,dove would have received a,rather than a,enhancement for the value of the galls using the district court valuation method,and his offense level would have been,yielding an imprisonment range of to months.the district court sentenced dove to months of imprisonment and months of supervised release,with five months of his supervised release term to be served as home detention dove contends on appeal that the galls sale was not criminal conduct because it occurred in west virginia where the sale of bear galls is lawful.the government argues that the galls sale in its entirety violated virginia law,and that the galls were correctly included as relevant conduct.the critical issues on appeal are whether dove violated virginia law and,separately,the lacey act in connection with the galls sale and the propriety of the district court method of valuing the galls sold.
we review the district court factual findings at sentencing,including the determination of relevant conduct,for clear error.see united states fletcher,cir.review of pure questions of law relative to a guideline determination when the relevant facts are undisputed is de novo.united states ruhe,cir.
the district court denied dove objection to the inclusion of the galls sale as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes.its reasoning was explained in its previous order denying dove motion to dismiss count three of the original indictment which charged that dove violated virginia law and the lacey act in connection with the galls sale.see united states dove,d.
as a threshold matter,the government argues that conduct may properly be considered as relevant conduct.however,if conduct which is not illegal may be relevant conduct because it is not benign,this approach would involve sentencing courts in the impossibly subjective task of determining the relative benignness of various legally permissible acts,and would allow individuals to be punished by having their guideline range increased for activity which is not prohibited by law but merely morally distasteful or viewed as simply wrong by the sentencing court.united states peterson,cir see also united states wilson,cir noting that the task of a district court in determining the amount of loss is to determine the amount that is attributable to the defendant criminal conduct united states dickler,cir agreeing that relevant conduct under must be criminal conduct.we thus conclude that relevant conduct under the guidelines must be criminal conduct.
in its order denying dove motion to dismiss count three of the original indictment,the district court held that count three properly charged a sale of wildlife in violation of ann.and transportation of the illegally sold wildlife in interstate commerce.dove,d at.although it was actually stump who transported the galls into virginia,the district court found that dove placed the galls in interstate commerce by selling them to stump because dove believed that stump would take them to virginia and resell them.id.at.
the lacey act is a federal statute that imposes federal penalties for certain violations of state law,and provides in part that it is unlawful for any person to import,export,transport,sell,receive,acquire,or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any fish or wildlife taken,possessed,transported,or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any state.a a west.thus,dove conduct did not violate the lacey act unless the wildlife he sold had been taken,possessed,transported or sold in violation of virginia law.id.the only virginia provision which the government argues as a basis for finding dove conduct illegal is,and that provision,we conclude,prohibits the sale of the bear galls at issue in this case,but not their transportation or possession 
in its ruling,the district court relied upon our decision in united states,cir,in which we held that a defendant who sold illegally taken rockfish to federal agents knew that the rockfish would be transported in interstate commerce and took the steps that began their travel to interstate markets,and thus violated the lacey act.id.at,however,is distinguishable.in that case,it was uncontroverted that the rockfish sold in interstate commerce had first been taken in violation of state law.id.at.here,no argument is made that the galls were taken,possessed,or transported in violation of the law of any state thus,unless virginia law prohibited the sale in west virginia of the galls,dove act of placing them into interstate commerce did not violate the lacey act.the standard which must be met to satisfy the interstate commerce aspect of the lacey act is not a demanding one,as illustrates.but virginia principles of criminal jurisdiction,as the following discussion illustrates,are not coextensive with the federal definition of interstate commerce,and the lacey act is not violated unless the animal parts which move in interstate commerce have been taken,possessed,transported or sold in violation of state law 
while the district court interpreted the telephone conversations between dove and stump and the subsequent activity of the two men as constituting a sale in virginia,we are not persuaded that a sale took place either in virginia or in violation of the law of virginia.a sale is defined under virginia law as the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.
