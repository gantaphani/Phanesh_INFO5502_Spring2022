opinion of the court 
plaintiffs bellevue drug,robert schreiber,and rehn heurbinger drug collectively plaintiffs appeal the district court order granting defendant advancepcs motion to compel arbitration.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in ordering them to arbitrate their antitrust claims because advancepcs waived its right to arbitrate by actively litigating the case in federal court for more than ten months prior to demanding arbitration and the arbitration clause is unenforceable because it limits the remedies that plaintiffs can receive under the sherman act,and contains a provision that deters plaintiffs from proceeding in arbitration.because we agree with plaintiffs that advancepcs waived its right to arbitrate,we will reverse the order of the district court compelling arbitration,and need not reach those issues addressed to the clause itself.
background 
the factual and procedural background underlying this case was extensively summarized in this court precedential decision disposing of an earlier appeal,in re pharmacy benefit managers antitrust litigation,cir.we will not reprise the entire background here,but will set forth those facts necessary to our analysis of the waiver issue,and most particularly those facts preceding advancepcs motion to compel arbitration.
advancepcs is a prescription benefits manager pbm for drug benefit plans sponsored by employers,unions,government agencies,insurance plans and others plan sponsors.pbms are retained by plan sponsors to efficiently manage their benefit plans and to achieve cost savings for plan sponsors and plan members.pbms achieve efficiencies and cost savings in a variety of ways,including negotiating discounts or rebates from drug manufacturers,providing mail order prescription service to plan members,contracting with retail pharmacies for reimbursement when prescriptions are filled for plan members,and electronic processing and paying of claims.
plaintiffs are retail pharmacy businesses that entered into written pharmacy provider agreements the agreements or ppa with advancepcs to provide prescription drugs and related pharmacy services to persons covered by drug benefit plans administered by advancepcs.the ppa establishes the terms and conditions under which the plaintiffs were to provide prescription drugs and services to plan members,and sets forth an agreed reimbursement rate that advancepcs will pay to the pharmacies.the ppa also contains an arbitration clause which provides 
arbitration.any and all controversies in connection with or arising out of this agreement will be exclusively settled by arbitration before a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association.the arbitrator must follow the rule of law,and may only award remedies provided in this agreement.the award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties,and judgment upon such award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.arbitration under this provision will be conducted in scottsdale,arizona,and provider hereby agrees to such jurisdiction,unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing or mandated by law,and the expenses of the arbitration,including attorneys fees,will be paid by the party against whom the award of the arbitrator is rendered.this section and the parties rights hereunder shall be governed by the federal arbitration act,et.
app.the ppa also includes a severability clause,which provides 
lawful interpretation.whenever possible,each provision of this agreement will be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable law,but if any provision of this agreement should be rendered unenforceable or invalid under applicable law,that provision will be ineffective to the extent of such unenforceability or invalidity without invalidating the remaining provisions of this agreement.
on august,plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all other pharmacies that contracted with advancepcs to sell drugs for a prescription drug benefit plan.the complaint asserted an antitrust claim against advancepcs,alleging that it had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy with its plan sponsors to restrain competition in violation of the sherman act.in particular,plaintiffs alleged that advancepcs used the combined economic power of its plan sponsors to reduce the contractual amount it pays to retail pharmacies below the levels that would prevail in a competitive marketplace.plaintiffs also alleged that the agreements impose certain limitations on drug refills and charges to plan members.the complaint sought treble damages,injunctive relief,attorneys fees,and costs.the case was initially assigned to judge eduardo robreno.
as noted at the outset,for more than ten months following the filing of the complaint,advancepcs actively and,indeed,aggressively litigated the case without mentioning arbitration,much less filing a motion to compel arbitration.on september,more than a month after the complaint was filed,advancepcs filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under.b,arguing that plaintiffs suffered no antitrust injury,failed to allege a per se agreement,and failed to allege any rule of reason agreement.with the motion,advancepcs submitted a binder of allegedly exhibits as thick as the yellow pages,we are told,including three lengthy studies of the efficiency enhancing effects of pbms,as well as advancepcs own annual report to the sec form k,and other materials.plaintiffs submitted a page response brief,and advancepcs filed a reply brief,expanding upon its earlier presentation as it argued that no antitrust injury had been alleged that no per se agreement had been alleged because the complaint lacked allegations of horizontal conspiracy,monopsony power,and output pricing that plaintiffs incorrectly interpreted materials of the department of justice and federal trade commission ftc that agreements by sellers should be treated differently that plaintiffs authorities on monopsony power were inadequate that buyer cartel cases were inapposite and that the complaint failed to state a rule of reason antitrust violation.
on february,judge robreno held a hearing on the motion to dismiss,and on march,denied the motion in a detailed opinion,rejecting each of advancepcs substantive antitrust arguments plaintiffs,the court concluded,had standing and had alleged facts sufficient to state an antitrust claim.two weeks later,on march,advancepcs filed a motion to reconsider the denial of its motion to dismiss,or to certify it for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.the motion to reconsider again urged dismissal based on the results of a recent ftc investigation into the acquisition of advancepcs by caremark.plaintiffs filed a response brief,and advancepcs replied.
at the same time in march as it filed its motion for reconsideration,advancepcs filed an answer to the complaint,and asserted a host of affirmative defenses,including failure to state a claim,lack of standing,lack of antitrust injury,laches,estoppel,waiver,failure to mitigate,failure to plead with particularity,and failure to join necessary and indispensable parties.on april,new counsel for advancepcs entered their appearances.a hearing was subsequently held on the motion for reconsideration,and on may,the motion was denied.also on may,judge robreno ordered the parties to submit a discovery plan and a proposed case management order,and scheduled a pretrial conference for june.on consent,the conference was rescheduled to july.
five weeks after judge robreno latest order,and after more than ten months of active and wholly unsuccessful litigation,on june,advancepcs filed a motion to compel arbitration asking the district court,for the first time,to enforce the arbitration clause in the ppa and enter an order compelling arbitration of the case.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that advancepcs waived any right to arbitrate by actively litigating the case in federal court for as long as it did,and that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable for various reasons.
on august,judge robreno granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed the district court action.he concluded that plaintiffs had entered into enforceable arbitration agreements that encompassed the antitrust claims,and that advancepcs had not waived its right to seek arbitration.plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration or,in the alternative,for certification of an interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.judge robreno denied reconsideration and certification,and ordered that the case remain stayed in accordance with the federal arbitration act faa.
plaintiffs,however,did not thereafter initiate arbitration proceedings.rather,on may,plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay and dismiss the complaint.in the motion,plaintiffs represented that they did not intend to arbitrate their claims,and instead wished to dismiss the complaint so that they could pursue an appeal of the decision to compel arbitration.while this motion was pending,the case was transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to judge john fullam for consolidated pretrial proceedings with five other similar antitrust actions against pbms.
on december,judge fullam convened a status conference in the mdl proceedings and heard argument on the motion to lift the stay and dismiss the complaint.following the conference,judge fullam sua sponte issued an order vacating judge robreno order compelling arbitration,concluding that the parties never intended this type of litigation to be submitted to arbitration,and that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it violates public policy.app.judge fullam thus denied as moot the plaintiffs motion to dismiss their complaint to seek appellate review.
advancepcs filed an immediate appeal to this court pursuant to a a b.concluding that judge fullam order violated the law of the case doctrine,we vacated that order,and remanded with directions to reinstate judge robreno order compelling arbitration.
on november,following remand,plaintiffs renewed their motion to dismiss their complaint to permit an immediate appeal of judge robreno reinstated order compelling arbitration.while this motion was pending,the case was reassigned to judge darnell jones.the parties were ordered to submit supplemental briefs,and oral argument was held.on january,judge jones granted plaintiffs motion and dismissed their claims with prejudice.plaintiffs appealed.
ii.jurisdiction 
advancepcs questions our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.under the faa,a party may generally not appeal from an interlocutory order compelling arbitration or granting a stay pending arbitration.b b.thus,judge robreno order compelling arbitration was,at least initially.in an effort to circumvent the nonappealabilty of judge robreno order,plaintiffs sought several times,and eventually obtained,an order lifting the stay and dismissing their complaint with prejudice.
the faa provides that an appeal may be taken from a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.id.a.where a district court compels arbitration and dismisses the federal lawsuit rather than staying it,the supreme court has held that is a final decision with respect to an arbitration,and an appeal may then be taken challenging the order compelling arbitration.green tree fin.alabama randolph,d.this is true whether the dismissal of the case is with or without prejudice.blair scott specialty gases,cir.the supreme court reasoned that the phrase final decision with respect to an arbitration has the same meaning as final decision in other contexts,and refers to a decision that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.randolph,at quoting digital equip.desktop direct,d and coopers lybrand livesay,d.the judgment to be executed upon is not the underlying complaint,but a new and separate proceeding in the district court to enter judgment on the arbitration award or vacate or modify that award.
advancepcs attempts to distinguish randolph and blair,arguing that those cases involved involuntary dismissals of the plaintiffs claims simultaneous with the order compelling arbitration,whereas plaintiffs sought a voluntary dismissal of their complaint after the fact.advancepcs contends that plaintiffs are thus seeking an end run around the nonappealability of judge robreno order.if judge robreno had dismissed plaintiffs claims at the same time he compelled arbitration,there would be no doubt as to our jurisdiction under randolph and blair.
in essence,though,judge jones dismissal order modified judge robreno order by substituting a dismissal for the stay,thus putting plaintiffs in a position to the plaintiffs in randolph and blair.just as in those cases,the ultimate dismissal was an order that ended the litigation on the merits and left nothing more for the district court to do but execute the judgment.it is thus a final decision with respect to an arbitration within the meaning of a.the fact that plaintiffs obtained the dismissal in a different manner is irrelevant because,as we have noted,t he randolph decision draws a distinction between dismissals and stays,but does not draw any distinctions within the universe of dismissals.blair,at.accordingly,we have subject matter jurisdiction.
iii.discussion 
congress enacted the faa in to counteract the traditional judicial hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agreements.alexander anthony,cir.under the faa,such agreements are enforceable to the same extent as other contracts.parilla iap worldwide,vi,cir internal quotation marks omitted.there is a strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,and a party to a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement is entitled to a stay of federal court proceedings pending arbitration as well as an order compelling such arbitration.alexander,at see also howsam dean witter reynolds,d noting that the court has also long recognized and enforced a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.when a federal court addresses a motion to compel arbitration,it is limited to a narrow scope of inquiry.gay creditinform,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the court may consider only narrow gateway matters that touch on the question of arbitrability,such as whether an arbitration agreement applies to a particular controversy,or whether the parties are bound by the arbitration clause.certain underwriters at lloyd london westchester fire ins,cir.thus,only when there is a question regarding whether the parties should be arbitrating at all is a question of arbitrability raised for the court to resolve.in other circumstances,resolution by the arbitrator remains the presumptive rule.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs concede that the ppa contains a arbitration clause that applies to a ny and all controversies in connection with or arising out of th e agreement.moreover,plaintiffs do not seriously dispute that their antitrust claim against advancepcs is a controversy arising out of the ppa and thus falls within the scope of the arbitration clause rather,plaintiffs argue that judge robreno incorrectly decided several questions of arbitrability and erred in granting the motion to compel arbitration because advancepcs waived its right to arbitrate and the arbitration clause is unenforceable.as noted above,we agree on the waiver issue and thus do not reach the issue of enforceability.
plaintiffs primary argument on appeal is that judge robreno erred in compelling arbitration because advancepcs waived its right to arbitrate by actively litigating the case in federal court for more than ten months while remaining silent about arbitration.judge robreno concluded that the issue of waiver was for the arbitrator not the court to decide and that,in any case,plaintiffs had failed to show prejudice resulting from advancepcs delay in asserting the arbitration clause.we exercise plenary review over the question of whether a party through its litigation conduct,waived its right to compel arbitration.gray holdco,cassady,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to the extent that a district court makes factual findings in making this determination,we review its findings for clear error.id.
at the time judge robreno issued his order compelling arbitration,the law was unclear as to whether waiver was an issue that should be decided by the district court or the arbitrator.several years after that order,however,we made clear that waiver of the right to arbitrate based on litigation conduct remains presumptively an issue for the court to decide.ehleiter grapetree shores,cir.the only question,then,is whether judge robreno erred in finding that plaintiffs had failed to establish waiver.
legal standard for assessing waiver 
consistent with the strong preference for arbitration in federal courts,waiver is not to be lightly inferred,and will normally be found only where the demand for arbitration came long after the suit commenced and when both parties had engaged in extensive discovery.nino jewelry,cir quoting painewebber faragalli,cir.a court may,however,refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement where a party has acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate,and we will not hesitate to hold that the right to arbitrate has been waived where a sufficient showing of prejudice has been made by the party seeking to avoid arbitration.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
p rejudice is the touchstone for determining whether the right to arbitrate has been waived by litigation conduct.zimmer cooperneff advisors,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to aid the analysis of waiver questions,we have identified six nonexclusive factors to guide the prejudice inquiry 
timeliness or lack thereof of the motion to arbitrate extent to which the party seeking arbitration has contested the merits of the opposing party claims whether the party seeking arbitration informed its adversary of its intent to pursue arbitration prior to seeking to enjoin the court proceedings the extent to which a party seeking arbitration engaged in motion practice the party acquiescence to the court pretrial orders and the extent to which the parties have engaged in discovery.
gray holdco,at citing hoxworth blinder,robinson,cir.these are known as the hoxworth factors,and they are generally indicative of whether a party opposing arbitration would suffer prejudice attributable to the other party delay in seeking arbitration.id.the factors,however,are nonexclusive and not all the factors need be present to justify a finding of waiver.nino,at.rather,the waiver determination must be based on the circumstances and context of the particular case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
application of the hoxworth factors 
this first hoxworth factor to consider is the timeliness of the motion to arbitrate.in this case,advancepcs filed its motion to compel arbitration on june,over ten months after plaintiffs filed their complaint in federal court.a ten month delay is significantly longer than the cases in which we have found no waiver,see palcko airborne express,cir days painewebber,at two months wood prudential ins.of,cir months gavlik constr.campbell,cir arbitration motion made immediately after removing case to federal court,and sits at the low end of the cases in which we have found waiver,see gray holdco,at ten months hoxworth,at months nino,at months ehleiter,at years.furthermore,advancepcs has not offered any satisfactory explanation for its delay in asserting arbitration other than the fact that the motion was made more than two months,we note after it retained new counsel.gray holdco,at finding significant that the party offered no explanation for its ten month delay.therefore,this factor weighs in favor of finding waiver.
the second hoxworth factor is the extent to which the party seeking arbitration has contested the merits of the opposing party claims.in this case,prior to seeking arbitration,advancepcs filed pages of briefing on its motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim a motion which directly addressed the merits of plaintiffs antitrust claims and supported that briefing with a binder of materials and studies.after a hearing was held and the motion to dismiss was denied,advancepcs next filed a motion for reconsideration,essentially dismissal based on the results of a recent ftc investigation.after holding a second hearing,the district court denied the motion.
in sum,advancepcs directly contested the merits of plaintiffs case through what was,in essence,two motions to dismiss,with ample briefing and supporting documentation,and raised issues outside of the scope of the pleadings.this is significantly more activity on the merits than in cases in which we found no waiver,see palcko,at motion to dismiss but only for insufficient service of process painewebber,at no briefing on the merits wood,at a motion to dismiss gavlik,at no contest on the merits,and appears to be at least comparable to or stronger than the cases in which we have found waiver,see nino,at no motions on the merits ehleiter,at motion for summary judgment hoxworth,at motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,and opposition to motion for class certification gray holdco,at motion for preliminary injunction with evidentiary hearing,and opposition to motions to dismiss.this factor thus weighs in favor of finding waiver.
the third factor is whether the party seeking arbitration informed its adversary of its intent to pursue arbitration prior to filing the motion to compel.here,advancepcs gave no prior indication to plaintiffs of its intent to arbitrate,and arbitration was not raised as a defense in its answer to the complaint or elsewhere.the facts of this case are thus stronger than the cases in which we have found no waiver,see palcko,at requested arbitration from opposing party before filing motion to compel painewebber,at objected that claims were subject to arbitration days after the filing of the plaintiff state court complaint wood,at raised arbitration in joint discovery plan before bringing motion to compel,and are comparable to or stronger than the cases in which we have found waiver,see nino,at included mandatory arbitration as one of ten affirmative defenses in its answer ehleiter,at no advanced notice gray holdco,at no advanced notice.this factor,too,weighs in favor of finding waiver.
the fourth hoxworth factor is the extent to which the party seeking arbitration engaged in motion practice.advancepcs motions dealt mostly with administrative and scheduling matters,such as motions for admission pro hac vice,for leave to file a reply brief,and to continue the pretrial conference.these motions were not contested.in addition,however,advancepcs also filed together with its motion for reconsideration a motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal pursuant to b seeking immediate appellate relief that likely would not have been available to it in the arbitral forum.these facts are stronger than the facts in those cases in which we have found no waiver,see palcko,at no motions mentioned wood,at same gavlik,at same but see painewebber,at motion to dismiss non pros,for lack of prosecution,and sit near the low end of what we have found to support waiver in the past,see ehleiter,at motion to implead third party.admittedly,however,the cases in which we have found waiver have tended to have somewhat more significant motion practice.see nino,at opposed three motions to compel discovery hoxworth,at filed motions to disqualify counsel and stay discovery,and opposed motions to compel discovery.in any event,this factor is not an absolute requirement,and we have found waiver even where no significant motion practice occurred.see gray holdco,at.ultimately,however,this factor weighs slightly in favor of waiver or is at worst neutral.
the fifth factor is the party acquiescence in a court pretrial orders.judge robreno entered orders setting hearings on advancepcs motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration.advancepcs attended and participated in these hearings.it also entered orders setting dates for the pretrial conference,and instructing the parties to submit a discovery plan and proposed case management order.prior to filing its motion to compel arbitration,advancepcs did not object to any of these orders.cases in which we have found no waiver generally were not litigated long enough to feature any acquiescence in pretrial orders,see painewebber,at
