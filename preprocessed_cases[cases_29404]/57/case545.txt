in this appeal,we must review the district court decision to vacate an arbitration award and remand on the ground that the award was in manifest disregard of the law.in an unusual circumstance,this is the second time in this case that the district court has vacated an arbitration award in favor of the appellee and remanded on that ground.
the award of the arbitration panel was not in manifest disregard of the law.instead,the district court engaged in an analysis of the merits of the arbitration panel award and found legal error.such an analysis is proscribed by the standards of review that apply in this circuit to a district court review of arbitration awards.therefore,we must vacate the district court ruling and direct the district court to enter a judgment confirming the arbitration award.
factual background 
plaintiff james mccarthy mccarthy was a financial consultant at smith barney,predecessor of defendant citigroup global markets cgmi,from until his resignation in may.as of,he worked in the manchester,new hampshire office of cgmi.cgmi is an investment bank and brokerage firm with its principal place of business in new york city.it is a subsidiary of citigroup,one of the world largest financial services companies.
while an employee,mccarthy participated in the capital accumulation plan cap plan,which was sponsored by cgmi parent company,traveler group.the cap plan is a program designed to retain employees by giving them the opportunity to purchase restricted shares of citigroup,either in the form of citigroup restricted stock at discounted prices on a basis,or as grants of stock options for citigroup common stock.an eligible employee must sign,at least annually,a form electing to participate in the cap plan,wherein the employee designates the amount of earnings he wants deducted from his paychecks and used in the cap plan.
under the cap plan restricted stock program,the restricted stock is acquired at a percent discount from market value and is purchased with wage deductions from payroll checks.however,the stock purchases are subject to a vesting period of two years.when the restricted shares vest,the participant pays ordinary income taxes and payroll taxes based on the market value of the shares on the vesting date,unless the participant has elected to pay taxes at the time of the payroll deduction.mccarthy had paid income and payroll taxes on many of the shares at issue here.if a participant in the cap plan resigns,as mccarthy did,the participant forfeits both the unvested restricted shares and the wages deducted from the paychecks.the unvested restricted shares are cancelled,the underlying restricted citigroup stock reverts to citigroup,and cgmi does not return the wages to the participant.under the cap plan stock option program,a participant can choose to receive up to of the restricted shares in the form of stock options on citigroup common stock.if employment terminates voluntarily,unvested options may not be exercised.as with the restricted stock program,when an option is exercised,income and payroll taxes are withheld.
mccarthy resigned on may.from until his resignation,mccarthy voluntarily elected in writing to direct the equivalent of of his compensation to be invested through the cap plan.he participated mostly in the restricted stock plan,but at times also purchased stock options under the cap plan.mccarthy sought to recover his contributions to the cap plan that had resulted in the purchase of unvested shares,as well as funds that had not been used to purchase shares.pursuant to the terms of the cap plan,these contributions had been forfeited.
procedural background 
pursuant to the parties arbitration agreement and the regulatory framework of the securities industry,mccarthy commenced arbitration proceedings against cgmi with the national association of securities dealers nasd on december,mccarthy asserted statutory claims under the new hampshire wage laws the wage law and equitable claims.
a hearing was held on november,the first hearing.the arbitrators in the first hearing the first panel ruled in favor of cgmi and dismissed mccarthy claims the first award 
mccarthy request for relief is denied.the evidence and documents presented in evidence at the hearing demonstrated that mccarthy knowingly and willingly participated in the cap plan by signing the election forms twice a year for several years.mccarthy benefitted financially from participation in the cap plan to a substantial degree over the years.while mccarthy invoked new hampshire wage law to support his case,the panel considered it irrelevant because the panel considered the case to be a contract dispute regarding an inventive compensation plan commonly used at the firm and commonly used in the securities industry.
on december,mccarthy asked the district court to vacate the first award.cgmi to confirm it.focusing on the language above,the district court remanded the matter to the nasd for further arbitration proceedings first remand order 
the arbitration panel does not appear to have intended irrelevant to have its usual meaning.instead,the panel concluded that mccarthy was not protected by the wage laws because he had profited from the cap in the past and had voluntarily agreed to its terms.as such,the panel acknowledged the applicability of the wage laws but decided not to apply them because of the circumstances attending mccarthy claim.the panel also decided not to consider the wage laws because plans like the cap are commonly used in the securities industry.in doing so,the panel set aside the governing law in favor of its perception of an equitable result and industry practices.the panel decision not to consider the new hampshire wage laws demonstrates its disregard for the governing law.
the district court concluded that the case must be remanded to have mccarthy claim decided under the new hampshire wage laws through arbitration.although cgmi filed an appeal from the first remand order the first appeal,it never pursued that first appeal.instead,cgmi voluntarily withdrew it.on march,we entered a judgment dismissing the first appeal and sending the case back to the district court.
mccarthy his claim with the nasd,which convened a second arbitration panel comprised of three new arbitrators the second panel.mccarthy withdrew all of his equitable claims,moving forward with only his claims based on new hampshire law.the parties submitted briefs to the second panel,along with copies of the wage law,case law,the district court first remand order,the cap plan documents,and exhibits reflecting mccarthy participation in the cap plan.the second panel heard argument and testimony from several witnesses on august,the second hearing.cgmi argued that the cap plan did not violate the wage law and,in the alternative,that mccarthy was not entitled to any damages regardless of the status of the cap plan under the wage law mccarthy asserted that the first remand order required the second panel to apply the wage law to his claims,and under the wage law the cap plan was illegal.on august,the second panel issued its award denying mccarthy claims with prejudice the modified award 
mccarthy requested that the panel declare that the cap plan is illegal under new hampshire law,to the extent the cap plan is implemented i through wage deductions,which are not actually used to purchase stock in citigroup,or ii so as to cause employees to forfeit wages.
the panel heard testimony from mccarthy and witnesses of both parties and considered the documentary evidence from each side as well.the arbitrators fully considered all claims and defenses,including the applicability of the new hampshire wage laws,which were heavily argued on both sides after full consideration of the matter,the panel decided to deny all claims with prejudice.
on september,mccarthy filed with the district court a motion to vacate the modified award,asserting again that the arbitrators had manifestly disregarded controlling law.mccarthy also claimed that the award should be vacated because cgmi improperly encouraged the arbitrators to ignore the district court legal findings as they were set forth in the first remand order,and because the arbitrators refused to be polled as to whether they would follow the law.cgmi again filed a for confirmation of the award.
in a second remand order dated december,the district court vacated the modified award because it was in manifest disregard of the law,denied cgmi for confirmation of the award,and remanded the case for a third arbitration proceeding,if necessary the court urged the parties to settle 
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to vacate or confirm an arbitration award de novo.see bull hn info,hutson,cir.the touchstone for review of arbitration awards is section authorizes vacatur of an award in cases of specified misconduct or misbehavior on the arbitrators part,actions in excess of arbitral powers,or failures to consummate the award.advest,mccarthy,cir see also cas.first state ins.group,cir.courts do,however,retain a very limited power to review arbitration awards outside of section.advest,at.as we have put it 
in the main,a successful challenge to an arbitration award,apart from section,depends upon the challenger ability to show that the award is unfounded in reason and fact based on reasoning so palpably faulty that no judge,or group of judges,ever could conceivably have made such a ruling or mistakenly based on a crucial assumption that is concededly a.
id.at quoting local,united food commercial workers stop shop,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in some of our cases,we have referred to this standard of review as manifest disregard of the law.wonderland greyhound park,autotote,cir we have elaborated that we mean by manifest disregard of the law a situation where it is clear from the record that the arbitrator recognized the applicable then ignored it.advest,at.to succeed under this standard there must be some showing in the record,other than the result obtained,that the arbitrators knew the law and expressly disregarded it.advest,at quoting securities,prof l planning,cir.d isregard implies that the arbitrators appreciated the existence of a governing legal rule but wilfully decided not to apply it.id.emphasis added 
b.the district court reasoning 
on appeal,cgmi maintains that the second panel modified award was improperly vacated under the manifest disregard of the law standard.mccarthy,inter alia,asserts that the district court second remand order was correct.
the first remand order 
although not the subject of this appeal,the court first remand order provides a useful insight into its reasoning in this case.as noted above,the first panel explained the first award against mccarthy in these terms 
while mccarthy invoked new hampshire wage law to support his case,the panel considered it irrelevant because the panel considered the case to be a contract dispute regarding an inventive compensation plan commonly used at the firm and commonly used in the securities industry.
emphasis added.focusing on the panel use of the word irrelevant,the district court concluded that the panel set aside the governing law in favor of its perception of an equitable result and industry practices.the panel decision not to consider the new hampshire wage laws demonstrates its disregard for the governing law.the court saw the first panel reasoning as an instance where it is clear from the record that the arbitrator s recognized the applicable then ignored it.advest,at.lest there be any doubt about this point,the court explained again in the second remand order the problem with the first award in the first award,the panel stated that the new hampshire wage laws were irrelevant.as such,the panel explicitly disregarded the governing law.the court first remand order,given the court interpretation of the first award,was a conventional application of the manifest disregard of the law standard.
the second remand order 
the district court application of the manifest disregard of the law standard to the modified award presents a different story.we again quote the reasoning of the second panel in the modified award 
the panel heard testimony from mccarthy and witnesses of both parties and considered documentary evidence from each side as well.the arbitrators fully considered all claims and defenses,including the applicability of the new hampshire wage laws,which were heavily argued by both sides.after full consideration of the matter,the panel decided to deny all claims with prejudice.
the district court focused on the second panel statement that it had fully considered all claims and defenses,including the applicability of the new hampshire wage laws,and found in that statement a troubling ambiguity.as the court explained in its second remand order 
t he second panel did not say whether it concluded that the wage laws were applicable or not applicable or whether it had applied that law in making its decision.therefore,while the second panel statement did not clearly demonstrate a manifest disregard of the governing law,as the first panel did,the second panel left open the possibility that,contrary to the court direction in the first remand order,the panel concluded that the new hampshire wage laws do not apply.
the district court acknowledged that the mere possibility that the panel concluded that the new hampshire wage laws do not apply is not itself a manifest disregard of the law as the district court put it t he second panel statement did not clearly demonstrate a manifest disregard of the governing law,as the first panel did.in the absence of such an expression of manifest disregard of the law in the modified award itself,the district court decided to pursue a further inquiry 
in the first award,the panel stated that the new hampshire wage laws were irrelevant.as such,the panel explicitly disregarded the governing law so that it was not necessary to look behind that decision to determine its basis.
emphasis added.
there is authority in our precedents for a court to go behind the award of an arbitration panel to the record itself in conducting a manifest disregard of the law inquiry.for example,we have said that there must be some showing in the record,other than the result obtained,that the arbitrators knew the law and expressly disregarded it.advest,at emphasis added.but resorting to the record in search of manifest disregard of the law is constrained by the narrow scope of the manifest disregard of the law standard itself.to repeat,manifest disregard of the law means,at its core,that arbitrators knew the law and explicitly disregarded it,at internal quotation marks omitted.put differently,disregard implies that the arbitrators appreciated the existence of a governing legal rule but wilfully decided not to apply it.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the manifest disregard of the law inquiry must not run afoul of the principle that courts do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in reviewing decisions of lower courts.united paperworkers int l union misco,d see also poland spring united food commercial int l union,cir a court does not conduct appellate review to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator or to consider the merits of an award.even where such error is painfully clear,courts are not authorized to reconsider the merits of arbitration awards.advest,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the district court did not observe this limitation on its authority to review an arbitration award.instead of finding manifest disregard of the law by the second panel,it found an application of the wage law with which it disagreed.to demonstrate this point,we quote several excerpts from the court second remand order 
cgmi arguments to the arbitration panel,that the cap was lawful because mccarthy compensation,paid in cash and restricted stock,conferred a benefit to him,because mccarthy had agreed to participate in the cap and was a sophisticated and intelligent financial consultant,and because mccarthy had benefitted in the past from the cap,are not pertinent to the principles of new hampshire law.instead,cgmi argument is based on the reasoning of the court of appeals of new york cgmi represented to the arbitration pan
