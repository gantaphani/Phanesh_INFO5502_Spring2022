this appeal has its genesis in the plaintiff complaint that coworkers created a workplace permeated by racially discriminatory taunts.the pivotal issues implicate two important aspects of employer liability the appropriateness of disciplinary action taken in response to an initial complaint of harassment and the reporting requirement that must be satisfied to trigger a duty to take remedial action for subsequent harassment.the district court,in a thoughtful rescript,rejected the plaintiff claims of employer liability and entered summary judgment accordingly.wilson moulison,d.we affirm.
background 
because this appeal follows a grant of summary judgment,we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant here,the plaintiff,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.ahern shinseki,cir cox hainey,cir.
moulison north corporation is a electrical utility contractor,specializing in the installation and repair of large lighting systems,airport runway illumination.ken moulison is its owner and chief executive.
the events undergirding this appeal took place in.arthur ray wilson,an male,started working for the company on may.he was assigned to a project at the portland jetport,where he labored alongside william stineford,dale small,and ryan polley all white males.polley had the most seniority and functioned as the lead worker.as such,he allotted daily work assignments when the supervisor,bill rowe,was elsewhere.
federal law encourages employers to establish antiharassment policies.burlington,ellerth.at all times relevant to this appeal,the company had such a policy in effect this policy directs employees to report harassment either to a supervisor or to ken moulison.for ease in compliance,it lists moulison telephone number.
the plaintiff woes began almost immediately after he joined the company.in late may,stineford referred to him as aunt jemima a reference that the plaintiff reasonably regarded as a racial slur.in response to this dysphemism,the plaintiff asked stineford to refer to him by name.stineford then used another racial epithet and stated that this was how he talked to other niggers.
at around the same record is muddled and the parties disagree as to the exact,small,and the plaintiff were digging in hard dirt.stineford loudly described the task as nigger work.polley overheard this remark,told stineford that it was inappropriate,and suggested that he watch his mouth.when the plaintiff informed polley about the aunt jemima comment,polley asked both stineford and small to refrain from using such expressions.as a further precaution,polley assigned stineford and small to tasks in a different area,thus temporarily separating them from the plaintiff.
polley importunings fell on deaf ears stineford made continued use of the word nigger and an unidentified coworker referred to the plaintiff as lips,which the plaintiff reasonably believed to be a racial slur.the plaintiff complained to polley about these incidents,but polley took no further action.
on june,the plaintiff called ken moulison.when moulison returned the call the same day,the plaintiff described what had happened.moulison then contacted polley,who confirmed the plaintiff account.
moulison did not let the matter linger.on june,he visited the job site and confronted stineford and small.neither of them denied the plaintiff allegations.moulison became irate and berated the men,making clear that such misconduct was unacceptable.he declared that each of them was working with a foot out the door and that any further incidents of harassment,no matter how minor,would result in immediate termination.
to give context to this warning,we note that the company antiharassment policy states in pertinent part disciplinary measures for prohibited harassment may include oral or written warnings,suspension,or termination depending upon the severity of the offense.
before leaving the job site,moulison spoke with the plaintiff.he apologized for the offensive behavior of the plaintiff coworkers and confirmed that any repetition of that behavior would result in their dismissal.moulison then told the plaintiff to report any further problems to him without delay.the plaintiff assured moulison that he would do so 
notwithstanding moulison warning,stineford use of racial epithets persisted.in addition,the plaintiff relationship with other coworkers began to deteriorate.the plaintiff considers this deterioration to be part of the racial discrimination that he experienced and,for summary judgment purposes,we accept that allegation as true.
the plaintiff continued working at the portland jetport into august.while there,several untoward incidents occurred.once,a coworker slapped him on the hand with a live electrical wire.another time,he was assigned to work with a live electrical wire which he viewed as an attempt to place him in peril.on other occasions,he discovered that his water bottle had been contaminated with dirt,gas,or oil.throughout,coworkers repeatedly yelled at him,swore at him,and refused to help him with his assigned tasks.although he complained to polley,polley took no corrective action.
during this time frame,moulison frequently visited the job site.the plaintiff had ready access to him but never apprised him of any of these developments similarly,moulison was readily available by telephone,but the plaintiff placed no call to him.by like token,the plaintiff never complained to rowe the supervisor.finally,the summary judgment record contains no evidence that either moulison or rowe witnessed any of the incidents of racial discrimination or learned about them.
during august,the company reassigned the plaintiff to an airport project in manchester,new hampshire.while so engaged,he had numerous opportunities to speak to moulison for example,he unloaded his tools outside moulison office each day upon returning from manchester but did not lodge any complaint.
on september,the plaintiff injured his back while working and went out on disability.he never returned to work.instead,he sued the company for discrimination in maine federal district court.his complaint asserted hostile work environment and retaliation claims under title vii of the civil rights act of,and.
following pretrial discovery,the company moved for summary judgment.see.the plaintiff opposed the motion.the district court concluded,inter alia,that the plaintiff had failed to make out a trialworthy issue as to employer liability and granted the motion.wilson,d at.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.ahern,at.we will affirm only if the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the summary judgment loser,discloses no genuine issue as to any material fact and confirms that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.vineberg bissonnette,cir.although we draw all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant favor,he nonetheless must point to competent evidence and specific facts to stave off summary judgment.tropigas de,certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir,slip op.at quoting mccarthy nw.airlines,cir.a properly supported summary judgment motion can not be defeated by conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,periphrastic circumlocutions,or rank speculation.ahern,at pagano frank,cir.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,the plaintiff pursues only his hostile work environment claim.accordingly,we deem his earlier claim of retaliation abandoned.see united states zannino,cir.
the plaintiff asserts that he was forced to toil in a racially hostile workplace,that the company unlawfully tolerated this discrimination,and that it did too little to deter the perpetrators.these circumstances,he says,render the company liable under title vii.see.we examine this charge.
legal framework.
as a general proposition,a plaintiff may recover on a hostile work environment theory when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.harris forklift,internal quotations omitted.the work environment must be both obj
