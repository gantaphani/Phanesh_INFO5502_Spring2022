for want of a comma,we have this case.it arises from a dispute between a maine dairy company and its delivery drivers,and it concerns the scope of an exemption from maine overtime law.specifically,if that exemption used a serial comma to mark off the last of the activities that it lists,then the exemption would clearly encompass an activity that the drivers perform.and,in that event,the drivers would plainly fall within the exemption and thus outside the overtime law protection.but,as it happens,there is no serial comma to be found in the exemption list of activities,thus leading to this dispute over whether the drivers fall within the exemption from the overtime law or not.
the district court concluded that,despite the absent comma,the maine legislature unambiguously intended for the last term in the exemption list of activities to identify an exempt activity in its own right.the district court thus granted summary judgment to the dairy company,as there is no dispute that the drivers do perform that activity.but,we conclude that the exemption scope is actually not so clear in this regard.and because,under maine law,ambiguities in the state wage and hour laws must be construed liberally in order to accomplish their remedial purpose,we adopt the drivers narrower reading of the exemption.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
maine wage and hour law is set forth in chapter of title of the maine revised statutes.the maine overtime law is part of the state wage and hour law.
the overtime law provides that a n employer may not require an employee to work more than hours in any one week unless times the regular hourly rate is paid for all hours actually worked in excess of hours in that week.the overtime law does not separately define the term,employee.instead,it relies on the definition of employee that the chapter elsewhere sets forth.
that definition,which applies to the chapter as a whole,provides that an employee is any individual employed or permitted to work by an employer,id.at.however,the definition expressly excludes a few categories of workers who are specifically defined not to be employee s,id.at a l.
the delivery drivers do not fall within the categories of workers excluded from the definition.they thus are plainly employees.but some workers who fall within the statutory definition of employee nonetheless fall outside the protection of the overtime law due to a series of express exemptions from that law.the exemption to the overtime law that is in dispute here is exemption 
exemption f covers employees whose work involves the handling in one way or another of certain,expressly enumerated food products.specifically,exemption f states that the protection of the overtime law does not apply to 
the canning,processing,preserving,freezing,drying,marketing,storing,packing for shipment or distribution of 
agricultural produce 
meat and fish products and 
perishable foods.
f.the parties dispute concerns the meaning of the words packing for shipment or distribution.
the delivery drivers contend that,in combination,these words refer to the single activity of packing,whether the packing is for shipment or for distribution.the drivers further contend that,although they do handle perishable foods,they do not engage in packing them.as a result,the drivers argue that,as employees who fall outside exemption f,the maine overtime law protects them.
oakhurst responds that the disputed words actually refer to two distinct exempt activities,with the first being packing for shipment and the second being distribution.and because the delivery drivers do quite obviously engage in the distribution of dairy products,which are perishable foods,oakhurst contends that the drivers fall within exemption f and thus outside the overtime law protection.
the delivery drivers lost this interpretive dispute below.they had filed suit against oakhurst on may,in the united states district court for the district of maine.the suit sought unpaid overtime wages under the federal fair labor standards act,et,and the maine overtime law,the case was referred to a magistrate judge,and the parties filed for partial summary judgment to resolve their dispute over the scope of exemption f.after hearings on those motions,the magistrate judge ruled that oakhurst reading of exemption f was the better one and recommended granting oakhurst motion.the district court agreed with the magistrate judge recommendation and granted summary judgment for oakhurst on the ground that distribution was a exempt activity 
the delivery drivers now appeal that ruling.they raise a single legal question what does the contested phrase in exemption f mean our review on this question of state law interpretation is de novo.see manchester sch.dist.crisman,cir.
the issue before us turns wholly on the meaning of a provision in a maine statute.we thus first consider whether there are any maine precedents that construe that provision.
oakhurst identifies one the maine superior court unpublished opinion in thompson shaw supermarkets,no.civ,wl me.sup.in that case,the superior court ruled that exemption f is clear that an exemption exists for the distribution of the three categories of foods,id.at,as a matter of both text and purpose,id.at.
but,a superior court decision construing maine law would not bind the maine law court,and thus does not bind us.see generally king order of united commercial travelers of,rejecting an unreported state trial court decision as binding on federal courts keeley loomis fargo,cir.finding a state trial court decision to be at most persuasive but nonbinding authority,with the federal court instead look ing to the plain language of the statute and our own interpretation in predicting how the state supreme court would rule.moreover,the superior court decision in thompson was appealed to the maine law court,which declined to follow the superior court approach and instead decided the case on different grounds altogether.see thompson shaw supermarkets,me.
nevertheless,the reasons that the superior court decision in thompson gave even if not adopted by the maine law court figure prominently in the arguments that oakhurst now presents to us on appeal.we thus consider those reasons in the course of our analysis,to which we now turn.
each party recognizes that,by its bare terms,exemption f raises questions as to its scope,largely due to the fact that no comma precedes the words or distribution.but each side also contends that the exemption text has a latent clarity,at least after one applies various interpretive aids.each side then goes on to argue that the overtime law evident purpose and legislative history confirms its preferred reading.
we conclude,however,that exemption f is ambiguous,even after we take account of the relevant interpretive aids and the law purpose and legislative history.for that reason,we conclude that,under maine law,we must construe the exemption in the narrow manner that the drivers favor,as doing so furthers the overtime law remedial purposes.see dir.of bureau of labor standards cormier,me.before explaining our reasons for reaching this conclusion,though,we first need to work our way through the parties arguments as to why,despite the absent comma,exemption f is clearer than it looks.
first,the text.see harrington state,me.only if the statute is reasonably susceptible to different interpretations will we look beyond the statutory language.in considering it,we do not simply look at the particular word distribution in isolation from the exemption as a whole.we instead must take account of certain linguistic conventions canons,as they are often called that can help us make sense of a word in the context in which it appears.oakhurst argues that,when we account for these canons here,it is clear that the exemption identifies distribution as a,exempt activity rather than as an activity that merely modifies the,exempt activity of packing.
oakhurst relies for its reading in significant part on the rule against surplusage,which instructs that we must give independent meaning to each word in a statute and treat none as unnecessary.see state tax assessor,me.when construing the language of a statute w ords must be given meaning and not treated as meaningless and superfluous.to make this case,oakhurst explains that shipment and distribution are synonyms.for that reason,oakhurst contends,distribution can not describe a type of packing,as the word distribution would then redundantly perform the role that shipment as its synonym already performs,which is to describe the type of packing that is exempt.see thompson,wl at i t is not at all clear how packing for shipment would be different from packing for distribution.by contrast,oakhurst explains,under its reading,the words shipment and distribution are not redundant.the first word,shipment,describes the exempt activity of packing,while the second,distribution,describes an exempt activity in its own right.
oakhurst also relies on another established linguistic convention in pressing its case the convention of using a conjunction to mark off the last item on a list.see the chicago manual of style ed.providing examples of lists with such conjunctions.oakhurst notes,rightly,that there is no conjunction before packing,but that there is one after shipment and thus before distribution.oakhurst also observes that maine overtime law contains two other lists in addition to the one at issue here and that each places a conjunction before the last item.see the regular hourly rate includes all earnings,bonuses,commissions and other compensation emphasis added id.at a exempting from overtime law automobile mechanics,automobile parts clerks,automobile service writers and automobile salespersons as defined in section emphasis added.
oakhurst acknowledges that its reading would be beyond dispute if a comma preceded the word distribution and that no comma is there.but,oakhurst contends,that comma is missing for good reason.oakhurst points out that the maine legislative drafting manual expressly instructs that when drafting maine law or rules,do use a comma between the penultimate and the last item of a series.maine legislative drafting manual legislative council,maine state legislature,drafting manual see also jacob kippax,me.invoking the drafting manual to help resolve a statutory ambiguity.in fact,oakhurst notes,maine statutes invariably omit the serial comma from lists.and this practice reflects a drafting convention that is at least as old as the maine wage and hour law,even if the drafting manual itself is of more recent vintage.see,me.stat.tit,g processing,canning or packing me.stat.tit,hours,total earnings and itemized deductions.
if no more could be gleaned from the text,we might be inclined to read exemption f as oakhurst does.but,the delivery drivers point out,there is more to consider.and while these other features of the text do not compel the drivers reading,they do make the exemption scope unclear,at least as a matter of text alone.
the drivers contend,first,that the inclusion of both shipment and distribution to describe packing results in no redundancy.those activities,the drivers argue,are each distinct.they contend that shipment refers to the outsourcing of the delivery of goods to a carrier for transportation,while distribution refers to a seller transportation of products directly to recipients.and the drivers note that this distinction is,in one form or another,adhered to in dictionary definitions.see new oxford english american dictionary,webster third new international dictionary.
consistent with the drivers contention,exemption f does use two different words shipment and distribution when it is hard to see why,on oakhurst reading,the legislature did not simply use just one of them twice.after all,if distribution and shipment really do mean the same thing,as oakhurst contends,then it is odd that the legislature chose to use one of them shipment to describe the activity for which packing is done but the other distribution to describe the activity itself.
the drivers argument that the legislature did not view the words to be interchangeable draws additional support from another maine statute.that statute clearly lists both distribution and shipment as if each represents a separate activity in its own right.see referring to manufacture,distribution or shipment.and because maine law elsewhere treats shipment and distribution as if they are separate activities in a list,we do not see why we must assume that the maine legislature did not treat them that way here as well.after all,the use of these two words to describe packing need not be understood to be wasteful.such usage could simply reflect the legislature intention to make clear that packing is exempt whether done for shipment or for distribution and not simply when done for just one of those activities 
next,the drivers point to the exemption grammar.the drivers note that each of the terms in exemption f that indisputably names an exempt activity canning,processing,preserving,and so forth on through packing is a gerund.by,contrast,distribution is not.and neither is shipment.in fact,those are the only nouns in the exemption,other than the ones that name various foods.
thus,the drivers argue,in accord with what is known as the parallel usage convention,that distribution and shipment must be playing the same grammatical role and one distinct from the role that the gerunds play.see the chicago manual of style ed.every element of a parallel series must be a functional match of the others word,phrase,clause,sentence and serve the same grammatical function in the sentence,noun,verb,adjective,adverb.in accord with that convention,the drivers read shipment and distribution each to be objects of the preposition for that describes the exempt activity of packing.and the drivers read the gerunds each to be referring to,exempt activities canning,preserving 
by contrast,in violation of the convention,oakhurst reading treats one of the two distribution as if it is performing a distinct grammatical function from the other shipment,as the latter functions as an object of a preposition while the former does not.and oakhurst reading also contravenes the parallel usage convention in another way it treats a again,distribution as if it is performing a role in the list naming an exempt activity in its own right that gerunds otherwise exclusively perform 
finally,the delivery drivers circle back to that missing comma.they acknowledge that the drafting manual advises drafters not to use serial commas to set off the final item in a list despite the clarity that the inclusion of serial commas would often seem to bring.but the drivers point out that the drafting manual is not dogmatic on that point.the manual also contains a proviso be careful if an item in the series is modified and then sets out several examples of how lists with modified or otherwise complex terms should be written to avoid the ambiguity that a missing serial comma would otherwise create.see drafting manual at.
thus,the drafting manual seeming and,from a judge point of view,entirely welcome distaste for ambiguous lists does suggest a reason to doubt oakhurst insistence that the missing comma casts no doubt on its preferred reading.for,as the drivers explain,the drafting manual can not be read to instruct that the comma should have been omitted here if distribution was intended to be the last item in the list.in that event,the serial comma omission would give rise to just the sort of ambiguity that the manual warns drafters not to create 
still,the drivers textual points do not account for what seems to us to be oakhurst strongest textual rejoinder no conjunction precedes packing.rather,the only conjunction in the exemption or appears before distribution.and so,on the drivers reading,the list is strangely stingy when it comes to conjunctions,as it fails to use one to mark off the last listed activity.
to address this anomaly,the drivers cite to antonin scalia bryan garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts,in which the authors observe that s ometimes drafters will omit conjunctions altogether between the enumerated items in a list,in a technique called asyndeton,id.at.but those same authors point out that most legislative drafters avoid asyndeton.id.and,the delivery drivers do not provide any examples of maine statutes that use this unusual grammatical device.thus,the drivers reading of the text is hardly fully satisfying 
the text has,to be candid,not gotten us very far.we are reluctant to conclude from the text alone that the legislature clearly chose to deploy the nonstandard grammatical device of asyndeton.but we are also reluctant to overlook the seemingly anomalous violation of the parallel usage canon that oakhurst reading of the text produces.and so there being no comma in place to break the tie the text turns out to be no clearer on close inspection than it first appeared.as a result,we turn to the parties arguments about the exemption purpose and the legislative history.see berube rust eng g,me.our purpose in construing a statute is to give effect to the legislative intent as indicated by the statute plain language,and we examine other indicia of legislative intent,such as its legislative history,only when the plain language is ambiguous.
oakhurst contends that the evident purpose of the exemption strongly favors its reading.the whole point of the exemption,oakhurst asserts albeit without reference to any directly supportive text or legislative history,is to protect against the distorting effects that the overtime law otherwise might have on employer decisions about how best to ensure perishable foods will not spoil.see oakhurst dairy,wl,at me,magistrate judge conclusion that the purpose of the exemption for employees engaged in the production and distribution of perishable foods can only be to achieve the most efficient possible production and delivery given the nature of the product.and,oakhurst argues,the risk of spoilage posed by the distribution of perishable food is no less serious than is the risk of spoilage posed by the other activities regarding the handling of such foods to which the exemption clearly does apply.
oakhurst then goes on to argue that legislative history supports this supposition about what the legislature must have intended in crafting the exemption.oakhurst points out that the overtime law,which was enacted in,piggybacks on the definition of employee set forth in the wage and hour law,which had been enacted four years earlier.oakhurst then notes that this definition of employee contained a that excluded workers involved in the handling of aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life but that in all other respects looks a lot like what became exemption f.in particular,that applied to workers employ ed in loading,unloading or packing for shipment or in propagating,processing other than canning,marketing,freezing,curing,storing or distributing various aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life,ch,f.
oakhurst thus argues that exemption f clearly was intended to expand upon the existing by adding activities such as canning and goods namely,meats,vegetables,and perishable foods more generally.and,for that reason,oakhurst contends that it makes no sense to read exemption f,as the delivers drivers do,to have deleted an activity distributing that the had included.
we are not so sure.any analysis of exemption f that depends upon an assertion about its clear purpose is necessarily somewhat speculative.nothing in the overtime law text or legislative history purports to define a clear purpose for the exemption.
moreover,even if we were to share in oakhurst speculation that the legislature included the exemption solely to protect against the possible spoilage of perishable foods rather than for some distinct reason related,perhaps,to the particular dynamics of certain labor markets,we still could not say that it would be arbitrary for the legislature to exempt packing but not distributing perishable goods.the reason to include packing in the exemption is easy enough to conjure.if perishable goods are not packed in a timely fashion,it stands to reason that they may well spoil.thus,one can imagine the reason to ensure that the overtime law creates no incentives for employers to delay the packing of such goods.the same logic,however,does not so easily apply to explain the need to exempt the activity of distributing those same goods.drivers delivering perishable food must often inevitably spend long periods of time on the road to get the goods to their destination.it is thus not at all clear that a legal requirement for employers to pay overtime would affect whether drivers would get the goods to their destination before they spoiled.no matter what delivery drivers are paid for the journey,the trip can not be made to be shorter than it is.
of course,this speculation about the effect that a legal requirement to pay overtime may or may not have on increasing the risk of food spoilage is just that.but such speculation does make us cautious about relying on what is only a presumed legislative purpose to generate a firm conclusion about what the legislature must have intended in drafting the exemption.
moreover,insofar as the legislative history does shed light on that purpose,it hardly supports oakhurst account in any clear way.significantly,exemption f does not simply copy the language from the in the definition of employee that bears on whether distribution is an exempt activity.instead,the legislature made some seemingly significant changes to the language of that changes that oakhurst overlooks.
the relevant language in the definition of employee reads employment in the packing of such products for shipment and in distributing the products.by using two prepositions,for and in,the text of that clearly separated the activities of packing products for shipment and of distributing those products,with the consequence that each activity was plainly excluded from the definition of employee.exemption f,however,deletes the second preposition,in,and thereby strips the new language of the clarity of the old with respect to whether the activity of distribution is a exempt activity or not.and exemption f also changes the word distributing to the word distribution,and thereby makes the activity of distribution parallel in usage to shipment,which,of course,modifies the exempt activity of packing and does not name an exempt activity on its own.
if oakhurst understanding of the legislative history were right,then there would have been no reason for the legislature to have made these revisions.after all,these revisions change the old language in ways that only serve to sow doubt as to whether the activity of distributing that plainly had been excluded from the definition of employee was intended to name a standalone,exempt activity in exemption 
moreover,the legislature actually revised the definition of employee just months after enacting the overtime law and thus exemption and the legislature made that revision in a manner that runs contrary to oakhurst account.for while the version of the definition of employee excluded workers engaged in packing for shipment and in distributing aquatic animal and vegetable life products,see me.laws,f,the revised version removed the reference to distributing altogether,see me.laws,g.the result was thus to draw the very distinction between those workers who were engaged in packing products and those workers who were engaged in distributing them that oakhurst contends we should presume the legislature could not possibly have intended to make in crafting exemption 
of course,exemption f,unlike this revised version of the from the definition of employee,refers not just to packing,or even just to packing for shipment.it refers to packing for shipment or distribution.but if exemption f is indeed modeled on the definition of employee as oakhurst contends then we would expect exemption f at least to use the gerund form of the word distribution in referring to that activity.that is the form that the legislature used in the exemption from the earlier definition of employee and that the legislature has used to refer to all the other exempt activities in exemption 
to be clear,none of this evidence is decisive either way.it does highlight,however,the hazards of simply assuming on the basis of no more than supposition about wha
