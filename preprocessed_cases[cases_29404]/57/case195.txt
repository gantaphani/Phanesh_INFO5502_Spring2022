when a tire company closed its plant in puerto rico,it offered its employees severance pay contingent upon the execution of general releases.the plaintiff acquiesced.nearly a year later,he reversed direction and asserted claims for unjust dismissal under puerto rico law.the district court rejected these claims.
the plaintiff appeals the dismissal of a particular claim under a protective puerto rico statute,laws ann.tit,known colloquially as law.as framed,his appeal implicates a fairly debatable question of first impression about the meaning and purport of law provision.see id.
if the answer to that question were dispositive of the case in its present posture,we might well certify it to the supreme court of puerto rico under laws ann.tit,app.iii,rule f.but there is a logically antecedent issue about whether law applies at all to the plaintiff discharge.the district court bypassed this issue,but we think that,in the interests of comity and federalism,it should be decided first.after all,if law does not apply,then there will be no need for us to answer prematurely the vexing question of statutory interpretation raised by the parties.
for this reason,we vacate the relevant portion of the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
because this case was decided below on a motion to dismiss,we rehearse the facts as revealed by the complaint and the documents annexed thereto.katz pershing,llc,cir.
for years,manuel ruiz sánchez toiled for kelly springfield puerto rico,a wholly owned subsidiary of goodyear tire and rubber company.during his tenure there,he attained the position of general manager.
on april,goodyear human resources manager,emily baranek,signaled the end of the plaintiff long career when she informed kelly springfield work force that the plant would cease operations at month end.to ease the blow,she announced that goodyear was prepared to offer severance packages provided,however,that each recipient sign a general release of all known and unknown claims,promises,causes of action,or similar rights of any type that the employee presently may have with respect to goodyear.anyone who disagreed with the proposed amount of his or her severance payment was directed to contact baranek.
the arrangement constructed a day window within which an employee could review and consider the offer and the release.any employee who signed a release was given the right to revoke it within seven days thereafter.
the plaintiff response was less than enthusiastic.in a letter dated april,he expressed dissatisfaction with the amount of his proposed severance payment and suggested instead a significantly higher figure.in the same letter,he inquired about avoiding severance altogether through a transfer to a different position at goodyear office in miami.this inquiry was apparently prompted by the fact that some employees were afforded the opportunity to transfer from kelly springfield puerto rico plant to miami.baranek responded verbally she rejected the more munificent severance payment suggested by the plaintiff,explained that goodyear was not willing to increase the amount of its offer,and scotched any possibility of a transfer.she later confirmed these advices in writing.
on april the day that the plant closed,the plaintiff accepted the severance package and signed the proffered release.at that point in time,days remained in the day consideration period.the rescission period passed without incident.
almost one year later,the plaintiff sued goodyear in a local court.his complaint asserted claims for unjust dismissal under both law and a puerto rico statute prohibiting age discrimination.noting diverse citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,goodyear removed the action to the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.see a.
in due course,goodyear moved to dismiss the complaint both for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.the district court rejected goodyear jurisdictional contention.ruiz sánchez goodyear tire rubber,wl,at.it then ruled that the release foreclosed the age discrimination claim but that the law claim could go forward.id.at citing laws ann.tit.
goodyear moved for reconsideration of the law ruling.the district court reconsidered the matter and concluded,on reflection,that the release barred the law claim as well.ruiz sánchez goodyear tire rubber,d.the court proceeded to dismiss the case with prejudice.
this timely appeal ensued.in it,the plaintiff challenges only the dismissal of his law claim.
ii.analysis 
the district court dismissal of the law claim followed a motion to reconsider an earlier order.we normally review a district court decision to grant or deny reconsideration for abuse of discretion.see,bennett saint gobain,cir.here,however,the parties arguments are directed to the underlying issue the propriety vel non of dismissal so the rule b standard of review applies.see santiago puerto rico,cir.this standard is familiar.we assay orders of dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo,assuming the truth of all facts contained in the operative version of the complaint and indulging all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.morales cruz of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the district court proceeded immediately to the issue of whether the release,which was annexed to the plaintiff complaint,bars the maintenance of his law claim.release is an affirmative defense.see.c.dismissal on the basis of an affirmative defense requires that i the facts establishing the defense are definitively ascertainable from the complaint and the other allowable sources of information,and ii those facts suffice to establish the affirmative defense with certitude.nisselson lernout,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
because this is a diversity case,the substantive law of puerto rico controls.erie tompkins.borges ex rel.serrano isern,cir.it follows that the validity of the plaintiff law claim must be evaluated under puerto rico law.
puerto rico law generally allows for release or settlement of a claim,referred to as a compromise.see laws ann.tit,see also id.rights granted by the laws of puerto rico may be renounced,provided such renunciation be not contrary to law,to public interest or public order,or prejudicial to the interest of a third person.the type of compromise at issue here is an extrajudicial compromise a compromise entered either before the commencement of an action or without the court intervention.neca mortg.v.a w developers.a validly consummated compromise has the same authority as res judicata as to the claims released laws ann.tit,citibank global mkts.rodríguez santana,cir.the supreme court of puerto rico has enumerated three prerequisites for the release or settlement of a claim i an uncertain legal relationship,ii an intent to eliminate the uncertainty,and iii reciprocal concessions.citibank dependable ins,offic.trans.the release at issue here satisfies these prerequisites.
with respect to the first prerequisite,the termination of the plaintiff employment necessarily created an uncertain legal relationship.after all,t he ubiquity of litigation that surrounds the termination of employment relationships bears powerful witness to the myriad uncertainties about legal rights and obligations incident to such terminations.cabán hernández philip morris usa,cir.
with respect to the second prerequisite,the language of the release manifests an obvious intent to eliminate those uncertainties.in pertinent part,the release memorializes the plaintiff agreement to release all known and unknown claims arising out of his employment,and specifically lists law as one type of claim which the plaintiff intends to forego.in this regard,the release acknowledge s that this severance payment is more than goodyear is otherwise obliged to provide.
with respect to the third prerequisite,the parties made reciprocal concessions.the plaintiff agreed not to pursue any claims that he may have had arising out of the aborted employment relationship goodyear agreed to give the plaintiff a severance payment to which he otherwise may not have been entitled.
at first blush,then,the fulfillment of these three requirements appears to warrant the conclusion that the release was a valid settlement of the plaintiff law claim pursuant to puerto rico law.see citibank,offic.trans.at.but appearances sometimes can be deceiving,and the plaintiff resists this conclusion.
as an initial matter,the plaintiff suggests that his execution of the release and his acceptance of the severance payment should not matter because those acts occurred under duress.in this connection,his brief dwells on the compressed time frame and the imminence of the plant closure.but there are no facts in the record and,specifically,nothing plausibly alleged in the complaint to support a remonstrance that the plaintiff did not have adequate time to consider the severance package.indeed,the known facts point in the opposite direction the plaintiff had days to decide whether to sign the release and he opted to act after only days had elapsed.in the same vein,he had available a rescission period,but he let it expire.for aught that appears,the plaintiff had ample time to consider the release fully and to make an informed judgment about whether to sign it.any claim of duress is woven entirely out of flimsy strands of speculation and surmise and,thus,can not survive scrutiny.see ashcroft iqbal,d.
if more were needed and we doubt that it is the legal underpinnings of the duress argument are afforded only perfunctory treatment in the plaintiff brief.we have said before,and today reaffirm,that i t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.united states zannino,cir.
this brings us to the much harder question that undergirds the appeal.law contains an provision stating that 
the right of an employee who is discharged from his employment without just cause,to receive the compensation provided in of this title,is hereby declared to be unwaiveable.
any contract or part thereof in which the employee waives the compensation to which he is entitled to,pursuant to of this title,shall be null and void.
laws ann.tit.the supreme court of puerto rico has not authoritatively determined the relationship between this provision and extrajudicial compromises of the kind embodied in the release.
nor are the contours of that relationship readily apparent.generally speaking,law requires employers to compensate employees who are discharged without just cause id.specifically,the law entitles such employees to a form of severance pay known as mesada,which is calculated according to a formula based on the employee salary and years of service otero burgos inter am,cir.section describes the reasons that constitute just cause for terminating an employee.if an employee is discharged for one of these reasons,the employer will escape liability under law.laws ann.tit.to further protect employees from the inequality of bargaining power inherent in the relationship,section provides that an employee may not waive the prophylaxis of law.see otero burgos,at.
the court below concluded that law provision applies to prospective waivers of law rights,not to waivers that come about when an employee waives his law rights in an agreement posttermination in order to avoid litigation.ruiz sánchez,d at.on this basis,the court held that the provision did not override the release executed by the plaintiff.id.at.because the release memorialized an otherwise valid extrajudicial compromise,it foreclosed any claim of entitlement to law relief.see laws ann.tit.
confining the application of section to prospective waivers of law claims,which has the effect of denying its application to extrajudicial compromises that settle previously accrued claims,may be a reasonable interpretation of the statute it is,however,not the only reasonable interpretation.the choice between these two reasonable interpretations is fairly debatable,and the sources that we normally look to for edification such as the language and purpose of the statute,see,arevalo ashcroft,cir legislative history,see,passamaquoddy tribe maine,cir analogous statutes and case law,see,blinzler marriott int l,cir and policy considerations,see,id.point in different directions.
on the one hand,it is evident that law was designed to provide economic protection from the ravages of arbitrary dismissals and the text of section contains no distinction between prospective waivers and waivers of previously accrued claims.by like token,section reference to a ny contract might be thought to imply that it applies unreservedly to extrajudicial compromises.
so,too,it can be argued that a broad reading of section is consistent with general trends in puerto rico labor law.after all,judicial supervision of contracts between employers and employees is not uncommon in puerto rico.see,laws ann.tit.other provisions within law also may be read to suggest a legislative preference for judicial or agency oversight of law claims.see id.tit.
on the other hand,none of these conclusions is compelled.indeed,there are factors that support a narrower interpretation of section.it can be argued that the absence of a distinction between prospective waivers and waivers of previously accrued claims in the text of the statute is telling.the same can be said for the absence of any mention of the provision applicability to extrajudicial compromises.on at least one other occasion when the puerto rico legislature sought to limit the availability of extrajudicial compromises,it did so explicitly.see id.imposing requirement that e very extrajudicial settlement in regard to the payment of certain types of wages shall be null unless approved by the department of labor and human resources.the absence of any such language in section may suggest the conclusion that the legislature,in enacting law,did not intend to interfere with the rights of employers and employees to settle previously accrued claims through extrajudicial compromises.
the short of it is that the push and pull of these competing centrifugal and centripetal forces muddy the waters as to how the puerto rico legislature intended section to be construed extrajudicial compromises of previously accrued law claims.this interpretive question is difficult,and we have no clear guidance on it from the commonwealth highest court.in addition,this question is a potentially important one,and prudence strongly suggests that a federal court which is,after all,not the final arbiter of state law,see andrew robinson int l,hartford fire ins,cir should not rush to answer it unnecessarily.
given the interests of comity and federalism,we would be inclined to certify this question to the supreme court of puerto rico if answering it would be dispositive of this case.see acadia ins.mcneil,cir w hen the meaning of a state law depends on the decisionmaker ability to discern the state legislature intent from an array of mixed signals,considerations of federalism,comity,and practicality suggest that the state highest tribunal is best positioned to make an informed and authoritative judgment.but we can not say that answering it would be dispositive because the district court bypassed the seminal question of whether law applies at all to the plaintiff loss of employment.we believe that this logically antecedent question should be answered before any inquiry is attempted into the difficult interpretive question about the meaning and purport of section.
to put into better perspective why we hold this belief,we pause to limn the parameters of the bypassed question.in its motion to dismiss,goodyear offered an alternative basis for dismissal it contended that law had no application in the circumstances of this case.it rested this contention on exceptions and exclusions contained in law itself and it has renewed this alternative contention on appeal.
we add that goodyear alternative contention,though not yet proven,appears to be colorable.it does,however,require further factual development factual development that precludes resolving the contention through a rule b motion to dismiss.see morales cruz,at.un
