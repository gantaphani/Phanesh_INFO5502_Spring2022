the age discrimination in employment act adea contains an exemption provision that allows state and local governments to set mandatory retirement ages for law enforcement officers and firefighters.see j.in this case,we examine for the first time revised criteria for invoking that exemption,including a provision that conditions its use on the employer compliance with fitness testing regulations that have yet to be promulgated by the secretary of health and human services.id.appellants are more than two dozen former puerto rico police officers who claim that their forced retirement at age,pursuant to puerto rico law,violated the adea and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see laws ann.tit,law.the officers filed suit against the commonwealth of puerto rico,its police department,the current and former governors,and the current and former police superintendents,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.the district court dismissed all claims concluding that law,puerto rico mandatory retirement law,is consistent with the adea and that appellants terminations also conformed to constitutional requirements.we agree and therefore affirm.
applicable age discrimination.the adea 
as originally enacted in,the adea did not apply to states and their political subdivisions.eeoc wyoming,d it thus had no impact on the age limits that many local governments had adopted for police and firefighting personnel.see,johnson mayor and city council of baltimore,d evaluating city code provision,adopted in,requiring mandatory retirement of most firefighting personnel at age minch city of chicago,cir noting chicago requirement,a s early as,that city firefighters retire at the age of binker pennsylvania,cir discussing pennsylvania law,first enacted in,requiring state police officers to retire at age sixty.among such provisions was puerto rico law,adopted in may,which established a mandatory retirement age of for both police officers and firefighters.
congress extended the adea to cover government employers in,and the supreme court quelled uncertainty over the constitutionality of that amendment nine years later in eeoc wyoming,at.once the adea became applicable to their employees,states and localities could retain maximum hiring and retirement ages only if they could show that age was a bona fide occupational qualification for particular positions.see f this bfoq exception is extremely narrow,and eligibility may turn on whether the employer can demonstrate a factual basis for believing that all or substantially all persons over the age qualification would be unable to perform the duties of the job involved.gately massachusetts,cir quoting air lines,criswell,d additional citation and emphasis omitted some alteration in original.thus,with the amendment,states and localities were subject to the same restrictive standard as private employers for justifying the use of age in employment decisions.
in,however,congress again amended the adea to provide a limited exemption for the mandatory retirement of state and local law enforcement officers and firefighters.see j.the exemption,known as the provision,permitted any state or local government that had in place age restrictions for law enforcement officers or firefighters on march,day after the decision in eeoc reinstate those restrictions.the amendment did not allow adoption of new mandatory retirement provisions,and the exemption for laws had a limited life span.d esigned to provide states an opportunity to adjust to the supreme court decision,difava,at,the exemption expired on december,when mandatory retirement provisions adopted by state and local governments once again became subject to attack for age discrimination.
that reversion to past practice was.in,congress reinstated the provision,with some revisions and without a sunset provision,retroactive to its december,termination date.see j.significantly,the legislation broadened the exemption to allow states and localities that had not had age restrictions before the wyoming decision to enact such limits.under this renewed provision,a public employer may impose mandatory retirement on law enforcement officers and firefighters who either attain the age of retirement that was in place for those employees as of march,the employer age limit was enacted after the amendment took higher of the age contained in the enactment or age.like the original version of the exemption,the amendment also provided that any exempted discharge be pursuant to a bona fide hiring or retirement plan that is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the adea.j 
the legislation also directed the secretary of health and human services hhs to study and report to congress within three years on the availability of tests or other methods for assessing the ability of law enforcement officers and firefighters to complete public safety tasks.within four years,the secretary was to issue advisory guidelines on the use and administration of physical and mental fitness tests to assess the competency of such personnel,and the guidelines were to be followed by regulations identifying valid,nondiscriminatory job performance tests that shall be used by employers seeking the exemption.stat.the legislation further provided that,once the regulations were issued,employers relying on the exemption would be required to give public safety personnel who reached retirement age an annual opportunity to show fitness for duty by passing such a test.stat.individuals who passed the test could not be forced to retire.id.
the expectation that fitness tests would be developed and prescribed in regulations became part of the law as codified.the statute requires the employer to comply with section d of the age discrimination in employment amendments of if the individual was discharged after the date described in such section.j.the reference to section d has been understood to be a mistaken reference to section d of public law,which requires employers to offer the fitness tests deemed appropriate by the secretary.see.d,stat,j historical and statutory notes.section d provides that the requirement does not take effect,however,until the date of issuance of the regulations identifying such tests 
thus,j effectively states that the employer obligation to administer fitness tests to individuals who reach mandatory retirement age begins on the date of issuance of the regulations,which is the date described in section d of the adea amendments.however,neither the advisory guidelines on the use and administration of tests,nor any regulations identifying appropriate tests,have yet been issued.on its face,then,the statute anticipates fitness testing as a prerequisite for mandatory retirement,but the tests required to be used have not yet been identified 
puerto rico law 
in august,the puerto rico legislature amended its longstanding mandatory retirement law for commonwealth police officers and firefighters,act of may,under which age had been the upper limit of their employment.the new government personnel retirement act,law,lowered the mandatory retirement age to for police officers and firefighters with thirty years of service,although the superintendent of the police force could authorize an officer to serve up to an additional months as a member of the police reserve force.laws ann.tit.
the preamble to law framed the retirement scheme as a way to promote modernization and innovation by bringing new officers into the public safety forces.the preamble further stated that no discrimination is being applied to the members of the police or firefighters corps for reason of age.rather,the motivation was to give a higher security to the people and to protect the security of police officers and firefighters.
the mandatory retirement provision was again amended in.under act,police officers and firefighters with thirty years of service could take voluntary retirement at age,but the mandatory retirement age was changed to.laws ann.tit.
procedural background 
four days after law was enacted,the superintendent of the puerto rico police department sent letters advising officers who had reached age that they had thirty days to complete the necessary documents for their retirement.more than two dozen officers who were involuntarily terminated under law subsequently filed this action against the commonwealth of puerto rico,its police department,governor sila calderón,police superintendent agustin,and former police superintendent victor alleging violations of the adea and,under,the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.they also alleged a supplemental claim under article of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit.
in their complaint,the plaintiffs claimed that former governor calderón and former superintendent had agreed to get rid of a group of old timers within the police department and replace them with younger officers.they requested declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate and enjoin enforcement of law and to establish their right to due process before being terminated.they also sought compensatory and punitive damages against the individual defendants.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss under.b,arguing that the eleventh amendment barred the claims against the commonwealth,the police department,and the individual defendants in their official capacities.they further asserted that the plaintiffs had failed to state claims under the adea and section,and they alternatively raised a qualified immunity defense.
in ruling on the motion,the district court noted plaintiffs concession that the eleventh amendment barred monetary damages against the defendants and the individual defendants in their official capacity,and it accepted defendants assertion,uncontested by plaintiffs,that there is no individual liability under the adea,d.the court also found no merit in the substantive claims,including plaintiffs contentions that law is a subterfuge to evade the adea and that the commonwealth violated the adea by forcing plaintiffs retirements without first administering a fitness test as contemplated by section j.id.at.the court dismissed all federal claims with prejudice and the supplemental claim under commonwealth law without prejudice.id.at.the court also denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.
plaintiffs appeal both the judgment of dismissal and the denial of reconsideration.they argue that the district court improperly dismissed their complaint based on its erroneous interpretation of the adea and its failure to apply well established principles of due process entitling them to a hearing before they were terminated they also claim that the supreme court eleventh amendment jurisprudence does not foreclose the availability of damages from the commonwealth under a due process theory.
our review of the district court grant of a motion to dismiss is de novo.fitzgerald harris,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must allege a plausible entitlement to relief.id.quoting bell atl.twombly,d.we turn first to the adea claim and then briefly discuss the due process claim.our disposition of these claims makes it unnecessary to consider appellants arguments concerning available remedies.
on appeal,plaintiffs offer numerous theories to support their contention that the defendants violated their rights under the adea.among these claims,we discern three rationales for recovery that warrant our attention plaintiffs terminations in accordance with law were unlawful because the adea bars a state or local government from lowering a retirement age that was in effect as of march,plaintiffs mandatory retirement violated the adea because they were not provided with fitness testing to determine their capacity to continue working,and plaintiffs terminations did not comply with j of the adea because their discharges were not pursuant to a bona fide hiring or retirement plan that is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter.
a.the lowered retirement age of law and the adea 
plaintiffs maintain that the and amendments to the adea,which created the exemption for termination of public safety personnel,prohibit the reduction of a mandatory retirement age that was applicable on march.they contend that j permits enactment of new age limits only in states and localities that had no mandatory retirement law in effect at that time.because puerto rico mandatory retirement age for police officers was in march,plaintiffs assert that law,with its lowered age limit,must be invalidated as inconsistent with the federal law 
in construing a statute,we begin with its plain meaning,and i f the meaning of the text is unambiguous our task ends there as well.united states godin,cir.a statute is not ambiguous unless it admits of more than one reasonable interpretation.id.quoting motors darling,cir.the language of j,as amended in,does not support plaintiffs proposed interpretation of the provision.the statute explicitly provides that states or their subdivisions may discharge a law enforcement officer or firefighter pursuant to a mandatory retirement plan that either was in effect on march,or was enacted after september.the only limitation on the latter option is that the discharge occur no earlier than age.j b ii.nothing in the language of the provision even suggests that governments that had mandatory retirement laws in place as of march,could not enact new laws with lower retirement ages after september.
plaintiffs rest their argument in part on an explanatory rule of construction contained in the background information that follows j in the united states code.the note,as it appeared in the legislation,states 
in the repeal,reenactment,and amendment made by subsections a and b shall be construed to make lawful the failure or refusal to hire,or the discharge of,an individual pursuant to a law that 
was enacted after march,and before the date of enactment of the age discrimination in employment amendments of and 
lowered the age of hiring or retirement,respectively,for firefighters or law enforcement officers that was in effect under applicable state or local law on march.
plaintiffs argue that this note eliminates any ambiguity in the language of the adea amendments and shows that the commonwealth was prohibited from lowering the mandatory retirement age for firefighters and law enforcement officers that was in effect as of march.by its terms,however,the note applies only to laws that were enacted between march,and the date of enactment of the adea amendments,which was september.law was enacted on august,the time frame to which the note refers.thus,rather than supporting plaintiffs view that law violated the adea,this note is strong evidence to the contrary.if the prohibition were meant to extend to a law passed after the excluded period of time,the end date in the phrase would have been unnecessary.thus,the only plausible interpretation of the note is that states and localities were permitted to enact laws lowering the mandatory retirement age for police officers and firefighters after passage of the amendment,so long as they complied with the requirements set out in the amendment.
plaintiffs reliance on our decision in gately,where we invalidated a lowered retirement age,is equally misplaced.the mandatory retirement law at issue there was enacted in in connection with the consolidation of four massachusetts police forces.id.at.before the consolidation,officers in three of the forces had been subject to retirement at age and officers serving on the fourth force had been subject to retirement at age fifty.id.the state legislation imposed mandatory retirement at age on all members of the consolidated force.id.we held that the amendment to the adea did not permit massachusetts to lower the retirement age to for the group of officers who,in,were subject to retirement at.before adoption of the amendments,a mandatory retirement scheme enacted after march,imposing new or lowered age limits on employment,was permissible only if it qualified under the narrow bfoq exception.see id.at describing the adea escape clause that allows all employers some limited flexibility to take age into consideration in business decisions.
unlike gately,this case is not governed by the amendment and,as we have explained,a state statute lowering the retirement age for public safety personnel is permitted by the amendment so long as the amendment other requirements are met.see feldman nassau county,cir t he exception can absolve a state or local government of liability under the adea for an age limit in law enforcement hiring regardless of whether that age limit was in existence pursuant to local law at the time wyoming was decided or whether it was enacted after the adea amendments that reinstated the law enforcement exception.citations omitted law is therefore not invalid as a result of its lower triggering age 
b.the fitness testing requirement 
plaintiffs contend that,even if they were lawfully subject to retirement at age,the commonwealth had to give them the opportunity to avoid discharge by taking performance tests that could prove their physical and mental fitness to continue working.this is the testing described above,which congress expected to be in place within about four years after enactment of the amendment.although plaintiffs acknowledge that the particular tests referenced in the statute have never been identified by the secretary of hhs,they insist that testing is nonetheless a prerequisite to their discharge.they claim that,in the absence of federally developed tests,puerto rico was required to devise its own evaluation refrain from imposing mandatory retirement.
we reject this reading of the statute.although the language of j requires careful parsing,it unambiguously requires testing as a to mandatory retirement only for those employees who would be discharged after the secretary of hhs promulgates appropriate tests as described above,section j states that the testing requirement applies if the individual was discharged after the date described in such section,and such section is section d of the age discrimination in employment amendments of.j the date referenced in section d is the date of issuance of the regulations the secretary shall issue identifying valid,nondiscriminatory job performance tests that shall be used by employers seeking the exemption,stat.thus,when pieced together,the elements of the statutory requirement are that employers seeking the benefit of the provision must use the tests identified by the secretary once regulations identifying those tests have been issued.
although the statutory language is not in our view reasonably susceptible to another interpretation,our conclusion would be the same if we deemed the provision ambiguous and found it necessary to consider legislative history to ascertain congress intent.see godin,at noting that,i f the statute is ambiguous,we look beyond the text to the legislative history in order to determine congressional intent see also minch,at stating that t he failure to promulgate guidelines and regulations for fitness testing gives rise to an ambiguity in the statute drnek chicago,d,concluding that the plain language of is ambiguous because it leaves a gap by requiring employers to comply with regulations that have not been promulgated.
in a thoughtful discussion that was endorsed by the seventh circuit in minch,see at,the district court in drnek examined j legislative history at length before concluding that the public safety exemption in the provision was subject to the use of fitness tests when and if suitable tests were ever made available by hhs.drnek,d at.the court cited comments made during floor debates on the proposed legislation that showed skepticism among members of congress about the adequacy of existing physical tests.see id.at the court then concluded 
t he legislative history suggests that the intent of the amendment was to reinstate an exemption from the adea allowing for retirement for public safety officials because fitness tests were unreliable,expensive,and had potential discriminatory effects on women and minorities.the provision in j for compliance with d merely imposed an obligation on employers to provide tests when and if suitable tests became available it did not make tests a condition precedent to the operation of the exemption.
we thus agree with the seventh circuit that this component of section j is essentially meaningless at this juncture.minch,at.at present,a state or local government seeking to enforce a mandatory retirement provision must show only that the designated retirement age was set forth in a law that either was a in effect on march,or b in a law enacted after september,and is no lower than age and the termination was taken pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan that is not a subterfuge for impermissible age discrimination.having already addressed the timing and scope of law,we now consider appellants contention that the statute was a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the adea 
c.the subterfuge requirement 
plaintiffs argue that the enactment of law was a subterfuge to evade the requirements of the adea because the defendants discriminated in a manner forbidden by the act when they lowered the mandatory retirement age from to.plaintiffs emphasize that defendants acted with discriminatory animus,deliberately seeking to replace them with younger officers,and they assert that this discriminatory motive connotes an impermissible scheme to bypass defendants obligations under the adea.
in effect,plaintiffs allege that law was a subterfuge to evade the adea because it was the product of intentional age discrimination.using age as a basis for requiring retirement is precisely what section j entitles the commonwealth to do,however,and we thus join the second and seventh circuits in rejecting an interpretation of subterfuge that would effectively nullify the exemption.see feldman,at there is nothing deceptive about the state legislature doing exactly what congress provided it the authority to do minch,at d oing something that the statute expressly permits does not evade its prohibitions.
in its analysis of the subterfuge limitation in minch,the seventh circuit relied on the supreme court decision in public employees retirement system betts,d.minch,at see also feldman,at adopting the reasoning in minch.the court in betts had considered another provision of the f that also contained a subterfuge exception to an exemption from liability.minch,at.section f protected employment decisions from the prohibitions of the adea if they were taken pursuant to the terms of a bona fide benefit plan and the same language that appears in section j the plan was not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the act.id.
in interpreting the not a subterfuge language in section f,the supreme court rejected the notion that differences in employee benefits would be inconsistent with the adea unless the employer could offer a cost justification for the differential treatment.betts,at.the court concluded that,to avoid a interpretation of the exception,id.at,the not a subterfuge criterion could not invalidate the very that the exemption allowed.id.at see also minch,at.the seventh circuit applied that reasoning in the context of section j 
the adea does not forbid a state or locality from making retirement decisions as to its police and firefighting personnel it expressly allows state and local governments to make such decisions so long as they act within the parameters set forth in section j the statute does not condition the validity of such retirement programs on proof that the public employer has adopted the program genuinely believing that it is justified in the interest of public safety.instead,recognizing that there was not yet any national consensus as to the relationship between age and one fitness to serve as a police officer or firefighter,congress opted simply to restore the status quo ante,permitting states and cities to continue imposing age limits on these positions as they had been able to do prior to the adea extension to state and municipal employers and wyoming holding sustaining that extension.
minch,at.thus,proof that an employer imposes mandatory retirement for police officers and firefighters based on the view that older individuals are not up to the rigors of law enforcement or firefighting and should make room for younger,fresher replacements will not establish subterfuge because it does not reveal a kind of discriminatory conduct that the adea by its very terms forbids.id.
as both the supreme court in betts and the seventh circuit in minch emphasized,this understanding does not strip the subterfuge provision of all meaning.instead,a plaintiff asserting subterfuge must show that the employer is using the exemption as a way to evade another substantive provision of the act in other words,that the employer is commit ting some other type of age discrimination forbidden by the adea.minch,at see also betts,at.feldman,at.the seventh circuit offered two examples of viable claims of subterfuge in the context of section j if an employer adopted or reinstated age limits in order to retaliate against an employee who had protested practices made unlawful by the adea or if the employer adopted age limits for police and firefighting personnel at the same time that it created a new,position unrestricted by age,and invited the newly retired officers to apply,allowing the inference that the mandatory retirement scheme was a subterfuge for wage discrimination against older employees.minch,at citing betts,at.
as we have described,the plaintiffs here offer only accusations of animus to support their subterfuge contention,alleging in their complaint that the governor and police superintendent agreed to get rid of a group of old timers with the purpose of replacing them by younger officers.even if that allegation fairly describes the defendants motivation,the fact remains that the adea permits government employers who are concerned about the effectiveness of older public safety officers to impose mandatory retirement at age.plaintiffs have thus offered no theory of subterfuge that can withstand a motion to dismiss,and they have therefore failed to state a viable claim under the adea.
plaintiffs assert that their fourteenth amendment right to due process was violated when,pursuant to law,the defendants lowered the mandatory retirement age by ten years without providing them an opportunity to demonstrate their physical and mental fitness to continue working.they claim that law,the act that set as the upper age limit for police officers,gave them a property interest in their jobs until they reached that age.plaintiffs also assert that they were entitled to individual hearings before their terminations.
we see no merit in this constitutional claim.to the extent plaintiffs have a property interest in their jobs,it derives from commonwealth law.see,cir property interests are created and defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.quoting bd.of regents roth,d.the right to continued employment until age that plaintiffs claim to have been given by law was modified by law,and no due process violation occurs when the legislature which creates a statutory entitlement or other property interest alter s or terminat es the entitlement by subsequent legislative enactment.gattis gravett,cir see also id.at while the legislative alteration or elimination of a previously conferred property interest may be a deprivation,the legislative process itself provides citizens with all of the process they are due.citing atkins parker,d story green,cir having enacted a statute that created such a property right,the legislature retains the power to enact new legislation altering or eliminating the right,and that elimination does not contravene the due process or takings clauses of the constitution.hoffman city of warwick,cir where the legislature enacts general legislation eliminating statutory rights or otherwise adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life,in the absence of any substantive constitutional infirmity,the legislative determination provides all the process that is due.quoting logan zimmerman brush,d see also passenger atchison,topeka santa fe,d a bsent some clear indication that the legislature intends to bind itself contractually,the presumption is that a law is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the legislature shall ordain otherwise.quoting dodge bd.of.educ.ass island ex rel.scigulinsky retirement bd.of,cir.
moreover,w hen statutory benefits are denied or terminated pursuant to a policy determination,as opposed to an individual determination of eligibility,the due process clause does not require the state to afford a hearing to each affected individual.hoffman,at see also johnson lefkowitz,cir rejecting entitlement to hearing before mandatory retirement because the administrative cost to the state of providing each retiree with a hearing would be enormous,and by far outweigh the hardship to the individual town court nursing,d blackmun,concurring in the judgment when governmental action affects more than a few individuals,concerns beyond economy,efficiency,and expedition tip the balance against finding that due process attaches.thus,the police department failure to administer fitness tests before discharging plaintiffs violates neither the constitution nor,as we have explained,the adea.
plaintiffs also attempt to rest a due process claim on the arbitrariness of age as the point at which police officers are no longer physically fit to serve on the force.they cite the puerto rico legislature subsequent amendment of law,by act of june,raising the upper age limit for police officers and firefighters to,as evidence that the defendants lacked a basis for terminating their employment at age.although this claim is insufficiently developed to warrant our consideration,it is,in any event,patently unavailing.section j explicitly permits states to impose mandatory retirement on public safety personnel at age,and a state legislature is therefore not obliged to amass scientific research or empirical evidence justifying its decision to adopt that age.the judgment made by puerto rico legislature,after further reflection,that the commonwealth safety goals could be better achieved by raising the age to hardly demonstrates that the prior adoption of age was arbitrary.forceful arguments certainly can be made as to the wisdom of enforcing a maximum age of hire,kopec,at,but puerto rico decision to do so consistently with the adea did not violate plaintiffs right to due process.
we summarize our holdings 
puerto rico law,which lowered the mandatory retirement age for public safety personnel from to,is consistent with section j of the adea 
defendants were not required to administer fitness tests before enforcing law mandatory retirement age because the testing requirement in section j will not take effect until appropriate tests are identified in regulations promulgated by the secretary of hhs 
plaintiffs allegations of animus on the part of defendants do not establish that law was a subterfuge for unlawful discrimination within the meaning of section j because the exemption purpose is to allow the termination of police officers and firefighters on the basis on age 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment was not violated by plaintiffs terminations without fitness testing or individualized hearings.
we thus conclude that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a viable claim for relief.the court likewise properly denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.
the judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.
so ordered.
chronology of events leading to an exemption under the adea for the mandatory retirement of firefighters and law enforcement officers 
adea enacted.it does not apply to states and their political subdivisions,and existing mandatory retirement provisions for police officers and firefighters are unaffected.
congress extends the adea to cover government employers,meaning that public employers could retain maximum hiring and retirement provisions only if they could show that age was a bona fide occupational qualification for the jobs.
supreme court decision in national league of cities usery,d,raises doubts about whether the adea could constitutionally be applied to state and local governments.
supreme court decision in eeoc wyoming,d,upholds the extension of the adea to government employers.mandatory retirement ages for firefighters and police officers were once again clearly unlawful unless the states and localities could show that age was a bona fide occupational qualification.
congress amends the adea to provide a temporary provision allowing the mandatory retirement of state and local law enforcement officers and firefighters if the government employer had an age restriction in place on march,day after the ruling in eeoc wyoming.no new mandatory retirement provisions could be adopted,and the exemption expired on december.
congress reinstated the provision,retroactive to december.the amendment also allowed public employers to adopt new mandatory retirement laws.public employers could thus impose mandatory retirement on police officers and firefighters if the employer had a mandatory retirement law in effect as of march,and the age of retirement was set no lower than the age set in that earlier law or the employer enacted a new mandatory retirement provision with an age limit no lower than.
appellants also alleged a supplemental claim under article of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit.the district court dismissed the federal claims with prejudice and the commonwealth claim without prejudice.given our disposition of the federal claims,we do not further consider the supplemental claim.see molina,cir a district court retains the discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction where the district court has dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction.
a chronology of the congressional action and supreme court cases leading up to the current adea exemption for the mandatory retirement of police officers and firefighters appears at the end of this opinion.
doubt about whether the adea could be applied to state and local governments had arisen in the aftermath of the supreme court decision in national league of cities usery,d.see kopec city of elmhurst,cir.in usery,which was subsequently overruled by garcia san antonio metro.transit,d,the court held that the tenth amendment barred extension of the and overtime provisions of the fair labor standards act to state and local governments.at.although wyoming eliminated tenth amendment concerns about the adea,the supreme court later held that congress did not have the authority to abrogate the states sovereign immunity from suit by private individuals for monetary relief under the adea.see kimel florida bd.of regents,d.injunctive relief,however,remains available.state police for automatic ret.ass difava,cir.
section f allows employers to take any action otherwise prohibited under the statute where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business f.
the full text of section j is as follows j employment as firefighter or law enforcement officerit shall not be unlawful for an employer which is a state,a political subdivision of a state,an agency or instrumentality of a state or a political subdivision of a state,or an interstate agency to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual because of such individual age if such action is taken with respect to the employment of an individual as a firefighter or as a law enforcement officer,the employer has complied with section d of the age discrimination in employment amendments of if the individual was discharged after the date described in such section,and the individual has attained a the age of hiring or retirement,respectively,in effect under applicable state or local law on march,or b i if the individual was not hired,the age of hiring in effect on the date of such failure or refusal to hire under applicable state or local law enacted after september,or ii if applicable state or local law was enacted after september,and the individual was discharged,the higher of i the age of retirement in effect on the date of such discharge under such law and ii age and pursuant to a bona fide hiring or retirement plan that is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter.
section d of,states d job performance tests identification of issuance of the advisory guidelines described in subsection c,the secretary shall issue regulations identifying valid,nondiscriminatory job performance tests that shall be used by employers seeking the exemption described in section j of the age discrimination in employment act of with respect to firefighters or law enforcement officers who have attained an age of retirement described in such section j.use of on the date of issuance of the regulations described in paragraph,any employer seeking such exemption with respect to a firefighter or law enforcement officer who has attained such age shall provide to each firefighter or law enforcement officer who has attained such age an annual opportunity to demonstrate physical and mental fitness by passing a test described in paragraph,in order to continue employment.
the legislation also had ordered the department of labor and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc to conduct a study of the feasibility of fitness testing for public safety personnel and directed the eeoc to promulgate guidelines on the administration and use of such tests.researchers from the center for applied behavioral sciences of the pennsylvania state university conducted the study for the government entities and concluded that age was a poor predictor of performance in public safety occupations,but no guidelines were issued.see.
luis fortuño,the current governor,was later added to the case in his official capacity,and calderón remained a defendant in her personal capacity.jose figueroa sancha,the current superintendent of police,has been substituted for cartagena as a defendant.
plaintiffs do not present an equal protection argument on appeal,and we therefore deem any such claim waived.see levin dalva brothers,cir noting that claims not raised in opening appellate brief are waived.
this argument was not raised before the district court and therefore could be treated as waived.see in re new motor vehicles canadian exp.antitrust,cir.we have nevertheless chosen to address it in order to clarify the scope of the provision.
indeed,we observed in difava that the provision allows states,if they choose,to continue to enforce against relevant law enforcement officers certain earlier retirement laws or to create new laws consistent with the mandates of the statute.difava,at emphasis added.difava primarily concerned the massachusetts statute we found invalid in gately in light of the amendments,but its description of the law suggests an understanding of the version of section j consistent with the view we have articulated here.
because the version of j allows states and their subdivisions to impose mandatory retirement at age or above,provisions adopting such a limit do not need to meet the requirements contained in f for a bfoq exception.see feldman,at holding that j by its terms relieves law enforcement agencies of having to establish that age is a bfoq in order to discriminate on the basis of age kopec,at noting that s ection j would accomplish nothing if the exemption from the adea were conditioned upon a bfoq showing because t hat requirement is already found in section f see also knight georgia,cir holding that,under the equivalent provision in the amendment,a bfoq showing was not necessary.
for convenience,we repeat the relevant portion of the provision it shall not be unlawful for an employer which is a state to discharge any individual because of such individual age if such action is taken with respect to the employment of an individual as a firefighter or as a law enforcement officer,the employer has complied with section d of the age discrimination in employment amendments of if the individual was discharged after the date described in such section j emphasis added.the statute then goes on to list the permissible retirement ages depending on the time of enactment of the applicable mandatory retirement plan and,in subsection,requires that the plan be bona fide and not a subterfuge to evade unlawful discriminati
