thomas ouellette,a verizon employee,took the day off on december,to attend the funeral of his wife grandfather and was disciplined.this in turn led to arbitration and to the present appeal,which presents a procedural issue of some importance.the events following ouellette december day away from work can be briefly summarized.
because verizon considered the absence to be unauthorized,it suspended ouellette for three days.pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between verizon and local of the international brotherhood of electrical workers the union,the union filed a grievance.verizon reduced the discipline to a suspension,designating december as an unpaid day of suspension.still unsatisfied,the union demanded arbitration.
the parties submitted to the arbitrator the question,was the suspension given to thomas ouellette for just cause if not,what shall be the remedy on june,the arbitrator issued a decision the june award which attributed some blame both to ouellette and his supervisor and concluded 
the one day suspension given to thomas ouellette was not for just cause.the day shall be converted to leave without pay and the discipline removed from his file.
verizon then altered its records for december,from suspension to unpaid absence and deleted any reference to discipline.verizon left unchanged the unauthorized absence marked on ouellette attendance record for december.
the union interpreted the june award as ordering verizon both to pay ouellette for december and to strike the unauthorized reference from ouellette attendance record for december although the union did not claim that he should be paid for december.when verizon disagreed,the union on june,wrote to the arbitrator with a copy to verizon counsel,seeking clarification of the award.its letter said 
it seems absolutely clear that the day which you hold should be converted to leave without pay is the day that ouellette attended the funeral.the second additional day for which he was suspended and not paid,is obviously covered by that part of your award that says the one day suspension was not for just cause.as such,ouellette is clearly entitled to pay for that day.
verizon responded by saying that the award was not ambiguous that t he day that the arbitrator had directed in the second sentence of the award be converted to leave without pay was the same day the one day suspension referred to in the first sentence and that the arbitrator had no power to alter his earlier award.in a conference call with the parties on august,the arbitrator said that he had intended to award ouellette back pay for december.
on august,the arbitrator issued a letter purporting to clarify his award the august letter 
the one day suspension give n to thomas ouellette was not for just cause.he shall be made whole for all lost wages and benefits arising from this suspension and the discipline shall be removed from his file.
the day of the funeral shall be treated as a day of leave without pay.
verizon neither complied with this make whole directive nor did it seek review in court.in november,the union sued verizon in federal district court under section of the labor management relations act.that statute provides federal courts with authority to enforce collective bargaining agreements and,as construed by the supreme court in textile workers lincoln mills,d,invokes federal substantive law to govern those agreements.
in its motion for summary judgment,the union argued for enforcement of the back pay directive.in its cross motion verizon answered that the august letter was not a proper award but an illegitimate alteration of the original june award.the union replied that verizon forfeited its alteration defense because it had not brought suit to set aside either the june award or the august letter.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the union,requiring that back pay be awarded to ouellette for december.it did not concern itself with the union forfeiture argument,because it found that in any event the august letter was merely a permissible clarification of the original award.however,the court refused the union request for attorneys fees,saying that verizon position was not frivolous but merely unpersuasive.
both sides have appealed.verizon claims that the august letter was an alteration of the award and beyond the arbitrator authority.the union says that verizon forfeited this defense and that in any case the august letter is a clarification that the arbitrator could permissibly make.given the forfeiture,the union says that verizon should pay the union attorneys fees for the enforcement proceeding.
we begin with the forfeiture issue.this is not an objection,like article iii or subject matter jurisdiction,that has to be addressed at the threshold the district court was free to bypass the issue and decide the case on the merits.but for the sake of future litigants,the ground rules ought to be clarified as far as possible,so that in similar circumstances the parties to arbitrations know who is to appeal.
to understand the forfeiture issue,one must take several steps back.where a collective bargaining agreement includes an arbitration clause,the arbitration award is treated as a contractual obligation that can be enforced through a section suit.lincoln mills,at.but this leaves unanswered a host of questions concerning the powers of arbitrators and the mechanics of judicial review of labor arbitration awards.
to resolve such issues,federal courts could conceivably borrow from the federal arbitration act faa,which does not apply of its own force,or they could create a common law of labor arbitration or they could borrow from analogous state law.the practice has developed in labor arbitration cases of borrowing the forum state law to fix the limitations period for seeking judicial review of an arbitration decision.posadas de puerto rico asociacion de empleados de casino de puerto rico,cir.
consonantly,federal courts have adopted the general rule that a party who fails to initiate an action to vacate or modify an award within the applicable state time days in massachusetts.laws ch.b is barred from asserting those claims as defenses to a later action to confirm.derwin general dynamics,cir.this rule serves to cut off stale defenses,to encourage parties to forego merely formal judicial proceedings aimed at obtaining confirmatory orders,and to advance the federal policy of according finality to labor awards.id.at.
such a rule is easily enough administered where there is only one pronouncement by the arbitrator and where it is clear from the outset who has won and who has lost.but here verizon could hardly be expected to seek review of the june award within days of its issuance the award did not mention back pay,and the first clear statement that the arbitrator wanted verizon to provide back pay came only in august.however,by or shortly after august,verizon did have such notice in definitive form.
yet verizon then failed to bring suit to challenge either the allegedly clarified june award or the explicit august letter.verizon says that it had no obligation to sue because the original award was in verizon favor,and that the august letter was ineffective to alter the award under the doctrine of functus officio.it concludes that it is free now to raise this objection as a defense in the union suit to enforce the award.
in its classic form,the common law doctrine of functus officio bars arbitrators from reconsidering or revising final awards.glass molders,pottery,plastics allied workers int l union excelsior foundry,cir.this restriction was traditionally cast in jurisdictional terms.as commentators have explained,a n arbitrator jurisdiction ends when a final award is issued.elkouri elkouri,how arbitration works ed.arbitrators are thus said by some our own case law is not so clear to be without power to revisit the merits of an award once it has issued.office prof l employees int l union,local brownsville,cir.
the current vitality of the doctrine is disputed by the union,which says that it is long dead in labor arbitration.judge posner,who sums up much of what is worth saying about the doctrine,is
