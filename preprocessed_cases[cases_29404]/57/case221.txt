this case involves the existence vel non of an obligation to pay disability ltd benefits under a conventional group insurance plan.the central question is whether,in an addiction context,a risk of relapse can be so significant as to constitute a current disability.although we recognize that our decision creates a circuit split,we answer this question affirmatively and uphold the district court award of ltd benefits to the plaintiff.in our view,a risk of relapse into substance dependence like a risk of relapse into cardiac distress or a risk of relapse into orthopedic complications can swell to so significant a level as to constitute a current disability.
background 
between and,the plaintiff,julie colby,was a partner in a medical practice known as merrimack valley anesthesia associates mvaa.in that capacity,she served as a staff anesthesiologist at a hospital located in newburyport,massachusetts.her schedule was demanding she worked to hours per week.
the landscape changed dramatically in july of,when a colleague happened upon the plaintiff sleeping or unconscious on a table in the hospital.the plaintiff tested positive for fentanyl,an opioid used in her anesthesiology practice.as matters turned out,she had for some time been opioids and had become addicted.
the consequences of this discovery were stark within a matter of weeks,the plaintiff took a leave of absence and entered inpatient substance abuse treatment at the talbott recovery campus talbott in atlanta,georgia.talbott professionals diagnosed the plaintiff as having an opioid dependence,a dysthymic disorder,and personality traits.in addition,her intake examination revealed severe back pain associated with degenerative disc disease and a history of major depression.
the plaintiff stayed at talbott until november of,after which she remained under regular medical supervision on an outpatient basis.for aught that appears,she has not resumed her use of fentanyl.her license to practice medicine was first relinquished,then revoked.
when the plaintiff dependence on opioids came to light,her employer,mvaa,had in force a group employee benefit plan,underwritten and administered by union security insurance company management company for merrimack anesthesia associates long term disability plan usic,which included ltd benefits the plan is governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.
the plan had a day waiting period denominated as a qualifying period for ltd benefits.when the plaintiff applied for those benefits,usic approved payment from the end of that period november,to the end of her stay at talbott november.but usic refused to pay benefits past this point.it noted that the plaintiff had been discharged from talbott and that,although she remained under a doctor care and feared a relapse,a risk for relapse is not the same as a current disability.
the plaintiff exhausted her administrative appeals within the structure of the plan and then brought suit in the federal district court.see a b.her complaint named an array of defendants but,to all intents and purposes,usic the lone appellant is the real party in interest.for ease in exposition,we refer to usic as if it were the sole defendant.
in due course,the parties for judgment on the record.ruling on these,the district court deemed usic termination of benefits unreasonable.colby assurant emp.benefits colby i,d.pertinently,the court stated that a denial of benefits premised on the ground that an ltd plan does not cover future risk generally or treats physical and psychological future risks differently,absent language allowing such distinctions,is arbitrary and capricious.id.the court remanded the matter for further consideration b ecause usic had categorically excluded risk of relapse as a basis for disability and thus had not conducted the appropriate analysis,whether the probability of colby relapsing upon a return to the practice of medicine was so high that she was totally disabled under the plan.id.at.
the remand had little practical effect.usic position hardened it continued to resist the payment of any benefits beyond november,insisting that u nder the terms of the applicable policy,risk of a potential future disability is not considered a current disability for which benefits are available.
the plaintiff again exhausted her administrative appeals and repaired to the district court.the district court reopened the case,and,responding to a new set of for judgment on the record,awarded the plaintiff ltd benefits for the remainder of the month period the maximum available to her under the plan.colby assurant emp.benefits colby ii,d.in support,the court explained that categorically excluding the risk of drug abuse relapse is an unreasonable interpretation of the plan.id.at.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the plan at issue here is conventional,and its contours are unremarkable.the baseline facts are pellucid the plan falls within the compass of erisa,usic is the plan administrator,and the plan documents vest discretion in the plan administrator with respect to both the interpretation and application of the plan provisions.refined to bare essence,this appeal poses only a single question whether,under the plan,usic exercised its discretion reasonably in terminating the plaintiff benefits on the ground that risk of relapse can not constitute a present disability.
we approach this question with an understanding that our review is deferential.where,as here,the administrator of an erisa plan is imbued with discretion in the interpretation and application of plan provisions,its use of that discretion must be accorded deference.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.it follows that judicial review is for abuse of discretion.see conkright frommert,d firestone tire,at.
in the erisa context,this metric is equivalent to the familiar arbitrary and capricious standard.d h therapy,llc bos.mut.life ins,cir cook liberty life assur,cir.whatever label is applied,the relevant standard asks whether a plan administrator determination is plausible in light of the record as a whole,or,put another way,whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.leahy raytheon,cir citations omitted 
even though this standard of review is deferential,we hasten to add that there is a sharp distinction between deferential review and no review at all.applying a deferential standard of review does not mean that the plan administrator will prevail on the merits.conkright.at.in order to withstand scrutiny,the plan administrator determinations must be reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.d h therapy,at internal quotation marks omitted.in short,they must be reasonable.see conkright.at.
in some cases,an inherent conflict of interest exists that is,the plan administrator typically,an insurer not only evaluates claims but also underwrites the plan.usic has such a dual role here.see colby ii,d at colby i,d at.this inherent conflict may be weighed as a factor in assessing the reasonableness of usic decision,but its existence does not perforce alter our standard of review.see metro.life ins.glenn,d.
against this backdrop,we turn to the plaintiff claim the case for coverage is straightforward.the plan contains an occupation test.the scope of coverage under the occupation test is set out in simple terms.the plan covers an injury or sickness that requires a claimant to be under the regular care and attendance of a doctor,and prevents her from performing at least one of the material duties of her regular occupation emphasis in original.coverage pursuant to this metric applies to the first months of a period of disability,subsequent to a day waiting period 
for purposes of this test,the plaintiff regular occupation is that of physician.the issue in this case,therefore,relates to the plaintiff ability to work as a physician.see colby i,d at.under the plan,the material duties of that position include working at least hours per week,reviewing and evaluating medical records,diagnosing patients medical conditions,e xpress ing an opinion on or prescrib ing,diagnostic measures and treatment,and recording and reporting facts and findings 
the definitions contained in the plan make clear that substance abuse,dependence,and addiction like mental illness more generally are conditions that may give rise to sickness within the purview of the plan.the plaintiff says that during the relevant period she suffered from opioid dependence and addiction,remained under the regular care of a series of doctors,and faced such a significant risk of relapse that she could not perform one or more of the material duties of her customary occupation.this risk of relapse was particularly acute because returning to work as a physician would afford her easy access to opioids and other addictive substances.
although there is evidence pointing in different directions,the record generally suggests that the plaintiff was at a high risk of relapse into opioid dependence following her discharge from inpatient care her attending physician at talbott recommended that she should not return to the practice of medicine for six months to allow her to continue to work on her recovery.the plaintiff followed this advice and entered into a contract with physician health services phs which required her,among other things,to abstain from alcohol and drugs,submit to random urine screens,meet with a therapist once or twice per month,attend a weekly support group,and submit to monitoring by a physician.
the plaintiff risk of relapse was not merely theoretical.in perhaps the most striking actualization of this risk,the plaintiff was arrested in may of some six months after her departure from talbott for driving under the influence of alcohol.this incident constituted a relapse within the parameters of her phs contract and precipitated the execution of a new contract which restarted the clock.
here,moreover,the plaintiff opioid dependence did not exist in a vacuum instead,it was part of a constellation of factors,including back pain and various mental health disorders.see colby i,d at.copious evidence,including statements by her therapist,patricia dell ross,linked her opioid dependence to her back pain,her turbulent personal life,and the stresses of her job her professed inability to return to work thus contemplated not only enhanced physical and logistical exposure to her drug of choice but also the likely exacerbation of other triggering conditions.cognizant of this nearly perfect storm,dell ross,in a letter dated january,predicted that,should the plaintiff return to work,her access to opiates,combined with the usual and unusual stressors of everyday life and work would make her relapse almost inevitable.
the record reflects that,due largely to the risk of relapse,a number of medical experts agreed that the plaintiff remained disabled for at least some period of time following her discharge from talbott.on november,alan wartenberg wrote that to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,colby is at high risk of relapse should she return to the practice of anesthesia,or to any situation where she could access anesthetic opioids.the plaintiff,he added,appears to still be in significant denial and minimizes the level of her dependency and the dangers associated with her drug use.in the same vein,marcus goldman wrote that the plaintiff had psychiatric functional incapacity from july through the end of and that her risk of relapse was significant.as such,she could not work from july through to december.so,too,william land wrote that the plaintiff combination of psychiatric and physical conditions including opioid dependence rendered her unable to perform the duties not only of an anesthesiologist,but also for a physician generally given the access to opio i ds during the period from july of through the last date for which land had access to the plaintiff medical records december of.he noted that the plaintiff appeared to have numerous psychosocial stressors which would have precipitated a relapse,including severe and disabling back pain.working,he explained,would clearly increase the plaintiff risk of relapse,and h er strong attraction to her drug of choice fentanyl would distract her and preclude her from conducting her essential duties.
a number of allied professionals agreed with these assessments.for example,milton jay,wrote that the plaintiff had a moderate severity relapse risk profile such that she did not have functional capacity for returning to work until june of.factors increasing her risk of relapse included denial of her dependence relapse to alcohol an personality trait and a history of major depression,dysthymia,and stress disorder.
the overwhelming weight of this evidence indicates that the plaintiff was,at least for some appreciable time after leaving talbott,at a very significant risk of relapse.it might have been possible for usic to limit the period of disability by arguing that this risk progressively diminished over the month period.but usic eschewed this possibility before the district court.it took a categorical approach,steadfastly maintaining that risk of relapse,whatever the degree,could not constitute a current disability under the plan.for example,its initial motion for judgment on the record posited that a mere risk of relapse into a prior,condition is not a condition that would preclude the plaintiff from working in her occupation.
even after the district court remanded for the specific purpose of allowing usic to find the facts relating to the significance of the risk of relapse over time,see colby i,d at,usic stuck to its guns.while it collected some additional medical evidence,it continued to view that evidence through the prism of its insistence that a risk of relapse,no matter how grave,could not constitute a current disability.
on appeal,usic reiterates this insistence but couches its argument in somewhat different phraseology.it says that the plaintiff did not provide objective proof of a disability and cites boardman prudential insurance,cir,for the proposition that,when such objective proof is lacking,a denial of benefits is not an abuse of discretion,see id.at.but this change in phraseology does not herald a change in substance.william shakespeare,romeo and juliet act,sc.t hat which we call a rose b y any other name would smell as sweet.usic collapsed this objective proof argument on itself when it noted that no such objective proof could exist because the plaintiff admittedly was not actively addicted on or after november.appellant br.at.usic then reaffirmed its categorical approach asserting that,a doctor opinion that there is a high probability of relapse is not objective or even reliable evidence of a current disability.appellant reply br.at.so viewed,usic defense remains the same as the one that it offered in the district court that a risk of relapse,even if significant,can not ground a claim for ltd benefits under the policy.
we readily acknowledge that the caselaw is mixed as to the viability of such a defense.compare,stanford cont l cas,cir upholding insurer denial of ltd benefits to nurse anesthetist,with,kufner jefferson pilot fin.ins,d,overturning insurer denial of continuing ltd benefits to opioid and anesthesiologist.we conclude that the defense is not viable in this case given the language of the plan,categorically excluding risk of relapse as a source of disability is simply unreasonable.
to begin,the language of the plan admits of no such categorical bar.it does not mention risk of relapse,let alone exclude risk of relapse as a potential basis for a finding of disability.this silence is telling in an erisa case because the discretion of a plan administrator is cabined by the text of the plan and the plain meaning of the words used.see harris harv.pilgrim health care,cir explaining that the plain language of an erisa plan must be enforced in accordance with its literal and natural meaning internal quotation marks omitted.plucking an exclusion for risk of relapse out of thin air would undermine the integrity of an erisa plan.
in an effort to turn dross into gold,usic suggests that the plain meaning rule actually operates in its favor.it emphasizes that the plan language is crafted in the present indicative tense a claimant is disabled if a sickness prevents her from performing
