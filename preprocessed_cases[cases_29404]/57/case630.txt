background 
brink is a nationwide corporation whose core business is providing secure,armored transportation of valuables.brink operates from local,largely autonomous branches that vary widely in size from five to hundreds of employees.branches are administered by a branch manager with the assistance of an assistant branch manager.
ingram worked at brink for nearly three years.she was hired in september and resigned in may.although her work was exemplary,she claims that she was passed over for a number of promotions between and early.the fatal problem for ingram discrimination claims,however,is her failure to file suit until august,by which time her earlier grievances were time barred.the only relevant hiring decision during the applicable limitations period was the decision to fill the lawrence assistant branch manager position,but that decision was favorable to ingram as she was offered the job.but she rejected it for a better paying one outside the company.although ingram goes to great lengths to describe a pattern of discrimination during her first two years with the company,without a showing of an adverse employment action within the limitations period,ingram can not make out even the minimal prima facie case of discrimination.
with respect to the equal pay act claim,ingram alleges that there were two male employees in the lawrence branch and several male employees throughout the company who were paid more than she was paid for performing comparable work.but the only two employees that ingram hardy and jeffrey assistant branch managers.ingram never formally held that position she turned it down when it was offered to her.nor did she effectively perform the same duties while she was in other positions.without more,her pay discrimination claim can not prevail.
ingram employment from september through december 
ingram took her first position at brink in september as chief office employee of its lawrence,massachusetts branch at an hourly wage of.the job was largely administrative and clerical.by november,according to the branch manager,ingram had become a great asset to the lawrence branch,and was reclassified from an hourly employee to a salaried employee earning per year.her new job title was branch supervisor,a rare,position with flexible duties depending on the needs of the individual branch 
at the time that ingram was hired,the lawrence branch had no assistant branch manager.in december,two months after she began working at brink,the assistant manager position was posted.ingram applied,although she conceded in her application that a deserved the promotion because of his longer tenure with the company.neither was hired the assistant branch manager position was not filled,and the company stopped recruiting applicants until when the vacancy was posted again.
in march ingram became pregnant.she claims no adverse employment consequence attributable to her pregnancy except for a dispute about the painting of the lawrence branch while on maternity leave,in january,the assistant branch manager position in lawrence was posted once again.for the first time,the posting stated that the assistant branch manager will be required to learn every run and make recommendations for route restructuring.and it included a new requirement for availability seven days per week,which ingram,as a new mother,found to be virtually impossible.she nevertheless expressed an interest in the position to david weinstock,the lawrence branch manager at the time.he responded that she needed more armored experience.
while it is true that ingram had never worked in the armored vehicle industry before her employment with brink,and had no experience working on the armored trucks even within brink,weinstock had never before mentioned the need for her to gain armored experience.indeed,notwithstanding this supposed deficiency,weinstock rated her as outstanding in seventeen out of twenty categories on her february performance review.and in the section assessing areas in which ingram needed to improve,weinstock made no mention of the need for armored experience.in any event,when ingram returned from maternity leave in march she set out to obtain armored experience by accompanying drivers and messengers on runs.
on april,brink appointed jeffrey hosfeld to the assistant branch manager position that had then been vacant for over two years.hosfeld was a former corrections officer and had previously served as a brink branch supervisor in another branch,the same title that ingram had,where he earned more per year than ingram despite what ingram describes as comparable experience and job responsibilities in support of her challenge to hosfeld being promoted instead of her,ingram also hosfeld had no experience in the administrative side of business operations prior to his appointment as assistant branch manager.in any case,hosfeld apparently had extensive experience in the field working on armored trucks,as required by the assistant branch manager job posting 
in may,weinstock was promoted to regional management,leaving the lawrence branch without a branch manager.brink posted the branch manager position,specifying that it required a bachelor degree or its equivalent.ingram expressed an interest in the position.weinstock recommended her to his supervisor,thomas szczepanski.szczepanski disagreed and chose a male,mark albright,on the ground that albright was more qualified because he had a bachelor degree and ingram did not.however,szczepanski offered ingram a branch manager position at a smaller branch in rochester,new york,although he acknowledged that she probably was not interested in moving in light of her recent maternity.ingram did not pursue the rochester position.in june,albright was appointed to the branch manager position,replacing weinstock.
in september,ingram was promoted to the position of operations manager.her salary was raised to per year from per year 
shortly thereafter albright left the lawrence branch manager position and the vacancy was posted yet again.ingram again expressed an interest in,szczepanski appointed tim messner,the syracuse branch manager,as interim manager of the lawrence branch while a more thorough search for a permanent branch manager could be conducted.as interim branch manager,messner split his time between the syracuse and lawrence branches.
b.the position at branch manager 
in,hosfeld,then the lawrence assistant branch manager,transferred to another branch,leaving vacant both the assistant branch manager and branch manager positions.ingram applied for the former.in her letter of application,ingram acknowledged that she did not feel ready for the branch manager position,but was unequivocally prepared to successfully function in the capacity of assistant manager.
after ingram applied,jim gaherity,szczepanski replacement as regional manager,informed ingram that he was keeping the assistant branch manager position open until the branch manager position was filled.he wanted the new branch manager to be involved in the selection of his staff.
ingram then expressed an interest in the branch manager position despite her admission only weeks earlier that she was not qualified for it.gaherity,the regional manager,rejected ingram,appointing daniel harrington in her stead.harrington had worked at brink since february,six months after ingram was hired.although at the time of his appointment to branch manager,harrington was working as a messenger in the lawrence branch,harrington had spent over fifteen years in management positions in the trucking and delivery field before joining brink.in contrast,before her employment with brink,ingram had no experience in the trucking and delivery field 
according to ingram,after interviewing her for the branch manager position,gaherity told her that she was for an assistant branch manager position.indeed,even the new branch manager,harrington,agreed and expressly recommended ingram for the position.but gaherity hesitated,reporting to harrington that ingram lacked the requisite experience and qualifications.gaherity proposed that someone from outside the company be hired hardy,the eventual hire for the position.harrington rejected hardy because he had no experience in the armored car industry,and because hardy had explicitly stated his concerns about the job safety hazards during his interview with harrington.as of december,the assistant branch manager position remained vacant.
ingram delivered her second child on february,and took maternity leave through april,although she continued to come to work once a week.in march,harrington assured ingram that he would relate to gaherity that she was still his pick for assistant manager.
shortly thereafter,ingram saw the assistant branch manager position advertised in a local newspaper.when she confronted harrington,he told her that gaherity was resisting her promotion.then,in,harrington showed ingram an email message stating that brink was eliminating the assistant branch manager title in favor of the operations manager title,the very title that she already held.according to brink,the title was changed to more accurately reflect the duties of the position.the internal posting for the position was changed to reflect the title change,but was otherwise identical to the prior posting.it is unclear from the record what the relationship was between the title change and ingram existing job title and duties.what is clear is that,by this juncture,ingram was convinced that the company had no intention of promoting her.
on may,harrington resigned without warning.gaherity visited the lawrence branch the following day,and he and ingram had an emotional confrontation.ingram expressed her anger at being passed over for promotion several times.gaherity told ingram that she could have the promotion to assistant branch manager,and that he would make a phone call to accomplish her promotion in an hour.
later that day,gaherity did send an email to his supervisor,jim tingley,requesting that ingram be appointed to the assistant branch manager position,with an accompanying salary increase to,an increase over ingram salary at the time and more than hosfeld made as assistant branch manager.the next morning,tingley forwarded the email,along with a strong endorsement of his own,to senior vice president greg hanno.on may,hanno approved the request.weinstock,who was assisting with the management of the lawrence branch in the face of harrington sudden resignation,called ingram at home to formally offer her the promotion.
by this time,however,ingram was on medical leave on the advice of her doctor.after not hearing back from gaherity to confirm her promotion after their confrontation on may,ingram reports leaving the office a wreck,a total wreck.she visited her doctor who told her to take medical leave for stress.she was still on medical leave on may,when harrington called to offer her the promotion.ingram told him that she would think about the offer.
in the meantime,ingram looked for another job.on may,she took a job at genesys software systems with a starting salary of per year.notably,ingram cited her salary at brink the amount offered with the promotion when applying to genesys.by letter dated may,ingram resigned from brink,admitting that their most recent offer was what she had sought but that it took too long.
in,hardy was hired as assistant branch manager for the lawrence branch.his starting salary was,more than brink offered ingram just one month prior.

on september,the district court entered a memorandum and order granting brinks motion for summary judgment on both the state and federal claims.pursuant to the framework laid out in mcdonnell douglas green,d,judge keeton concluded that brink could successfully rebut a prima facie showing of discrimination by showing that ingram was eventually offered the very promotion that she claims she was denied,and that ingram could not rebut with a showing of pretext or discriminatory animus.see memorandum and order,ingram brink,civil action.september,at memorandum and order of september.with regard to ingram claim under the equal pay act,the district court found that ingram could not show that she received less pay than any male employee performing equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill,effort and responsibility,as required by corning glass works brennan,d.memorandum and order of september,at.

federal rule of civil procedure c permits the trial court to enter summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.on summary judgment,the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant here,ingram,and all reasonable inferences are drawn in the nonmovant favor.rathbun,at.once the moving party avers the absence of genuine issues of material fact,the nonmovant must show that a factual dispute does exist,but summary judgment can not be defeated by relying on improbable inferences,conclusory allegations,or rank speculation.see mesnick,cir n ot every discrepancy in the proof is enough to forestall a properly supported motion for summary judgment the disagreement must relate to some genuine issue of material fact.and summary judgment can be entered even where ambiguous,often murky concepts such as motive and intent are involved,as in the employment discrimination context.id.
ingram claim under ch.
ingram alleges that brinks failure to promote her to either assistant branch manager or branch manager amounts to actionable sex and pregnancy discrimination under.laws ch.in relevant part,ch.makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate on the basis of sex in hiring,firing,compensating,or in providing other terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.the protections of this provision have been interpreted to apply to plaintiffs asserting claims of sex discrimination stemming from their pregnancy.gunther gap,d.
neither party disputes that the applicable limitations period is six months,since ch.as it existed before requires a plaintiff to file a charge with the mcad no later than six months after the alleged act of discrimination see ocean spray cranberries mcad.accordingly,only events taking place between february,and august,the day that ingram filed her claim with the mcad,are actionable to be sure,discriminatory acts or practices that predate or postdate the actionable period can be used as relevant background evidence.rathbun,at.but the problem with ingram case is more fundamental while the prior acts that ingram describes can be introduced to provide a background for or evidence of animus in connection with an adverse decision,without an adverse decision within the limitations period,the discrimination inquiry simpl
