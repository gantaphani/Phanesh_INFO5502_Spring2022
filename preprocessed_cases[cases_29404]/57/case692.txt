this equal protection case is before us for the second time.see donahue city of boston,cir donahue i.appellant bradley donahue sued the city of boston,the boston police department bpd,and various public officials,alleging that the hiring practices of the bpd,which are governed by a federal court consent decree,violate the constitution guarantee of equal protection.the district court found that donahue lacked standing to pursue his suit and entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.on appeal,we affirmed the decision below as to donahue claim for damages but remanded to the district court for a determination as to whether donahue had standing to pursue his claim for prospective relief.
on remand,after further proceedings,the district court held that when donahue last took the qualifying civil service exam in april,he was no longer eligible for hire to the bpd due to the age restriction of for certification for original appointment to a police officer position imposed by.laws ch.finding that the statute was valid,constitutional,and applicable to donahue,the court concluded that donahue was not able and ready to apply to the bpd and therefore lacked standing to pursue his claim for prospective relief.we affirm.
the facts of this case are laid out in detail in donahue i.we briefly review those facts that are relevant to the present appeal,recounting them in the light most favorable to donahue.banco popular de,cir.
to become a police officer with the bpd,an individual must first pass a statewide civil service examination,which is administered by the commonwealth of massachusetts human resources division hrd.the bpd hiring procedures are governed in part by a consent decree that was entered in.see castro beecher.after the hrd administers the exam,it compiles an eligible list of individuals who received a passing score on the examination and who therefore are eligible for appointment to a civil service position.in accord with the terms of the consent decree,hrd alternates minority and candidates on the eligible list.the candidates included on the eligible list are divided into residents and of boston,with residents ranked higher than similarly situated,subject to the alternation requirement of the consent decree.among the residents,certain candidates are entitled to a statutory preference and are ranked higher than those without a preference,again subject to the consent decree requirement.when hiring a new class of police officers,the bpd notifies the hrd of the number of positions it wishes to fill.hrd then certifies twice the number of persons requested plus one,selecting names from the eligible list in rank order.the bpd must appoint candidates in order of their position on the certification list,unless it provides a reason for bypassing a candidate 
bradley donahue,a white male,is a police officer for the town of yarmouth,massachusetts.prior to his employment in yarmouth,he was employed by the university of massachusetts police.neither of these positions required donahue to take an entrance exam.
however,donahue aspired to become a police officer with the bpd and sought appointment by taking the hrd civil service examination.because he did not qualify for a statutory hiring preference,he could only be appointed from the general certification list according to his score on the examination and subject to the consent decree.he took the civil service exam in april and may,receiving passing scores of and respectively.on each occasion,he was placed on the eligible list but was not hired by the bpd.he filed this lawsuit on may,alleging that the bpd procedures and appointments following the two civil service tests discriminated against him on the basis of race,in violation of the united states constitution and and.see donahue city of boston,d in march,donahue sought,and was granted,permission to amend his complaint to include additional allegations relating to the bpd hiring of police officers from the eligibility lists created from the exam.
on april,while his case was pending in the district court,donahue again sat for the statewide civil service exam,passing with a score of.however,one year earlier,the massachusetts legislature had adopted a statute providing that in any municipality adopting the law,no person who has reached the age of on the date of the entrance examination shall be eligible to have his or her name certified for original appointment to a municipal police officer position.acts ch.codified at.laws.ch.boston adopted the provisions of in december.donahue had reached the age of by the date of the april examination.hence,his name was not included on the certification list that the hrd forwarded to the bpd on september.
on november,the boston city council passed a home rule petition to exempt from any boston resident who took the april civil service examination for appointment to the bpd until his or her eligibility expired.several months earlier,the city council had passed a similar home rule petition exempting from the statute applicants to the boston fire department who,unlike the police officer candidates,took the civil service exam that was held prior to the enactment of.that petition had been approved by the mayor of boston and enacted by the massachusetts legislature,as is required for such a petition to become law.see.however,because the mayor of boston did not approve the home rule petition as to police officer candidates,it was never presented to or enacted by the legislature.therefore,no candidates for appointment to the bpd were exempted from.
meanwhile,on may,the defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that donahue lacked constitutional standing to assert the claims alleged in his complaint.on september,donahue filed a for summary judgment,claiming that the consent decree was unconstitutional based on the uncontested facts.in their opposition to donahue motion,filed on october,the defendants argued in part that donahue lacked standing to seek prospective relief because he was ineligible for appointment to the bpd under.two days later,donahue moved for leave to amend his complaint to challenge the validity,applicability,and constitutionality of.
on december,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,finding that donahue lacked standing to pursue his claim.it held,in particular,that donahue test scores were such that he would not have been hired,even in the absence of the consent decree donahue test scores and lack of statutory preference doomed his candidacy to failure before the consent decree came into play.therefore,the district court concluded that donahue had not suffered any injury and had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the consent decree.on december,the district court entered orders denying donahue motion for summary judgment and his motion to amend the first amended complaint on the ground that they were now moot.donahue timely appealed.
in donahue i,we affirmed the district court holding that donahue lacked standing to pursue his claim for damages,explaining that more than applicants had scored higher than donahue on the april exam but were not hired,while the eligible list created after the exam included candidates between donahue and the last appointee.given his placement on the eligible lists,we concluded that donahue would not have been hired by the bpd even under a policy.because donahue would not have qualified for hiring in the absence of the consent decree,he lacked the causation and required to establish standing to assert a claim for damages.see donahue i,at.
we explained,however,that a plaintiff may have standing to assert an equal protection claim for prospective relief,even if he or she does not have standing to pursue a claim for damages.where a plaintiff challenges an race conscious program and seeks prospective relief in the form of an injunction and a declaratory judgment,the relevant injury is the inability to compete on equal footing.id.at quoting texas lesage,d.thus,a plaintiff may have standing to pursue a claim for prospective relief if he or she has or is likely to be exposed to unequal treatment.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in donahue case,at least one minority candidate without special language skills or a statutory preference was hired despite a lower score than donahue on the may exam.therefore,donahue was not able to compete on an equal footing with other candidates because of his race,a key element of standing to seek relief.id.at.
however,we cautioned that unequal treatment was not enough.a plaintiff seeking to establish standing to pursue a claim for prospective relief must also be able to show that he is able and ready to apply for the benefit and that the challenged discriminatory policy prevents him from doing so.id.at.quoting northeastern.chapter of contractors city of jacksonville,d.the appellees argued that donahue was not able and ready to apply for a future appointment to the bpd because he was over years old and was thus ineligible for an original appointment under the terms of.donahue countered that was no longer in effect and did not apply to him because,as a yarmouth police officer,he was not seeking an original appointment.noting that the parties had not provided sufficient factual and legal support for their positions to enable us to assess the effect of on donahue standing to bring suit,we remanded the case to the district court for further consideration of donahue equal protection claim for prospective relief.we also directed the district court to reevaluate donahue motion to amend the first amended complaint,which,in light of our ruling,was no longer moot.
on december,the district court held a status conference to address the mandate from this court.at the end of the conference,the court issued an order allowing donahue october motion to amend the first amended complaint and allowing the defendant subsequently to file a motion for summary judgment on the issues of the constitutionality and applicability of.
donahue filed his second amended complaint on december.in addition to challenging the validity and application of,as proposed in donahue motion to amend the first amended complaint,the second amended complaint included new claims of age and race discrimination under,and.law ch,and ch.title vii and the united states and massachusetts constitutions.
the city subsequently moved for summary judgment to dismiss all of the claims in donahue second amended complaint.donahue filed a for summary judgment.on june,the district court granted summary judgment for the city,holding that there was no evidence that is no longer in effect does not apply to donahue or is unconstitutional.because prevented donahue from being appointed to the bpd on account of his age,donahue was not able and ready to compete for a position in the bpd and therefore lacked standing to pursue his claim for prospective relief.the district court declined to address the additional claims that donahue had added to his second amended complaint,explaining that a lthough the parties make a number of arguments in their briefs,this court believes that effect on donahue candidacy is the only remaining issue in this case.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court entry of summary judgment for the defendants,evaluating the record in the light most favorable to donahue.suarez pueblo,cir.donahue claims that the district court erred in concluding that he lacks standing to assert an equal protection claim seeking prospective relief.in addition,he argues that the district court erroneously failed to address the new counts that donahue added to his second amended complaint.we address each of these claims in turn.
standing to assert claim for prospective relief 
donahue challenges the district court conclusion that prevents him from being appointed to the bpd,thereby depriving him of standing to seek prospective relief in the form of an injunction against the operation of the consent decree it appears that donahue has abandoned on appeal his earlier claims that is no longer in effect and does not apply to him because he is not seeking an original appointment with the bpd.rather,he argues that should not apply to him because he was entitled to be hired based on the results of the examination.he also claims that the district court erred by upholding the constitutionality of under a rational basis test rather than applying strict scrutiny.both of these arguments are unpersuasive.
applicability of 
frankly,we have found it difficult to understand the precise nature of donahue claim that does not deprive him of standing to seek prospective relief.essentially,he seems to claim that should not be applied to him because he was entitled to be hired to the bpd based on the results of the examination.he argues in his brief that he took the qualifying exam in and scored high enough at that time that he would have been hired but for his race.therefore i t was only because of the consent decree that donahue was forced to take the exam,and was treated disparately under.emphasis in original.
this argument relies on an erroneous reading of donahue i.as we emphasized in that opinion,donahue would not have been hired in in the absence of the consent decree.approximately applicants scored higher than donahue on the test but were also denied appointment to the bpd.all of those candidates would have been eligible for appointment before donahue.as we explained,irrespective of the consent decree,donahue was too far down the list to be even remotely considered for hiring to the bpd based on his test score.see donahue i,at.therefore,donahue was not entitled to an appointment prior to the enactment of and would have been subject to the statute age restrictions in april even under a hiring policy.
we found in donahue i that donahue was denied the opportunity to compete on equal footing in the bpd hiring process on account of his race in connection with the exam.id.at.however,unequal treatment is not itself sufficient to establish standing to seek prospective relief donahue must also be able to demonstrate that he is able and ready to apply for a position with the bpd and is prevented from doing so by the challenged discriminatory policy,that is,the operation of the consent decree.id.at quoting jacksonville,at.see also gratz bollinger,d to seek,injunctive relief,petitioners must show that they face an imminent threat of future injury.littleton,d past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief if unaccompanied by any continuing,present adverse effects.because of age limitation,donahue was not able and ready to apply for appointment to the bpd in december when the district court issued its original opinion in this case,nor is he eligible for such an appointment today.thus,donahue does not satisfy a key element of standing to seek prospective relief 
constitutionality of 
donahue further claims,however,that the district court erred in upholding the constitutionality of under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment on the ground that its age classification is rationally related to a legitimate public purpose.donahue argues that is subject to strict scrutiny rather than rational basis analysis because the statute has a disproportionate impact on,which,coupled with other relevant facts,demonstrates that the statute has an invidious discriminatory purpose.washington davis,d although a statute is not unconstitutional solely because it has a racially disproportionate impact,an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts,including the fact,if true,that the law bears more heavily on one race than on another see also arlington heights metro.housing dev,d racially disproportionate impact does not constitute a violation of the equal protection clause absent p roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose.
more specifically,donahue argues that minorities who scored at least a on the exam were hired prior to the enactment of and are not affected by the statute age limitation.therefore,he asserts that section as applied to the donahue similarly situated class is so inextricably bound to the consent decree as to amount to an extension of its application but fo
