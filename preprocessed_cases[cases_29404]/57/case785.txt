background 
we glean the relevant facts from the summary judgment record,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing brevis disposition here,the plaintiff.see smith,cir.
wareham,massachusetts,is a bucolic community known largely as a gateway to cape cod.beginning in january of,kearney served as a patrol officer and canine handler for the wareham police department.as a canine handler,kearney brought his dog home each evening and provided essential care.the police department did not count the time spent ministering to the animal as part of kearney work week.
on may,kearney and todd bazarewsky a similarly situated canine handler demanded overtime compensation of up to three hours per day for this work.they also sought additional overtime for transporting the dogs to and from the police station.when the town rejected these entreaties,the officers filed suit under the flsa a trial ensued,and the jury found in kearney favor.its verdict eventually translated into an award of in damages,in costs,and in attorneys fees.
the suit plainly left a bad taste in the mouths of kearney superiors.after the verdict but before the case was finally resolved,chief joyce circulated a memorandum entitled mandatory overtime reduction.this document,dated april,anticipated the final judgment and warned that the police force must prepare to absorb the settlement costs of kearney lawsuit from the department budget.the memorandum then described the chief plans to effectuate reductions in overtime assignments to free up the needed funds.kearney claims that the money used to pay the judgment was not derived from the police department budget and that chief joyce statements were calculated to pit kearney against his fellow officers who counted on overtime to supplement their income.
kearney asserts that,as a result of the memorandum,his colleagues acted cooly toward him.moreover,his allegation in the course of the litigation that the town had acted in bad faith rankled,and chief joyce,among others,voiced suspicions that kearney victory had been procured by untruthful testimony.
from and after that point,kearney supervisors began paying particularly close attention to his job performance.this scrutiny resulted in two reprimands.the first,issued on may,was for failure to discover a at a local restaurant during a patrol.the second,issued shortly thereafter,was for failing to clean his revolver.kearney admits to the accuracy of the facts on which these reprimands were based but asserts without offering specific examples to the contrary that such infractions often were overlooked when committed by others.as an added slight,he was assigned what he described as the oldest and most dilapidated patrol car in the police department fleet.
at some point in record is silent as to the exact assumed the position of shop steward for the union that represented the rank and file members of the wareham police department.in that capacity,he helped to bring two more flsa claims against the town.the first arose when the police department asked officers to remain available in case their services might be required during a predicted hurricane.kearney argued that officers deserved compensation for the time that they spent at home awaiting a call to action.the other claim comprised an effort to secure compensation for police officers for training and time.in each instance,municipal officials found the claim to be meritorious and adjusted officers compensation accordingly.
not long after the last of these claims was settled,a series of events unfolded that marked the beginning of the end.during the early morning hours of may,kearney,while on patrol,found a bag of expensive golf clubs.although standard procedure required officers to inventory lost property and either place it inside the evidence shed or ask a sergeant to secure it temporarily,kearney eschewed these alternatives.instead,he left the clubs next to the evidence shed at the rear of the station house without either logging them in or reporting that he had found them.he did,however,mention his discovery to a fellow officer,dennis damata.
the clubs vanished.they mysteriously reappeared twelve days later after their owner had reported them lost.kearney suspected that damata had taken the clubs and said as much.when damata learned of this aspersion,he complained to lieutenant brightman.after conferring with chief joyce,brightman mounted an internal investigation.
brightman interviewed several police officers and the owner of the golf clubs.he reported to chief joyce that he could not reach a factual conclusion.he did,however,express the view that some of those interviewed were being less than truthful and that criminal conduct likely had occurred.emphasizing the disruptive effect of the incident,brightman recommended that the probe continue and that the police department arrange polygraph tests for kearney and damata.
both officers voluntarily agreed to undergo polygraph examinations,which were administered by an independent expert.the test results indicated that damata was being truthful and kearney was not.chief joyce immediately placed kearney on administrative leave.he then wrote to murphy on september,requesting the convening of a suspension hearing to look into kearney conduct.acceding to this request,murphy appointed warren rutherford,the barnstable town administrator,as an independent hearing officer.kearney did not object to the appointment.
rutherford took testimony for four days over a period from september through october.kearney and several other police officers were among the witnesses.on october,rutherford issued a detailed report in which he summarized the evidence,found that kearney had violated departmental rules,and adjudged him guilty of continued untruthful statements and conduct.on this basis,rutherford recommended kearney immediate discharge.four days later,murphy adopted the hearing officer recommendation and terminated kearney employment.the following day,chief joyce announced kearney termination in a letter to all police personnel,noting that e mployees who are untruthful will not be tolerated.at about the same time,in what amounted to an exit interview,chief joyce told kearney you may have won the battle,but you did win the war.not unreasonably,kearney interpreted this as a reference to his successful prosecution of flsa claims.
kearney appealed his termination to the massachusetts civil service commission the commission.on november,the commission found kearney guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer and noted that his behavior had caused dissonance within the department.withal,the commission thought dismissal too severe a sanction and reduced the penalty to a suspension.the state superior court affirmed the commission decision.see wareham police dep t kearney,wl,slip op.at.judicial review ended at that point.the dismissal never actually took effect although the suspension presumably has been served.
in the meantime,kearney had commenced the instant action.after the close of discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court,in a thoughtful rescript,granted the motion.kearney,wl,at.this timely appeal followed
