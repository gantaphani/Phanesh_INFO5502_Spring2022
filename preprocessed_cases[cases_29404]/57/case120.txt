prior to being laid off,alan clukey served as a police dispatcher for the town of camden the town for years.the sole issue on appeal,the second one in this case,is whether the collective bargaining agreement governing clukey employment contained an unambiguous condition precedent requiring clukey to submit his address and phone number to the town after his layoff in order to assert his recall rights.
because we conclude that the pertinent contract provision is ambiguous,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the town and remand for further proceedings.
factual background 
alan clukey was an employee of the camden police department from until he was laid off in june,at which time he was the department most senior dispatcher.the collective bargaining agreement the cba between the police union and the town permitted the layoff of dispatchers for any reason and provided for recall of qualified employees based on seniority.
the cba recall provision,article,section,states,in pertinent part 
the affected employee has recall rights for twelve months from the date of such layoff.the affected employee shall file in writing his or her mailing address and telephone number,if any,with the town manager at office and shall be obligated,as a condition of recall rights for said twelve month period,to continue to inform the town manager in writing of any change thereafter 
it is undisputed that clukey did not file in writing his address or phone number with the town manager after his layoff,but it is also undisputed that the town had that information in its employment records.during the period after clukey was laid off on june,vacancies opened in the camden police department for a parking enforcement officer and an administrative position,both of which clukey was qualified to fill.however,the town neither recalled clukey to employment nor notified him that he was not being selected for the positions.
procedural background 
the lawsuit 
in,clukey and his wife,dera clukey,brought this lawsuit under,alleging that the town had deprived him,without due process of law,of his property interest in his right to be recalled.the town moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that clukey did not have a constitutionally protected property interest in his asserted recall right.the magistrate judge held that clukey had a property interest in his right to be recalled,but ultimately ruled that our decision in ramírez arlequín,cir,compelled the conclusion that clukey claim was not cognizable under.in particular,the magistrate judge recommendation relied heavily on our conclusion that 
a claim of breach of contract by a state actor without any indication or allegation that the state would refuse to remedy the plaintiffs grievance should they demonstrate a breach of contract under state law,does not state a claim for violation of the plaintiffs right of procedural due process.
id.at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.finding that clukey,like the plaintiff in ramírez,had asserted a breach of contract claim rather than a federal due process claim,the magistrate judge recommended dismissal.the district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed clukey complaint for failure to state a claim.clukey appealed.
the first appeal 
in clukey town of camden,cir clukey i,we held that the plain language of the seniority provision contained in article,section of the cba,
compels a conclusion that clukey had a property interest in his right to be recalled.the intent of the bargaining parties to grant employees an entitlement to recall could not be clearer.by its terms,this proviso vests the recall rights in the individual affected employee and provides the town no discretion in qualified employees with requisite seniority employees shall be recalled.
id.at emphasis in original.we agreed with the district court that clukey ha d stated facts which,if true,establish that he has a constitutionally protected property interest in his right to be recalled to employment with the police department of the town of camden.id.at.we further held that 
t he town alleged failure to provide clukey with any notice at all,either before or after filling open positions with new hires,states a claim for a procedural due process violation.that injury can not be fully redressed by recourse to a state law breach of contract claim or the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement.
id.at.we therefore vacated the dismissal of clukey action and remanded the case to the district court 
decision on remand 
when proceedings resumed in the district court,both parties moved for summary judgment on the basis of a stipulated factual record.in its motion,the town argued that the address and phone number notification required by the recall provision is a condition precedent for an employee right to be recalled.the town asserted that,because clukey did not file his address and phone number in writing during the period after his layoff,between june,and july,he had no right to be recalled.clukey argued in response that the recall provision required only that he file his address and phone number with the town at some time in history,which he had done.he claimed that his recall right was contingent only on his obligation to alert the town to any change in the information it had on file,and no such change had occurred.thus,the town violated his right to recall by failing to contact him when positions became available.
the magistrate judge recommended judgment for the town,concluding that the cba notification requirement is a condition precedent to the right to be recalled.although the town already had the specified information for clukey,the magistrate judge determined that the requirement purpose was to indicate the employee intent to initiate the month recall period and thereby relieve the town of the burden to search out all employees who have been laid off or affected during the immediately preceding months regardless of their interest in recall.the district court accepted the recommended decision on the basis of the magistrate judge reasoning.clukey timely appealed.
a.the issue 
this appeal turns on the construction of the cba recall provision.specifically,the sole issue before us is whether the recall provision creates the condition precedent argued by the town,whether it defines an event which must occur before a contract becomes effective or before an obligation to perform arises under the contract.sands ridefilm,cir internal citation omitted applying massachusetts contract law.if,as the town asserts and the district court held,the cba conditions an employee recall right on the written submission,after layoff,of the employee mailing address and telephone number,this case would necessarily come to an end.it is undisputed that clukey did not submit information and,if he failed to meet such a condition precedent,he would never have acquired a right to recall.see id.at holding that an otherwise enforceable contract will be defeated by the of a condition precedent irving town of clinton,me an elementary rule of contract law is that the nonoccurrence of a condition discharges the parties from their duties under the contract.
as the issue before us is thus a matter of contract interpretation,our review of the district court ruling is de novo.see grand wireless,verizon wireless,cir.both parties accept that the contract should be interpreted according to maine law.
b.a condition precedent 
although some courts have required quite emphatic words to create a condition precedent forfeiting or limiting rights,midwest precision,ptm indus,cir,the parties intention to impose such a condition is what governs,see,loyal erectors,hamilton son,me stating that whether a contract provision creates a condition precedent depends upon the intention of the parties,to be determined by considering not only the words of the particular clause,but also the language of the whole contract as well as the nature of the act required and the subject matter to which it relates restatement second of contracts cmt.a no particular form of language is necessary to make an event a condition.
to determine whether the cba recall provision article,section creates a condition precedent,we necessarily must focus closely on its specific language.we thus reproduce here its pertinent sentence 
the affected employee shall file in writing his or her mailing address and telephone number,if any,with the town manager at office and shall be obligated,as a condition of recall rights for said twelve month period,to continue to inform the town manager in writing of any change thereafter.
emphasis added.the significant difference between the two independent clauses in this sentence is immediately apparent.although the second clause expressly conditions the recall right on the submission of updated contact information,the first clause contains no such condition in stating the employee initial obligation to submit his or her address and phone number in writing.
thus,as a matter of plain language,the parties to this agreement appear to have made a conscious choice to include the condition precedent language only in the second independent clause.if they had been so inclined,the condition easily could have been placed at the start of the sentence,advising that,as a condition of recall right,the affected employee shall both submit current address in writing and keep the town updated about changes during the recall period.that is not,however,what the provision says.we construe contracts so as to give force and effect to all of its provisions,and we will avoid an interpretation that renders meaningless any particular provision in the contract.acadia ins.buck const,me internal citation omitted.some significance may be attached,therefore,to the choice of the contracting parties to link the as a condition language only to the affected employee obligation to keep the town up to date on any changes to his or her contact information.
discounting this difference between the two parts of the sentence,the town maintains that the only reasonable interpretation of the provision is that an employee acquires no right to recall unless he or she submits the required contact information in writing subsequent to layoff.the town emphasizes that the provision applies only to affected employees,those who have been laid off and the town posits that the command to submit a mailing address and telephone number thus can be met only by a filing.that timing makes sense,the town argues,because the required filing would serve as notice of the individual continuing interest in employment with the town.
clukey,however,maintains that the differing language in the two clauses reflects an important distinction between the obligations they describe.in his view,the first clause obliges employees only to provide the town with current contact information so as to ensure that they can be recalled when appropriate positions become available.because the town had his address and phone number in his personnel file,clukey asserts that he was not required to make a pro forma of that information.by contrast,the express conditional language prefacing the second clause emphasizes the obligation to keep the town informed of changes in the employee whereabouts if the employee wishes to remain subject to recall.while the second phrase clearly imposes a condition to recall,the first phrase merely announces a need for contact information.if the town already has that information,the employee does not forfeit his valuable right to recall because he did not make a redundant filing of that information.
thus,the parties dispute over the timing of the filing requirement of the recall provision is really a dispute over the purpose of the requirement.the town insists that the provision requires an affected employee to submit his or her contact information only after layoff,when he or she has become affected,because the filing serves as a notice of interest in recall.in clukey view,the purpose of the filing requirement is informational,and the only question is whether the affected employee has submitted the requested information in writing to the town manager at some point so that the town can notify the employee of the recall possibility.it is undisputed that the town had the information necessary to notify clukey of that possibility.
we consider both of these constructions of the language of the cba to be plausible.indeed,clukey interpretation benefits from the contrast in language used in setting out the provision two independent requirements.as we have explained,ordinary contract principles assign meaning to that difference in language.hence,a reasonable person could conclude that the parties to the cba expressly conditioned one obligation,but not the other,because they believed that emphatic language was unnecessary for the initial filing requirement.in other words,the absence of as a condition language for the first obligation may reflect the view of the signatories to the agreement that employers ordinarily possess current contact information for their employees.
moreover,because the first clause does not refer to timing at all,its purpose may be reasonably understood as solely,and not as the town argues to provide notice of the individual interest in continuing employment.an exclusive purpose is reinforced when the sentence under scrutiny is considered in context.while that sentence says nothing about notice,the following sentence directs an employee who is recalled to notify the town within ten days if wishes to accept the position.see supra.the provision thus contains only one plainly stated notice obligation after recall.hence,the provision is readily subject to the reading that clukey proposes as an affected employee,his obligation is to be certain he has at some point submitted his current contact information to the town in writing.
indeed,while no explicit language is required to create a condition precedent,see bucksport inhabitants of brewer,me,me,there are indications that a contractual ambiguity should be reasonably interpreted,where possible,to avoid the forfeiture that would result from finding a condition precedent.see cantillon walker,me the difficulty lies in the construction to be placed upon the particular language used by the testatrix.the rule has been well stated as follows whether there has been a performance or breach of a condition precedent or a condition subsequent depends upon a construction of the condition,and a reasonable construction is to be given to such condition in favor of the beneficiary and against a forfeiture,and such construction is dependent upon the circumstances of each particular case.quoting la rocque martin.
nonetheless,we can not exclude as a matter of law the notification purpose that the town attributes to the filing requirement.although the first clause lacks the emphatic as a condition wording,it does use language shall file in writing that we ordinarily would view as signaling an inflexible obligation to perform.see black law dictionary ed noting that the meaning of shall h as a duty to or is required to is the mandatory sense that drafters typically intend and that courts typically uphold see also webster third new international dictionary ed noting that shall as used in directives express es what is mandatory claudio de león sistema universitario ana méndez,cir noting that it is axiomatic that the word shall has a mandatory connotation.that obligation is imposed on t he affected employee.thus,even absent language expressly articulating a condition precedent,the first clause reasonably may be read to require a formal,submission or of current contact information to provide notice to the town of the employee desire to be recalled 
our discussion thus demonstrates that the purpose of the recall provision initial filing requirement is not apparent from its plain language and,hence,as a matter of language,the timing of that obligation is left ambiguous.we have also demonstrated that reasonable rationales support the competing purpose arguments of the parties.see coastal ventures alsham plaza,llc,me a contractual provision is considered ambiguous if it is reasonably possible to give that provision at least two different meanings.internal quotation marks omitted alte
