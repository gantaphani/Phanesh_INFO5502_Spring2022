this employee retirement income security act erisa dispute reaches us following the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the spx corporation individual account retirement plan spx.the plan participant,thomas gillis,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment and raises two essential objections.first,gillis argues that the district court erred because he was entitled,under the language of the retirement plan,to receive a higher pension payout than the plan administrator granted.second,gillis argues that the district court erred by failing to find that his future accrued pension benefits were cut back without proper notice.because we find neither argument persuasive,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
thomas gillis was a employee of the general signal corporation gsx,and participated in its traditional defined benefits pension plan.while employed by gsx,gillis qualified for the early retirement subsidy offered under the gsx pension plan because he had attained the age of and had at least five years of continuous employment.gsx was acquired by spx corporation in,and former gsx employees,including gillis,were transitioned to the spx pension plan,which ultimately was comprised of three separate cash balance benefit options.
when spx acquired gsx,it initially offered two cash balance pension plans to its employees.the first,the gsx accrued benefit,merely captured the value of the employee benefit under the previous gsx pension plan.this benefit did not allow for any future accruals and is not at issue on appeal.the second,the spx accrued benefit,converted the value of the employee benefit under the previous gsx pension plan into an opening account balance,and then added principal and interest to that account balance as the employee accrued them during the course of his employment with spx.therefore,because both the gsx accrued benefit and the spx accrued benefit had an opening account balance equivalent to the amount already accrued by the employee under the previous gsx pension plan,the two benefits began with the exact same balance,an amount identical to the employee accrued pension under the previous gsx pension plan.importantly,in gillis case,this means that both the gsx accrued benefit and the spx accrued benefit included the early retirement subsidy that gillis had already earned while employed by gsx.
shortly after spx acquired gsx,spx discovered that the two available benefit options could a small of employees who,under the previous gsx plan,had been working toward achieving their early retirement subsidy,but who,at the time the plans merged,had not yet reached age.to address this concern,spx created a third retirement plan option,called the transition benefit.an employee was eligible for the benefit if,by january,he was at least years old and had completed at least five years of continuous service with the company.gillis was among this group of eligible employees in the disclosure form given to employees,spx explained that the purpose of the transition benefit was to provide you with a better benefit if you retire early from spx.the disclosure form also explained that those who had already qualified for an early retirement subsidy before the merger of the plans,like gillis,would receive a higher payout under the regular cash balance account than under the transition benefit because your opening account balance already included the value of your early retirement benefit.
under its pension plan,spx guaranteed that an employee already accrued benefit under the previous gsx pension plan would not be reduced and upon retirement,the plan administrator would calculate an employee potential benefit under each of the three spx plan options,and grant the employee the highest of the three payment amounts.
when gillis elected to retire early,in,at age,the plan administrator calculated his potential payout under each benefit and concluded that the gsx accrued benefit would yield a lump sum payout the spx accrued benefit,a payout and the transition benefit,a payout.therefore,because the spx pension plan guaranteed that employees would receive the highest of the three benefit amounts,spx informed gillis that he was entitled to the lump sum payout under the spx accrued benefit.
gillis appealed the plan administrator calculations,alleging that he would receive the greatest payout under the transition benefit,which he claimed the plan administrator had miscalculated.he asserted that the transition benefit should be calculated by giving him an opening account balance equivalent to the total amount he accrued under the previous gsx pension plan,which included his early retirement subsidy,and then be increased based on accrued interest and credits,plus the additional early retirement subsidy offered by the transition benefit.the plan administrator rejected this calculation because it the early retirement subsidy.
gillis appealed the plan administrator final determination to the district court,arguing primarily that the alleged miscalculation of the transition benefit amounted to an illegal cutback of gillis already accrued benefit,in violation of erisa g,g.further,gillis argued that this illegal cutback amounted to prohibited age discrimination,in violation of erisa b g,b g,because only employees over the age of had earned early retirement subsidies,meaning the alleged improper subtraction of that subsidy,under the transition benefit calculation,affected only those workers over age 
before the district court,both gillis and spx moved for summary judgment on all counts.the court granted spx motion,concluding that spx calculation of gillis pension payout did not violate erisa prohibition on the cutback of previously accrued retirement benefits,because the choice between the gsx accrued benefit and the spx accrued benefit ensured that gillis would receive at least as great a benefit after the merger and amendment as he was entitled to beforehand.because it found no violation of the provision,the district court also rejected gillis claim that the alleged cutback resulted from age discrimination.finally,the district court granted summary judgment to spx as to gillis other claims,and on appeal he does not further pursue these claims.
gillis also put forth a separate claim before the district court,which he now presses on appeal.in a supplemental memorandum,submitted with leave of the district court after the close of the summary judgment record,gillis argued that spx illegally cut back his future accrued benefit without proper notice,in violation of erisa h,h.he asserted that he would have accrued a greater total pension payout under the previous gsx pension plan than he did under any of the three benefits offered by spx after the merger of the plans.to support this allegation,gillis attached to his supplemental memorandum an affidavit from an actuary that purported to show that gillis would have earned a greater pension under the previous gsx plan than he did under any of the three spx benefits.the district court,in its summary judgment decision,did not address this additional argument.gillis now raises it on appeal,while spx vigorously contests both the merits of the claim and whether the issue is properly before this court,given the manner in which gillis presented it to the district court.
