in this action alleging violations of the family and medical leave act of fmla,scott bellone appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of his former employer,the southwick tolland regional school district.he argues,among other things,that the district court overlooked several genuine issues of material fact,misapplied the parties burdens of production,and relied upon inadmissible evidence we disagree and affirm.
facts background 
we recite here only the undisputed facts that are relevant to this appeal,construing those facts in the light most favorable to bellone.see ponte steelcase,cir.bellone has attempted to supplement the record on appeal with certain evidence that he did not present to the district court.as we made clear in a december order,we will decide this appeal on the basis of the record compiled before the district court.see fed.a describing the composition of the record on appeal smith jenkins,cir save for certain exceptions not applicable here,we do not consider arguments or evidence not presented to the district court.
bellone began working for the southwick tolland regional school district in november,as a fourth grade teacher at woodland elementary school in southwick,massachusetts.on march,bellone informed the school district that he needed to take a leave of absence for medical reasons.he provided a note from his physician,aleksandr pugach,stating that he would be unable to work from march,to march.on march,bellone provided a second note from pugach,stating that he would be unable to work from march,to april.on march,the school district sent bellone what it later characterized as an fmla eligibility notice.the letter instructed bellone to fill out a certification form and return it within fifteen days.pugach submitted the completed form on april,representing that bellone was unable to perform the job function of teach ing children for what pugach estimated would be an uncertain period of time on may,the school district notified bellone that the form did not provide enough specific information about his medical condition.on may,bellone gave the school district permission to communicate directly with pugach.for the remainder of the academic year,which ended on june,the school district continued to receive correspondence from pugach stating that bellone was unable to work 
on july,the school district sent bellone what is known as an fmla designation notice,informing him that he had been approved for fmla leave,that the school district had designated his leave period as march,through june,that he had exhausted his fmla entitlement during that time,and,therefore,that the school district was requiring that bellone physician indicate medical opinion regarding bellone ability to come back to work for the next school year.the letter also informed bellone that,if he was not medically able to return to work,he could apply for an unpaid leave of absence for up to one year,pursuant to the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
the school district did not hear from bellone regarding his ability to return to work until it sent him another letter,on august,informing him that his position remained open and that he had seven days to provide evidence of his fitness for duty in response,the school district received a letter,dated august,from psychologist robert wing,who stated that he could see no psychological reasons why bellone should not return to work at the beginning of the new academic year.
the academic year began on september.on september,the school district sent bellone a letter informing him that he was being placed on paid administrative leave as of the date it received the documentation from robert wing his salary would be at a level for the coming year and he was expected to return to work on september,at which point he would be notified of his teaching assignment.ultimately,the school district assigned bellone to the following position,as described in the affidavit of the school superintendent 
half of bellone workday would be spent as a in the same classroom and grade where he previously taught.the other half of the day would be spent as a teacher of individual students and small groups from the and grades,providing math tutoring and instruction.
the new position provided the same benefits and salary as the fourth grade teaching position bellone had held before he went out on leave 
bellone,who believed the new position to be a demotion,did not report for work on september.he was immediately suspended without pay and then officially terminated in october.he filed this lawsuit in june,alleging that the school district interfered with his fmla rights by failing to provide proper and timely fmla eligibility and designation notices the school district request for a certification interfered with his fmla rights and was retaliatory and the school district actions were retaliatory and caused bellone severe emotional distress.
the school district filed a motion to dismiss bellone complaint,see.b,which the district court converted into a motion for summary judgment,see,because the school district had attached certain exhibits that were outside the pleadings,see.d.bellone filed an opposition and for summary judgment.in january,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the school district.the court concluded,as relevant here,that the school district fmla eligibility and designation notices were indeed both inadequate and untimely,but bellone had failed to demonstrate that he suffered any harm from the lack of notice and the school district request for a medical opinion as to bellone ability to return to work constituted neither interference with his fmla rights nor retaliation bellone southwick tolland reg l sch,d.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
our review is de novo.see mcardle town of pub,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
under the fmla,an eligible employee is guaranteed twelve weeks of unpaid leave during any period for,among other things,a serious medical condition that renders the employee unable to perform his job duties.a d.it is unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided by the fmla.id.a.according to the labor department regulations that accompany the fmla,when an employer acquires knowledge that an employee leave may be for an reason,the employer must notify the employee of the employee eligibility to take fmla leave within five business days,absent extenuating circumstances.b.this is known as an eligibility notice.once the employer has enough information to determine whether the leave is being taken for a n reason,after receiving a certification,the employer must notify the employee whether the leave will be designated and will be counted as fmla leave within five business days absent extenuating circumstances.id.d.this is known as a designation notice.
here,the district court concluded that the march,eligibility notice and the july,designation notice were both untimely,and that the eligibility notice was also inadequate,as it did not contain any of the information required by b and c.bellone,d at.the school district has not challenged those findings,so we accept them as correct for purposes of this appeal.
nor has the school district challenged the validity of the labor department regulations,which provide that an employer failure to follow the fmla notice requirements may constitute an interference with,restraint,or denial of the exercise of an employee fmla rights.e.late or inadequate notices,however,are not actionable unless they harm the employee.see ragsdale wolverine world wide,mcardle,at dube morgan investor servs,app x,cir per curiam.the harm bellone claims is that he could have structured his leave differently in order to preserve some of his fmla entitlement if the school district had given him the proper notice.see ragsdale,at mcardle,at dube,app x at.
we agree with the district court that bellone has demonstrated no genuine dispute of material fact that would support a finding that he suffered harm as a result of the school district late and inadequate notices.the record shows that bellone went out on leave on march,and,from that point through the end of the academic year on june,the school district received regular communications from pugach stating that bellone was medically unable to work.indeed,there is no affirmative evidence that bellone was fit to return to work until august,which is when psychologist robert wing submitted his letter,stating that he saw no psychological reasons why bellone should not return to work at the beginning of the new academic year.once the school district put forward evidence that bellone could not have structured his leave differently,the burden was on bellone to offer definite,competent evidence to rebut the motion.meuser fed.express,cir quoting mesnick,cir see.c.
yet bellone presented no evidence whatsoever to contradict the notes from pugach.he simply made unsupported statements in his amended complaint,which he repeated in his brief opposing the school district summary judgment motion,that,had he known that his leave would count toward his fmla entitlement,he could have preserved some of that leave by modifying his medical treatment,requesting a workplace accommodation or intermittent leave,or returning to work earlier.our case law is clear that,in the summary judgment context,a nonmovant may not rest upon mere allegations in,say,an unverified complaint or lawyer brief,kelly united states,cir,nor upon denials of the movant pleading,but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to each issue upon which he would bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial,sensing outback steakhouse of,llc,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original see also rivera colón mills,cir unsupported allegations and speculation do not demonstrate either entitlement to summary judgment or the existence of a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.bellone did not satisfy that burden,nor did he demonstrate,by affidavit or declaration that,for specified reasons,he could not present facts essential to justify his opposition to the summary judgment motion.d.
bellone burden to present evidence that it would have been medically possible for him to structure his leave differently distinguishes his case from conoshenti public service electric gas,cir,upon which he relies.in conoshenti,as in this case,the defendant employer did not provide the requisite fmla notice.id.at.part of the leave conoshenti had taken was due to a shoulder surgery,which he insisted he could have scheduled differently in order to preserve some of his leave time,had he known about his fmla rights.id.at.the third circuit reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of conoshenti employer,emphasizing that the employer had never asserted that conoshenti could not meet his burden of proving that he could have structured his leave differently and thus did not satisfy its initial burden of pointing to an absence of evidence as to whether conoshenti had been prejudiced.id.at.conoshenti was therefore not required to respond with specific facts establishing a genuine issue with respect to the prejudice requirement.id.here,on the other hand,the school district came forward with affirmative evidence demonstrating that bellone was unable to return to work before the end of the academic year.at that point,it was up to bellone to establish a genuine issue for trial by presenting more than just a bare allegation that he could have done things differently if he had known that his leave would count toward his fmla entitlement.
the district court thus properly treated as undisputed the fact that bellone could not have returned to work before the expiration of his fmla leave.see.e.in short,nothing was lost,nor was any harm suffered,by reason of the alleged violations,mcardle,at,and summary judgment was appropriate with respect to bellone notice claim.
bellone failure of production also dooms his claim that the school district violated the fmla requirement that a covered employee returning from leave be restored to his previous position,a a,or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits,pay,and other terms and conditions of employment,id.a b see also defining the phrase equivalent position.we have held that an employee is not entitled to reinstatement under the fmla if he is unable to return to work until after the expiration of his leave.colburn parker portland,cir see c.the undisputed facts in this case demonstrate that bellone went out on leave on march,and was medically unable to return to work before at least the end of the academic year on june.that was a leave period of about fifteen weeks more than the twelve weeks guaranteed to bellone under the fmla.we therefore need not address whether the new position to which bellone was assigned in the fall of was equivalent to his old one within the meaning of the fmla.see colburn,at.the school district failure to provide timely notice does not salvage bellone reinstatement argument,since he has not demonstrated that he could have returned to work within the fmla period even if the school district had properly notified him of his rights.see sarno douglas elliman gibbons ives,cir assuming that employer did not provide proper notice to employee of his fmla rights but nonetheless finding no right to reinstatement where undisputed evidence demonstrated that employee was unable to return to work at end of leave period.
bellone also claims that the school district did not uniformly apply its certification requirement,see.a,but he has failed to satisfy his summary judgment obligation on this point as well.the school district put forward evidence,in the form of an affidavit from the superintendent of schools,that it consistently requires a certification for any employee returning to work after a serious illness.bellone did not offer any evidence to refute that assertion and thus has not demonstrated the existence of a genuine factual dispute.see sensing,at meuser,at.on appeal,bellone claims that he could not prove the absence of a uniform policy before discovery,but he never raised that argument in opposition to the school district summary judgment motion,as required by federal rule of civil procedure d,so we will not consider it at this stage.see nieves romero united states,cir.
bellone also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court should have analyzed his case pursuant to the fmla special rules for school employees.see.we find that claim forfeited as well,since it was not raised below.see united states nee,cir.in any event,we fail to see how the regulation that bellone cites.a,would change the analysis here.bellone has presented no evidence that he attempted to return to work during the period before the end of the term,id.a ii,or that he was capable of doing so.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm.each party shall bear its own costs.
bellone was represented by counsel before the district court and in his opening brief on appeal.he filed his reply brief pro se.
the school district established this fact by attaching,as an exhibit to its summary judgment motion,the actual form submitted by pugach and by describing pugach representations in an affidavit from the school district superintendent.on appeal,bellone challenges that portion of the affidavit as hearsay.see vazquez lopez rosario,cir evidence that is inadmissible at trial,such as inadmissible hearsay,may not be considered on summary judgment.however,because bellone did not raise any objection to the affidavit below,the district court was free to consider it.see desrosiers hartford life accident ins,cir.in any event,bellone has not challenged the underlying medical record from pugach,which would almost certainly have been admissible,see,even if the statement in the affidavit was not.
the record in this case includes several notes from pugach certifying bellone inability to perform his job duties from march,through may,as well as an affidavit from the superintendent stating that
