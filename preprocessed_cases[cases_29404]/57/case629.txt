as alleged in the complaint,plaintiffs were hired by gte service corporation gte,a business unit of gte corporation now verizon communications,to work in its danvers,massachusetts,office in or around april.although plaintiffs were hired directly by gte,each was told to sign on with one of two independent payroll agencies,fisc or benetemps,who issued plaintiffs paychecks during the entire period of their employment with gte.plaintiffs received no paychecks or benefits from gte during their tenure.in all other respects,plaintiffs were treated like regular,gte employees.in particular,plaintiffs received the same training,performance reviews,and access to gte facilities as other employees were invited to corporate functions,staff meetings,and committee service just as other employees were and were explicitly instructed to identify themselves to outsiders as gte employees rather than as temporary employees.in short,according to the complaint,plaintiffs were thoroughly integrated in gte workforce.
in august,gte terminated parsons employment in preparation for closing the danvers facility.in december,gte terminated edes and lyons employment.on may,plaintiffs made demands for erisa plan benefits on the gte human resources department.gte denied the claims on september,on the ground that plaintiffs had not been employed by gte,and offered plaintiffs no administrative review options.
on october,plaintiffs filed a putative complaint in federal district court against verizon communications,formerly gte corporation,seven named gte erisa benefits plans and their administrators and fiduciaries and gte john doe unknown plans.plaintiffs alleged,on information and belief,that because eligibility to participate in gte erisa plans was expressly limited to employees who were paid directly by a participating business unit,defendants had violated their rights under erisa and state common law.
on february,defendants moved to dismiss each of plaintiffs claims pursuant to.b,arguing,inter alia,that their claims of interference with attainment of participation rights and breach of fiduciary duty were and their state claim preempted.after a hearing on the motion,the court stayed discovery but did not stay automatic disclosure,noting that defendants had yet to disclose the plans actual language.on september,the court issued an order denying defendants motion to dismiss without prejudice to its renewal once the precise language of the terms of eligibility is produced.in october,defendants submitted an attorney declaration with exhibits stating that they had disclosed plan documents to plaintiffs in may and june.after the court permitted plaintiffs to take a deposition to determine when the relevant eligibility criteria had been included in gte erisa plans,defendants filed a memorandum in further support of their motion to dismiss in january.plaintiffs filed a memorandum in further opposition to the motion

entitlement to benefits under the plans 
plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly dismissed their claim of entitlement to plan benefits under erisa a b,a b,for lack of standing.see,abraham exxon,cir whether an employee has standing as a participant depends,not on whether he is actually entitled to benefits,but on whether he has a colorable claim that he will prevail in a suit for benefits.the district court made no reference in its decision to standing.rather,based on the plan documents submitted by defendants,the court concluded that by the terms of the plans,p laintiffs are not entitled to benefits because they were not paid directly by gte,but instead were paid by temporary payroll agencies.edes,d at footnote omitted 
plaintiffs also insist that they may proceed with their claim because they were employees of gte by virtue of their full integrat ion in gte workforce.whether or not this is so,the district court correctly concluded that t he fact that p laintiffs may be common law employees is not by itself enough to state a valid claim for benefits under erisa.edes,d at.in an opinion published several months after the district court rendered its decision,a panel of this circuit reached the same conclusion,stating that a plaintiff may have a plausible argument that he was a common law employee,but it is the language of the plan,not common law status,that controls.kolling am.power conversion,cir.
plaintiffs own complaint alleges,and the plan documents submitted by defendants confirm,that gte erisa plans explicitly exclude from participation employees who were not paid directly by gte,without regard for their employment status plaintiffs further allege that they were in fact not paid directly by gte,but by payroll agencies.because they can prove no set of facts to support their claim for benefits under the erisa plans,rockwell,at,the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs claim under erisa a b.
interference with attainment of plan participation rights 
plaintiffs allege that defendants misclassified them as employees for the purpose of interfering with their attainment of plan participation rights in violation of erisa.that statute provides,in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for any person to discharge,fine,suspend,expel,discipline,or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under erisa or an erisa plan,or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled.
the district court held that plaintiffs could not state a claim for relief under this provision for two independent reasons.first,an employer may hire employees under terms that render them ineligible to receive benefits given to other employees without violating erisa.edes,d at.plaintiffs argue that the district court analysis ignored the language in erisa prohibiting employers from discriminating against a participant or beneficiary for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under an erisa plan.emphasis added.plaintiffs argue that whether or not defendants permissibly excluded them from plan eligibility at the time they were hired as employees,defendants failed to move them to the gte payroll after they were hired,for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of participation rights to which they should have become entitled 
we need not decide the circumstances,if any,under which employees who are ineligible for erisa benefits at the time of hiring may state a claim under erisa,based on a defendant failure to reclassify them,because the district court properly dismissed the claim on the alternate ground that it was.see edes,d at.the district court determined the applicable statute of limitations by reference to state law.see muldoon muldoon sons,cir per curiam because congress did not provide a statute of limitations in the erisa statute for section claims,federal courts must apply the limitations period of the cause of action most analogous to the federal claim.the claimed wrong here is the misclassification of plaintiffs in april when they went on the payroll of the agency rather than the company.consequently,the district court properly applied massachusetts statute of limitations for torts.laws ch,to plaintiffs claim under erisa.
the district court next applied federal law to determine the date on which plaintiffs claim accrued and started the clock on the statute of limitations.tolle carroll touch,cir federal common law determines date of accrual of cause of action under erisa cal.retail clerks unions jumbo markets,cir federal common law determines when cause of action by trust funds to recover employer contribution accrues under erisa.for a claim under erisa,it is the challenged employment decision and the participant discovery of this decision that dictates accrual of plaintiffs cause of action.tolle,at.applying this rule in light of plaintiffs allegation that they were directed to sign on with payroll agencies at their time of hire,the district court concluded that t he statute of limitations clock began on p laintiffs claim when p laintiffs were hired in april and classified as employees of a temporary payroll agency instead of as regular employees of gte.edes,d at.
plaintiffs argue that even if they discovered the factual basis for their claim as early as april,their complaint alleges a continuing tort that tolled the statute of limitations until they received their last paychecks under this theory,in plaintiffs words,e very time plaintiffs received a paycheck from a payroll company while still being denied benefits under any of the gte erisa plans they were incurring new injury,as a result of defendants continuing wrongful behavior.as authority for this argument,plaintiffs cite doe town of blandford,a case in which a claimant under the massachusetts tort claims act alleged the continuing torts of negligent supervision and failure to fire,which tolled the time period for presentment of her claim to an executive officer of a public employer as required by statute.
even assuming for the sake of argument that massachusetts continuing tort doctrine is applicable to a federal claim under erisa an issue we do not decide plaintiffs have not alleged a continuing tort.while plaintiffs may have felt the ongoing effects of their ineligibility for erisa benefits every time they received a paycheck from a payroll agency,plaintiffs own allegations make clear that defendants wrongful conduct,if any,involved the misclassification of plaintiffs as employees at their time of hire in april.see berry allstate ins,d,allstate refusal to allow plaintiffs to participate in its benefit plans was the single act that served as the basis for the alleged wrongful discrimination,aff.cir.the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs erisa claim as 
breaches of fiduciary duty 
plaintiffs allege that the defendant plan fiduciaries breached their fiduciary duties in violation of erisa,by misclassifying plaintiffs as employees ineligible to participate in gte erisa plans and creating a structural defect in the design of the plans through the use of arbitrary eligibility criteria to exclude a disproportionate number of employees from plan participation in violation of erisa minimum participation standards the district court held that plaintiffs claims were barred by the erisa statute of limitations applicable to breaches of fiduciary duty.erisa,prohibits commencement of such claims after the earlier of 
six years after a the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation,or b in the case of an omission,the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation,or 
three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation 
emphasis added pursuant to,erisa provides that claims based on a breach of fiduciary duty must be brought within six years of the breach or the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation,and within three years of the date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach.watson deaconess waltham,cir.the district court found plaintiffs claim barred by the statute of limitations because p laintiffs did have actual knowledge of their status in,yet failed to commence their case until.edes,d,
plaintiffs argue on appeal that actual knowledge of a breach or violation within the meaning of erisa requires a showing that plaintiffs actually knew not only of the events that occurred which constitute the breach or violation but also that those events supported a claim of breach of fiduciary duty or violation under erisa.int l union of,salaried,mach.furniture workers murata erie,cir see also maher strachan shipping,cir applying third circuit test.the issue of defining actual knowledge has vexed the circuits.the briefing purports to divine a clear circuit split.on that view,as noted,the third and fifth circuits follow a rule that for an erisa claim to accrue,a plaintiff must know of not only all the facts and events constituting the fiduciary breach,but also that those events supported a claim of breach of fiduciary duty or violation under erisa.murata,at see also maher,at quoting murata.by contrast,the sixth,seventh,ninth,and eleventh circuits are said to have a hard and fast rule that a plaintiff need only have had knowledge of the facts or transaction that constituted the alleged violation and not knowledge that those facts support a legal start the limitation period running.martin consultants adm rs,cir see also wright heyne,cir blanton anzalone,cir.accord brock nellis,cir.the second and circuits,on this scale,have hybrid analyses.see caputo pfizer,cir plaintiff need have knowledge of all material facts necessary to understand that an erisa fiduciary has breached his or her duty,but need not have knowledge of the relevant law citing maher,at gluck unisys,cir and blanton,at fink sav.trust,the disclosure of a transaction that is not inherently a statutory breach of fiduciary duty can not communicate the existence of an underlying breach.
we think the differences are exaggerated,and the positions of the circuits,as evidenced by how they apply the rules to the facts,are much more nuanced.further,even if the language set forth above were an accurate depiction,we would find ourselves in the middle.
settling on a description of the appropriate standard to apply is a complex venture.prior to,erisa also contained a constructive knowledge provision,stating that the limitations period began when a plaintiff could reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge from certain reports filed with the secretary of labor.martin,at citing earlier version and legislative history.given this explicit statutory alteration,as the seventh circuit has recognized,actual knowledge must be distinguished from constructive knowledge in applying erisa.id.at.yet i t is difficult to say in the abstract precisely what constitutes actual knowledge of a breach or violation.id.where the alleged breach arises out of a financial transaction involving erisa plan funds,determining where the distinction between actual and constructive knowledge lies in a particular case may depend on the level of generality employed in characterizing the transaction at issue,which may depend,in turn,on an examination of the complexity of the underlying factual transaction,the complexity of the legal claim and the egregiousness of the alleged violation.id.
we agree with the observation that the primary purpose of a statute of limitations is to prevent plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights and to prohibit the prosecutio
