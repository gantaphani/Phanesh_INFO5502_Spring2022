appellant paul senra senra,a former probationary public employee of the town of smithfield,rhode island town,alleges that he received insufficient procedural due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment in relation to the termination of his employment,and additionally that the town violated art.iii,of the rhode island constitution,and the rhode island whistleblowers protection act,laws,when it fired him.the district court granted summary judgment on all counts against senra.for the reasons given below,after de novo review,we affirm.
facts background 
appellant senra was hired by the town as a deputy building official on march.the town hired senra on a probationary basis,and on the condition that senra obtain his building official certification certification from the state of rhode island within one year of being hired.to obtain the certification,senra had to pass two building code examinations.
senra status as a probationary employee initially lasted six months.when that time had elapsed and senra had not obtained the required certification,the town manager extended senra probation for three months.after that time elapsed,and senra still had not obtained the certification,the town manager extended senra probation for another three months.by january,it was clear to town administrators that senra was unlikely to obtain the certification within a year of his hiring date.on january,the town manager,the town building official and the town human resources director met with senra to address the problem.at that meeting,senra agreed to accept a timetable for his passing the required examinations,and the town manager agreed to give senra until march,to obtain the certification 
senra timetable required him to pass the first examination by april,and to pass the second by august.senra did not meet these requirements.by april,he had not signed up to take the first examination.he took but failed the first examination on april,and after that took no more tests.despite this,the town extended senra probationary status for two months in june,and then again for two months in september.
one week before his probationary status was set to expire,the town manager on november,met with senra and advised senra that he was going to be terminated.the town placed senra on administrative leave until november,to give him time to consult with a union representative.on that date,senra and the union business agent appeared at a hearing before the town manager.both senra and the agent spoke at the meeting.at the conclusion of the meeting,the town manager terminated senra.
senra challenged his termination by filing a grievance through his union against the town.an arbitrator heard this grievance on january,and issued a decision on april,finding that the town did not have just cause to terminate senra on november,only to the extent that it did not allow him until march,to obtain the certification,as had been previously agreed by the town manager and senra.accordingly,the arbitrator reinstated senra for that equivalent time.at the end of his reinstatement,senra had still not obtained the certification and was again terminated.
after senra requested arbitration but prior to the arbitration hearing,senra filed a complaint in the rhode island superior court on january,against the town,its town manager,its building official,and its human resources director collectively,defendants.on february,the defendants removed the case to federal court.senra,in his complaint and again on appeal,alleged that he was improperly terminated because he received constitutionally inadequate procedural due process with respect to his termination he was entitled to hold his position during good behavior and so qualified,const.art.iii,and that he was protected from termination under the rhode island whistleblowers protection act,laws specifically on this third point,senra alleged that he was fired not because of his failure to obtain the certification,but because he had uncovered allegedly illegal behavior by the town building official.
approximately one year after the case was removed,and after seven months of discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.senra then moved for partial summary judgment on his procedural due process and state constitutional claims.after a hearing,a district judge,ruling from the bench,granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on all counts and denied senra motion.senra now appeals these rulings and further argues that the district court erred by exercising supplemental jurisdiction over his state claims after dismissing senra only federal claim.

senra makes two arguments as to why he has not received constitutionally adequate procedural due process.first,senra argues that the arbitration was not a procedurally adequate mechanism because the arbitrator could not address senra constitutional and statutory claims.second,senra argues that he was due a mandated hearing before the town counsel.
to maintain a procedural due process claim,a plaintiff must allege that the plaintiff was deprived of constitutionally protected property because of defendants actions,and that the deprivation occurred without due process of law.rumford,city of east providence,cir.to assert such a claim arising out of the termination of his employment,a public employee must first demonstrate that he has a reasonable expectation,arising out of a statute,policy,rule,or contract,that he will continue to be employed.wojcik.state lottery comm n,cir citing perkins bd.of dirs.of sch.admin.dist,cir.we will assume that this showing has been made for the purposes of resolving the due process claim 
the employee must also demonstrate that he was deprived of that property interest without the minimum amount of process that was due under the constitution including some kind of hearing and some pretermination opportunity to respond.id.quoting cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d see also mard town of amherst,cir.and proceedings are not evaluated for constitutional adequacy in isolation from each other a reviewing court studies the totality of the process received in light of the factual record to determine if the procedural due process was sufficient.see loudermill,at noting that the existence of procedures is relevant to the necessary scope of pretermination procedures wojcik,at considering both and procedures when evaluating whether plaintiff was provided with constitutionally adequate procedural safeguards rumford,at considering whether rhode island law provide s constitutionally adequate predeprivation and postdeprivation remedies see also hadfield mcdonough,cir finding that a remedy was sufficient to address any pre deprivation of process caused by random and unauthorized conduct by the due process defendants cronin town of amesbury,cir same.
here,senra challenges only the constitutional adequacy of the hearing,arguing that a defect there would render inadequate the entire procedural due process he received.we find senra attack on his arbitration to be without merit.but even so,if senra had raised a valid defect in his hearing,we would look to the entire proceedings to determine if the procedural due process he received was sufficient.
as an initial matter,we have previously indicated that an arbitration hearing can be an appropriate mechanism to conduct a hearing.wojcik,at.however,senra argues here that the defect in his arbitration was that the arbitrator could not resolve senra allegations that he enjoyed protections afforded by the rhode island constitution and the whistleblower statute 
a termination proceeding does not need to address all possible claims that an employee may bring against his former employer to satisfy the constitution procedural due process requirements.writing about proceedings,we have observed that a termination hearing is not a court of law.chmielinski massachusetts.cir.that observation holds true for hearings,which may be limited in scope to address the asserted basis for an employee termination.here,the town asserted an objective basis for terminating senra,which is that senra repeatedly failed to obtain the required certification.procedural due process is satisfied where senra was given a meaningful opportunity to respond to the town explanation for his termination.id.
even if the arbitrator could not or did not consider whether the town had violated the rhode island constitution or the whistleblower statute in firing senra,a arbitration only need address the asserted basis for the employee termination and,if the opportunity had not already been provided prior to termination,give the employee the ability to provide his side of the story to a decision maker.id.noting the requirements that a hearing provide notice,an explanation of the evidence and an opportunity to respond.here,senra enjoyed a full arbitration hearing where he was represented by counsel and was permitted to put on evidence before a neutral arbiter.senra could further seek a remedy for the alleged statutory and constitutional violations in court,and in fact here he did so by filing the present suit even before the arbitration began.gonzález droz gonzález colón,cir observing that a lthough the plaintiff implies that he would have challenged the constitutionality of the regulation at the hearing before the board of medical examiners,that is a question for adjudication by the courts.
senra further argues that his procedural due process rights would have been satisfied had a hearing been held before the town counsel,allegedly pursuant to the town charter and bylaws however,the town counsel surely had no more power than the arbitrator to address senra statutory and constitutional claims.at oral argument,senra counsel suggested that the difference in decision makers itself was the source of the procedural violation,but on this record we see no reason why this would be so.senra also did not explain how the remedies that could have been granted by the town counsel or by the arbitrator were different.here in fact,we observe that after the district court had granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,the arbitrator issued his decision reinstating senra into his job for over four months and that the arbitrator considered but declined to award back pay or benefits.
but more importantly,the federal due process clause does not incorporate the particular procedural structures enacted by state or local governments.chmielinski,at quoting torres rosado rotger sabat,cir.claims involving state procedural guarantees that are above and beyond constitutional due process requirements,are not properly before us.baker,cir.such claims,should be pursued,if at all,under state law.torres rosado,at loudermill,at observing that once it is determined that the due process clause applies,the question remains what process is due.the answer to that question is not to be found in a state statute.
here we review in toto whether the procedural due process actually received by senra was adequate using a constitutional benchmark.for the reasons given above,we conclude that the procedural due process given to senra,which included a hearing with notice and union representation at the hearing,where both the representative and senra spoke,and the arbitration proceeding,where senra was represented by counsel and was able to participate and to present evidence to a neutral arbiter,satisfied senra rights to procedural due process.
senra also contends that the district court erred by exercising its discretion to reach and resolve the state law claims after ruling against senra on the sole federal claim.senra argument is that the district court actions violated principles of comity and judicial economy.as described below,we find that the district court acted within its discretion.because we so hold,we then proceed to review de novo the district court disposition of senra state law claims.
a federal court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims that are so related to claims in the action within the court original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.a.t he termination of the foundational federal claim does not divest the district court of power to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,but,rather,sets the stage for an exercise of the court informed discretion.roche john hancock mut.life ins,cir see also delgado pawtucket police,cir finding that t he district court decision here to retain jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state law claims after dismissing the federal claims fell squarely within the realm of its discretion.in deciding whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in such a circumstance,a judge must take into account concerns of comity,judicial economy,convenience,fairness,and the like.roche,at see redondo constr.izquierdo,cir noting that the proper inquiry is pragmatic and quoting roche,at.
here,the parties had been actively litigating the matter for more than a year,and a window for discovery had closed well before the district court considered the state law claims.the court considered the issues of comity and judicial economy,and found that the questions of state law were not so novel as to warrant the added time and expense inherent in a remand to state court.moreover,we note that senra himself in his partial motion for summary judgment sought to have the district court resolve his state constitutional claim.for all of these reasons,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion by retaining jurisdiction over the state law claims.
senra first state law claim is that his employment was protected under the provision of const.art.iii,which states in full 
ethical conduct.the people of the state of rhode island believe that public officials and employees must adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct,respect the public trust and the rights of all persons,be open,accountable and responsive,avoid the appearance of impropriety and not use their position for private gain or advantage.such persons shall hold their positions during good behavior.
the supreme court of rhode island has declared that article,section,announces a laudable principle and not a workable rule of law,and has held that it is not a constitutional provision.lusi,convention ctr,quoting smiler napolitano.under rhode island law,a constitutional provision may be said to be if it supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right given may be enjoyed and protected,or the duty imposed may be enforced and it is not when it merely indicates principles,without laying down rules by means of which those principles may be given the force of law.id.quoting bandoni state.in the lusi case,the supreme court of rhode island,after quoting the entire section above,held that although article,section,articulates ethical principles that public officials and employees should adhere to,those provisions are aspirational in nature,and the constitutional provision does not set forth rules that give those principles the force of law.id.
senra argues that because the lusi court did not explicitly address the last sentence stating that s uch persons shall hold their positions during good behavior,the lusi case holding is properly limited to address only the first portion of that constitutional section.but the lusi opinion recites the entire constitutional provision in its holding and does not make the distinction that senra asks us to make.the intended scope of the lusi case holding is reinforced by a closer examination of the constitutional and statutory provisions on which the lusi opinion relies.
as the lusi court observed,although article,section,does not itself direct the legislature to take further action to give this provision the force of law,article,section,of the rhode island constitution requires the legislature to adopt implementing legislation for a rticle,s ections and and i n accordance with this directive,the legislature enacted a code of ethics,codified in chapter of title.lusi,at.that chapter in turn established an ethics commission,laws,and ethics code that applies to,among others,e mployees of state and local governm
