plaintiffs appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment on their claims that certain amendments to maine public employee retirement system violate the contract and takings clauses of the united states constitution.after careful consideration,we affirm.
facts background 
plaintiffs are the maine association of retirees and the maine state employees association and several individual members of each the district court also certified the following class 
all retired state of maine employees and public school teachers whose final termination of service occurred before june,and who had become eligible to receive service retirement benefits from the maine public employees retirement system no later than that date.
defendants are the board of trustees of the maine public employees retirement system and individual officers and members thereof,named in both their individual and official capacities.plaintiffs allege that their contractual rights were impaired by certain amendments to the maine public employees retirement system mepers that had the effect of decreasing the adjustments colas they otherwise would have received under the law.
the district court provided a thorough review of the legislative history of mepers and its predecessors,see me.ass of retirees bd.of trs.of me.pub.emps.ret,d,and we need not repeat it here to answer the narrow question before us whether plaintiffs have a contractual right to adjustments calculated according to pre law.we confine our recitation to those facts necessary to resolve this particular question.
maine state employees and public school teachers are required to be members of mepers during their employment.tit,and they do not participate in social security.an employee who works the required number of years qualifies,upon retirement,to receive a pension that is calculated by reference to his length of service and compensation.id.
maine public employee retirement system has taken various forms over the several decades after it was first created exclusively for teachers in,but,for our purposes,we can begin in,when colas were first introduced.me,ch.under that provision,retirees were awarded a onetime percentage increase based on the effective date of their retirement allowance,with any future adjustments mirroring adjustments to salaries of active state employees.in,the following provision was added 
effect on accrued benefits.no amendment to this chapter shall cause any reduction in the amount of benefits which would be due to the member based on creditable service,compensation,employee contributions and the provisions of this chapter on the date immediately preceding the effective date of such amendment.
me,ch.the legislature also adopted a provision stating that a member retirement allowance would be determined according to the law in effect on the later of the date of termination of service or january.id.
two years later,the legislature amended the system to reflect that,after a waiting period,all retirees would receive annual,compounding cola increases or decreases,matching the percentage change in the consumer price index cpi,up to a maximum of four percent.me,ch.this amendment also provided that,notwithstanding any cola adjustments,the amount of annual retirement allowance otherwise payable under this chapter shall not be less than the retired member received on the effective date of his retirement or on july,whichever is greater.id.thus,while a negative cpi could,in effect,take back prior cola increases,the allowance could never go below the floor set by the initial base amount.
then,in,the laws governing the retirement system were revised in several ways.first,the provision governing accrued benefits was retitled amendment not to cause reduction in benefit and was slightly modified 
no amendment to this part may cause any reduction in the amount of benefits which would be due to a member based on creditable service,compensation,employee contributions and the provisions of this part on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the amendment.
me,ch,codified as amended at.tit,following the parties and the district court terminology,we will refer to this provision as former section.the provisions covering colas were codified at.tit,without substantive change.the provision specifying the applicable law was retitled law governing benefit determination,and amended to read i f a member final termination of service occurred on or after january,the retirement system law in effect on the date of termination shall govern the member service retirement benefit.id.
in,this court held that maine statutory scheme did not evince an unmistakable intent to create private contractual rights with respect to teachers who had not yet begun receiving pension benefits,and therefore an amendment that reduced their expected pension benefits did not violate the contract clause.parker wakelin,cir.in direct response to this ruling the legislature repealed former section and replaced it with a provision that establishes that certain enumerated protections constitute solemn contractual commitments of the state protected under the contract clauses of the constitution of maine,article i,section and the united states constitution,article i,section,under the terms and conditions set out in subparagraph.me,ch,codified at.tit,b.subparagraph specifies that the contractual commitment attaches when the member satisfies the applicable creditable service requirement.id.b.the enumerated provisions all relate either to the eligibility qualifications for particular benefits or to the computation of those benefits.id.b.among these provisions is subsection of section,which states that the waiting period to begin receiving colas may not be increased.the subsections governing all other aspects of colas are not included on this list.subsection specifies that the commitment set out in subsection applies only to those enumerated provisions,and that a ny provision not specifically identified in subsection may be increased,decreased,otherwise changed or eliminated by the legislature as to any member regardless of whether the member has or has not met any creditable service requirement for eligibility to receive a service retirement benefit.id.finally,subsection provides that,at any time before a member has satisfied the creditable service requirement,the legislature may increase,decrease,otherwise change or eliminate any provisions of this part.id.
in,the legislature passed emergency legislation,entitled an act to protect benefits for state retirees,amending section to provide that,in the event of a negative cpi,the board would set the cola at zero percent rather than decreasing the amount to be paid.me.legis.serv.ch,codified at.tit,a the stated purpose for this amendment was to ensure that the benefits for state retirees are protected.id.
in,the maine legislature amended the statutes governing calculation of colas in two pertinent ways.first,it prohibited cola payments for,and,me.legis.serv.ch,t,subject to conditions that would allow noncumulative cola payments each of those years if sufficient funds remained in the retirement benefit reserve fund id.t.second,it reduced the maximum cola from to,and provided that the adjustment would apply only to the first of the retirement benefit.id.t.while the financial impact of these changes for any individual retiree depends on multiple factors the annual cpi,the amount of the retiree pension benefit,and how many years of payments are made to the retiree or his beneficiary,in general,retirees stand to be paid significantly less as a result of the amendments 
the district court divided its analysis into two parts,focusing first on individuals who retired after the amendment to section.it held that the plain language of section t he retirement system law in effect on the date of termination shall govern the member service retirement benefit.meant that section,rather than former section,applied to them.me.ass of retirees,d at.the district court concluded that those retirees were entitled only to the solemn contractual commitments contained in the current version of section.id.at.because the provi
