this is a case of first impression for this court as to airport security screeners and the relationship between the aviation and transportation security act atsa,stat.codified in scattered sections of,and the rehabilitation act,et.
maura field,administratrix of the estate of her late husband martin field,appeals from the district court dismissal of her suit alleging that the transportation security administration tsa discriminated and retaliated against martin field field on the basis of a disability in violation of the rehabilitation act.tsa determined that field,who developed a diabetic ulcer on the bottom of his foot in,was unable to perform even his adjusted job requirements as a tsa security screener at boston logan international airport because he could not stand for long periods of time and experienced difficulty walking.after field missed several months of work,tsa terminated field employment on november,two years after it had hired him.
brought suit in federal court in massachusetts,alleging discrimination and retaliation under the rehabilitation act,after exhausting administrative remedies.the district court dismissed both claims because it concluded that the atsa precludes a cause of action under the rehabilitation act.field napolitano.we affirm.
the facts,as alleged in the complaint,are as follows.
on november,field began working for tsa as an airport security screener at logan international airport in boston,massachusetts.tsa security screeners are primarily responsible for screening people and property at tsa security checkpoints in federal airports.screeners are expected to meet several conditions of employment,including the ability to walk up to two miles during a shift and stand for prolonged periods of time.screeners are also required to handle,lift,and carry baggage weighing up to seventy pounds.
field suffered from diabetes and several related medical conditions,including recurring diabetic ulcers on the bottom of his feet.these diabetic ulcers required field to wear an air cast and to remain off his feet for extended periods of time.
in april,field was approved for restricted duty to limit the time that he had to stand while he was working due to a diabetic ulcer.he reported to work on most days,but on occasion called in sick because he was unable to walk due to the diabetic ulcer on his foot.in june,field leg became infected and he took approximately six weeks of leave under the family medical leave act.
on july,field faxed a doctor note to tsa management official george barris stating that field was able to return to work with the restriction of getting off of his foot to a sitting position as he feels a need during his shift.field alleges that he also called and faxed barris several times over the following week,but received no response.
on august,field reported for work.he was given certain forms to be completed by his doctor.field immediately went to his doctor office,where his doctor completed and faxed the forms to tsa manager tom brady.that afternoon,brady allegedly informed field that tsa management considered field to be too much of a liability to return to work at that time.field did not return to work.
from august to october,field called in sick nearly every day so that he would not be terminated for not showing up for work.in the meantime,field applied for unemployment benefits.field stopped calling in sick on october,the day that he began to receive unemployment benefits.
on october,barris sent field a memorandum stating 
b ecause of your extended illness or absence,which has not been supported,you are requested to furnish medical evidence which includes a diagnosis and prognosis by october,to cover your absence if absence is due to a cause other than your personal illness,you are required to submit evidence to justify the reason for your absence should you fail to provide acceptable evidence for your current absence by october,your absence will be charged to absence without official leave awol,and necessary corrective action,up to and including removal from the tsa,will be initiated.
alterations in original complaint.field responded to barris that he had reported for work with restrictions in august and had been informed that he would not be allowed to return to work.on october,brady sent field a further request for medical information,stating our records indicate that you continue to call the sick line and to date we have not received any documentation which would authorize you to return to full duty without any restrictions.field did not respond to this request.
on november,tsa terminated field employment,citing excessive absence without leave and failure to follow instructions.
after exhausting administrative remedies,field brought suit in march,alleging both discrimination on the basis of his diabetes and retaliation as a result of engaging in protected eeo activity.the tsa moved to dismiss both claims on the basis that the aviation and transportation act atsa exempts the tsa from compliance with the rehabilitation act and so provides no private cause of action to field for either theory.
the district court granted the tsa motion to dismiss as to both claims.field,slip op.at.as to the discrimination claim,the district court reasoned that the atsa authorizes the tsa to set standards of employment for security screeners such as field n otwithstanding any other provision of law,and that this notwithstanding language signals that the atsa overrides any conflicting provisions of the rehabilitation act.id.at.the district court noted that the seventh and eleventh circuits have also held explicitly that the atsa preempts the rehabilitation act.id.at.because the plaintiff had no cause of action under the rehabilitation act,the retaliation claim also failed.id.

a.the aviation and transportation security act atsa 
congress enacted the atsa immediately after the terrorist attacks of september.congress sought to improve aviation security by effecting fundamental change in the way the united states approaches the task of ensuring the safety and security of the civil air transportation system,at.to that end,congress created a new agency,the tsa,with sweeping responsibility for airport security screening,including setting the qualifications,conditions,and standards of employment for airport security screeners.
congress vested the tsa with the authority to carry out the provisions of the atsa.id.d f congress placed particular emphasis on the administrator singular responsib ility for federal security screening operations for passenger air transportation and intrastate air transportation,directing that t he under secretary shall develop standards for the hiring and retention of security screening personnel.id.e.
congress recognize d that,in order to ensure that federal screeners are able to provide the best security possible,the secretary must be given wide latitude to determine the terms of employment of screeners,at.
this led congress to enact a very specific provision,atsa d,which provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,the under secretary of transportation for security may employ,appoint,discipline,terminate,and fix the compensation,terms,and conditions of employment of federal service for such a number of individuals as the under secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions required by the act.
atsa d,stat.at emphasis added historical and revision notes.
congress regarded screeners as so fundamental to aviation security that it outlined detailed minimum qualifications for the job in a provision containing a second notwithstanding clause.section e a,entitled qualifications for security screeners,states the under secretary shall establish qualification standards for individuals to be hired by the united states as security screening personnel.notwithstanding any provision of law,those standards shall require,at a minimum,an individual to meet several specific qualifications.e a emphasis added.for example,security screeners must receive a satisfactory or better score on a federal security screening personnel selection examination and must demonstrate daily a fitness for duty without any impairment due to illegal drugs,sleep deprivation,medication,or alcohol.id.e a i,e a v.
most pertinently,the enumerated qualifications include detailed physical requirements.section e a iii provides that security screeners must meet,at a minimum,the requirements set forth in f.section f,in turn,contains a third notwithstanding clause which sets forth the following physical requirements 
notwithstanding any provision of law,an individual may not be deployed as a security screener unless that individual shall possess basic aptitudes and physical abilities,including color perception,visual and aural acuity,physical coordination,and motor skills,to the following standards 
screeners performing physical searches or other related operations shall be able to efficiently and thoroughly manipulate and handle such baggage,containers,and other objects subject to security processing.
screeners who perform or metal detector searches of individuals shall have sufficient dexterity and capability to thoroughly conduct those procedures over an individual entire body.
id.f emphasis added.this section lists several additional physical requirements,including the ability to distinguish between colors,hear alarm sounds,and respond in spoken voice.id 
section e a,the qualifications section,also requires that at a minimum a security screener must meet such other qualifications as the under secretary may establish.id.e a.using this authority,tsa has established that all security screeners must be able to handle,lift,and carry baggage weighing up to seventy pounds.yeager chertoff,no,wl,at,see also tsa transportation security officer conditions of employment,ht tp last visited.tsa has explained that a security screener who is medically restricted from lifting or carrying baggage weighing up to pounds is not qualified to perform the essential function of performing security screening of property and baggage at our nation airports.it would be unsafe to the person,to the traveling public,and to other employees to put a person with such a medical restriction in this position.declaration of elizabeth kolmstetter,deputy assistant administrator,office of human capital,transportation security administration,yeager,wl 
the atsa also mandates an annual evaluation of each security screener to ensure continued qualification for the job.f.the statute states that a n individual employed as a security screener may not continue to be employed in that capacity unless the evaluation demonstrates that the individual continues to meet all qualifications and standards required to perform a screening function,and demonstrates the skills necessary to effectively perform such screening functions.id.f.
finally,the statute provides that the under secretary shall also review,and revise as necessary,any standard,rule,or regulation governing the employment of individuals as security screening personnel.id.e.
tsa exemption from suit under the rehabilitation act 
the question before us is whether the atsa precludes a security screener,field,from bringing suit under the federal rehabilitation act et.we conclude that it does.
the tsa takes the position that the atsa excludes security screeners from filing suit in federal court under certain of the federal employment statutes incorporated under title of the united states code,including the age discrimination in employment act,the fair labor standards act,and the rehabilitation act.while consistently taking the position that suit can not be brought under any of these acts as to security screeners,the tsa administrator has,within the tsa itself through management directives,provided certain corollary limited protections,which include some whistleblower protections and certain procedures for preventing and responding to sexual harassment.see tsa management directive may,whistleblower protections for transportation security officers tsa management directive,prevention and elimination of sexual harassment in the workplace 
as to the rehabilitation act,the tsa administrator has issued a management directive providing that employees may request a reasonable accommodation but that employees who fail to meet the statutory requirements for the security screener position are not eligible for such accommodations.see tsa management directive,reasonable accommodation program.pursuant to his statutory authority,the tsa administrator has declined to fully extend the rehabilitation act standards to security screeners because,inter alia,the rehabilitation act standards are not consistent with the physical qualifications that the tsa administrator has established for the screener position.
the plain language of the atsa supports the tsa position.it is well established that,when the statutory language is plain,we must enforce it according to its terms.jimenez quarterman,d.the atsa provides that the tsa administrator may establish and enforce employment qualifications for security screeners n otwithstanding any other provision of law.historical and revision notes.
t he use of such a notwithstanding clause clearly signals the drafter intention that the provisions of the notwithstanding section override conflicting provisions of any other section.cisneros alpine ridge,d.as cisneros observed,a clearer statement is difficult to imagine.id.alteration in original quoting liberty.united states,internal quotation marks omitted.the law of this circuit follows cisneros.see united states hyde,cir citing cisneros for the holding that the language n otwithstanding any other federal law in the mandatory victims restitution act is an unambiguous indication that the statute overrides conflicting provisions in the federal bankruptcy code.
moreover,the atsa enumerates specific physical qualifications for screeners,requires that screeners meet any such other physical qualifications as the tsa administrator may establish,and requires the tsa to conduct annual evaluations to ensure conformity with such qualifications.e f.thus,under the atsa,tsa can not retain as security screeners individuals who are physically incapable of distinguishing between colors,hearing alarms,handling up to pounds of baggage,or conducting a.see id.
allowing security screeners to bring suit under the rehabilitation act would be inconsistent with these statutory mandates in several respects.first,these specific atsa requirements as to security screeners and the assignment of qualifications to the tsa administrator displace the broader and more general standards of the rehabilitation act.compare.e f,with.second,these provisions preclude of tsa decisions as to implementing the criteria congress has established and the discretion as to employment decisions given to tsa.third,in combination with the notwithstanding clauses,these provisions evidence a clear intent to free tsa from the costs and burdens of litigation in federal court over such decisions.
every circuit to address the issue has agreed that the language of the atsa plainly precludes security screeners from bringing suit under certain of the federal employment statutes incorporated under title of the united states code,including the rehabilitation act.see,joren napolitano,cir,reh g en banc denied.lexis cir,cert.denied,wl,we now join every other circuit to have considered the question and conclude that the plain language of the atsa preempts application of the rehabilitation act to security screeners.castro sec y of homeland,cir the plain language of the atsa indicates that tsa need not take the requirements of the rehabilitation act into account when formulating hiring standards for screeners.conyers merit.prot,section d of the atsa exempts tsa from laws that otherwise would apply to screener positions.see also conyers rossides,cir holding that the tsa administrator decision not to utilize the federal aviation administration personnel management system in deciding whom to employ or appoin
