morales conflict of interest theory is premised on a mistaken assumption.as mcs points out,the plan explains that it is funded by contributions from participating companies,and in this case it is warner lambert.the contributions are held in a trust fund for the benefit of plan participants and beneficiaries.mcs administers claims under the plan but does not insure the plan.successful claims are paid from the trust fund and not by mcs.therefore,morales inherent conflict of interest theory is not supported by the record,and he showed no other reason to support his request for discovery.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for leave to amend and his request for discovery.
