petitioner heffernan was a police officer working in the office of paterson,new jersey chief of police.both the chief of police and heffernan supervisor had been appointed by paterson incumbent mayor,who was running for against lawrence spagnola,a good friend of heffernan.heffernan was not involved in spagnola campaign in any capacity.as a favor to his bedridden mother,heffernan agreed to pick up and deliver to her a spagnola campaign yard sign.other police officers observed heffernan speaking to staff at a spagnola distribution point while holding the yard sign.word quickly spread throughout the force.the next day,heffernan supervisors demoted him from detective to patrol officer as punishment for his overt involvement in spagnola campaign.heffernan filed suit,claiming that the police chief and the other respondents had demoted him because,in their mistaken view,he had engaged in conduct that constituted protected speech.they had thereby depriv ed him of a right secured by the constitution.the district court,however,found that heffernan had not been deprived of any constitutionally protected right because he had not engaged in any first amendment conduct.affirming,the third circuit concluded that heffernan claim was actionable under only if his employer action was prompted by heffernan actual,rather than his perceived,exercise of his rights.
when an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in protected political activity,the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action under the first amendment and even if,as here,the employer actions are based on a factual mistake about the employee behavior.to answer the question whether an official factual mistake makes a critical legal difference,the court assumes that the activities that heffernan supervisors mistakenly thought he had engaged in are of a kind that they can not constitutionally prohibit or punish.section does not say whether the right protected primarily focuses on the employee actual activity or on the supervisor motive.neither does precedent directly answer the question.in connick myers,garcetti ceballos,and pickering board of ed.of township high school dist,will,there were no factual mistakes the only question was whether the undisputed reason for the adverse action was in fact protected by the first amendment.however,in waters churchill,a government employer adverse action was based on a mistaken belief that an employee had not engaged in protected speech.there,this court determined that the employer motive,and particularly the facts as the employer reasonably understood them,mattered in determining that the employer had not violated the first amendment.the government motive likewise matters here,where respondents demoted heffernan on the mistaken belief that he had engaged in protected speech.a rule of law finding liability in these circumstances tracks the first amendment language,which focuses upon the government activity.moreover,the constitutional harm discouraging employees from engaging in protected speech or association is the same whether or not the employer action rests upon a factual mistake.finally,a rule of law imposing liability despite the employer factual mistake is not likely to impose significant extra costs upon the employer,for the employee bears the burden of proving an improper employer motive.
for the purposes of this opinion,the court has assumed that heffernan employer demoted him out of an improper motive.however,the lower courts should decide in the first instance whether respondents may have acted under a neutral policy prohibiting police officers from overt involvement in any political campaign and whether such a policy,if it exists,complies with constitutional standards.

jeffrey heffernan,petitioner city of paterson,new jersey,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the first amendment generally prohibits government officials from dismissing or demoting an employee because of the employee engagement in constitutionally protected political activity.see elrod burns,branti finkel,but civil service comm letter carriers.in this case a government official demoted an employee because the official believed,but incorrectly believed,that the employee had supported a particular candidate for mayor.the question is whether the official factual mistake makes a critical legal difference.even though the employee had not in fact engaged in protected political activity,did his demotion deprive him of a right secured by the constitution we hold that it did.
to decide the legal question presented,we assume the following,somewhat simplified,version of the facts in,jeffrey heffernan,the petitioner,was a police officer in paterson,new jersey.he worked in the office of the chief of police,james wittig.at that time,the mayor of paterson,jose torres,was running for reelection against lawrence spagnola.torres had appointed to their current positions both chief wittig and a subordinate who directly supervised heffernan.heffernan was a good friend of spagnola.
during the campaign,heffernan mother,who was bedridden,asked heffernan to drive downtown and pick up a large spagnola sign.she wanted to replace a smaller spagnola sign,which had been stolen from her front yard.heffernan went to a spagnola distribution point and picked up the sign.while there,he spoke for a time to spagnola campaign manager and staff.other members of the police force saw him,sign in hand,talking to campaign workers.word quickly spread throughout the force.
the next day,heffernan supervisors demoted heffernan from detective to patrol officer and assigned him to a walking post.in this way they punished heffernan for what they thought was his overt involvement in spagnola campaign.in fact,heffernan was not involved in the campaign but had picked up the sign simply to help his mother.heffernan supervisors had made a factual mistake.
heffernan subsequently filed this lawsuit in federal court.he claimed that chief wittig and the other respondents had demoted him because he had engaged in conduct that on their mistaken view of the facts constituted protected speech.they had thereby depriv ed him of a right secured by the constitution.stat.
the district court found that heffernan had not engaged in any first amendment conduct,supp,nj and,for that reason,the respondents had not deprived him of any constitutionally protected right.the court of appeals for the third circuit affirmed.it wrote that a retaliation claim is actionable under only where the adverse action at issue was prompted by an employee actual,rather than perceived,exercise of constitutional rights.citing ambrose robinson,emphasis added.heffernan filed a petition for certiorari.we agreed to decide whether the third circuit legal view was correct.compare,at case below,with dye office of racing comm n,similar factual mistake does not affect the validity of the government employee claim.
with a few exceptions,the constitution prohibits a government employer from discharging or demoting an employee because the employee supports a particular political candidate.see elrod burns,supra branti finkel,supra.the basic constitutional requirement reflects the first amendment hostility to government action that prescribe s what shall be orthodox in politics.west virginia bd.of ed.barnette.the exceptions take account of practical realities such as the need for efficiency and effective ness in government service.waters churchill,see also civil service comm n,supra,at neutral and appropriately limited policy may prohibit government employees from engaging in partisan activity,and branti,supra,at political affiliation requirement permissible where affiliation is an appropriate requirement for effective performance of the public office involved 
in order to answer the question presented,we assume that the exceptions do not apply here.but see infra,at.we assume that the activities that heffernan supervisors thought he had engaged in are of a kind that they can not constitutionally prohibit or punish,see rutan republican party of,joining,working for or contributing to the political party and candidates of their own choice but that the supervisors were mistaken about the facts.heffernan had not engaged in those protected activities.does heffernan constitutional case consequently fail 
the text of the relevant statute does not answer the question.the statute authorizes a lawsuit by a person depriv ed of a right secured by the constitution.but in this context,what precisely is that right is it a right that primarily focuses upon the employee actual activity or a right that primarily focuses upon the supervisor motive,insofar as that motive turns on what the supervisor believes that activity to be the text does not say.
neither does precedent directly answer the question.in some cases we have used language that suggests the right at issue concerns the employee actual activity.in connick myers,for example,we said that a court should first determine whether the plaintiff spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,at.we added that,if the employee has not engaged in what can be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern,it is unnecessary for us to scrutinize the reasons for her discharge.at.we made somewhat similar statements in garcetti ceballos,and pickering board of ed.of township high school dist,will.
these cases,however,did not present the kind of question at issue here.in connick,for example,no factual mistake was at issue.the court assumed that both the employer and the employee were at every stage in agreement about the underlying facts that the employer dismissed the employee because of her having circulated within the office a document that criticized how the office was being run that she had in fact circulated.the question was whether the circulation of that document amounted to constitutionally protected speech.if not,the court need go no further.
neither was any factual mistake at issue in pickering.the court assumed that both the employer a school board and the employee understood the cause for dismissal,namely,a petition that the employee had indeed circulated criticizing his employer practices.the question concerned whether the petition was protected speech.garcetti is substantially similar.in each of these cases,the only way to show that the employer motive was unconstitutional was to prove that the controversial statement or activity in each case the undisputed reason for the firing was in fact protected by the first amendment.
waters churchill,is more to the point.in that case the court did consider the consequences of an employer mistake.the employer wrongly,though reasonably,believed that the employee had spoken only on personal matters not of public concern,and the employer dismissed the employee for having engaged in that unprotected speech.the employee,however,had in fact used words that did not amount to personal gossip as the employer believed but which focused on matters of public concern.the court asked whether,and how,the employer factual mistake mattered.
the court held that,as long as the employer had reasonably believed that the employee conversation had involved personal matters,not matters of public concern,and had dismissed the employee because of that mistaken belief,the dismissal did not violate the first amendment,at.in a word,it was the employer motive,and in particular the facts as the employer reasonably understood them,that mattered.
in waters,the employer reasonably but mistakenly thought that the employee had not engaged in protected speech.here the employer mistakenly thought that the employee had engaged in protected speech.if the employer motive and in particular the facts as the employer reasonably understood them is what mattered in waters,why is the same not true here after all,in the law,what is sauce for the goose is normally sauce for the gander.
we conclude that,as in waters,the government reason for demoting heffernan is what counts here.when an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in political activity that the first amendment protects,the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action under the first amendment and even if,as here,the employer makes a factual mistake about the employee behavior.
we note that a rule of law finding liability in these circumstances tracks the language of the first more closely than would a contrary rule.unlike,say,the fourth amendment,which begins by speaking of the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,the first amendment begins by focusing upon the activity of the government.it says that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.the government acted upon a constitutionally harmful policy whether heffernan did or did not in fact engage in political activity.that which stands for a law of congress,namely,the police department reason for taking action,abridge s the freedom of speech of employees aware of the policy.and heffernan was directly harmed,namely,demoted,through application of that policy.
we also consider relevant the constitutional implications of a rule that imposes liability.the constitutional harm at issue in the ordinary case consists in large part of discouraging employees both the employee discharged or demoted and his or her colleagues from engaging in protected activities.the discharge of one tells the others that they engage in protected activity at their peril.see,elrod,at retaliatory employment action against one employee unquestionably inhibits protected belief and association of all employees.hence,we do not require plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to prove that they,or other employees,have been coerced into changing,either actually or ostensibly,their political allegiance.branti,at.the employer factual mistake does not diminish the risk of causing precisely that same harm.neither,for that matter,is that harm diminished where an employer announces a policy of demoting those who,say,help a particular candidate in the mayoral race,and all employees including heffernan,fearful of demotion,refrain from providing any such help.gooding wilson,explaining that overbreadth doctrine is necessary because persons whose expression is constitutionally protected may well refrain from exercising their rights for fear of criminal sanctions the upshot is that a discharge or demotion based upon an employer belief that the employee has engaged in protected activity can cause the same kind,and degree,of constitutional harm whether that belief does or does not rest upon a factual mistake.
finally,we note that,contrary to respondents,a rule of law that imposes liability despite the employer factual mistake will not normally impose significant extra costs upon the employer.to win,the employee must prove an improper employer motive.in a case like this one,the employee will,if anything,find it more difficult to prove that motive,for the employee will have to point to more than his own conduct to show an employer intent to discharge or to demote him for engaging in what the employer mistakenly believes to have been different and protected activities.we concede that,for that very reason,it may be more complicated and costly for the employee to prove his case.but an employee bringing suit will ordinarily shoulder that more complicated burden voluntarily in order to recover the damages he seeks.
we now relax an assumption underlying our decision.we have assumed that the policy that heffernan employers implemented violated the constitution.supra,at.there is some evidence in the rec
