paul campagna campagna,an employee of the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep and septic system inspector,claims that six dep subjected him to a retaliatory administrative proceeding that deprived him of his constitutional rights to petition the government for redress of grievances under the first amendment and to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment.finding that campagna failed to state a claim for relief under,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss campagna federal claims under.b and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
we cull the relevant facts from campagna amended complaint,taking them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.campagna began working for the dep in as an environmental engineer,and was promoted soon thereafter.he unsuccessfully sought a further promotion,while candidates were hired for positions at the level sought by campagna who were in his view less qualified,but more politically connected.frustrated by his situation,campagna left the dep in for a position with the federal government.as soon as he left,the dep announced a position for which campagna was qualified.he immediately applied for the position,but defendant david howland,the dep employee responsible for filling the position,refused to hire him.
campagna brought suit in state court,claiming that he was entitled to preferential hiring because of his status as a veteran of the vietnam war.the court agreed,and ordered the dep to place him in the position unless a better qualified candidate who was also a veteran applied for the job.the dep appealed,contending that campagna was not qualified for the position as part of a settlement of the dispute,campagna ultimately accepted a different position that was less desirable.
campagna continued working for the dep without incident for more than two years.during this period,campagna also ran a private business designing and monitoring septic systems.in april,campagna was hired to upgrade a septic system of a home in westfield,massachusetts that had failed an inspection conducted by another inspector,identified in the pleadings as lally lally.lally had concluded that the system was installed too close to the groundwater and that the tank had an unsealed weep hole,a small hole allowing drainage of any water that accumulates in the tank prior to installation.campagna inspected the system and concluded that lally was incorrect in both respects.campagna advised westfield board of health to reevaluate the system.the board notified the dep of the discrepancy,and on october,defendant cabral,a dep employee,reinspected the site,accompanied by inspector david recoulee recoulee and others.
cabral evaluated the soil in a deep inspection hole and found evidence of a high groundwater level of inches like lally,cabral concluded that the system had been installed too close to the groundwater.cabral instructed recoulee to fail the system.recoulee did not make any independent evaluation of the average height of high groundwater cabral also concluded that campagna determination that the weep hole had been adequately sealed was invalid because he had not emptied the tank to reach this finding.cabral initiated an administrative proceeding or enforcement action against campagna without first sending the plaintiff a letter of non compliance,charging him with two willful violations of state regulations commonly known as title for inaccurately estimating the groundwater level and failing to complete a required form.
also in october although the precise date is not set forth in the amended complaint,the dep brought an enforcement action against another inspector,timothy maginnis maginnis.like campagna,maginnis was fined without first receiving a notice of.campagna actively supported maginnis subsequent appeal.this support included a march letter from campagna to maginnis attorney exonerating maginnis.
on august,campagna was fined for the violations that were the subject of the october reinspection.campagna appealed,and on november,an administrative judge reduced the fine to.according to the amended complaint,the judge found that,except for the minor violation of failing to note the owner explanation regarding the weep hole,the accusations against campagna were unfounded.the judge also found that campagna had been subjected to a different standard than other inspectors,basing her conclusion in part on the fact that both lally and recoulee failed to include similar information in their inspection forms but had not been accused of violations.
campagna contends that his groundwater estimate was accurate,and that the findings made by lally and cabral were incorrect.according to the amended complaint,cabral acting under the direction of the other defendants ignored key evidence that would have validated campagna estimate,including monthly readings from a test hole on the property.campagna further alleges that only three other inspectors including maginnis,the inspector campagna actively supported have been subjected to enforcement actions by the western regional office of the dep,and only two of these inspectors were fined.
during the pendency of campagna appeal of the enforcement action,defendant alan weinberg advised campagna not to discuss his case with other dep employees,and required him to request permission to visit other areas of the dep western regional office in an effort to prevent campagna from discussing his case with fellow employees.also,at some time after another dep employee advised defendant mary holland that he intended to testify on campagna behalf,the employee was falsely accused by the dep of visiting pornography sites on the internet during office hours.this employee left the dep,accepting a position because he could no longer tolerate the animosity of the defendants.
campagna brought suit in may,claiming violations of his constitutional rights under and.laws ch,and common law defamation according to campagna,the enforcement action violated his constitutional right to petition the government for redress of grievances under the first amendment because it was initiated in retaliation for his lawsuit and his support of maginnis appeal.further,the enforcement action violated his fourteenth amendment right to equal protection under the law because he had been held to a different standard than other inspectors.the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under.b as to both of the alleged constitutional violations.the district court granted the motion,dismissing the case in toto after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.this appeal followed.

first amendment 
we begin with campagna claim that the enforcement action violated his right to petition the government for redress of grievances.the district court found that campagna had failed to allege that his lawsuit or his support of maginnis appeal implicated matters of public concern thus,it concluded,campagna failed to state a claim challenging a retaliatory action by his employer.the district court relied on the principle that,except in unusual circumstances,public employees claiming an adverse employment action in retaliation for exercising their first amendment rights must allege that their conduct touched on matters of public concern.connick myers,d applying public concern doctrine in connection with claim made under the free speech clause of the first amendment see also nethersole,at same tang state of rhode island,cir same boyle burke,cir discussing,in dicta,the applicability of the public concern doctrine to claim made under the petiti
