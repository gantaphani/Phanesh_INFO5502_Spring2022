le fort enterprises,le fort does business as a merry maids franchise,providing cleaning services,primarily to homeowners in and around boston,massachusetts.le fort serves approximately customers,generates annual sales in excess of,and employs housekeepers.some of the housekeepers decided to try to unionize.over le fort objection,the national labor relations board the board asserted jurisdiction and conducted a election among the housekeepers.by a vote of to with one challenged ballot,the employees voted to select the international association of bridge,structural,ornamental and reinforcing iron workers,local,afl cio the union as their exclusive representative.rejecting le fort challenge to the election,the board certified the union in accord with the employees vote.le fort then refused to bargain with the union,triggering a charge of unfair labor practices and a board order directing le fort to bargain.see le fort,may.the board now petitions this court pursuant to d and e to enforce the board unfair labor practice order.for the following reasons,we reject le fort objections to the board jurisdiction and the election,and grant the board petition.
i.the board jurisdiction 
congress empowered the board to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce.a.congress intended to and did vest in the board the fullest jurisdictional breadth constitutionally permissible under the commerce clause.nlrb reliance fuel oil,per curiam accord nlrb living learning,cir.le fort does not claim that it falls outside that broad statutory grant of jurisdiction.
le fort relies instead on the board adoption of discretionary limits on the exercise of its jurisdiction.see siemons mailing.adopted in order to conserve and efficiently deploy the board limited resources,see,these limits are expressed as minimum levels of business activity,with differing benchmarks for retail and employers.see bussey williams tire,n.the board exercises jurisdiction over a retail enterprise if it has a gross annual business volume of at least.nlrb pizza pizzaz,cir per curiam citing carolina supplies cement co.the board exercises jurisdiction over a enterprise if its gross outflow or inflow of commerce across state lines is at least.nlrb somerville const,cir siemons mailing,at.
the board found le fort to be a retail enterprise because its sales were sales to a purchaser who desires to satisfy his own personal wants or those of his family or friends.latta son,quoting roland walling.with annual sales of over,le fort easily fits within the board jurisdiction,even as limited by the board,if it is indeed a retail enterprise.le fort therefore argues that the board erred in classifying it as a retail business,and that the company does not otherwise satisfy the discretionary standard for exercising jurisdiction over businesses.
such a challenge to the board application of its jurisdictional reach by a company that falls within the board broad statutory grant of jurisdiction faces a steep uphill climb.we will enforce against the board its own jurisdictional limits only in extraordinary circumstances or where the board has abused its discretion.pizza pizzaz,at where statutory jurisdiction exists the board has the administrative discretion to disregard its own jurisdictional yardstick when the board disregards its own jurisdictional guidelines in asserting jurisdiction on an ad hoc basis,the courts should not intervene unless compelled to do so by extraordinary circumstances,or unless the board has abused its discretion.quoting nlrb erlich,cir.
here,there is no plausible basis for arguing that the board disregarded its discretionary jurisdictional standards in classifying le fort as a retail enterprise,much less that it did so in extraordinary circumstances.as the board found,and le fort concedes,le fort provid es home cleaning services to residential customers.le fort owner testified that his employees just clean houses percent of the time.le fort is therefore a retail enterprise with annual revenues in excess of,and fits well within the board jurisdiction,even as limited by the board.le fort only argument to the contrary relies on cases involving other cleaning companies determined to be businesses.in each of those cases,though,the employer provided cleaning services to commercial and institutional clients,and not primarily to homeowners.serv.emp.int l union local,three employers provided services to commercial clients bergensons prop,employer provided services to a university west side carpet cleaning,enterprise provided services to commercial and residential customers,enforced,cir.
ii.le fort objections to the election 
factual background 
the facts relevant to the election are largely undisputed.the voting occurred in the kitchen of the single building from which le fort operated.to enter the kitchen,employees walked into the building foyer,crossed fourteen feet through the foyer into a hallway,passed through a steel door into a garage,and then walked another fifteen feet across the garage to a door into the kitchen.
during the voting,approximately eight employees gathered in the foyer.some of these employees made remarks to other workers entering or leaving the foyer going to or from the kitchen.the comments included the following 
four employees were told or overheard others saying that whoever did not vote for the union would be dismissed,or that new employees would be dismissed if they voted no.
after they voted,one of those same four employees,plus two other employees,were told that,if the union won,undocumented employees would be fired 
three other employees were told things like w e counting on your vote,w e need you on our side,or you know how you going to vote.
additionally,an employee listening from another room overheard those gathered in the foyer making derogatory remarks about managers and employees who opposed the union none of the electioneering occurred in any designated no electioneering area.nor were any officials or agents of the union involved.
the hearing officer,and then the board in affirming the hearing officer,found that none of the foregoing conduct required setting aside the election results.le fort now challenges that conclusion,contending that the board improperly relied on its finding that union agents did not make the various remarks,and that the board abused its discretion in concluding that the various comments,viewed collectively,did not warrant setting aside the election results.
standard of review 
in reviewing the board findings and conclusions on the conduct of elections,the board is entitled to a wide degree of discretion in establishing what safeguards are necessary to insure that the outcome reflects a fair and free choice of bargaining representatives by employees.hosp.menonita nlrb,cir alterations in original quoting nlrb tower.the board findings of fact will stand if supported by substantial evidence.e.as the party challenging the election,le fort bears the burden of proof,and must establish that the board abused its discretion in upholding the election.hosp.menonita,at.the board would abuse its discretion if it used the incorrect legal standard.nlrb reg l home care,cir.
standard for non party employee misconduct 
in assessing the impact of the workers comments,the board determined that the workers gathered in the foyer were not agents of the union,nor were they acting at its behest.therefore,the board evaluated the comments effect on the election under a more lenient standard than it would for conduct by the agents of the union or le fort.compare melrose wakefield hosp.ass n,nlrb,f d,cir under settled law,statements require the setting aside of the election only when they are shown to have created such an atmosphere of fear and coercion that free choice has become impossible.with overnite transp.nlrb,where election misconduct is attributable to one of the parties,the board will overturn the election if the misconduct created such an environment of tension and coercion as to have had a probable effect upon the employees actions at the polls and to have materially affected the results of the election.internal quotatio
