userra prohibits employers from denying members of the armed services reemployment,or retention in employment on the basis of the employee military service,a,and it grants members of the armed services a right to reemployment following an absence necessitated by reason of military service,id.a.thus,had an obligation to reinstate fryer upon his return from deployment.see a see also,clegg.dep t of,cir holding that userra is violated where a member of the armed services is not reemployed in the position she would have been in had she not taken military leave or a position of like seniority,status and pay internal quotation marks omitted.

when fryer arrived home from military duty,he informed that he was available to start work on may.in response,told fryer that,during his deployment,another individual had been hired to fill his position and that there were no positions currently available at on may,fryer sent a letter to formally requesting reinstatement to his position and informing that he intended to report to work on june.when fryer met with on june,he was told that his position was unavailable.instead,offered fryer a position as a sprinkler helper.although fryer was offered a three dollar per hour increase in pay,sprinkler helpers have a much more limited opportunity to earn commissions.commissions had previously been a substantial portion of fryer income.additionally,sprinkler helpers do not have access to a company van or cell phone,both of which were made available to fryer in his position as a sprinkler service sales representative.fryer accepted the position but repeatedly voiced his desire to return to his position.fryer continued in service with as a sprinkler helper until he was terminated on october,allegedly on grounds of absenteeism during the period of reemployment.

while does not challenge the district court determination that it violated userra,argues that fryer claims under state law are barred because they are preempted by userra.specifically,contends that the state law claims are preempted because the same conduct serves as the basis for both the federal liquidated damages and the state compensatory damages awards,thereby creating a duplicative award,which argues is contrary to the purpose of userra.fryer argues that there is no preemption of state law because userra specifically preserves state claims,providing 
nothing in this chapter shall supersede,nullify or diminish any federal or state law that establishes a right or benefit that is more beneficial to,or is in addition to,a right or benefit provided for such person by userra.
as a threshold matter,fryer argues that we should not address the merits of the preemption question because did not raise the issue of preemption below and has accordingly waived the argument.acknowledges that its counsel did not formally raise preemption in the trial court as an affirmative defense,but contends that userra is jurisdictional in nature and that preemption is therefore a defense.
whether the defense of preemption is jurisdictional or waivable is a question of law we review de novo.wolf reliance standard life ins,cir.the supreme court has recognized that the defense of preemption can be jurisdictional,and therefore,if success on the preemption defense would dictate the choice of forum and thereby deprive the reviewing court of subject matter jurisdiction.see int l longshoremen davis.in contrast,the defense of preemption is waivable where it merely dictates a different choice of law.id.in davis,the supreme court held that a preemption defense under the national labor relations act,et,is jurisdictional because successful assertion of the defense would cause the state court jurisdiction to itself be preempted by federal law vesting exclusive jurisdiction over that controversy in another body,the national labor relations board.id.at emphases added.in contrast,this court has held that a preemption defense under the labor management relations act lmra,a,is not jurisdictional because the state courts maintain concurrent jurisdiction over claims under the act.sweeney
