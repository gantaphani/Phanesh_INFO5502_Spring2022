now before us are four appeals in a case brought by sagun tuli,a female neurosurgeon,against her employer brigham and women hospital the hospital and her former and supervisor arthur day.the first appeal was by the hospital from a preliminary injunction sought and obtained by tuli the three more recent appeals followed a jury verdict awarding tuli damages against the defendants and a permanent injunction crafted by the district judge.
in,the hospital hired tuli as an associate surgeon in the department of neurosurgery and day as residency director and vice chairman of the department.in and,tuli was made the department professionalism officer and representative to the hospital quality assurance and risk management committee qarm,which required her to investigate and in some cases report on other doctors case complications.in,the departure of two colleagues left tuli as the sole spine surgeon she says that,unlike prior male doctors,she was not promoted to the position of director of spine.
most of tuli claims stem from her interactions with day,who became her supervisor when he was promoted to chair the department in.as qarm representative,tuli was asked to investigate three of day cases,which ultimately were reported to the state board of registration of medicine.tuli alleged that day behavior toward women has been consistently inappropriate and demeaning.starting in and continuing until,tuli began to bring her concerns about day to anthony whittemore,the chief medical officer of the hospital.
tuli herself exchanged with a resident in.he accused her of threatening his job after he told day that she was upset by day decision to operate on one of her patients against her wishes tuli accused the resident of mismanaging one of her patients by failing to check blood work,leading to a complication requiring urgent care.tuli also received a number of patient complaints in and,primarily concerning her attitude and communication skills.
tuli medical staff credentials were due for review by the hospital credentials committee in october.day presented tuli case to the committee,stating that she had mood swings,that twenty to thirty members of the operating room staff did not want to work with her,and that she would benefit from anger management training.the committee then conditioned tuli reappointment on obtaining an evaluation within four months by an outside agency called physician health services phs and agreeing to comply with its recommendations.
after concerns were raised about the lack of specificity of day presentation,the committee had whittemore tuli case at a december meeting whittemore provided a somewhat more balanced opinion,but mostly rehashed the issues day had discussed during the earlier meeting and did not tell the committee of tuli prior complaints against day.the committee affirmed its earlier decision.near the end of december,tuli filed the present lawsuit and sought a preliminary injunction to prevent loss of her privileges during the pendency of the case.
under both federal and state law,tuli complaint charged the hospital and day with gender discrimination through both disparate treatment and a hostile work environment retaliation and violation of massachusetts health care whistleblower act it also charged the hospital with equal pay violations under both federal and state law and day with intentional interference with advantageous relations and slander.
the district court granted the preliminary injunction,which the hospital appealed shortly thereafter the trial resulted in a jury decision favorable to tuli in most respects,which then led to a permanent injunction.this court then deferred action on the original appeal,anticipating that it would be mooted by the superceding permanent injunction.when the hospital said that attorneys fees might be affected by the resolution of the appeal on the original injunction,we instead consolidated the old appeal with the new appeal from the final judgment.
the jury awarded tuli against the hospital in compensatory damages on the retaliation claim in compensatory damages against it on the hostile work environment claim in damages against day for economic harm on the interference claim and nominal damages for the whistleblower claim against the hospital,the slander claim against day,and harm from the interference claim against day.tuli lost her discriminatory disparate treatment and unequal pay claims.both sides have now appealed from the final judgment.
hostile work environment.in contesting the award on the hostile work environment claim,the hospital makes four different arguments.we begin with the contention that the claim failed as a matter of law.our review on such issues is de novo,but the evidence is taken in the light most favorable to the verdict.monteagudo asociacin de empleados del estado libre asociado de,cir,cert.denied.
to prevail on such a claim based on gender discrimination,tuli had to offer evidence to show that 
she is a member of a protected class she was subjected to unwelcome harassment the harassment was based upon gender the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive that it altered the conditions of her employment and created an abusive working environment the offending conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive and some basis for employer liability has been established.

assuming admissibility,the evidence was ample.the primary actors,in tuli account,were day and another doctor dong kim who like day is no longer at the hospital.kim conduct,according to testimony set forth below that the jury could have accepted,was blatantly sexist and offensive day,according to other evidence,sufficiently demeaning to a female surgeon as to be unlawful.because chronology is pertinent,the principal episodes are set out in a time line 
day ignores tuli at conferences by stating,l et ask the spine guys,eric and marc,what they think,and omitting her despite the fact that she is also a spine surgeon.
at a graduation dinner and in front of a female resident,day asks tuli,can you get up on the table to dance so you could show them how to behave.
in the summer,tuli attends a bachelorette party for a coworker and sees a doll with a picture of her face attached to it.
day makes comments on different occasions you just a little girl,you know,can you do that spine surgery oh,girls can do spine surgery are you not strong enough to use the hand instruments 
in february or march,with his arm on tuli back,kim says,why do we leave this place and go to the elliott hospital so i can give you an oral exam i think you really hot and i imagine you naked.
early in,day sits in on tuli teaching conference and disagrees with tuli lecture.he does this more than once,and tuli does not believe that he did so during male doctors teaching conferences.
residents,who are supervised by day as residency director,ignore tuli pages,fail to assist her on rounds,and fail to show up for clinical duties.in the summer,tuli notices that she is given,junior residents for her cases.
tuli becomes aware of a party planned with strippers and cages and beer kegs.although it was supposed to celebrate the incoming chief residents,a new female chief resident was excluded.day approves of the party and of outside funding for it.
in september or october,day and tuli meet to clear the air,and day says,our relationship is like that of lovers and you cheated on me,with his hand on her arm he also calls her deranged.when she attempts to shake his hand at the end of the meeting around,he gives her a prolonged hug.

kim states that he would like to have the opportunity to sexually harass tuli tuli observes him fondling a physician assistant at a department event.
day looks in on tuli spine surgery and makes some comment to the effect of whether she was able to do that case because she was a girl,are you sure you can do that,you just a girl,something to that effect.
day bars tuli from spine oncology research saying that he had a guy in mind for the job.
without specifying dates,tuli also reported that day had given her other prolonged hugs and had held her hand as they walked at work.she also testified that day had questioned her authority in multiple teaching conferences and had made comments repeatedly about tuli being a little girl and questioning whether she could do a big operation the incidents noted above were particular examples of this recurrent behavior for which she could remember specific dates.
the accumulated effect of incidents of humiliating,offensive comments directed at women and pranks,taken together,can constitute a hostile work environment.city of providence,cir.tuli repeatedly complained about these acts,but the hospital did nothing to prevent their repetition.that tuli managed to get her work done despite the harassment does not prevent a jury from finding liability.billings town of grafton,cir.the jury was entitled to find that a hostile workplace had been tolerated and that the hospital was liable 
the hospital argues that tuli unreasonably failed to seek corrective action,burlington,ellerth,because though she reported the harassment to whittemore she never filed a formal complaint.but whittemore discouraged a formal complaint,conceding that tuli fear of retaliation was reasonable and known to him.see reed mbna mktg,cir.nor does this affirmative defense apply where,as here,the employer has taken a tangible employment action that would be actionable under title vii independent of a hostile work environment.marrero goya of,cir quoting ellerth,at.both the federal and state provisions require that a charge be filed within days of the alleged unlawful employment practice.title vii,e.laws ch.tuli filed her complaint with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad on november.the hospital says that events listed in the time line set forth above that occurred prior to that date but outside of the day window can not be considered.
however,under supreme court precedent,a series of acts may comprise a single hostile environment claim,and 
i t does not matter,for purpose of the statute,that some of the component acts of the hostile work environment fall outside the statutory time period.provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability.

the sequence also satisfies massachusetts parallel analysis,which does not penalize victims of discrimination for reporting misconduct as it occurs and attempting to work with their employers to remedy the situation.cuddyer stop shop supermarket.although in and,prior to the day window,tuli was subject to pinpricks,id.at,day presentation to the committee in october could be viewed as making clear that the situation was hopeless,triggering the clock for the sum of prior acts comprising the continuing violation.id.at.
the hospital also complains that various evidence bearing on the hostile work environment claim was wrongly admitted at trial.specifically,the hospital contends that comments attributed to day and kim,as well as testimony from eileen hardy about a penis statue and cookie jar with women underpants in day office and sexual drawings day downloaded onto her palm pilot,were either inadmissible hearsay,irrelevant,unfairly prejudicial,or some combination of the three.
the claims of hearsay fail because the statements in question were not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted.if certain of the offensive conduct was unknown to tuli at the time,it remained relevant for purposes of showing notice to the hospital and toleration of a general climate of offensive remarks and displays.see cummings standard register,cir.those of kim statements made at a party remained relevant to the hostile work environment claim,parrish sollecito,d,and tuli reported kim conduct to whittemore.
the hospital claims that tuli waived her rights when,in a june,letter to the hospital,tuli counsel said that she appreciated efforts made by the hospital to change behavior in her department and would hold her grievance in abeyance to allow whittemore to address the issues.the letter explicitly states that it is not a waiver,and a deferral in the hope of improvement does not foreclose a renewed complaint or lawsuit.cabn hernndez philip morris usa,cir formal release.
finally,the hospital sought jury instruction language to the effect that mere offensive utterances,offhand comments and isolated incidents do not amount to discrimination,and it says now that the failure to give its language was error.the district court gave a balanced instruction describing the considerations that bear on hostile work environment,noting that severity,frequency and offensiveness were all relevant.it was not obliged to use the hospital language.
retaliation.the hospital next claims the district court should have granted judgment as a matter of law on the retaliation claim.under title vii,a,it is 
an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,or because he has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this subchapter.
massachusetts has a counterpart provision.laws ch.
tuli position was that she had complained about day and that the credentials committee action against her comprised retaliation.the hospital does not dispute that tuli complaints were protected conduct,but it disputes that the evidence showed either of the two other requisites of a retaliation claim that tuli suffered an adverse employment action and that a causal connection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse action.mcmillan.soc y for the prevention of cruelty to animals,cir citation omitted,cert.denied.
tuli provided sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the consequences of the obligatory counseling ordered by the hospital invasion of privacy,potential stigma,and possible impact on employment and licensing elsewhere might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.burlington santa fe ry.white,internal quotation marks omitted.obligatory counseling is not a typical adverse action but the impact here could be deemed sufficient by the jury if the action was prompted by a retaliatory motive.
the issue of causal connection is more complicated.a hospital has good reason to intervene both to protect itself and to safeguard its patients where a doctor is in need of treatment in order to provide competent care,and courts are likely to defer to an impartial assessment.further,there is no suggestion that individuals on or involved with the committee other than day harbored any improper animus or acted with a retaliatory motive in voting to compel tuli to seek and follow an evaluation.
but day represented the hospital as the head of his department in presenting the case against tuli,staub proctor,and whittemore who knew the background it without qualifying information about day.day presented the case even though he had been the subject of adverse critiques by tuli of his own performance as part of her official responsibilities and day was the subject of her complaints about day own wrongful conduct toward her.it was for the jury to decide whether the committee was misled by day in a way that altered the outcome.
nor was the jury obliged to think the causal chain broken by the second round of review.whittemore was himself relying in part on information from day,and he did not tell the committee of the complaints that tuli had made about day although some members were apparently aware of some of the background,it was not disclosed at the meeting.two committee members testified that knowledge of the complaints against day would have been important information.
in making her retaliation claim,tuli also argued that day negative report about her re
