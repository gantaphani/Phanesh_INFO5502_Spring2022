appellants marcos mercado and suzanne claim that they experienced unlawful discrimination while working at the san juan hotel,spa casino,and they brought suit under title vii of the civil rights act of,a,and similar puerto rico laws.to sue under title vii,individuals must have filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc within a specified time after the alleged unlawful practices occurred.see id.e.appellants did not file their charges within the statutory period,and the district court dismissed their claims on that ground.on appeal,appellants assert that the court erred in refusing to give them the benefit of equitable tolling.as we shall explain,we conclude that appellants are entitled to factual development of their tolling claim,and we therefore vacate the dismissals and remand for further proceedings.
background 
this suit was filed by appellants and a,sandra megwinoff,each of whom alleged different instances of discriminatory conduct on the part of their supervisors.appellant mercado claimed discrimination on the basis of national origin appellants hebert and megwinoff both alleged sexual harassment,as well as gender and national origin discrimination megwinoff additionally asserted age discrimination.all three employees,who began working at the hotel in,claimed that their unlawful treatment and unsustainable working conditions forced them to resign from their jobs in the three employees met with an attorney on november,and filed charges with the eeoc on december.
it is undisputed that mercado and hebert filings were untimely.under title vii,they were required to file charges with the eeoc within days after the allegedly unlawful practice,see e and the most generous calculation of the trigger date renders mercado filing days late and hebert days late the eeoc,without making either a determination on the merits or a finding on timeliness,issued all three plaintiffs letters.they filed their joint suit in march,and subsequently filed a motion seeking dismissal of mercado and hebert claims based on their untimely eeoc charges.
in their opposition to the dismissal motion,appellants contended first that the timeliness defense was waived because it had not been raised before the eeoc.in addition,they claimed that was barred from asserting timeliness as a defense because the hotel failed to comply with eeoc regulations requiring employers to post notices advising employees of their legal rights relating to employment discrimination.see a invoking the doctrine of equitable tolling,appellants claimed that the filing period did not begin to run until they received notice of their rights when they met with an attorney.
the district court rejected appellants arguments and concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of their claims because of the late eeoc filings.the court reasoned that the equitable tolling doctrine may be utilized only when there is active misleading on the part of the employer,and it held that failure to post the mandatory notices was insufficient to satisfy that standard.the court implicitly rejected appellants argument that had waived the timeliness issue by failing to raise it with the eeoc,noting that the agency issuance of letters did not insulate the filing defect from independent evaluation by the court.
on appeal,mercado and hebert reiterate both their waiver and equitable tolling arguments.we first briefly address the threshold question of waiver,along with contention that the appeal is premature,and then turn to the equitable tolling doctrine.
ii.discussion 
appellants contend that waived the timeliness defense by failing to bring the issue to the attention of the eeoc they claim it was raised for the first time in motion for partial dismissal in the district court.appellants are wrong both legally and factually.
first,appellants offer no support for their assertion that the failure to initially raise the defense before the eeoc was fatal,given that the eeoc did not reach a decision on the merits.both of their cited cases involve instances in which parties belatedly sought to rely in court on procedural flaws that had not been raised in earlier administrative proceedings that reached substantive outcomes.see united states tucker truck lines.ester principi,cir.in ester,the seventh circuit held that an agency waives a timeliness defense in a subsequent lawsuit if it decides the merits of a complaint,but noted the court adherence to the rule that agencies do not waive a timeliness defense merely by accepting and investigating a discrimination complaint.id.at citing fifth,ninth and circuit cases see also belgrave pena,cir bruce dep t of justice,cir concluding that timeliness defense was waived where a government agency made an express determination that a complaint was timely based on a specific factual finding.we find that principle to be applicable here,where the eeoc issued letters without reaching the merits of appellants claims.
nor did appellee belatedly raise the claim in the district court.in its answer to appellants complaint,asserted as its initial affirmative defense that t he claims alleged in the plaintiffs complaint are partially totally barred by the applicable statute of limitations jurisdictional time frames.although conclusory,this assertion adequately identified the issue.the subsequent motion for partial dismissal elaborated on the untimeliness defense by setting out the argument that mercado and hebert exceeded the statutory period for filing a charge with the eeoc.thus,contrary to appellants contention,the issue was raised by at its first opportunity in the litigation and it was thus fully preserved.
meanwhile,seeks dismissal of the appeal as premature.it argues that no final,appealable judgment has been rendered because the district court has not yet resolved the case of their,megwinoff.although the district court certified the judgments with respect to mercado and hebert as final under.b,finding that there is no just reason for delay,see,quinn boston,cir,claims the court erred in doing so.the hotel maintains that the equities counsel against a piecemeal appeal.
the district court did not explain its rule b decision,but we think it sufficiently apparent why it acted as it did if the court ruling dismissing mercado and hebert claims proved to be incorrect,the most efficient course of action would be for all three employees claims to proceed together.although their individual factual contentions and theories vary,the same general environment is at issue and at least some witnesses would be expected to testify on each case.by certifying the judgments against mercado and hebert as final and allowing this court to review the discrete legal issue underlying them without delay,the district court was maximizing the potential for the most expeditious resolution of the entire case.we see no error in this approach.
we thus turn to the substance of the appeal.
equitable tolling 
appellants contend that their late filing of charges with the eeoc should be forgiven under the doctrine of equitable tolling because of failure to post statutorily mandated notices of their employment rights as noted earlier,the district court rejected this excuse.the court relied on a line of precedent describing equitable tolling as a narrow doctrine reserved for exceptional cases,see roche,cir,and permitted only where the employer has actively misled the employee,thomas eastman kodak,cir.
the district court correctly identified t he baseline rule that time limitations are important in discrimination cases,and that federal courts therefore should employ equitable tolling sparingly,bonilla muebles alvarez,cir see also passenger morgan,d.after careful review of the case law,however,we conclude the court erred in utilizing the actively misled standard in the context of a claim.
while an employer affirmative misconduct provides one rationale for extending the filing period,we have recognized that an employer violation of the eeoc posting requirement may provide a second basis for an extended filing period where the employee had no other actual or constructive knowledge of the complaint procedu
