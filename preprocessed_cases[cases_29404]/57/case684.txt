efra√≠n and his parents hereinafter jointly referred to as claudio,filed suit under the fair labor standards act flsa,the employee retirement income security act erisa,and puerto rico public law,laws ann.a,alleging that claudio was wrongfully terminated from his employment by becton dickinson caribe,becton and that becton failed to give claudio notice of his right to continued medical coverage.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of becton.claudio appeals.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
claudio was hired by becton as a process engineer on september.after a month on the job,claudio was informed that his responsibilities included monitoring the security guards at becton juncos,puerto rico plant.this task included see ing to it that the guards are there,that the guards render the service,and they give the service the contract specifies.in addition,claudio was responsible for approving the guards invoices for payment.
the security guards at the juncos plant were hired through cm express service cm express,a contractor.upon examining the invoices submitted by cm express,claudio concluded that the security guards were not being properly compensated for overtime hours worked.claudio spoke with his superiors about this potential labor violation and wrote a letter to becton explaining the potential violation.
in response to claudio letter,becton held a meeting,with becton lawyer in attendance,and determined that the security guards were not employees of becton and,therefore,becton was not responsible for ensuring that the guards received overtime pay.becton decided that it would inform cm express of the potential flsa violations claudio had identified.at the conclusion of the meeting,claudio supervisors told him that,in the meantime,he should approve the invoices.claudio refused to do so and was terminated from employment.

iii.analysis 
flsa provision 
claudio argues that he was wrongfully terminated because the flsa makes it unlawful for any person to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint related to the act.a.the elements of a retaliation claim under the flsa require,at a minimum,a showing that the plaintiff engaged in a statutorily protected activity,and his employer thereafter subjected him to an adverse employment action as a reprisal for having engaged in protected activity.blackie maine,cir.the central issue on appeal is whether claudio engaged in a statutorily protected activity that triggers the protection of a.
there are two incidents that claudio contends fall within the ambit of filing a complaint.the first incident occurred when claudio informed becton,both orally and in writing,that the guards were not being paid overtime.the second incident occurred when claudio refused to sign the invoices even after being told that becton was not the employer of the guards.
as to the first incident,other circuits have held,and we agree,that it is the assertion of statutory rights by taking some action adverse to the company that is the hallmark of protected activity under a.mckenzie renberg,cir see also eeoc hbe,cir requiring action adverse to the company in a title vii retaliation case.to engage in protected activity,the employee must step outside his or her role of representing the company and file an action adverse to the employer,actively assist other employees in asserting flsa rights,or otherwise engage in activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of rights protected by the flsa.mckenzie,at.a requirement of stepping outside a normal role is satisfied by a showing that the employee took some action against a policy and that the action was based on a reasonable belief that the employer engaged in conduct contrary to the flsa.hbe,at.
in mckenzie,the tenth circuit held that a personnel director did not engage in a protected activity by reporting overtime violations because her job responsibilities included wage and hour issues.mckenzie,at.in contrast,the tenth circuit held in conner that a food clerk engaged in a protected activity by reporting overtime violations because the employee had no management responsibilities regarding the calculation of overtime wages.conner,at.in hbe,the eighth circuit held that a personnel director engaged in a protected activity when he stepped outside his employment role by refusing to fire a black employee because the firing was ordered for patently discriminatory reasons.hbe,at.
when claudio first informed becton of the potential overtime violations,he did so in furtherance of his job responsibilities.claudio job responsibilities included approving invoices documenting the guards hours worked and their corresponding pay.as claudio letter to becton indicates,claudio was concerned with protecting becton,not asserting rights adverse to becton.compare id.the letter stated 
acceptance of inappropriate conditions of salary payment by an outside contractor to their employees is an inappropriate practice of becton dickinson juncos.becton dickinson juncos and their representative officers can sic be responsible for this 
it is my intention by bringing out this important issue,sic avoid potential liability of becton dickinson juncos before any future reclamation related with it.
as in mckenzie,claudio never crossed the line from being an employee merely performing h is job to an employee lodging a personal complaint.mckenzie,at.when claudio first alerted becton about a potential violation,therefore,he did not engage in a protected activity for purposes of a.
as to the second incident,we must determine whether claudio refusal to sign the invoices triggers the protection of a.there is a conflict among the circuits regarding what actions constitute the filing of a complaint.see valerio putnam,cir explaining the circuit split.this circuit,although not requiring an employee to file a formal complaint with a court or agency to receive flsa protection,does require an employee to take action beyond mere abstract grumblings.id.at.proceeding on a basis,we analyze the facts to inquire whether the communications to the employer were sufficient to amount to a filing of a complaint as required by the flsa.id.at.
before claudio refused to sign the invoices,he attended a meeting with becton management discussing the guards overtime pay.at the meeting,becton lawyer concluded that the guards were not employees of becton and therefore that becton was not responsible for paying the guards overtime.as a preventive measure,however,becton management decided to send a letter informing cm express that it might be violating the flsa.claudio,who was present during this meeting,heard the recommendation of the lawyer,was informed that becton was not responsible for paying the guards overtime,and knew that becton was taking action nonetheless.claudio was also specifically directed to approve the invoices.
we do not believe claudio refusal to sign the invoices constituted the filing of a complaint.the flsa provision protects an employee lawful efforts to secure rights afforded by the flsa.the flsa does not,however,provide a shield against legitimate employer actions.blackie,at.claudio refusal to sign the invoices occurred after the whistle had been blown and after corrective actions were being taken to remedy any flsa violations.the flsa was created to protect an employee who lodge s complaints or suppl ies information to officials regarding allegedly substandard employment practices and conditions.valerio,at c
