background 
located in portland,maine,barber foods is a secondary processor of products.it purchases boneless chicken breast in bulk and processes that raw material into finished products such as stuffed entrees,chicken fingers,and nuggets.barber foods has two shifts,each with six production lines,consisting of three specialty lines and three lines.the product is assembled on the specialty lines,and then,after passing through large spiral freezers,the product is pouched,packed,and palletized on the lines.
the production lines are staffed primarily by rotating associates,employees who generally rotate to different positions on the lines every two hours.in addition to rotating associates,barber foods employs operators whose primary duty is to ensure that various machines on the lines are operating properly,meatroom associates who work where the raw product is blended with ingredients,shipping and receiving associates,maintenance employees,and sanitation employees.
all associates are expected to be on the production floor ready to work when their shift begins.they are paid from the time they actually punch in to a computerized system from time clocks located at the entrances to the production floor.
rotating associates are required to wear lab coats,hairnets,earplugs,and safety glasses.the lab coats,hairnets,and earplugs must be on before they can punch in and until they punch out.safety glasses and any items that they choose but are not required to wear,such as gloves,aprons,and sleeve covers,can be donned after punching in and doffed before punching out.
before they punch in,operators are required to wear lab coats,hairnets,earplugs,safety glasses,boots,bump hats and back belts and are required to carry equipment,which they put in their lab coat pocket.any other items they choose to wear may be donned after punching in.
meatroom associates are required to wear lab coats,hairnets,earplugs,safety glasses,boots,back belts,aprons,and vinyl gloves.many also choose to wear sleeve covers.all items must be on before punch in,except the apron,gloves,and sleeve covers,which can be donned after punching in and doffed before punching out.
shipping and receiving associates are required to wear boots,hard hats,and back belts.they generally don these items before punching in and doff them after punching out.their time clock is located on the production floor,so they must also don and doff lab coats,hairnets,and earplugs in order to enter the production floor to punch in and out.
employees obtain lab coats and cotton glove liners from the hallway between the entranceway and the equipment cage.the lab coats are on hanger racks,and the glove liners are in tubs.hairnets,earplugs,vinyl gloves,sleeve covers,and aprons are dispensed from the window of the equipment cage.vinyl gloves,sleeve covers,and aprons are also available from tubs on the production floor.
bump hats,back belts,safety glasses,boots,and reusable earplugs are dispensed once and then replaced as needed.items retained by associates may be stored in their locker or taken home.lab coats and gloves are laundered and reused on their way out of the plant,associates drop these items in laundry bins located at several points along the hallway from the production floor exits to the plant exits.vinyl gloves,sleeve covers,and aprons are disposed of in trash bins located on the production floor and along the hallways from the production floor exits to the plant exits.
employees may have to wait to obtain and dispense with clothing and equipment.at busier times,there may be lines at the coat racks,glove liner bins,and cage window.there may also be lines at the time clocks.
time keeping 
barber foods uses a computerized system.the system downloads clock punches into the payroll software.time clocks are located at the entrances and exits to the production floor and at various other locations in the facility.each employee has a swipe card with a bar code,which she swipes through the time clock.rotating associates,operators,and meatroom employees generally punch in at a clock in the area where they will be working and punch out on the clocks located next to the two primary exits.maintenance employees punch in on a time clock in the maintenance room.employees punch in and out on the plant office clock located by the office.sanitation associates punch in on the cafeteria clock and punch out at the plant office clock.
employees get paid from the moment they punch in.in an attempt to stagger times,barber foods allows employees twelve minutes of swing time,meaning that employees can punch in up to six minutes early and get paid for that additional time or punch in up to six minutes late and not be charged with an attendance violation.
history of dispute 
seven current employees and former employees brought suit in district court claiming that barber foods violated the flsa by forcing its hourly employees to work off the clock by not paying employees for the time it takes to obtain,don,and doff their gear.although the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants as to most counts,the court denied summary judgment as to the claim involving the donning and doffing of required clothing and equipment.the court found that the donning and doffing of clothing and equipment required by barber foods or by government regulation is an integral part of plaintiffs employment.this finding removed the donning and doffing of required gear from the act and its exclusion of compensability for preliminary or postliminary activity.a trial was held on the issue of whether the time spent donning and doffing required clothing was de minimis and thus did not constitute work under the flsa.
the jury found that the combined donning and doffing times are minute for rotating associates,minutes seconds for operators,minute seconds for meatroom associates,minutes seconds for shipping and receiving associates,and no time for maintenance and sanitation workers because they are not required to don clothing before punching in or to doff clothing after punching out.the jury found that each of these donning and doffing times is de minimis,making the donning and doffing time.employees do not challenge the jury findings.
employees appeal the following findings in the partial summary judgment decision that the time employees must necessarily spend walking and waiting in connection with obtaining,donning,doffing,and disposing of the sanitary and protective gear required by barber foods federal regulation is not compensable that the time spent donning and doffing clothing,equipment,and gear which is not expressly required by barber foods is in addition,employees challenge two district court jury instructions 
ii.standard of review

iii.discussion 
the flsa requires an employer to record,credit,and compensate employees for all of the time which the employer requires or permits employees to work,et,commonly defined as physical or mental exertion whether burdensome or not controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business.coal,iron muscoda local.see also reich new york city transit,cir.
however,even when an activity is properly classified as work,the act,exempts from compensation activities which are preliminary or postliminary to an employee principal activity or activities unless they are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered work ers are employed and not specifically excluded by section a of the act.lindow united states,cir citation and quotations marks omitted reich,at.in addition,some activities that may qualify as work and fall outside of the act nevertheless do not require compensation because the activities require such little time that they are adjudged de minimis.dunlop city,cir.
donning and doffing of gear 
the district court found that the donning and doffing of required gear is an integral and indispensable part of employees principal activities.see generally steiner mitchell.holding that activities should be considered integral and indispensable when they are part of the principal activities for the particular job tasks mitchell king packing.we agree with the district court conclusion as to the required gear.in the context of this case,employees are required by barber foods and or government regulation to wear the gear.therefore,these tasks are integral to the principal activity and therefore compensable.see alvarez ibp,cir holding that donning and doffing which is both required by law and done for the benefit of employer is integral and indispensable part of the workday a.
as relates to the gear,employees contend that any activity which promotes safety and sanitary conditions necessarily benefits the employer.we think this takes the argument too far.the donning and doffing of gear is not compensable under these facts.not everything an employee does in her workplace is compensable under the flsa.these optional items required are neither by the employer nor by the regulations and are worn by employees at their own discretion.
walking time 
employees argue that the district court improperly excluded from compensable time the periods employees walk from one area where they obtain an initial piece of clothing or equipment required by barber foods usda regulations to another area where they obtain additional items,the period they spend walking from getting their garb to the time clocks,and the period they spend walking to the area where they dispose of clothing and equipment after they punch out.
the act specifically addresses walking time,generally exempting from compensation walking,riding,or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.a.the act also generally exempts from compensation activities which are preliminary or postliminary to an employee principal activity or activities.see a.on their face,these provisions would appear to exempt from compensation the walking at issue here.
employees argue that the act excludes only that walking time which occurs before an employee commences her principal activity or activities.see a.the code of federal regulations code states that congress intended the term principal activities to be broad.a.however,the code regulations state that just because the changing of clothes may in certain situations be so directly related to the specific work the employee is employed to perform that it would be regarded as an integral part of the employee principal activity,t his does not necessarily mean,however,that travel between the washroom or place and the actual place of performance of the specific work the employee is employed to perform,would be excluded from the type of travel to which section a act refers.g citing colloquy between senators cooper and mcgrath,cong.rec.internal citation omitted.
compensability issues are determined under the flsa and its accompanying regulations.both parties agree that the act does not apply to questions of compensability during the workday.the secretary urges an expansion of the ordinary workday rule in favor of a broader,automatic rule that any activity that satisfies the integral and indispensable test itself starts the workday,regardless of context.this extension overreaches and would lead to the absurd result that an employee who dons required equipment supplied by the company at,at his own home,starts his workday for flsa purposes at though he is not required to punch in to work and does not punch in until.this plainly can not be what congress intended.the secretary offers a fallback position that the workday starts with any donning or doffing of required gear so long as it is done on company property.but the logic of the secretary position does not permit such a narrowing,nor does the secretary fallback argument make sense in a world,for example,in which not all employees who perform work that is compensable under the flsa do so at a facility owned and run by their employer.
further,nothing in steiner requires the result that the secretary urges and the secretary rule threatens to undermine congress purpose in the act,which with rare exceptions sought to exclude preliminary and postliminary waiting and walking time from compensability.not surprisingly,the secretary broad position has implicitly been rejected by two circuits.see anderson pilgrim pride,d,aff,wl cir reich ibp,cir.but see alvarez,at.
the secretary position is one taken in litigation,in response to an invitation from this court.the secretary has no authority to promulgate legislative rules in this area.the secretary has promulgated interpretive regulations,which are entitled to some weight,see skidmore swift,but those regulations appear to cut both ways on the facts of this case.in any event,the secretary present litigation position,in our view,pushes so far that it threatens to undermine the act.we affirm the determination that the employees walking time is not compensable.
waiting time 
employees claim that barber foods must compensate them for all the time they spend waiting in line to receive the required clothing or equipment and to punch in at the time clocks.
whether waiting time is compensable under the flsa depends on whether an employee is waiting to be engaged or engaged to wait.see generally skidmore,at.idle time may be considered work under the flsa where it is controlled by the employer and the time spent is dominated by the need to serve the employer needs.see armour wantock.the regulations elaborate on this principle by stating that an employee is engaged to wait,working,when the employee is unable to use the time effectively for his own purposes.it belongs to and is controlled by the employer.see citations omitted.the secretary argues that the waiting time spent by the employees is integral to their principal activities,and compensable under the flsa.
first,employees argue that they should be compensated for time spent waiting to punch in at the time clocks.waiting in line to punch in at the time clock is explicitly excluded from compensable activity by c there is no indication that any of the time spent waiting is controlled by the employer.employees have adduced no evidence to counter that conclusion.
second,we turn to the waiting time associated with donning and doffing of clothes.even if we were to find that the employees were engaged to wait under the flsa and its accompanying regulations,the waiting time would qualify as preliminary or postliminary activity under the act.wait time is compensable when it is part of a principal activity,but not if it is preliminary or postliminary activity.vega gasper,cir.when we look at,we find that while the code does not explicitly address the type of waiting time at issue,the code indicates that a reasonable amount of
