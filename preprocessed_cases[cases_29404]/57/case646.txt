miriam jorge brought a discrimination suit against her government employer the district court ruled that jorge cause of action under the age discrimination in employment act adea,was and that her claim under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,a,was foreclosed because she had not exhausted her administrative remedies.after careful perscrutation of the briefs and record,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
this appeal follows a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see.b consequently,we accept the facts as true and indulge all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff favor.lachapelle berkshire life ins,cir.we augment those facts with facts extractable from documentation annexed to or incorporated by reference in the complaint and matters susceptible to judicial notice.see in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir see also beddall state bank trust,cir when,as now,a complaint factual allegations are expressly linked admittedly dependent document the authenticity of which is not challenged,that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under rule b.moreover,the district court appropriately may consider the whole of a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in a complaint,even if that document is not annexed to the complaint.see clorox.proctor gamble comm l,cir.
applying these tenets to the instant record enables us to mine certain additional nuggets of information.the correspondence between jorge attorney and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc most notably,the letter upon which jorge predicates her claim of within this parameter.so to does jorge notice of retirement.with this in mind,we rehearse the relevant facts.
between and,jorge worked for the army and air force exchange services aafes,a commissary program for military personnel administered by the department of defense.in,she became the retail manager of toyland,an store on the premises of fort buchanan which is located in guaynabo,puerto rico.jorge remained in this position for nearly two decades until,at the age of,she elected to make a lateral transfer to the base mu√±iz shoppette which is located at a national guard installation some twelve miles away.jorge claims,and the defendants do not contest,that she was a model employee who,both at toyland and at the shoppette,consistently exceeded sales and performance targets set by senior management.
jorge began working at the shoppette in.soon thereafter,aafes assigned debra baynard to oversee its operations in the region.the relationship between baynard and jorge quickly turned frosty.from jorge point of view,baynard altered the workplace by insisting upon,and rigorously enforcing,an policy and by undermining jorge managerial authority in insidious ways.when jorge complained about baynard policies and practices,baynard allegedly made derogatory comments about her age.
the situation came to a head early in when,during jorge vacation,baynard unilaterally transferred her back to her former position at toyland and filled the position she had occupied at the shoppette with a younger,less experienced man who spoke only english.after jorge vacation ended on march,she met with baynard,who served formal notice of the job shift without offering jorge any explanation for it.
jorge refused to report for duty at toyland.instead,she exhausted her accrued vacation time and sick leave while trying to get herself reinstated at the shoppette.even after her efforts proved unsuccessful,she refused to assume her duties at toyland.in due course,aafes informed her that,pursuant to settled agency regulations,her extended absence had led to the forfeiture of any right she may have had to regain her position at the shoppette.jorge was given two options at that juncture return to toyland or take early retirement.she chose the latter option and,on april,submitted a notice of involuntary early retirement,retroactive to march.
ii.travel of the case 
jorge did not let sleeping dogs lie.her first initiative came in the form of a notice letter,dated may,sent on her behalf to the eeoc.that letter announced her intention to sue for age discrimination.following the expiration of a waiting period,the agency granted jorge leave to sue under the adea.see d.several months then passed with no further action.
on april,jorge commenced an action in the federal district court,seeking relief under,inter alia,the adea and title vii.in her complaint,jorge alleged that she was humiliated both by baynard ageist comments and by the requirement,and that the involuntary transfer to toyland exacerbated this state of affairs.she also characterized her early retirement,for the first time,as a constructive discharge.
jorge complaint named a bevy of defendants,including the secretary of defense,aafes,baynard,two other aafes managers who had assisted baynard in facilitating the transfer,the spouses and conjugal partnerships of the individual defendants,and four unidentified defendants apparently sued as.jorge experienced difficulty in serving the individual defendants other than secretary rumsfeld.she discussed this problem with the assistant united states attorney ausa who was handling the case.the ausa suggested that she dismiss the action without prejudice,see.a,get her ducks in a row,and then refile.eventually,jorge embraced that suggestion and moved to dismiss the complaint without prejudice.the government consented,and the district court granted the motion on september.
jorge commenced a new action,identical to the first in all respects,on march.that action ended in the order of dismissal that undergirds this appeal.we pause to explicate the district court reasoning.
the court first determined that jorge supplemental claims were not cognizable because the adea and title vii comprised the exclusive remedies for claims of age,gender,and national origin discrimination.jorge rumsfeld,civ,slip op.at,unpublished.the court then concluded that the secretary of defense was the only proper defendant in regard to the adea and title vii claims and dismissed the action as to all the other defendants.id.at.these rulings are not contested on appeal,and we do not discuss them.
with respect to jorge title vii claim against the secretary,the lower court noted that jorge sole contact with the eeoc was her letter indicating an intent to sue under the adea.id.at.it thereupon dismissed her title vii claim without prejudice for failure to initiate,much less exhaust,her administrative remedies.id.at.finally,the court noted that jorge adea claim was subject to a statute of limitations.see rossiter potter,cir.in light of that limitations period,the district court held that jorge,who had instituted the operative action a full three years after her involuntary transfer,had sued too late.jorge,slip op.at.for that reason,the court dismissed the adea claim with prejudice.id.this appeal followed.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,jorge limits her assault to the district court disposition of her adea and title vii claims.we consider these lines of attack separately.
a.the adea claim.
the district court held that jorge adea claim was.id.that holding rested on a determination that the cause of action accrued at the time of the involuntary transfer rather than at the time of jorge retirement.see id.concluding that the transfer constituted the gravamen of plaintiff adea claim.jorge assigns error to that determination.we consider her argument,mindful that when,as now,an order of dismissal is premised on the running of the applicable limitations period,we may affirm only if the rule b record leave s no doubt that the asserted claim is.lachapelle,at.
the adea requires that personnel actions affecting most employees who are forty years of age or older be free from discrimination.a.in one sense,the adea treats federal employees as a class apart from other employees.see rossiter,at discussing the statutory scheme.that difference implicates the adea enforcement mechanism whereas most employees must first exhaust administrative remedies before instituting an adea action,see d,a federal employee has the option of bypassing administrative remedies entirely and suing directly in the federal district court.id.c.a federal employee who wishes to avail himself of this bypass option must notify the eeoc of his intent to sue within days following the occurrence of the allegedly unlawful practice and then observe a waiting period before filing suit.id.d.the eeoc is required to notify the putative defendant of the employee intent to sue,but it has no authority to forestall the litigation.id.
in this instance,it is beyond peradventure that jorge gave notice of her intent to sue and that the period elapsed.but because an action prosecuted pursuant to c is subject to a limitations period,rossiter,at,it is less clear whether jorge brought her action within the prescribed time.the uncertainty arises out of a difference of opinion about the accrual date.
on the one hand,the government the district court the last independent act of alleged age discrimination occurred when baynard unilaterally transferred jorge to toyland.on the other hand,jorge argues that her retirement should be treated as an independent act of discrimination.the choice of an accrual date makes a dispositive difference here.jorge commenced this action on march.if the accrual date is the date of the transfer,which occurred during,or just after the end of jorge vacation for simplicity sake,we shall use an approximate date of march,her adea claim is.if however,the accrual date is the date of her retirement which took place on april,retroactive to march,her adea claim is timely.
jorge argument proceeds on the basis of a supposed constructive discharge.that is theoretically feasible a constructive discharge can constitute an adverse employment action under the adea.see,suarez pueblo int l,cir explaining that a charge will lie if the employer has engag ed in a calculated,effort to force an employee to quit.by the same token,an offer of an early retirement package sometimes can be a vehicle for a constructive discharge a worker who is presented with such a package can be said to be constructively discharged if her refusal to accept the offer will result in work or working conditions so onerous or disagreeable that a reasonable person would feel compelled to forsake employment rather than to submit herself to manifold indignities.vega kodak caribbean,cir.the rationale behind this rule is rooted in a desire to ensure that an employer bent on dismissing an employee for reasons can not skirt congress clear prohibition on such discrimination by indirection.see suarez,at.
although jorge would have us believe that the employer offer of early retirement here was tantamount to a constructive discharge and,thus,an independent act of discrimination giving rise to her adea claim,her when read with full deference to its factual to bear out this assertion.jorge troubles evidently stemmed from the sequence of events exemplifying the harassing behavior of her new supervisor.that sequence of events began in and culminated in the order transferring her to toyland.jorge refused to accept that transfer,even though it entailed no loss of pay,benefits,status,or the like because that transfer entailed no tangible diminution,it did not,without more,sink to the level of indignity necessary to make out a prima facie case of constructive discharge.see suarez,at.here,there is no more jorge complaint is devoid of any allegations indicating that,by accepting the transfer,she would have been subjected to the kind of indignities against which the adea stands guard.
nor does jorge allege a discriminatory motive behind aafes directive that she report to toyland or take early retirement.when jorge refused to accept the transfer,she did not resign,but remained nominally in aafes employ,drawing salary and benefits from her accumulated vacation time and sick leave while protesting the transfer administratively.by all accounts,it was the refusal to report for work and the passage of time that led to aafes ultimatum,and jorge does not suggest that this action was anything other than standard operating procedure.thus,the toyland transfer constituted the last independent discriminatory act visited upon the district court phrase,it constituted the gravamen of p laintiff complaint,jorge,slip op.at the employer ultimatum that she accept the transfer or retire early was merely an inevitable consequence of that action.it follows that the adea limitations period runs from the date the transfer order was made.
the most pertinent authority for this proposition is the supreme court decision in delaware state college ricks,d.there,a college denied tenure to a faculty member who alleged that the denial was attributable to national origin discrimination.id.at.the administration then offered the faculty member a contract,not subject to renewal.id.at.the offer was accepted and,after the year had run,the faculty member left the school employ.he then sued.the court deemed the case,rejecting the faculty member contention that his employment discrimination claim accrued from the expiration of his terminal contract.id.at.the court held that the plaintiff had neither alleged nor proved that the manner in which his employment was terminated differed discriminatorily from the manner in which the college terminated other professors who also had been denied tenure.id.at.absent such an allegation,the plaintiff loss of employment was merely an inevitable consequence of the earlier tenure decision,and could not constitute a separately actionable event.id.at.in short,the critical datum is the point in time at which the discriminatory act occurred,not the point at which its effects became most injurious.morris gov t dev.bank,cir.
we find the same deficiency in jorge complaint.she has not pled that the choice ultimately given her by aafes differed discriminatorily from the way in which the organization handled personnel matters involving other,similarly situated employees,those who had refused to accept lateral transfers and who had exhausted their vacation and sick leave time.nor has she explained how the employer ultimatum differed in any respect from the employer standard response to younger,similarly situated employees.here,as in ricks,the mere continuity of the employment relationship,in and of itself,is not enough to prolong the life of a cause of action.ricks,at.accord campbell bankboston,cir am.airlines,cir 
jorge makes a effort to resuscitate her adea claim by arguing that the operative tolling date was april,the date when she filed her first action,later dismissed rather than march,the date when she commenced the action presently on appeal.this argument is hopeless march,was the correct tolling date for the statute of limitations calculation.
a voluntary dismissal without prejudice results in a tabula rasa.it renders the proceedings null and void and leaves the parties in the same position as if the action had never been prosecuted.passenger int l ass of machinists,cir in re piper aircraft distrib.antitrust,cir.consequently,a prescriptive period is not tolled by filing a complaint that is subsequently dismissed without prejudice.roche,cir.
equally unavailing is jorge contention that the statute of limitations should be equitably extended due to her attorney misplaced reliance on the ausa suggestion that she dismiss the first action because of the difficulty she was experiencing in locating some of the individual defendants.while the doctrine of equitable estoppel may be invoked when a defendant conduct causes a plaintiff to delay bringing an action or pursuing a claim he or she was entitled to initiate by law,kelley nlrb,cir,this requires affirmative misconduct,see see also lavery marsh,cir.jorge makes no such would the pleaded facts support one.
to say more about the adea claim would be pointless.for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court dismissal of that claim as.
b.the title vii claim.
the district court dismissed jorge title vii claim without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.jorge,slip op.at.jorge assigns error to this ukase as well.she is fishing in an empty stream.
unlike the adea,title vii does not spare fede
