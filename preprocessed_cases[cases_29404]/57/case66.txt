the national labor relations board applies for enforcement of its bargaining order against lily transportation corporation.we grant the application.
pumpernickel express,incorporated,carried automotive parts from warehouses in mansfield,massachusetts,to toyota and chrysler dealerships in the region.pumpernickel drivers were represented by the international association of machinists and aerospace workers,district lodge,local.
in october,pumpernickel filed for bankruptcy,and lily subsequently obtained the portion of pumpernickel business that involved distributing parts for toyota.lily hired many of pumpernickel former employees,including drivers,and began operations in november.the union promptly demanded that lily recognize it as the drivers bargaining representative,but lily refused.lily later produced signed statements it allegedly had received from a majority of the drivers saying that they no longer wished to be represented by the union.
the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the national labor relations board,claiming that lily refusal to bargain violated sections a and a of the national labor relations act after a hearing,the administrative law judge found that in distributing for toyota,lily was a successor employer to pumpernickel,that is,an employer who makes a conscious decision to maintain generally the same business and to hire a majority of its employees from the predecessor,fall river dyeing finishing nlrb,accord asseo centro m√©dico del turabo,cir.the judge held that lily,as a successor,was required under fall river to recognize and bargain with the union,and rejected lily position that its refusal to bargain about terms of employment in the affected unit was justified by the signed employee statements of repudiation.rather,the judge explained,under the successor bar doctrine,as adopted by the board in service,an incumbent union is entitled to represent a successor employer employees for a reasonable period of time for bargaining before its majority status may be questioned.
the board affirmed,agreeing with the administrative law judge that insofar as lily was a successor employer,it was obligated to bargain with the union,and that ugl barred lily from challenging the union majority status until a reasonable period of time for bargaining had elapsed.the board accordingly ordered lily to recognize and bargain with the union.
the board now asks this court to enforce its order over lily objection.lily submits that the board erred in relying on ugl successor bar doctrine and that we should instead substitute only a rebuttable presumption of majority union support under the rule of mv transportation,of the kind the board adopted and enforced prior to its rejection in ugl.lily also says that it has rebutted that presumption with its documentary evidence that a majority of the affected drivers no longer support the union.
lily objection to the successor bar implicates some doctrinal history.the national labor relations act provides neither bar nor presumption to address the unstable labor climate that can develop in successor employment,a silence the board has seen as leaving a statutory gap needing to be filled.in,it adopted a successor bar partially resembling its present iteration,in elizabeth manor.there,the board held that once a successor employer obligation to recognize an incumbent union attaches under fall river,the union is entitled to a reasonable period of time for bargaining without challenge to its majority status.id.at.the board recognized that it was overruling its previous decision of some years earlier in southern moldings,which had held that at the beginning of a successorship situation a union generally enjoys only a rebuttable presumption of continuing majority membership support.elizabeth manor,at.
just three years later,though,in mv transportation,the board overturned elizabeth manor in favor of the rebuttable presumption.the board declared that the presumption represented the appropriate balance between the two fundamental purposes of the national labor relations act,that is,employee freedom of choice and the maintenance of stability in bargaining relationships.id.at.in some circumstances,it said,the successor bar could preclude employees from making a choice of representation for as long as several years,id.at,and as an example it cited the possible combination of the successor bar and a bar running for three years from the execution of a collective bargaining agreement,id.one board member dissented,however,citing the dramatic increase in the number of corporate mergers and acquisitions over the previous years,and taking that as a reason to argue that the interest of stability should be given greater weight in shaping national labor policy.id.at member liebman,dissenting.
nine years afterwards,in ugl,the board changed course again,citing the figures from the mv transportation dissent along with current statistics.it observed that successorship situations had become increasingly common owing to a rising level of corporate merger and acquisition activity,id.at,and held that the bar better achieves the overall policies of the act,in the context of today economy,than a rebuttable presumption does,id.at.the board did not,however,merely reinstate the elizabeth manor bar,which it modified in two respects.it defined the previously unspecified reasonable period of time for bargaining after the successor arrival as being between six months and a year,depending on the circumstances.id.at.the board also provided a special variant of the bar for successorship situations that involve successorship followed by execution of a collective bargaining agreement.it reduced that latter bar duration to two years,so as to mitigate the limitation on employee choice or other challenges that could previously have resulted from adding the contract and successor bars together.id.at.it is the successor bar thus doubly modified that is at stake here.
lily attacks the board reliance on ugl successor bar on two grounds that a bar to challenging the union support,as distinguished from a rebuttable presumption,deserves no judicial deference under chevron nat.res.def.council,because it flatly violates employees rights under section of the national labor relations act to choose or reject union representation and that the board irregularity in successor cases,switching back and forth between rebuttable presumption and bar rules,most recently in the elizabeth manor,mv transportation,and ugl sequence,independently disentitles the current bar rule to the judicial deference that an otherwise lawful administrative rule of decision would deserve if consistently applied.
the claim of a section violation on these facts is untenable.to be sure,we can imagine bars on challenges to unions so patently arbitrary as to run afoul of the section guarantee a bar following certification,say.the bar choice here,however,is for a newly limited period alone or in tandem with the contract bar,a fact that lily disregards on the apparent absolutist theory that duration is not of the essence in its view,any bar,no matter its length,would unlawfully burden section rights.but the assumption that a bar per se patently trespasses on section while some rebuttable presumptions would not does not survive scrutiny.if we compare a bar with a presumption,we may easily suspect that the burdens of the bar on employees section rights would be demonstrably the heavier of the two alternatives and require a comparatively more powerful justification to fall within the zone of reasonable agency action.but if the comparison is between a bar and a rebuttable presumption for the same period,the bar could turn out to be the lighter of the two,given the added burden of rebuttal that would come with the presumption,which could increase litigation time and expense,as against a proceeding free of the presumption.thus,lily argument that any bar is forbidden because it burdens the exercise of section rights is in tension with its favored alternative of a rebuttable presumption,which does the same and could be the more onerous of the two depending on the time period involved.
the board is thus within the zone of reason in rejecting a neat,categorical distinction between the two species of rules.each serves the obviously legitimate objective of stability in labor and management relations during a period in which the entrance of new management can destroy the prior modus operandi among union,employer,and employees.see fall river,at.in those circumstances,for example,there may well be a risk that employees will,rightly or wrongly,blame the incumbent union for the demise or departure of the old employer,or will fear that support for a union will jeopardize jobs with the new boss.see id.thus,some limited discouragement of an unduly hasty reexamination of a prior section choice serves to provide time for second thoughts,a subject the statute does not directly address in successor cases,but which falls within its underlying purpose.brooks nlrb,accord nlrb beverly,cir.since neither of the competing means to further this legitimate objective,then,is categorically forbidden,the only remaining question in this case goes to the adequacy of the board justification for deciding to impose the newly adjusted bar rule,with particular attention to lily claim that the board has undercut its entitlement to deference by blowing hot and cold in its choices of successor rules.
this inconsistency challenge to ugl calls to the fore the supreme court recent leading case on agency reversal of prior interpretive doctrine,fcc fox television stations,see also encino motorcars,llc navarro,discussing fox the court in fox was unanimous in its acceptance of the view,often expressed,that an agency is not forever bound by an earlier resolution of an interpretive issue,but that a change must be addressed expressly,at least by the agency articulate recognition that it is departing from its precedent.see fox,at id.at kennedy,concurring id.at breyer,dissenting see also ass of home builders epa,cir.stating that the core requirement that fox makes clear an agency must meet when changing course is to provide reasoned explanation for its action,which would ordinarily demand that it display awareness that it is changing position quoting fox,at.there was disagreement between majority and dissent,however,on the detail necessary to justify an overruling decision,compare fox,at,with id.at breyer,dissenting,with justice kennedy view generally in the majority taking the position that reversing course requires reasoned explanation,id.at kennedy,concurring.nonetheless,all views were in accord that an on a rule owing to facts changed from those underlying the prior view requires that the new facts be addressed explicitly by reasoned explanation for the change of direction.see id.at majority opinion id.at kennedy,j,concurring id.at breyer,dissenting see also modesto irrigation dist.gutierrez,cir.describing fox as holding that an agency must provide a greater justification for changing a policy when the new policy rests upon changed facts.
this is such a case.changes from the significant factual bases of the earlier rule were essential to the board departure from precedent in ugl,where two such developments received attention.
the first concerned corporate business activity,as the board in ugl emphasized the fact stressed by the dissenting board member in mv transportation merger and acquisition activity was much increased from the quieter heyday of the presumption rule of southern moldings.ugl,at.in ugl,the board majority brought the supporting statistics up to date,and showed,in this respect,that the volume of mergers and acquisitions had not substantially declined since the mv transportation majority ignored them.id.at.the ugl board noted that,in,merger and acquisition announcements numbered,with transactions valued at billion that in,two years before mv transportation was decided,the numbers had increased to and trillion and,finally,that following a drop after,the numbers had ris en again,peaking in,before another decline,which now seems over.id.the board also cited an article claiming that conditions were ripe for a b oom in mergers and acquisitions in,the year in which the ugl board was writing.id.citing frank aquila,conditions are ripe for an boom in,bloomberg business week.
lily tries to disparage the board reliance on these statistics by asking what they are supposed to prove.but we do not think the decision gets a failing grade for dereliction in spelling out the point the board was making,since it seems clear enough that the corporate activity in question carries significant consequences under the fall river successor rule.the greater the number of mergers and acquisitions,the greater the number of those that will produce a fall river successor employer.the greater the number of successor situations with unionized employees,the greater the potential volatility in relationships across the national labor market.the greater the level of that instability,the greater the likelihood of precipitate disruption in litigation challenging union support during the unsettled period with the new employer.this risk would not only affect the actual employment relations in the market overall owing to the quantity of successorships,but by the same token would also portend a heavier burden on the administrative law machinery,including the board itself,in administering the national labor relations act.
these obviously apparent consequences answer not only lily objection to the reliance on the statistics,but its attempt to distance this case from their threat by pointing out that its own successor status follows neither a merger nor an acquisition.but how the fact of successor employment comes about is not to the point.what does matter is simply the probable volume of hasty challenges to union support.it is this that makes the merger and acquisition facts relevant in reexamining the mv transportation rule and in concluding that a bar would serve stability in labor relations better in a market likely to be fraught with higher numbers of upsets than in the world of forty years ago 
the ugl board relied on another set of changed facts in justifying its return to a successor bar.these facts are notable in that they were actually subject to the board control,which the board exercised by modifying its own rules in respects not independently challenged here.the mv transportation majority justified its rejection of a bar rule by showing how long a period of union immunity to challenge might stretch out if the elizabeth manor successor bar period of a reasonable but unspecified time was combined with other bars.the mv transportation board explained in this way 
it is possible that the successor bar could preclude the employees exercise of their section rights for as long as several years.for example,a successor employer could engage in bargaining with the incumbent union and,prior to the expiration of a reasonable period of time,reach agreement with the union on a new agreement,which then would serve as a bar to a representation petition for the duration of the contract,up to a period of years.moreover,the incursion on the employees freedom of choice could be even more severe up to years if the union and the predecessor employer were parties to a agreement that served to bar any employee efforts to remove or replace the union prior to the successor assumption of operations.
at.the board in ugl treated this as a serious objection,see at,to which it responded by decreeing the following modifications of bar rules as previously imposed.first,as to the successor bar,the board tightened the formerly undefined reasonable period of time,setting it at a minimum but no longer than a year,depending on circumstances.id.at.second,the board modified the contract bar doctrine,holding that where a first contract is reached between the successor employer and the incumbent union within the successor bar newly specified reasonable time,and where there was no open period permitting the filing of a union challenge petition during the final year of the predecessor employer bargaining relationship with the union,the period would be a maximum of two years,instead of three.id.at.
thus,in responding to the mv tr
