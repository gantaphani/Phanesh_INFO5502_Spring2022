an arbitration panel awarded appellant robert fenyk in back pay based on a claim that he was unlawfully terminated from his job as a stock broker because he is an alcoholic.the district court vacated the award,concluding that the arbitrators lacked authority to grant that remedy because fenyk brought no claims under the state law the arbitrators applied.fenyk now seeks reinstatement of the award,arguing that the district court failed to give due deference to the arbitrators ruling.
we reverse the district court judgment.although the arbitration decision may have been incorrect as a matter of law,it was not beyond the scope of the panel authority.
factual background 
appellant fenyk was associated with appellee raymond james financial services rjfs as a securities broker for more than seven years,first in new york city and then,beginning in october,in vermont.fenyk managed his own small branch office in vermont and was designated an independent contractor for rjfs under his agreement with the company.rjfs is based in florida,and the independent sales associate agreement that fenyk signed contained a provision stating that florida law would govern disputes between the parties.fenyk also signed rjfs business ethics policy,in which he agreed to arbitrate any conflicts arising out of the independent contractor relationship.
in may,during a routine check of fenyk customer communications,an rjfs reviewer noticed an email to a client,fenyk former domestic partner,suggesting that fenyk had an alcohol problem.the email began with information about the client account,but went on to note fenyk slip and his need for meetings and real sobriety for a dialoug sic with you.the email also reported that fenyk new aa friend was very hard on him last night.
the reviewer alerted fenyk rjfs supervisors in florida to the email.on may,thomas harrington,regional director for the northeast,and john tholen,the assistant regional director,called fenyk and told him they were no longer comfortable supervising him from afar and his contract would be terminated in thirty days harrington testified that he decided to terminate fenyk affiliation with rjfs as a result of the email because he was concerned about fenyk ongoing sobriety and the possibility that he was transacting business with clients while he had an alcohol problem.although fenyk employment with rjfs initially was extended beyond the thirty days so he could arrange a sale of his client book to another rjfs broker,the relationship ended on july,after fenyk decided not to proceed with that sale.
approximately two years later,in june,fenyk filed a complaint in vermont state court alleging that he had been fired on account of his sexual orientation and his status as a recovering alcoholic,in violation of vermont fair employment practices act vfepa.stat.ann.tit.once alerted by rjfs of his obligation to arbitrate employment disputes,fenyk dismissed the complaint and brought an arbitration proceeding before the financial industry regulatory authority finra.his finra statement of claim reiterated the same two causes of action asserted in his court complaint retaliation based on sexual orientation and disability,in violation of vermont law.fenyk sought in back pay,in front pay,and in punitive damages,along with attorney fees and costs.
in addition to denying the allegations of discriminatory action,rjfs responded to fenyk filing by asserting that vermont law did not apply to the parties relationship,and thus the vermont claims necessarily failed that fenyk was an independent contractor,not an employee,and was therefore not protected by either florida or vermont employment discrimination law and that his claims were.
a hearing was held before a panel of three arbitrators in january.on the opening day,fenyk asked to amend his complaint to add a claim under the americans with disabilities act,noting that the federal law mirrors the vermont and florida employment discrimination statutes and that,hence,there would be no prejudice to the defense.counsel for rjfs objected to the proposed amendment as untimely,stating that she had responded to the claims that have been proffered.she further noted that fenyk had not,in fact,alleged discrimination per se,but had only asserted claims for retaliation.fenyk did not at that time propose to add claims under florida law.
the panel proceeded without deciding whether to accept fenyk proposed amendment and,following the hearing,fenyk again moved to amend his statement of claim,this time seeking to add disability discrimination claims under federal,new york,and florida law he argued that the statutes and the elements of the claims are essentially the same,as are the interpretive judicial decisions,though he noted that damage awards are handled differently under the various provisions.
on the same day he filed his renewed motion to amend,fenyk also filed a brief,in which he noted that he originally had asserted claims under vermont law but had since moved to add claims for violations of other relevant jurisdictions.he repeated his assertion that the state statutes are similar to each other and to federal law,forbid ding employers from engaging in discriminatory practices against their employees,again acknowledging that the statutory remedies differed.he urged the panel,inter alia,to grant his motion to amend his statement of claim to add claims under federal,new york and florida law.
in its brief,rjfs pressed the panel to reject fenyk proposed amendment the company argued,inter alia,that fenyk had violated finra rules by making the motion outside the prescribed time period,rjfs would be prejudiced by the belated amendment,and the proposed ada claim should in any event be rejected as.rjfs acknowledged that florida employment discrimination law substantially differs from vermont law only in its treatment of sexual orientation,and asserted that,even under vermont principles,florida law would apply.
arbitration ruling 
in march,the arbitration panel denied fenyk motion to amend his statement of claim,finding that the request was untimely and there were no special circumstances alleged to justify such relief.at the same time,however,the panel granted what it described as a request from both parties that florida law be applied to the proceedings the panel subsequently refused to reconsider its denial of fenyk motion to amend.
the arbitrators announced their ruling on the merits in late april,issuing only a brief statement of their conclusions.see zayas bacardi,cir although arbitrators frequently elect to explain their decisions in written opinions,they are under no compulsion to do so.we reproduce here the complete award section of their decision.
after considering the pleadings,the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing,and the submissions,the panel has decided in full and final resolution of the issues submitted for determination as follows 
respondent is liable for and shall pay to claimant compensatory damages in the amount of for back pay on his claim of discrimination based on disability.
respondent is liable for and shall pay to claimant attorneys fees in the amount of plus litigation expenses in the amount of pursuant to paragraph b of the contract between the parties and of the florida civil rights act.
any other relief sought under claimant claims of statutory discrimination is denied.
any and all relief not specifically addressed herein,including punitive damages,is denied.
the panel also assessed rjfs roughly in arbitration fees.
district court ruling 
rjfs moved in federal court to vacate the arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrators had exceeded their powers by,inter alia,awarding damages on a claim violation of the florida civil rights act fcra that fenyk never submitted to them for their review.verified petition to vacate an arbitration award,at.the district court agreed with rjfs that the award was unsupportable.the court noted that the arbitration panel had determined that florida law applied,but nonetheless had ignored florida statute of limitations for civil rights claims and somehow construed florida law to find a violation of a vermont statute a statute which,given the governing law,was wholly inapplicable to the case.the court then concluded 
awarding damages to a plaintiff who has pled no claims under the applicable law plainly transgressed the limits of the arbitrators power.for this reason,the award must be vacated.
this appeal by fenyk followed.he argues that the district court erred in construing the florida statute of limitations to bar his claim and improperly failed to defer to the arbitrators good faith effort to resolve the dispute.in response,rjfs reiterates the two primary flaws it has consistently identified in the arbitration decision the panel awarded damages despite its finding that florida law applied and fenyk brought no claims under florida law and even assuming fenyk claims may be analyzed as alleged violations of florida law,such claims fail as under the statute of limitations for initiating a complaint under florida law.

we need not resolve the uncertainty over manifest disregard here.as we explain below,even assuming the doctrine remains available,it would not invalidate the award in this case.
whether the award exceeds the arbitrators authority 
the district court identified two problems with the arbitration panel decision its disregard of florida statute of limitations,and the award of damages despite fenyk failure to bring any claims under florida law the law that everyone now agrees governs his dispute with rjfs.we consider each issue in turn.
statute of limitations 
rjfs argues that fenyk claims,brought two years after his contract was terminated,were barred by florida statute of limitations for civil rights actions the company asserts that fenyk alleged claims under vermont law which has a longer limitations in an attempt to circumvent the florida.that attempt necessarily fails,the company maintains,because florida law governs the controversy.
given the arbitration panel determination that florida law applies to fenyk claims,we agree that florida statute of limitations governs.that judgment does not help rjfs.at the time of the arbitration panel decision,florida law on the applicability of statutory limitations periods to arbitrations was evolving.two weeks after the panel april ruling in this case,the florida supreme court held that a general statute of limitations provision applicable to most state law civil actions also applies to arbitration proceedings.see raymond james fin,phillips,so d,issued may,and revised.the high court ruling came in response to a certified question from an intermediate appellate court,which had held that the provision at issue florida statutes governs arbitrations only if the parties arbitration agreement expressly incorporates a statutory filing deadline.see raymond james fin,phillips,so d,per curiam.in reversing the lower court,the florida supreme court concluded that arbitrations are subject to because the statute defines an action to encompass proceedings,thereby including arbitration proceedings within its scope.see phillips,so d at 
here,the parties debate whether the holding in phillips extends to claims brought under the fcra.stat.ann.however,whether the decision in fact applies to employment discrimination cases such as the one before us does not matter.given the legal uncertainty reflected in the certified question presented to the florida supreme court,and the fact that even serious error by arbitrators will not invalidate their award,any error by the panel in refusing to dismiss fenyk claims as untimely does not rise to the level necessary to justify vacatur.stolt nielsen,at.
the absence of claims under florida law 
the panel award of damages based on florida law,despite its denial of fenyk request to amend his statement of claim to include a claim under the fcra,troubled the district court.we understand its discomfort.yet we can not conclude,in the particular circumstances of this case,that the arbitrators decision to impose liability on rjfs under florida law willfully flouted the governing law or otherwise exceeded the bounds of the arbitrators authority to resolve the parties dispute.stolt nielsen,at internal quotation marks omitted.the reliance on florida law would be a different matter if the pertinent statutes in florida and vermont materially diverged.rjfs acknowledged in its brief,however,that the two states laws are substantially equivalent in covering disability discrimination.see johnson great expressions dental ctrs.of,so d,n
