appellants crystal litz and amanda payne plaintiffs claim unpaid overtime wages for their work as project managers for the saint consulting group,saint consulting.the district court concluded that plaintiffs were highly compensated employees and thus exempt from the overtime pay protections of the fair labor standards act flsa.a.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
the relevant facts are not in dispute.saint consulting is a massachusetts corporation that provides political consulting to land use campaigns across the country.michael saint is its founder,ceo,chairman,and majority shareholder,and patrick fox serves as its president.litz joined saint consulting as a project manager in.her relevant period of employment for this appeal is from october,when she returned to the project manager position after a stint as division manager,until her employment with saint consulting ended in march.amanda payne worked as a project manager for saint consulting from june until october.
the plaintiffs earned well over per year as project managers during the years at issue.for most weeks,their earnings equaled the number of hours they billed to clients multiplied by an hourly rate between and.project managers typically received to per week in gross pay,which means that they typically worked more than hours per week.saint consulting did not pay its project managers at a higher,overtime rate for hours worked beyond hours per week.saint consulting compensation plan for the relevant time provided,however,that a ll project managers will be guaranteed a minimum weekly salary of whether they bill any hours or not.therefore,if a project manager billed hours at a hourly rate,or,she would still receive in pay for that week.if she instead billed hours,she would simply receive,or times.there is no dispute that saint consulting always paid the when the value of a project manager billed hours did not exceed.indeed,payne billed no hours during several weeks and still received per week,designated as minsal or stipen on her paystubs.
in september,former project manager leigh mayo filed suit against saint consulting in the northern district of illinois for unpaid overtime compensation under the flsa.see.litz and payne consented to join the action as party plaintiffs in december and january,respectively.litz became the representative in march after mayo settled with saint consulting.because none of the other project managers opted to join the lawsuit after receiving notice of rights under b,litz and payne were the sole party plaintiffs.
with mayo,an illinois resident,out of the case,saint consulting filed and the court granted an uncontested motion to transfer venue to the district of massachusetts.after the transfer,the plaintiffs sought leave to file a second amended complaint with a claim under the massachusetts overtime statute.see.laws ch.the district court denied their motion,reasoning that the massachusetts statute did not apply because they did not allege that they or any other project manager worked,resided,or had sufficient contact with massachusetts.litz saint consulting,gao,wl.two years later,after both sides filed motions for summary judgment,the plaintiffs asked the district court to reconsider its denial of leave to add a claim under massachusetts overtime law.as support for their motion,the plaintiffs pointed to a new decision by the massachusetts supreme judicial court applying the massachusetts independent contractor statute to new york residents and workers,although,unlike here,a written contract between the parties in that case contained an express choice of massachusetts law provision.taylor eastern connection operating.the district court denied the plaintiffs request.
the district court granted summary judgment on the flsa claim to saint consulting.the plaintiffs appeal from that judgment,as well as from the denial of their motions to amend and reconsider 
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.velázquez pérez developers diversified realty,cir.as the moving party,saint consulting is entitled to summary judgment if it shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
iii.analysis 
a.the plaintiffs flsa claim 
the flsa requires employers to pay nonexempt employees at a higher rate for hours worked beyond hours in a week.a.the flsa exempts from its overtime protection any employee employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity.id.a.the flsa implementing regulations further provide that this exemption applies to highly compensated employees who customarily and regularly perform any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive,administrative or professional employee receive at least in total annual compensation and receive at least per week paid on a salary or fee basis.a,b.saint consulting argues,and the district court agreed,that the plaintiffs satisfied these three requirements.the plaintiffs concede that they satisfied the duties requirement and earned well over annually during the relevant time period,but they argue that they were not paid any amount on a salary basis.
this appeal therefore depends on whether saint consulting paid the stipend on a salary basis within the meaning of a.the stipend was paid on a salary basis if it was a predetermined amount,constituting all or part of the employee compensation,and not subject to reduction because of variation in the quality or quantity of the work performed.id.a.there is no dispute that the stipend was a predetermined amount of per week.the plaintiffs arguments instead apply to the latter two requirements.
the plaintiffs first direct us to two communications from saint and fox that,according to plaintiffs,show that the stipend was subject to reduction because of variations in the quantity of work performed.id.the first is a lengthy email from saint instructing managers to document instances in which a project manager refused assignments or available billable hours outside of their geographic division.after reading the email in its entirety,however,it is clear that saint was trying to make sure his company satisfied project managers who wanted to make more than per year,and not suggesting that the company would reduce stipends notably,in that same email saint explained that project managers had a minimum fixed cost to saint consulting of a year a week minimum and benefits,which suggests that saint did not consider it a possibility to reduce the per year in weekly stipend payments.
the second communication,by contrast,does speak to the possibility of not paying the stipend.it is a brief message from fox instructing managers that the stipend is not to be used like vacation time.if there are hours available for a project manager to bill and they choose not to do the work,they need to use vacation time.we will not pay the stipend in that situation.but the plaintiffs identify no instance where saint consulting actually reduced or did not pay the stipend.without any evidence that saint consulting had an actual practice of reducing the stipend for any project manager,and with an undisputed record showing no project manager was paid less than the stipend amount,this single email can not demonstrate that plaintiffs pay was actually subject to improper deductions.see a b requiring a n actual practice of making improper deductions for an employer to lose the exemption see also,a policy permitting improper deductions is some evidence that an employer has an actual practice of not paying employees on a salary basis,but not sufficient evidence by itself to cause the exemption to be lost if a manager has never used that policy to make any actual deductions.even if saint consulting did require project managers to use vacation time when they rejected available hours,this would only show that the project managers vacation time,and not their salary,was subject to deduction.see mcbride peak wellness,cir employer permissibly deducted employee accrued leave for partial day absences.
the plaintiffs also point to the paystubs generated by saint consultin
