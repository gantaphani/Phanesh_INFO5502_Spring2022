the act increased the size of the national labor relations board board from three members to five,see a,and amended b of the national labor relations act to increase the board quorum requirement from two members to three and to allow the board to delegate its authority to groups of at least three members,see b.in december,the board finding itself with only four members and expecting two more vacancies delegated,inter alia,its powers to a group of three members.on december,one group member appointment expired,but the others proceeded to issue board decisions for the next months as a quorum of a group.two of those decisions sustained unfair labor practice complaints against petitioner,which sought review,challenging the board authority to issue orders.the seventh circuit ruled for the government,concluding that the two members constituted a valid quorum of a group to which the board had legitimately delegated its powers.
held section b requires that a delegee group maintain a membership of three in order to exercise the delegated authority of the board.
a the first sentence of b,the delegation clause,authorizes the board to delegate its powers only to a group of three or more members.this clause is best read to require that the delegee group maintain a membership of three in order for the delegation to remain valid.first,that is the only way to harmonize and give meaningful effect to all of b provisions the delegation clause the vacancy clause,which provides that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board the board quorum requirement,which mandates that three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board and the group quorum provision,which provides that two members shall constitute a quorum of any delegee group.this reading is consonant with the board quorum requirement of three participating members at all times,and it gives material effect to the delegation clause rule.it also permits the vacancy clause to operate to provide that vacancies do not impair the board ability to take action,so long as the quorum is satisfied.and it does not render inoperative the group quorum provision,which continues to authorize a properly constituted delegee group to issue a decision with only two members participating when one is disqualified from a case.the government contrary reading allows two members to act as the board ad infinitum,dramatically undercutting the board quorum requirement significance by allowing its permanent circumvention.it also diminishes the delegation clause requirement by permitting a de facto delegation.by allowing the board to include a third member in the group for only one minute before her term expires,this approach also gives no meaningful effect to the command implicit in both the delegation clause and the board quorum requirement that the board full power be vested in no fewer than three members.second,had congress intended to authorize two members to act on an ongoing basis,it could have used straightforward language.the court interpretation is consistent with the board longstanding practice of reconstituting a delegee group when one group member term expired.
b the government several arguments against the court interpretation that the group quorum requirement and vacancy clause together permit two members of a group to constitute a quorum even when there is no third member that the vacancy clause establishes that a vacancy in the group has no effect and that reading the statute to authorize the board to act with only two members advances the congressional objective of board efficiency are unconvincing.

new process steel,petitioner national labor relations board 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice stevens delivered the opinion of the court.
the act,enacted in,increased the size of the national labor relations board board from three members to five.see a.concurrent with that change,the act amended b of the national labor relations act nlra to increase the quorum requirement for the board from two members to three,and to allow the board to delegate its authority to groups of at least three members.see b.the question in this case is whether,following a delegation of the board powers to a group,two members may continue to exercise that delegated authority once the group and the board membership falls to two.we hold that two remaining board members can not exercise such authority.
as came to a close,the board found itself with four members and one vacancy.it anticipated two more vacancies at the end of the year,when the recess appointments of members kirsanow and walsh were set to expire,which would leave the board with only two members too few to meet the board quorum requirement,b.the four sitting members decided to take action in an effort to preserve the board authority to function.on december,the board made two delegations of its authority,effective as of midnight december.first,the board delegated to the general counsel continuing authority to initiate and conduct litigation that would normally require approval of the board.see minute of board action,app.to brief for petitioner hereinafter board minutes.second,the board delegated to members liebman,schaumber and kirsanow,as a group,all of the board powers,in anticipation of the adjournment of the session of the congress.at.the board expressed the opinion that its action would permit the remaining two members to exercise the powers of the board after the departure of members kirsanow and walsh,because the remaining members will constitute a quorum of the group.ibid.
the board minutes explain that it relied on the statutory language of b,as well as an opinion issued by the office of legal counsel olc,for the proposition that the board may use this delegation procedure to issue decisions during periods when three or more of the five seats on the board are vacant.at.the olc had concluded in that if the board delegated all of its powers to a group of three members,that group could continue to issue decisions and orders as long as a quorum of two members remained.of justice,olc,quorum requirements,app.to brief for respondent.in seeking the olc advice,the board agreed to accept the olc answer regarding its ability to operate with only two members,at,and the board in its minutes therefore acknowledged that it is bound by the olc opinion.board minutes.the board noted,however,that it was not bound to make this delegation rather,it had decided to exercise its discretion to do so.ibid.
on december,the board delegation to the group of members liebman,schaumber,and kirsanow became effective.on december,member kirsanow recess appointment expired.thus,starting on january,members liebman and schaumber became the only members of the board.they proceeded to issue decisions for the board as a quorum of a group.the delegation automatically terminated on march,when the president made two recess appointments to the board,because the terms of the delegation specified that it would be revoked when the board membership returned to at least three members,at.
during the period in which the board had only two members,it decided almost cases.see letter from elena kagan,solicitor general,to william suter,clerk of court.one of those cases involved petitioner new process steel.in september,the board issued decisions sustaining two unfair labor practice complaints against petitioner.see new process steel,lp,new process steel,lp.petitioner sought review of both orders in the court of appeals for the seventh circuit,and challenged the authority of the board to issue the orders.
the court ruled in favor of the government.after a review of the text and legislative history of b and the sequence of events surrounding the delegation of authority in december,the court concluded that the two members constituted a valid quorum of a group to which the board had legitimately delegated all its powers.on the same day that the seventh circuit issued its decision in this case,the court of appeals for the district of columbia announced a decision coming to the opposite conclusion.laurel baye healthcare of lake lanier,nlrb.we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.
the board quorum requirements and delegation procedure are set forth in b of the nlra,stat,as amended by stat,which provides 
the board is authorized to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise.a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board,and three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.b.
it is undisputed that the first sentence of this provision authorized the board to delegate its powers to the group effective on december,and the last sentence authorized two members of that group to act as a quorum of the group during the next three days if,for example,the third member had to recuse himself from a particular matter.the question we face is whether those two members could continue to act for the board as a quorum of the delegee group after december,when the board membership fell to two and the designated group of members liebman,schaumber,and kirsanow ceased to exist due to the expiration of member kirsanow term.construing b as a whole and in light of the board longstanding practice,we are persuaded that they could not.
the first sentence of b,which we will call the delegation clause,provides that the board may delegate its powers only to a group of three or more members.stat.there are two different ways to interpret that language.one interpretation,put forward by the government,would read the clause to require only that a delegee group contain three members at the precise time the board delegates its powers,and to have no continuing relevance after the moment of the initial delegation.under that reading,two members alone may exercise the full power of the board so long as they were part of a delegee group that,at the time of its creation,included three members.the other interpretation,by contrast,would read the clause as requiring that the delegee group maintain a membership of three in order for the delegation to remain valid.three main reasons support the latter reading.
first,and most fundamentally,reading the delegation clause to require that the board delegated power be vested continuously in a group of three members is the only way to harmonize and give meaningful effect to all of the provisions in b.see duncan walker,declining to adopt a construction of the statute,that would render a term insignificant market hoffman,a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be insignificant internal quotation marks omitted.those provisions are the delegation clause the vacancy clause,which provides that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board the board quorum requirement,which mandates that three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board and the group quorum provision,which provides that two members shall constitute a quorum of any delegee group.see b.
interpreting the statute to require the board powers to be vested at all times in a group of at least three members is consonant with the board quorum requirement,which requires three participating members at all times for the board to act.the interpretation likewise gives material effect to the requirement in the delegation clause.the vacancy clause still operates to provide that vacancies do not impair the ability of the board to take action,so long as the quorum is satisfied.and the interpretation does not render inoperative the group quorum provision,which still operates to authorize a delegee group to issue a decision with only two members participating,so long as the delegee group was properly constituted.reading b in this manner,the statute various pieces hang together a critical clue that this reading is a sound one.
the contrary reading,on the other hand,allows two members to act as the board ad infinitum,which dramatically undercuts the significance of the board quorum requirement by allowing its permanent circumvention.that reading also makes the requirement in the delegation clause of vanishing significance,because it allows a de facto delegation to a group,as happened in this case.under the government approach,it would satisfy the statute for the board to include a third member in the group for only one minute before her term expires the approach gives no meaningful effect to the command implicit in both the delegation clause and in the board quorum requirement that the board full power be vested in no fewer than three members.hence,while the government reading of the delegation clause is textually permissible in a narrow sense,it is structurally implausible,as it would render two of b provisions functionally void.
second,and relatedly,if congress had intended to authorize two members alone to act for the board on an ongoing basis,it could have said so in straightforward language.congress instead imposed the requirement that the board delegate authority to no fewer than three members,and that it have three participating members to constitute a quorum.those provisions are at best an unlikely way of conveying congressional approval of a board.indeed,had congress wanted to provide for two members alone to act as the board,it could have maintained the nlra original board quorum provision,see b ed,or provided for a delegation of the board authority to groups of two.the rube delegation mechanism employed by the board in delegating to a group of three,allowing a term to expire,and then continuing with a quorum of a phantom delegee group is surely a bizarre way for the board to achieve the authority to decide cases with only two members.to conclude that congress intended to authorize such a procedure to contravene the board quorum,we would need some evidence of that intent.
the government has not adduced any convincing evidence on this front,and to the contrary,our interpretation is consistent with the longstanding practice of the board.this is the third factor driving our decision.although the board has throughout its history allowed two members of a group to issue decisions when one member of a group was disqualified from a case,see brief for respondent board minutes,the board has not until recently allowed two members to act as a quorum of a defunct group instead,the board concedes that its practice was to reconstitute a delegee group when one group member term expired.brief for respondent,that our interpretation of the delegation provision is consistent with the board longstanding practice is persuasive evidence that it is the correct one,notwithstanding the board more recent view.see bowen georgetown.hospital.
in sum,a straightforward understanding of the text,which requires that no fewer than three members be vested with the board full authority,coupled with the board longstanding practice,points us toward an interpretation of the delegation clause that requires a delegee group to maintain a membership of three.
against these points,the government makes several arguments that we find unconvincing.it first argues that b authorizes the board action by its plain terms,notwithstanding the somewhat fictional nature of the delegation to a group with the expectation that within days it would become a group.in particular,the government contends the group quorum requirement and the vacancy clause together make clear that when the board has delegated its power to a group,any two members of that group constitute a quorum that may continue to exercise the delegated powers,regardless whether the third group member continues to sit on the board and regardless whether a quorum remains in the full board.brief for respondent see also,at.
although the group quorum provision clearly authorizes two members to act as a quorum of a group designated pursuant to the first sentence a group of at least three members it does not,by its plain terms,authorize two members to constitute a valid delegee group.a quorum is the number of members of a larger body that must participate for the valid transaction of business.see black law dictionary ed.defining quorum as the minimum number of members who must be present for a deliberative assembly to legally transact business oxford english dictionary ed.a fixed number of members of any body whose presence is necessary for the proper or valid transaction of business webster new international dictionary ed.such a number of the officers or members of any body as is,when duly assembled,legally competent to transact business but the fact that there are sufficient members participating to constitute a quorum does not necessarily establish that the larger body is properly constituted or can validly exercise authority in other words,that only two members must participate to transact business in the name of the group,does not establish that the group itself can exercise the board authority when the group membership falls below three.
the government nonetheless contends that quorum rules ordinarily define the number of members that is both necessary and sufficient for an entity to take an action.brief for respondent.therefore,because of the quorum provision,if at least two members of a delegee group actually participate in a decision that should be the end of the matter,regardless of vacancies in the group or on the board.ibid.but even if quorum provisions ordinarily provide the rule for dealing with vacancies,even if they ordinarily make irrelevant any vacancies in the remainder of the larger body the quorum provisions in b do no such thing.rather,there is a separate clause addressing vacancies.the vacancy clause,recall,provides that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.b ed.we thus understand the quorum provisions merely to define the number of members who must participate in a decision,and look to the vacancy clause to determine whether vacancies in excess of that number have any effect on an entity authority to act.
the government argues that the vacancy clause establishes that a vacancy in the group has no effect.but the clause speaks to the effect of a vacancy in the board on the authority to exercise the powers of the board it does not provide a delegee group authority to act when there is a vacancy in the group.it is true that any vacancy in the group is necessarily also a vacancy in the board although the converse is not true,and that a group exercises the delegated powers of the board.but b explicitly distinguishes between a group and the board throughout,and in light of that distinction we do not think board should be read to include group when doing so would negate for all practical purposes the command that a delegation must be made to a group of at least three members.
some courts have nonetheless interpreted the quorum and vacancy provisions of b by analogizing to an appellate panel,which may decide a case even though only two of the three initially assigned judges remain on the panel.see,nlrb.the governing statute provides that a case may be decided by separate panels,each consisting of three judges,b,but that a majority of the number of judges authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof shall constitute a quorum,d.we have interpreted that statute to requir e the inclusion of at least three judges in the first instance,but to allow a quorum to proceed to judgment when one member of the panel dies or is disqualified.nguyen united states.but,which addresses the assignment of particular cases to panels,is a world apart from this statute,which authorizes the standing delegation of all the board powers to a small group given the difference between a panel constituted to decide particular cases and the creation of a standing panel plenipotentiary,which will decide many cases arising long after the third member departs,there is no basis for reading the statutes similarly.moreover,our reading of the court of appeals quorum provision was informed by the longstanding practice of allowing two judges from the initial panel to proceed to judgment in the case of a vacancy,see,and as we have already explained,the board practice has been precisely the opposite.
finally,we are not persuaded by the government argument that we should read the statute to authorize the board to act with only two members in order to advance the congressional objective of board efficiency.brief for respondent.in the government view,congress establishment of the quorum for a delegee group reflected its comfort with practice,when the board regularly issued decisions with only two members,at.but it is unsurprising that two members regularly issued board decisions prior to,because the statute then provided for a board quorum of two.see b ed.congress changed that requirement to a quorum for the board.as we noted above,if congress had wanted to allow the board to continue to operate with only two members,it could have kept the board quorum requirement at two 
furthermore,if congress had intended to allow for a board,it is hard to imagine why it would have limited the board power to delegate its authority by requiring a delegee group of at least three members.nor do we have any reason to surmise that congress overriding objective in amending b was to keep the board operating at all costs the inclusion of the quorum and delegation provisions indicate otherwise.robert rules of order,ed.the requirement of a quorum is a protection against totally unrepresentative action in the name of the body by an unduly small number of persons 
in sum,we find that the board quorum requirement and the delegation clause should not be read as easily surmounted technical obstacles of little to no import.our reading of the statute gives effect to those provisions without rendering any other provision of the statute superfluous the delegation clause still operates to allow the board to act in panels of three,and the group quorum provision still operates to allow any panel to issue a decision by only two members if one member is disqualified.our construction is also consistent with the board longstanding practice with respect to delegee groups.we thus hold that the delegation clause requires that a delegee group maintain a membership of three in order to exercise the delegated authority of the board.
we are not insensitive to the board understandable desire to keep its doors open despite vacancies nor are we unaware of the costs that delay imposes on the litigants.if congress wishes to allow the board to decide cases with only two members,it can easily do so.but until it does,congress decision to require that the board full power be delegated to no fewer than three members,and to provide for a board quorum of three,must be given practical effect rather than swept aside in the face of admittedly difficult circumstances.section b,as it currently exists,does not authorize the board to create a tail that would not only wag the dog,but would continue to wag after the dog died.
the judgment is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
new process steel,petitioner national labor relations board 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice kennedy,with whom justice ginsburg,justice breyer,and justice sotomayor join,dissenting.
as of the day this case was argued before the court,the national labor relations board board,constituted as a board,had operated with but two members for more than months.that state of affairs,to say the least,was not ideal.this may be an underlying reason for the court conclusion.despite the fact that the statute plain terms permit a quorum of a properly designated group to issue orders,the court holds that the quorum lost all authority to act once the third member left the board.under the court holding,the board was unauthorized to resolve the more than cases it addressed during those months in the course of carrying out its responsibility to remove obstructions to the free flow of commerce through the promotion of industrial peace.nlrb fansteel metallurgical.this result is removed even farther from the ideal and from congressional intent,as revealed in the statutory design.so it is hard to make the case that the court interpretation of the statute either furthers its most evident purposes or leads to the more sensible outcome.
indeed,in my view,the objectives of the statute,which must be to ensure orderly operations when the board is not at full strength as well as efficient operations when it is,are better respected by a statutory interpretation that dictates a result opposite to the one reached by the court.and in all events,the outcome of the case is but a check on the accuracy of the textual analysis and here the text of the statute,which must control,does not support the holding of the court.these reasons,and those to be further discussed,inform this respectful dissent.
the board,by statute,consists of five members.a.section b provides a mechanism in which the board can delegate all of its powers to a group.as relevant here,the statute consists of three parts.first,a delegation clause 
the board is authorized to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise.
then,a vacancy clause 
a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.
and finally,immediately following the vacancy clause,are the board and group quorum provisions 
a nd three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.
as the court acknowledges,ante,at,the group of members liebman,schaumber,and kirsanow were a group designated pursuant to the first sentence of b.as such,a quorum of that group had statutory authorization to issue orders and that is precisely what members liebman and schaumber did.because the group was properly designated under b and a quorum of the group was authorized to act under the statute plain terms,its actions were lawful.see connecticut nat.bank germain,i n interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one,cardinal canon before all others.c ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says 
nothing in the statute suggests that a delegation to a group expires when one member seat becomes vacant,as the court holds today.in other contexts,it is settled law that a vacancy in a delegee group does not void the initial delegation.see nguyen united states,concerning vacancies in panels of the courts of appeals.any doubt on that point should be resolved by this specific statutory instruction a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.members liebman and schaumber were exercising the powers of the board as its remaining members yet the court today holds that the vacancy impaired their right to exercise those powers in hundreds of cases.that conclusion is contrary to the statutory mandate.
by its holding,the court rejects a straightforward reading that it acknowledges is textually permissible.ante,at.it does so because,in its view,it is structurally implausible.ante,at.but the only textually permissible reading of b authorizes a quorum of a delegee group to issue orders,as was done here and in any event there is no structural implausibility in reading the statute according to its plain terms.
the court reads the statute to require a delegee group to maintain three members.unable to find this requirement in the statute text,the court gives three reasons for its interpretation.those reasons do not withstand scrutiny.
the first reason the court gives for its interpretation is that reading the statute to require a delegee group to maintain three members is the only way to harmonize and give meaningful effect to all of the provisions in b.ante,at.this is not so.but it should be further noted that the argument advanced by the court is not that the government interpretation of the statute renders any provision superfluous or without a role to play in the statutory scheme.instead,the court surmises that certain provisions would not have meaningful,material,or practical effect,ante,at.but that is just to say that the court has determined,in its own judgment,that some provisions should have a greater role than provided by the text of the statute.
the government reading of the statute does not render any clause meaningless.the full board must have three or more members in order to conduct any business,including delegating its authority to a group,as required under the board quorum provision.this provision applies at all times to the board acting as a whole.two members of the board could not conduct any business unless they were previously designated by the full board as members of a delegee group with such authority.any delegation of the board authority must be to at least three members,as required by the delegation clause.any group to which the board has properly delegated its authority must have two members present to act,as required by the group quorum provision.this reading gives the delegation clause and each of the quorum provisions independent meaning.
where two members act as a quorum of a group,the statute unlike the court is indifferent to the reason for the third member absence,be it illness,recusal,or vacancy.the court would hold that two members of a group can act as a quorum so long as the third absence is not due to a vacancy yet the vacancy clause makes it clear that the authority of board members to act shall not be impaired by vacancies.the clause includes all members,including those acting as part of groups.
the court in effect would rewrite the group quorum provision to say,two members shall constitute a quorum of any group unless the third member absence is due to a vacancy.even if the statute said nothing about vacancies,this would be a misreading of the quorum provision.a quorum is the minimum number of members who must be present for a deliberative assembly to legally transact business.see black law dictionary ed.hereinafter black.as the court has made clear in the past,quorum requirements are generally indifferent to the reasons underlying any particular member absence.see nguyen,at.
for instance,the court has previously discussed a statute governing the delegation of power to panels of the federal courts of appeals.ibid.that statute provides a majority of the number of judges authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof shall constitute a quorum.d.while the statute makes no mention of vacancies,the court had little trouble concluding that the statute permits a quorum to proceed to judgment when one member of the panel dies or is disqualified.nguyen,supra,at.the court today offers to distinguish nguyen as being informed by the longstanding practice of allowing two judges from the initial panel to proceed to judgment in the case of a vacancy.ante,at.but there was little if any reliance on any such practice in nguyen.in noting that its conclusion was a matter of settled law,the court relied on the text of the statute and a single case that itself looked directly to the statutory text of d.nguyen,supra,at citing united states allied stevedoring,hand.
if the group quorum provision leaves any room for doubt that it applies in cases of vacancy,its application is made clearer by the vacancy clause itself.that clause states in unequivocal terms that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.b.the court makes much of the fact that the statute refers to a vacancy in the board rather than in a group.but the former category subsumes the latter.that is,the phrase a vacancy in the board covers the entire universe of instances in which there may be a vacancy in a group,because all group members are board members.
the court counters that the vacancy clause speaks to the effect of a vacancy in the board on the authority to exercise the powers of the board,ante,at,as opposed to a vacancy in a group.but the court abridged restatement of the vacancy clause suffers from a critical imprecision.the court point would be well taken if the vacancy clause stated that a vacancy in the board shall not affect the power of the board to operate.but the clause instead states that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.delegee groups consist of members exercising the powers of the board.this clause thus instructs that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of members to exercise the board powers,an authority that members of delegee groups possess.but under the court reading,vacancies in the board will often impair the right of the remaining members to exercise the powers of the board,notwithstanding the explicit statutory command to the contrary.
in an effort to avoid the mandates of the group quorum provision,as buttressed by the vacancy clause,the court relies on the delegation clause.the court reads the clause as requiring a delegee group to maintain three members in order for its authority to remain intact.in my respectful submission,this reading of the statute,in which any vacancy in a delegee group somehow invalidates the delegation itself,has no textual basis.contrary to the court and petitioner assertions,the delegation clause is not rendered unimportant under the government interpretation.the delegation clause establishes what is required for delegation in the first instance,while the vacancy clause and the group quorum provision allow the delegee group to proceed in the event that a member term expires or a member resigns.
congress could have required a delegee group to maintain three members,but it did not do so instead,it included a vacancy clause that is an explicit rejection of such a requirement.that is no doubt why the court reading has not been adopted by the five courts of appeals to have rejected its result.see teamsters local union nlrb,narricot,nlrb,snell island snf llc nlrb,northeastern land,nlrb.while one court of appeals reached the same result as the court,it too did not adopt the court reasoning that a delegee group must maintain three members.laurel baye healthcare of lake lanier,nlrb,cadc t his delegee group may act with two members so long as the board quorum requirement is,at all times,satisfied 
the court reasons for nonetheless reading this requirement into the statutory text bring me to its second point.
the court textual arguments in the end reduce to a single objection the government reading of b allows two board members to act as the full board,thereby eviscerating the requirement that the board only operate with a quorum or as panels.this animates the court second reason for departing from the statutory text,as the court suggests that had congress intended to authorize two members alone to act for the board on an ongoing basis,it could have said so in straightforward language.ante,at.but congress undoubtedly permitted two members to act for the board even under the court interpretation,two members are authorized to exercise the full powers of the board so long as they are part of a delegee group that has fallen to two members due to any reason other than vacancy.ante,at t he group quorum provision still operates to allow any panel to issue a decision by only two members if one member is disqualified 
the court complaint,then,can not be that congress did not intend two members to exercise the powers of the board it must be that congress did not intend to allow two members to do so for protracted periods of time.the court is likely correct that congress did not expect a quorum to operate as the board for extended periods,but unintended consequences are typically the result of unforeseen circumstances.and it should be even more evident that congress did not intend the board to cease operating entirely for an extended period of time,as the court interpretation of b now ordains.members liebman and schaumber issued more than opinions when they operated as a quorum of a properly designated group 
those decisions resolved a wide variety of disputes over union representation and allegations of unfair labor practices,including cases involving employers discharges of employees for exercising their statutory rights disputes over secret ballot elections in which employees voted to select a union representative protests over employers withdrawal of recognition from union representatives designated by employees refusals by employers or unions to honor their obligation to bargain in good faith and challenges to the requirement that employees pay union dues as a condition of employment.brief for respondent footnotes omitted.
the court objection,that congress could have been more explicit if it wanted two members to operate as the board,is misplaced.there is nothing inconsistent about congress preferring board decisions to be made by three members and advancing that preference through statutory requirements,while at the same time providing exceptions for suboptimal circumstances,such as those presented here.quorum provisions do not express the legislature judgment about the optimal number of members that should be present to transact business they set a floor that,while less than ideal,provides a minimum number of participants necessary to protect against totally unrepresentative action.robert rules of order,ed.
one likely reason congress did not permit the board to delegate its authority to groups in the first instance is that congress wanted to avoid groups in the mine run of cases.congress statutory scheme achieved that goal,as the court review of the board historical practices aptly demonstrates.ante,at.congress nonetheless provided for quorums to operate in extraordinary circumstances,where the board has exercised its discretion to delegate its authority to a particular group,and one member of such a group is unavailable for whatever reason.the board delegation to a group that ultimately dwindled to two was a thoughtful and considerate exercise of its reasonable discretion when it was confronted with two imperfect alternatives.
during the past two years,events have turned what congress had undoubtedly thought would be an extraordinary circumstance into an ordinary one,through no fault of the board.that is no reason to dispense with the statutory regime that is prescribed when these circumstances arise,even when they unexpectedly persist.
the court final reason for its interpretation is the board longstanding practice of reconstituting panels whenever they drop below three members due to a vacancy.but see,nlrb,upholding decision from a delegee group after third member retired.the commonsense conclusion from this practice,however,is that the board respects the superiority of groups to quorums of those groups.that the board reconstitutes its panels to include three members does not demonstrate that a group lacks the authority to act when recomposition is not an option.
the court is mistaken,then,when it suggests that,if quorums were permissible,the board would have a practice of allowing quorums to persist without reconstituting panels.persuasive authority shows the contrary to be true.in,the office of legal counsel advised that two members can operate as a quorum of a properly designated group,even if the other seats on the board are vacant.the board agreed to be bound by that opinion.see of justice,office of legal counsel,quorum requirements,app.to brief for respondent.six months later,board member acosta resigned.see nlrb bulletin,ronald meisburg receives recess appointment from president bush to be nlrb member.despite olc opinion and the board position that quorums could exercise the full powers of the board,the board prudently reconstituted each panel on which member acosta served before his departure because there were enough members of the board to do so.its own prudent actions should not be used as a reason t
