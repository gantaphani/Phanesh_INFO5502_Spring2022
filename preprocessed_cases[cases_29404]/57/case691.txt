bernard glista,who is in his,was diagnosed in january with primary lateral sclerosis pls,a rare neurological disorder that arises in adults in mid to late life and causes progressive weakness in the muscles of the face,arms,and legs and eventual loss of basic motor functions such as speech and swallowing.although survival is possible,those afflicted can die within as few as three years from onset.
glista,who had just changed jobs in the summer of,filed a claim for disability benefits with his new employer under its disability plan the plan,administered by unum life insurance company of america under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.the plan grants unum,as plan administrator,discretion to determine eligibility for benefits and to interpret plan provisions.unum found that glista was disabled but denied his claim on the ground that his pls was a condition and,hence,was within an exclusion from coverage.
this case requires that we address for the first time two questions of general import a the admissibility in erisa cases of internal guidelines and training materials that interpret certain plan terms and are promulgated by the plan administrator and b whether a plan administrator may defend a denial of benefits on the basis of a different reason than that articulated to the claimant during the internal review process.we decline to adopt rules as to either question.we conclude that such internal documents are admissible under certain conditions,which are met here.we also conclude that where a plan administrator articulates in litigation an additional reason for denial of benefits that differs from the reasons articulated to the plaintiff,reviewing courts have a range of options available.here,we decline to consider the merits of the reason not articulated to glista.considering only the reason articulated to glista,we conclude that the denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious.
on june,glista left his position as a senior sales director at picturetel.his disability coverage under picturetel unum plan stopped that day.fifteen days later,on july,glista began work at ezenia,as the vice president of worldwide sales,and started receiving disability coverage under a different unum plan,one for ezenia employees the plan.his coverage under the plan became effective on july.
the plan provides that w hen making a benefit determination under the policy,unum has discretionary authority to determine the claimant eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and provisions of the policy.the terms of the plan provide coverage for claimants who are disabled for more than days.one is disabled if one is limited from performing the material and substantial duties of one regular occupation due to one sickness or injury and has a or more loss in one indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury emphasis omitted.
the plan,however,does not cover any disabilities caused by,contributed to by,or resulting from a condition the clause.the plan states that 
you have a condition if 
you received medical treatment,consultation,care or services including diagnostic measures,or took prescribed drugs or medicines in the months just prior to your effective date of coverage the treatment clause or you had symptoms for which an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a health care provider in the months just prior to your effective date of coverage the symptoms clause and 
the disability begins in the first months after your effective date of coverage.
the plan glossary defines condition the glossary definition as 
a condition for which you received medical treatment,consultation,care or services including diagnostic measures,or took prescribed drugs or medicines for your condition during the given period of time as stated in the plan or you had symptoms for which an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a health care provider during the given period of time as stated in the plan.
glista coverage under the plan began on july.hence,the period to which the plan refers the period was april,through july.
on april,during the period,glista saw anthony pikus for a slowly progressive sense of left lower extremity weakness over the past several months,pain in his left heel and proximal lateral arm,and discomfort in his area.pikus prescribed naprosyn for the pain and referred glista to a neurologist.
on may,glista saw david kolb,a neurologist,who performed a neurological exam.the exam revealed some weakness in glista foot and shoulder.kolb also noted a finding of hyperreflexia,observing that glista reflexes were quite hyperactive and perhaps beats of clonus could intermittently be elicited at the left ankle.in addition,kolb observed that glista left heel pain does not have a radicular quality.kolb requested an electromyography test emg of the left leg and left shoulder girdle to check for any component of lower motor neuron involvement.primary lateral sclerosis pls,the disease with which glista was ultimately diagnosed in january,involves a purely upper motor neuron deficit.
the emg,which was done on june,revealed m ild chronic reinnervation change,most likely in an distribution.in response,kolb requested a lumbar and cervical mri and prescribed anaprox.the mris,conducted on june,showed conjoining of the left and nerve roots,a possible minimal mass effect on the left nerve root,degenerative disc disease at,and mild early osteoarthritis.
seven days after the period ended,on july,glista went for a visit with kolb.glista told kolb that he was having difficulty walking.kolb did another neurological exam,finding that glista deep tendon reflexes were normoactive to slightly hyperactive in glista upper extremities and remain ed hyperactive in the lower extremities.kolb concluded,with glista hyperreflexia which i think is a fairly solid clinical finding and some very soft findings of functional weakness,i think ongoing workup is mandated.he stated,
i think bernard probably has a left or radiculopathy that is responsible for his left leg numbness and left foot dorsiflexor weakness this is certainly supported by his mri and emg testing.
the larger issue is his more global bilateral leg difficulties and hyperactive reflexes.my differential at this point includes lesion of the thoracic cord,demyelinating disease,and motor neuron disease.
pls is a type of motor neuron disease.
on august,an mri of glista brain revealed multiple punctate cerebral white matter lesions.when glista returned to kolb on september,kolb reported that he need ed to look into the possibility of demyelinating disease but would also keep the possibility of neuron lateral sclerosis in mind.this was the first time that any doctor had specifically mentioned the possibility that glista had pls.
kolb reiterated pls as a possible diagnosis at glista november evaluation,although he thought that glista sensory symptoms made such a diagnosis improbable.kolb sent glista to allan ropper,chief professor of neurology at elizabeth medical center,for a second opinion.ropper,who examined glista on december,stated that in closely reviewing the brain mri,i think there are subtle lesions in the corticospinal tracts that suggest primary lateral sclerosis emphasis omitted.at glista january,evaluation,kolb reported that his working diagnosis was primary lateral sclerosis.
on february,glista submitted a claim for disability benefits under the plan.glista stated on the application form that the symptoms of his disabling condition,including leg weakness,heel shoulder pain,and lower back discomfort,began around january of.on the form submitted in support of glista claim,dated february,kolb stated that he had diagnosed glista with pls.in response to the item marked when did symptoms first appear kolb wrote.in a second supporting form,dated february,kolb reiterated the diagnosis of pls.in response to the item marked date of first visit for this illness or injury,kolb wrote.
unum began an investigation into whether glista was excluded from coverage under the clause.glista claim file was referred to robert macbride,an unum medical director,who was asked whether glista had a condition.macbride found that during the period,glista had received treatment for a condition namely,neurological symptoms forming the basis of primary lateral sclerosis.
in a letter dated march,heather smith,a disability benefit specialist at unum,informed glista that his application for disability benefits had been denied.smith letter stated,information gathered during our investigation supports that you were treated by kolb on may,and june,for a condition which caused,contributed to,or resulted in the condition for which you are now claiming disability.since this was within the period,we must deny any liability on your claim.
glista timely appealed on june,arguing that the treatment he received during the period was for or radiculopathy,not for pls.he attached a letter from kolb,dated may,seeking to clarify the original statement.kolb letter stated 
jim glista has primary lateral sclerosis,a diagnosis that was established as a probable diagnosis only approximately in january of.
previous investigation with an emg in june of demonstrated abnormalities,however these abnormalities were not germane to what was subsequently proven to be his disabling disease,primary lateral sclerosis.
furthermore,while medical treatments of a general nature were used pursuant to jim emg testing,these too were directed at pain related problems that are also,in retrospect,not felt to be related to his disabling diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis.
in addition,glista attached a letter from his primary care physician,joseph shalhoub,stating that when pikus who is an associate of shalhoub saw glista in april,glista symptoms were felt to be musculoskeletal and not related to his present condition.
on july,unum had macbride glista claim.macbride noted that kolb had found hyperreflexia in his assessment of glista on may,and that hyperreflexia is a characteristic of upper motor neuron disease s such as pls and would not be explained by radiculopathy.macbride further noted that kolb had not limited his differential diagnosis to radiculopathy at glista may,visit and had ordered tests that were not limited to a possible collateral existence of radiculopathy.macbride thus concluded that t he evidence continues to indicate that the claimant was under for an array of neurological problems,the most critical of which was ultimately diagnosed as primary lateral sclerosis.
unum denied glista appeal in a letter dated july.the letter concluded that glista was not covered because he had received medical treatment,consultation,care and services including diagnostic measures during the period.the letter relied principally on kolb may,finding of hyperreflexia,noting that o ur medical advisors indicate that bilateral hyperreflexia would not normally be a finding associated with radiculopathy.glista medical records,the letter stated,confirm ed that glista had neurological symptoms present and under investigation during the period which indicate a concern for and ultimate relationship to pls.
glista claim was forwarded to unum quality review unit for a second review.on september,karen van deventer,an unum appeals consultant,reviewed glista case file and forwarded it to neurologist richard sullivan.van deventer asked sullivan to determine if the treatment and diagnostic measures undertaken on,along with the emg and mri clearly indicate a condition that caused,contributed to,or resulted in the disabling diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis.sullivan called unum to clarify what determines if the condition is.an unum representative,after consulting van deventer,gave sullivan the text of the clause,including both the treatment and symptoms clauses,but did not mention the definition of condition in the plan glossary.sullivan responded that under the definition provided,glista condition was.in a letter dated november,sullivan stated,though the patient did not receive a definite diagnosis until december by rop p er,clearly he sought medical attention for the symptoms which ultimately led to this diagnosis as early as april.from april until december,his doctors were actively trying to diagnose his rare condition.
on november,relying on sullivan analysis and kolb finding of hyperreflexia during the period,van deventer informed glista by letter that unum was upholding the denial of his appeal on the ground that he was treated during the time period for the same symptoms,which ultimately led to his diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis.
on february,glista brought suit against unum in federal district court for unlawful termination of his benefits under erisa,a b following discovery,unum moved for judgment on the administrative record on june,arguing that its denial of coverage could be overturned only if arbitrary and capricious and that the denial here did not meet that standard.unum emphasized that the plan contains no requirement that doctors or patients be aware of the correct diagnosis of the patient illness during the period.here,unum argued,glista had received treatment during the period for hyperreflexia,a symptom of pls that,according to macbride,could not be explained by radiculopathy.unum contended that because glista had received treatment for a condition,a set of symptoms including hyperreflexia and weakness in his extremities,that was caused by pls,he was excluded from receiving benefits under treatment clause.eventually,unum additionally argued that glista was also barred from benefits by the symptoms clause because he had symptoms of pls for which an ordinary person would have sought treatment,as he ultimately did.
glista opposed the motion,arguing that unum interpretation of the plan was arbitrary and capricious.glista argued that unum could not rely on the symptoms clause because unum had not relied on the symptoms clause in the internal review process and because the symptoms clause applied only when the claimant had not sought treatment.as for the treatment clause,glista stressed that the glossary definition of condition referred to a condition for which he receive d treatment emphasis added.glista contended that he could not have received treatment for pls if he and his doctors were not aware that he had pls.further,he argued that even if the clause did not require awareness of his diagnosis or disabling condition,the treatment he received was for symptoms caused by radiculopathy,a condition not related to pls.although hyperreflexia was noted in his exam,glista contends,kolb may,letter demonstrated that kolb had ordered the emg and mri tests to address radiculopathy.
in addition,glista moved on july,to include as part of the administrative record two documents and related deposition testimony that he had obtained,over unum objections,in discovery.
the first document was a set of excerpts from unum risk management reference guide,known as rimare,concerning the interpretation of condition provisions.van deventer,who handled the second internal review of glista claim and who has sole discretion to approve or deny appeals of claims to which she is assigned,stated in her deposition that rimare is a tool used to help with the analytical process of reviewing a claim.although she could not recall when she was first pointed to rimare,she said that,at some point,she was informed to check rimare when processing appeals.van deventer stated,though,that she personally does not use rimare on an everyday basis in reviewing claims and,as of her deposition on march,had not referenced it in over a year.she could not recall whether she had used rimare when evaluating glista claim.van deventer also said that she received training on the use of rimare from a mentor who advised her what systems to use and what systems to review or look at for information when reviewing claims.she noted,though,that her training in rimare did not specifically address its use with respect to the preexisting condition clause and that she typically relies on attorneys when the appeal raises a legal issue concerning the proper interpretation of the policy.
in evaluating whether a clause applies,rimare states 
t here must be a clear and direct relationship between the sickness or injury treated during the period and that causing the insured to become disabled.a possible or hypothetical relationship is not a sufficient basis for denial of a claim.
rimare notes,though,that whether a condition has manifested itself during the period is governed by the terms of the policy and advises claims examiners to s ee the specific terms of the particular contract,which can vary.
the second document that glista sought to add to the administrative record was unum training materials on applying various conditions clauses the training materials.the training materials were created on march,and revised on may,before glista claim was filed.van deventer testified in her deposition that she encountered the training materials in a training course on disability claims,but that this course occurred in august,after she had handled glista claim.
the training materials state that in determining if a condition is,claims examiners should apply the following standard 
if there is no record of treatment in the period 
if the claim is under a cxc policy which contains prudent person wording in the provision,discuss the claim with a mcr to determine if an ordinarily prudent person would have consulted a health care provider in the period for symptoms which the disabling condition was caused by,contributed to by or resulting from.
if yes,the disabling condition is.
if no,the disabling condition is not.
if there is a record of treatment in the period 
refer all medical records showing treatment in the period to a mcr,asking if the treatment was for a condition which the disabling condition was caused by,contributed to by or resulting from.
if the mcr documents a clear link between the treatment in the period the disabling condition,the disabling condition is.
if the mcr does not establish a clear link between the treatment in the period the disabling condition,the disabling condition is not.
in addition,the training materials instruct claims examiners to r efer to rimare for more information on how to determine if a condition is.
on september,the district court denied glista motion to include rimare,the training materials,and related deposition testimony in the administrative record.the court accepted unum argument that the discretion of a plan administrator could be fettered only by the language of the plan itself,and not by any internal guidelines or interpretations.the court held that by creating a training or a reference manual,unum did not relinquish its discretion to interpret the terms of its own insurance policy.both documents and the associated deposition testimony were therefore excluded for lack of relevance.
in the same order,the court also granted unum motion for judgment on the administrative record,finding that unum denial of coverage was not arbitrary and capricious.the court noted that it would have reached the same result even if it had included rimare in the administrative record.the court found unum interpretation of the treatment the clause does not require the claimant or his physicians to be aware that the treatment was for the disabling be reasonable.the court emphasized that the plain language of the clause did not require diagnosis or awareness of the disabling condition.although contra proferentum ordinarily requires reading insurance contracts in favor of the insured,the court found that rule inapplicable here because the terms of the plan expressly gave unum discretion to interpret the plan provisions and decide glista eligibility for benefits.
the court then concluded that substantial evidence supported unum denial of benefits under either the treatment clause or the symptoms clause.glista,the court found,had sought treatment and diagnostic services during the period for a range of neurological symptoms that turned out to be caused by pls and that were identified during the period as involving some form of neuron disease.the fact that glista was also diagnosed as suffering from radiculopathy,the court concluded,does not undermine the reasonableness of unum determination.
glista timely appealed the order,challenging both rulings.
we turn first to glista argument that the district court erred in excluding rimare and the training materials as irrelevant.unum contends that the documents are irrelevant as a matter of law because to admit them would be an impermissible constraint on the discretion of the plan administrator.unum also argues that these documents are inadmissible because they are of the same category as those on which the court refused to allow discovery in liston unum.officer severance plan,cir.both arguments overreach.
liston was concerned with a different problem.it held that the district court had not abused its discretion in refusing to grant to a claimant who had been denied benefits discovery about other similarly situated claimants who did receive benefits.id.at.liston held that w hether discovery was warranted depends in part on if and in what respect it matters whether others were better treated and this is not a question that has a neat mechanical answer.id.emphasis in original.liston was clear that how others were treated some substantively relevant to the reasonableness of the plan administrator decision.id.but it concluded that such information was not relevant in liston because t he plan general standard is too vague and the variables in executive jobs are too numerous to expect that anyone else will be identically placed.id.as a result,discovery in such a situation would be so burdensome as to be at odds with the concerns about efficient administration that underline the erisa statute itself.id.at.
liston is unlike this case in several respects.liston involved an effort to put into the record facts about other persons that were not before the administrator.here,by contrast,what is sought to be admitted are the plan administrator own documents interpreting the language of the plan and providing the standard for evaluation of the facts presented.the documents here are more analogous to an administrative agency guidelines or regulations,which are routinely considered in evaluating whether the agency actions were arbitrary or capricious.the documents here shed light on the legal rule the plan applies,not the underlying facts presented to the administrator.
liston concerns about burdening the plan administrator and allowing quick and efficient disposition of claims are also of considerably less weight here.rimare and the training materials are discrete documents easily made available.
moreover,under new federal regulations,claimants are entitled to obtain copies of precisely such documents.erisa requires that i n accordance with regulations of the secretary of labor,every employee benefit plan must provide participants whose benefits claims were denied with a full and fair review of the denial.in,the department of labor promulgated regulations interpreting full and fair review to require that claimants be given access to all relevant documents.h iii.where the plan in question provides disability benefits,the department of labor defines relevant documents to include statement s of policy or guidance with respect to the plan concerning the denied treatment option or benefit for the claimant diagnosis,without regard to whether such advice or statement was relied upon in making the benefit determination.m iv.the department indicated that these new regulations were intended to make clear that the claimant should receive any information demonstrating that,in making the adverse benefit determination,the plan complied with its own processes for ensuring appropriate decisionmaking and consistency.
although these regulations apply only to claims made on or after january.at,and thus do not apply to glista claim,the department of labor has made clear that the new regulations were intended to clarify the preexisting ones and that,in its view,the preexisting regulations already contemplated disclosure of such information.see.at.in addition,the new regulations reflect the department of labor expert judgment that the benefits of making such information available to claimants outweigh the potential burdens on plan administrators.
the weight and admissibility of internal documents,whether those documents are offered in support of the interpretation of the plan administrator or that of the claimant,will vary with the facts of each case.see doe travelers ins,cir.such documents are most likely to be relevant where they have been authenticated,have been generated or adopted by the plan administrator,concern the policy in question,are timely to the issue in the case,are consistently used,and were known or should have been known by those who made the decision to deny the claim.where a plan administrator has chosen consistently to interpret plan terms in a given way,that interpretation is relevant in assessing the reasonableness of the administrator decision.the department of labor regulations state that claims procedures will be deemed reasonable only if they ensure that plan provisions are applied consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.b 
contrary to unum arguments,we do not see a court consideration of internal memoranda as impermissibly narrowing the discretion of plan administrators.by creating and promulgating internal guidance documents,plan administrators choose to exercise their discretion to define terms.when courts place weight on those definitions,they do not narrow the plan administrator discretion beyond what the administrator itself has chosen to do.
there is nothing uncommon about reviewing courts considering such internal memoranda containing erisa interpretations.for example,in doe,this court considered internal guidelines upon which travelers,the plan administrator,had relied in applying the mental health provisions of its plan.at.we ultimately found the administrator denial of benefits unreasonable,in part because that denial conflicted with travelers own guidelines.id.similarly,in egert.life ins,cir,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit relied on an internal memorandum in finding arbitrary and capricious the plan administrator denial of a claim for in vitro fertilization on the ground that the plan authorized reimbursement only for the treatment of an illness and infertility was not an illness.although the court found that illness could be credibly interpreted either to include or to exclude infertility,id.at,it held that the denial was arbitrary and capricious because connecticut general ha d described infertility as an illness in its own internal guidelines,id.at,which outline d appropriate applications of the plan to individual circumstances,id.at the court stressed the importance of uniformity of construction when evaluating whether an action was arbitrary and capricious.id.at quoting reilly blue cross blue shield united of,cir,which cites dennard richards group,cir.
here,rimare and the associated deposition testimony regarding its use are relevant to the interpretation of the treatment clause.in particular,rimare states that in applying exclusions,those that,like the clause here,create a period for disability claims made in the first twelve months of coverage,the treatment clause does not apply unless there is a clear and direct relationship between the condition treated and the disabling condition there is no question as to rimare authenticity or its use by unum moreover,van deventer deposition testimony establishes that decisionmakers at unum were instructed to consult rimare when processing appeals and that rimare was in use when glista claim was evaluated.van deventer,who made the decision to reject glista appeal,received training on using rimare.the fact that she does not remember if she actually relied on rimare in evaluating glista claim does not undercut rimare relevance.see cannon unum life ins.of,i f an internal memorandum existed that favored the claimant receipt of continuing benefits,the fact that it was disregarded would be powerful evidence of an arbitrary and capricious claims determination.emphasis added.
the training materials and the associated deposition testimony regarding their use are relevant as well.in particular,we note the relevance of the statement in the training materials that i f the medical review does not establish a clear link between the treatment in the period the disabling condition,the disabling condition is not emphasis added the training materials indicate that this statement is intended to apply to condition clauses of the type in cxc the sort at issue here.van deventer testified in her deposition that the training materials were used in unum training courses on the application of conditions clauses,and the training materials indicate that they were created on march,and revised on may,before glista filed his claim with unum in february.accordingly,we give the training materials some weight,as they reflect the plan administrator interpretation of the clause at the time glista claim was evaluated.we do not,however,give them as much weight as rimare because it is not clear that the decisionmakers in glista case knew or should have known of the training materials when evaluating glista claim.van deventer said in her deposition that she herself did not receive training on using the training materials until after she had handled glista claim,and there is no evidence that any of the other decisionmakers in glista case received such training.
we turn next to glista challenge to unum denial of benefits.our review of the district court grant of judgment on the administrative record is de novo.see,spangler lockheed martin energy,cir.where,as here,a plan administrator has discretion to determine eligibility for and entitlement to benefits,the district court must uphold the administrator decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.gannon metro.life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the fact that unum,the plan administrator,will have to pay glista claim out of its own assets does not change that standard of review.itt hartford life accident ins,cir.
on arbitrary and capricious review,unum decision will be upheld if the denial is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.gannon,at.here,unum argues that it had two bases for denying benefits the treatment clause and the symptoms clause.we take up each in turn.
treatment clause 
the treatment clause,as we have said,excludes coverage for disabilities beginning in the first year of coverage when the claimant received medical treatment,consultation,care or services including diagnostic measures,or took prescribed drugs or medicines in the months just prior to his effective date of coverage for a condition that caused,contributed to,or resulted in his disability.rimare states that the treatment clause applies only when there is a clear and direct relationship between the sickness or injury treated during the period and that causing the insured to become disabled.rimare specifically states that a possible or hypothetical relationship is not a sufficient basis for denial of a claim.the training materials further require a clear link between the treatment in the period the disabling condition,stating that without such a link,the disabling condition is not.in short,under unum interpretation as articulated in rimare and the training materials,the treatment clause applies only where there is a clear and direct relationship between the symptoms and treatment in the period and the disabling condition here,pls.
even assuming arguendo,in unum favor on both assumptions,that the treatment clause itself contains no awareness requirement and,further,that the term condition can refer to an array of symptoms the treatment clause,as applied in rimare and the training materials,does not provide a reasonable basis for denying glista claim.six events occurred during the period glista april,visit to pikus,a general practitioner pikus prescription of naprosyn glista may,visit to kolb,a neurologist an emg test on june,lumbar and cervical mris on june,and kolb prescription of anaprox.none of those events constituted treatment that was both itself clearly linked to pls and addressed to symptoms clearly linked to pls.
glista visit to pikus concerned complaints of left leg weakness and heel pain,lower back pain,and arm pain.the record does not support a clear and direct relationship between those symptoms and pls.it is undisputed that glista suffered from radiculopathy during the period and that those symptoms were consistent with radiculopathy.unum concedes in its brief that kolb diagnosis of radiculopathy was correct,albeit,in unum estimation,incomplete.the evidence of record is that,to the extent any clear and direct link existed between any illness and the symptoms experienced by glista when he visited pikus,it was between those symptoms and radiculopathy,not pls.indeed,even after glista had been diagnosed with pls,kolb assessment was that glista pain related problems during the period were not felt to be related to his disabling diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis.
pikus prescription of naprosyn is similarly unhelpful to unum.pikus stated that he prescribed naprosyn to treat glista arm,back,and heel pain,symptoms that did not have a clear and direct relationship to glista disabling condition of pls.
glista may,visit to kolb did uncover a symptom of pls not consistent with radiculopathy hyperreflexia.kolb noted that symptom in his report but did nothing further about it during that visit.unum argues that the mere fact of this notation constituted treatment with a clear and direct relationship to pls.we disagree.notation of a symptom in a report does not constitute treatment for that symptom.oxford english dictionary ed defining treatment as m anagement in the application of remedies medical or surgical application or service.nor does it constitute consultation for that symptom.the oxford english dictionary defines consult as to take counsel with to seek advice from.oxford english dictionary ed.the record does not indicate that glista asked for or received advice about his hyperreflexia,or that kolb even mentioned the symptom to glista.moreover,mere notation of the symptom does not constitute a diagnostic measure,much less one clearly linked to pls.a measure is a plan or course of action intended to attain some object,see oxford english dictionary ed.notation of a symptom,without further investigation of its causes,does not alone constitute a plan or course of action for arriving at a diagnosis of pls.
kolb did order several diagnostic measures in response to his examination of glista.but none of those measures was clearly linked to pls.first,kolb ordered an emg.but kolb described the emg as a test for lower motor neuron involvement,a point that has not been controverted by unum own medical experts.see als center at ucsf,information about diagnosis and related disorders,available at http electromyography emg is a test that is very sensitive in detecting lower motor neuron disease.lower motor neurons run from the spinal cord to muscles.see gould medical dictionary.pls is a purely upper motor neuron,not lower motor neuron,disease.upper motor neurons are located in the motor cortex of the brain and run from the brainstem to the spinal cord.see gould medical dictionary.
after the emg,kolb ordered lumbar and cervical mris,which produced images of glista lower back and neck,respectively.see gould medical dictionary,defining lumbar and cervical.nothing in the record indicates that either mri had any relation to pls.the cervical mri report did mention glista hyperreflexia among other symptoms in his medical history,and kolb later stated that the cervical mri checked both for glista hyperactive reflexes and some mild arm complaints.but the cervical mri report stated that its clinical concern was with cervical myelopathy or demyelination.nothing in the record connects either of those conditions to pls.the only mention of either of those conditions in the record indicates that demyelination is a sign of multiple sclerosis,not pls.indeed,as best the record shows,kolb used the cervical and lumbar mris as tests for radiculopathy,a condition unrelated to pls and described by macbride in his deposition as involving pressure on nerve roots in the cervical,thoracic or lumbar spine.kolb stated in the report of glista july,visit after the period had ended that a diagnosis of radiculopathy was certainly supported by glista mri and emg testing.
kolb prescription of anaprox following the mris does not trigger the treatment clause either.kolb july,report indicates that he prescribed the drug to treat glista heel pain glista complained of left heel pain i placed him on anaprox previously.he did not have much of a response to this,but a s he has become less active and more sedentary,his heel pain has abated quite a bit.that pain,as we have mentioned,was not clearly linked to pls.
using unum own definition of the treatment clause,the decision to deny benefits under that clause was neither reasonable nor supported by the evidence.
symptoms clause 
having determined that the denial of benefits can not be justified under the treatment clause,we turn to unum reliance on the symptoms clause.glista argues,inter alia,that unum should not be permitted to rely on the symptoms clause in litigation because it did not rely on that clause in its communications to him during the internal review process.we agree.because we do not reach the question whether the symptoms clause would have been a proper basis for denying coverage if it had been raised earlier,we do not address golden rule ins.atallah,cir,upon which unum relies heavily in its discussion of the applicability of the symptoms clause.
both the statute and the erisa regulations require that the plan administrator provide a claimant with the specific reasons for its denial of a claim.erisa provides that 
in accordance with regulations of the secretary,every employee benefit plan shall provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant 
emphasis added.the department of labor implementing regulations require that the initial notice of a claim denial contain 
the specific reason or reasons for the denial 
specific reference to pertinent plan provisions on which the denial is based 
a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary and 
appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the participant or beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.
f the regulations also require that decisions in subsequent internal appeals include specific reasons for the decision,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant,as well as specific references to the pertinent plan provisions on which the decision is based.h.
t hese regulations are designed to afford the beneficiary an explanation of the denial of benefits that is adequate to ensure meaningful review of that denial.halpin grainger,cir see also terry bayer,cir the purpose of and its implementing regulations is to ensure a sufficiently clear understanding of the administrator position to permit effective review internal quotation marks omitted.
the regulations also further the overall purpose of the internal review process to minimize the number of frivolous lawsuits promote consistent treatment of claims provide a nonadversarial dispute resolution process and decrease the cost and time of claims settlement.powell v.at t,cir see also makar health care of the carefirst,cir short cent.states,areas pension fund,cir amato bernard,cir.those goals are undermined where plan administrators have available sufficient information to assert a basis for denial of benefits,but choose to hold that basis in reserve rather than communicate it to the beneficiary.such conduct prevents erisa plan administrators and beneficiaries from having a full and meaningful dialogue regarding the denial of benefits.see juliano v.the health maint.org.of,cir.
glista argues that in unum communications to him during the internal review process,unum never mentioned the symptoms clause as a reason for its denial and relied instead on the treatment clause alone.unum denies this.our review of the record supports glista characterization.erisa requi
