petitioner integrity staffing solutions,required its hourly warehouse workers,who retrieved products from warehouse shelves and packaged them for delivery to customers,to undergo a security screening before leaving the warehouse each day.respondents,former employees,sued the company alleging,as relevant here,that they were entitled to compensation under the fair labor standards act of flsa for the roughly minutes each day that they spent waiting to undergo and undergoing those screenings.they also alleged that the company could have reduced that time to a de minimis amount by adding screeners or staggering shift terminations and that the screenings were conducted to prevent employee theft and,thus,for the sole benefit of the employers and their customers.
the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim,holding that the screenings were not integral and indispensable to the employees principal activities but were instead postliminary and noncompensable.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed in relevant part,asserting that postshift activities that would ordinarily be classified as noncompensable postliminary activities are compensable as integral and indispensable to an employee principal activities if the postshift activities are necessary to the principal work and performed for the employer benefit.
held the time that respondents spent waiting to undergo and undergoing security screenings is not compensable under the flsa.
a congress passed the act to respond to an economic emergency created by the broad judicial interpretation given to the flsa undefined terms work and workweek.see a tennessee coal,iron muscoda local.the act exempted employers from flsa liability for claims based on activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to the performance of the principal activities that an employee is employed to perform.a.under this court precedents,the term principal activities includes all activities which are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities.steiner mitchell.an activity is integral and indispensable if it is an intrinsic element of the employee principal activities and one with which the employee can not dispense if he is to perform his principal activities.this court has identified several activities that satisfy this test see,at,mitchell king packing,and department of labor regulations are consistent with this approach,see cfr c,g.
b the security screenings at issue are noncompensable postliminary activities.to begin with,the screenings were not the principal activities the employees were employed to perform,the workers were employed not to undergo security screenings but to retrieve products from warehouse shelves and package them for shipment.nor were they integral and indispensable to those activities.this view is consistent with a department of labor opinion letter,which found noncompensable under the act both a preshift screening conducted for employee safety and a postshift search conducted to prevent employee theft.the ninth circuit test,which focused on whether the particular activity was required by the employer rather than whether it was tied to the productive work that the employee was employed to perform,would sweep into principal activities the very activities that the act was designed to exclude from compensation.see,ibp,supra,at.finally,respondents claim that the screenings are compensable because integrity staffing could have reduced the time to a de minimis amount is properly presented at the bargaining table,not to a court in an flsa claim.

the employer in this case required its employees,warehouse workers who retrieved inventory and packaged it for shipment,to undergo an antitheft security screening before leaving the warehouse each day.the question presented is whether the employees time spent waiting to undergo and undergoing those security screenings is compensable under the fair labor standards act of flsa,et,as amended by the act of,et.we hold that the time is not compensable.we therefore reverse the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.

integrity staffing required its employees to undergo a security screening before leaving the warehouse at the end of each day.during this screening,employees removed items such as wallets,keys,and belts from their persons and passed through metal detectors.
in,busk and castro filed a putative class action against integrity staffing on behalf of similarly situated employees in the nevada warehouses for alleged violations of the flsa and nevada labor laws.as relevant here,the employees alleged that they were entitled to compensation under the flsa for the time spent waiting to undergo and actually undergoing the security screenings.they alleged that such time amounted to roughly minutes each day and that it could have been reduced to a de minimis amount by adding more security screeners or by staggering the termination of shifts so that employees could flow through the checkpoint more quickly.they also alleged that the screenings were conducted to prevent employee theft and thus occurred solely for the benefit of the employers and their customers.app.
the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim,holding that the time spent waiting for and undergoing the security screenings was not compensable under the flsa.it explained that,because the screenings occurred after the regular work shift,the employees could state a claim for compensation only if the screenings were an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities they were employed to perform.the district court held that these screenings were not integral and indispensable but instead fell into a noncompensable category of postliminary activities.
the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed in relevant part.the court of appeals asserted that postshift activities that would ordinarily be classified as noncompensable postliminary activities are nevertheless compensable as integral and indispensable to an employee principal activities if those postshift activities are necessary to the principal work performed and done for the benefit of the employer,at.accepting as true the allegation that integrity staffing required the security screenings to prevent employee theft,the court of appeals concluded that the screenings were necessary to the employees primary work as warehouse employees and done for integrity staffing benefit,at.
we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
