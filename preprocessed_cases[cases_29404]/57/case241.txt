kathy henry appeals an award of summary judgment in favor of her former employer,united bank,on her claims of retaliation in violation of the family and medical leave act fmla,and disability discrimination in violation of massachusetts law.ch.her claims arise from united bank decision to terminate her employment after she had exhausted weeks of medical leave.agreeing with the magistrate judge that the undisputed material facts compel judgment in favor of united bank,we affirm.
background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to henry as the party.see jones walgreen,cir.henry began working for united bank in as a commercial loan administrative assistant and in the following year was promoted to the position of commercial credit analyst.as a credit analyst,her tasks included evaluating the of commercial borrowers and making lending recommendations.she reported to joanne sheedy,the assistant vice president of credit,who in turn reported to jack patterson,the vice president of risk management.
in january,henry began experiencing neck pain,blurred vision,and dizziness.her primary care physician pcp suzanne jorey examined her and referred her to a neurologist,christopher comey.comey determined that henry was suffering from a spinal cord compression in her cervical spine.she received physical therapy during this time frame and scheduled another appointment with comey for early september.that appointment was later changed to september.henry kept the bank informed of her physical condition and of the scheduled september appointment with the neurologist.
with some workplace accommodations provided by the bank,henry was able to perform her job for a time.these accommodations included,for example,an ergonomic chair and modifications to an air conditioning vent in the plaintiff office.henry also compensated for her sedentary position by walking around several times during the day.despite these adjustments,however,her symptoms worsened,and on the first day of july she had difficulty getting out of bed.that day henry went to her pcp,who examined her and completed an excuse slip.this note,which henry gave to the bank,stated that she would be on bed rest until further notice.
near the end of july,henry pcp recommended that her leave of absence be extended for three weeks while further tests were performed and a diagnosis reached.in,the pcp provided an attending physician statement to the bank.this statement noted that henry could not sit all day,that she suffered a decreased range of motion in her neck and back,and that it was indeterminable when she could return to work.henry told the bank human resources department that her pcp wanted her to remain out of work until her appointment with the neurologist at the end of september.
intermittently over the course of the summer,henry employer provided her with forms to complete for fmla leave and disability leave.toward the end of july,the bank informed her that her week leave had begun on july,leaving about nine more weeks of leave time remaining.in early september,however,the bank sent henry a letter stating that her request for disability had not yet been approved,pending further documentation from her doctor,and,therefore,it was unable to qualify her work absence as fmla leave.the correspondence included a certification of health care provider form chcp form which was to be completed within fifteen days.at henry direction,the bank also sent the form to her pcp office.a few days later,the bank disability insurance company informed henry that her request for disability had been denied due to a lack of medical documentation showing that she was totally disabled.
meanwhile,sheedy,patterson,and senior vice president of human resources miriam siegal met in early september to discuss the staffing needs of the credit analysis department.this discussion included the topic of the bank ability to continue to hold henry position open indefinitely.sheedy communicated to siegal that the department was strained from short staffing two other credit analysts,as well as sheedy herself,had been carrying the plaintiff workload.they opted,however,to wait to make a decision until the end of september.
by,the bank received the completed chcp form from the pcp office.that certification stated that henry was not incapacitated and was able to perform her job on a normal work schedule with no heavy lifting.on september,sheedy,patterson,and siegal decided that the bank was unable to hold henry position open any longer siegal told henry that she was expected to return to work on september,after her scheduled september appointment with the neurologist.in her correspondence memorializing the bank decision,siegal characterized henry lengthy absence as unexcused and not leave,because it had not been supported by her healthcare providers.
the morning of september,after she saw her neurologist henry arrived at the bank with a note authored by him.it stated 
henry is under my care for a neurosurgical condition cervical myelopathy.our office will be scheduling a surgical procedure for her in the next few weeks.due to extreme pain henry has been unable to go to work since july,she is to remain out of work until further notice.
when henry attempted to deliver the note to lynn orr,the payroll and benefits administrator,orr told her that she needed to wait for siegal to arrive to work in a few minutes in order to give the note directly to her.henry declined to wait and left the note with another employee to deliver to siegal.later that same day,henry sent an email message to siegal,advising her that the surgery referred to in the neurologist note was scheduled for october.siegal responded by informing henry that her employment was terminated,noting that the bank can not continue to hold her position open indefinitely and that she had been given a full week period of fmla leave commencing july,even though the medical documentation did not support it.
henry took the position that the chcp form submitted by her primary care physician in august had mistakenly characterized her as able to work.she never provided a statement from the pcp to modify that form,however,nor did she provide an additional chcp form completed by the neurologist.henry did undergo the surgery in october,and on april she was cleared to work without restrictions.
henry subsequently filed this action,which united bank removed to federal court,and the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge.in due course,the bank moved for summary judgment on all claims,and also sought to strike certain portions of the plaintiff statement of facts.the magistrate judge granted the motion to strike in part and entered judgment in favor of united bank.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,taking the record evidence in the light most favorable to henry as the nonmoving party.see hodgens general dynamics,cir.c.to defeat summary judgment in the trial court,the plaintiff must provide specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to each issue upon which s he would bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial,an obligation that is triggered once the defendant has properly supported its summary judgment motion.hodgens,at internal quotation marks omitted.the very mission of the summary judgment procedure is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also godfrey globe newspaper,noting that while s ummary judgment is generally disfavored in cases involving employment discrimination because the question of intent requires a credibility determination,it nonetheless may at times be appropriate.scope of summary judgment record 
henry first challenges the district court decision to strike from her rule statement of material facts an assertion that the chcp form completed by her pcp office had mistakenly characterized her health status and endorsed her ability to work with minimal limitation.the court did not commit error.
at bottom,the plaintiff belief that the statements were wrong does not affect the pcp stated position as represented on the form.henry offered no evidence that the pcp office ever modified or otherwise corrected any perceived error.further,as noted by the magistrate judge,the neurologist opinion memorialized in the september note that henry had been unable to work since july does not necessarily override the pcp opinion because the conflict could simply represent a difference in medical opinions.in any event,even assuming that the form mistakenly characterized henry work abilities,she has not demonstrated how this conclusion helps establish that the bank acted unlawfully when it decided to terminate her on the stated ground that it could not hold the position open indefinitely.we find no abuse of discretion in the magistrate decision to strike the statement,see casas office machines,mita copystar america,cir,and turn next to henry claim that this case should be resolved by a jury.
fmla retaliation claim 
the family and medical leave act entitles eligible private sector employees to take,for medical reasons,reasonable leave up to a maximum of twelve weeks,and then to return to the same or an alternative position with some equivalency.see hodgens,at a d,a.the act also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for exercising their statutory rights.see a.thus,an employer can not regard the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in deciding to terminate an employee.see c mellen trustees of boston,cir.but,although an employee who properly takes fmla leave can not be discharged for exercising a right provided by the statute,she nevertheless can be discharged for independent reasons.nagle acton boxborough reg l sch,cir 
henry claim challenges united bank motivation for terminating her,and she acknowledges that the mcdonnell douglas framework applies.see mcdonnell douglas green,d hodgens,at noting that the framework applies when there is no direct evidence of discrimination colburn parker portland,cir see also reeves sanderson plumbing,d further explaining mcdonnell douglas framework in the summary judgment context 
we will assume for the sake of argument that the plaintiff has satisfied her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case.see hodgens,at setting forth the elements of a prima facie fmla retaliation claim.additionally,because henry does not challenge the magistrate judge ruling that the bank satisfied its evidentiary burden under the second step of mcdonnell douglas,we also assume that the bank produced enough competent evidence which,if taken as true,would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the challenged employment action was taken for a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,we describe the evidence supporting the bank proffered business decision that it could not hold henry position open indefinitely in order to set the stage for the final mcdonnell douglas prong on pretext,which is the crux of the dispute.
siegal testified at her deposition that the credit analysis department was critical to the bank business because the analysts perform credit risk assessments with respect to both potential and current commercial loans.she underscored that,in,an independent auditing company had recommended that the bank maintain three credit analysts,and that the auditors were due to perform their review of the bank credit functions in the fall of.at the time that the bank made its termination decision,henry had been out of work for about three months.the two remaining analysts and sheedy had taken on the extra work,which strained the department.
siegal also testified that no other employee in the bank was available to temporarily fill the third analyst position,and that hiring a temporary employee was not a wise business practice,due to the confidential nature of the client information to which the credit analysts have access and the particularized training involved in preparing an employee to competently perform the job.additionally,she explained that the analysts loan review responsibilities were expected to increase for a variety of reasons.these included the fact that the poor state of the economy had created a need for increased financial documentation when scrutinizing,and the fact that an increase in new loans was expected due to the bank having recently hired additional commercial lenders.finally,siegal testified that the neurologist note did not change the bank decision to terminate henry employment,because the note gave no indication of a date by when she possibly might return to work.
in light of this undisputed evidence that the bank termination decision was animated by legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons,any presumption of retaliatory animus created by the prima facie case evaporates.see id.at see also reeves,at.thus,to survive summary judgment,henry burden is to demonstrate,without the benefit of the animus presumption,a trialworthy issue on whether the stated reason was but a pretext for retaliating against her for having taken protected fmla leave.hodgens,at see also reeves,at.
henry argues that,viewed in her favor,the summary judgment record would permit a jury to infer pretext and discriminatory animus.she focuses primarily on the circumstances leading up to her termination and on two remarks made by sheedy in the workplace.additionally,she contends that the record contains evidence that undermines the veracity of the bank stated need to fill the third analyst position.
henry first points to the employer conduct leading up to her termination,including the bank changed position about the status of her requested fmla leave that it had initially approved siegal insistence that henry return to work,despite being aware of her upcoming appointment to see the neurologist orr demand that she have the chcp form completed in,rather than allowing her to wait for the scheduled appointment with the neurologist the bank failure to reconsider its termination decision once she informed siegal that the pcp statements in the chcp form were mistaken and orr refusal to accept the neurologist note on the morning of september.
we first note with respect to orr conduct that there is no evidence that she had anything to do with the decision to terminate henry.see colburn,at.additionally,we reject the argument that the bank took an inconsistent stance on the status of henry leave that is suggestive of pretext or bad motive.in late july,about three weeks into her absence,the bank simply sent her a letter stating that her fmla leave began on july.in early september,after two months had passed since she left work,the bank informed henry that her absence could not qualify as fmla leave without proper medical documentation substantiating her claimed disabled status.the bank included a chcp form in that correspondence,in order to assist her in providing the necessary documentation.
neither do the circumstances surrounding the submission of the chcp form itself suggest retaliatory animus.we detect nothing nefarious in siegal requiring that henry return to work once the bank learned in that her pcp deemed her able to do so with the minimal accommodation of no heavy lifting.further,although henry told siegal that the form was mistaken,she points to no evidence suggesting that the bank prevented her from submitting a modified form by the pcp to correct any perceived error.and,once the bank received the neurologist note stating that she would be out of work until further notice,it simply remained consistent in its position that it could not hold her job open indefinitely.
henry highlights the temporal proximity between the conclusion of the week fmla leave period,comey note documenting her need for additional time,and her termination.although timing can be relevant when considering whether there was retaliatory animus,the timing here is unremarkable.see id.at colburn,at.the undisputed facts show that the decisionmakers began discussing staffing issues related to henry continued absence in early september,and,before ever receiving the neurologist note,siegal notified henry that the bank could not hold her position open indefinitely,setting september as the date for her to r
