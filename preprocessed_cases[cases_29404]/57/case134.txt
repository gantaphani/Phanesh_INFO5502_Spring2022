these two appeals arise out of similar lawsuits in which plaintiffs,current and previous employees of the puerto rico state insurance fund corporation sifc,have alleged that defendants,the sifc and its administrators,selectively enforced puerto rico merit principle against them.this selective enforcement is said to be in violation of the equal protection clause.const.amend.xiv.
plaintiffs were appointed from to to career managerial positions at the sifc.control of the puerto rico government changed parties in early.a later audit revealed that these plaintiffs were appointed through internal job postings,rather than through open announcements as required by sifc regulation.finding the appointments to have violated the merit principle,the new administration annulled the appointments.
the equal protection clause does not provide a basis to undo these employment actions.rather,this case can be viewed as an effort to circumvent the limits imposed on first amendment claims.indeed,we recently affirmed entry of summary judgment for defendants in a suit by a former employee alleging that a similar annulment constituted political discrimination in violation of the first amendment.reyes pérez state ins.fund,cir.these plaintiffs challenge the annulment under the equal protection clause,expressly disavowing any first amendment claim.the district courts granted summary judgment to defendants because plaintiffs failed to identify similarly situated individuals treated differently by defendants.we affirm on the same basis.

plaintiffs are individuals who were appointed to career managerial positions at the sifc,the puerto rico government entity that administers the local workers compensation program,between january,and december.a career managerial employee is one of five employee categories at the sifc.the term is defined as a permanent employee of the sifc who is assigned and unskilled technical professional duties and who does not belong to any of the appropriate bargaining units for purposes of collective contracting existing in the sifc.for example,one of the plaintiffs here,josé rodríguez pomales,held a career managerial position of budget officer.
plaintiffs were appointed while one of puerto rico two major political parties,the popular democratic party pdp,was in power.in,when the new progressive party npp came to power,the new administration performed an audit of all personnel transactions that had occurred between january,and december.defendants reviewed the personnel files of all employees at the sifc.according to the october,audit report,appointments of career managerial employees including those of the plaintiffs were made through internal job postings rather than public announcements.in the sifc view,this exclusion of outside candidates contravened article of the sifc employee manual,which,implementing puerto rico merit principle,requires that positions be filled by means of open competition.see laws ann.tit,defining the merit principle as the concept on which basis all public employees shall be selected,promoted,retained and treated in all matters concerning their employment based upon their capability and without discrimination.in january,the sifc began to annul all of those appointments,including those of the plaintiffs,regardless of the appointee party affiliation.see generally gonzález segarra state ins.fund,offic.trans.describing the events giving rise to the annulments and holding that plaintiffs appointments made through closed job announcements violate the merit principle.

it is generally true that u nder the equal protection clause,persons similarly situated must be accorded similar governmental treatment.marrero gutierrez molina,cir citing city of cleburne cleburne living,d in order to prove an equal protection violation,plaintiffs must establish that,compared with other similarly situated individuals,they were selectively treated based on impermissible considerations such as race,religion,intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights,or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.see id.alteration in original quoting rubinovitz rogato,cir internal quotation marks omitted 
the formula for determining whether individuals or entities are similarly situated for equal protection purposes is not always susceptible to precise demarcation.id.t he test is whether a prudent person,looking objectively at the incidents,would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated.much as in the lawyer art of distinguishing cases,the relevant aspects are those factual elements which determine whether reasoned analogy supports,or demands,a like result.barrington cove.hous.mortg.fin,cir quoting dartmouth review dartmouth,cir,overruled on other grounds by educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the cases must be similar in all relevant respects e xact correlation is neither likely nor necessary,but the cases must be fair congeners.in other words,apples should be compared to apples.id.quoting dartmouth review,at internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs do not argue that there are individuals hired to career managerial positions in violation of the merit principle from to whose appointments were not annulled.rather,they point to two other categories of individuals,appointed earlier by other decisionmakers a group of individuals appointed without any job announcement,open or closed,in the,and several physicians appointed to career managerial positions without any job announcement in.they also point to a third category appointed after the time period covered by the audit union employees appointed though closed job announcements after.these obviously dissimilar appointments simply present different factual situations to which the open competition requirement may,or may not,apply.indeed,the supreme court of puerto rico has rejected any notion that the merit principle applies in the same manner across the board,without regard to context or circumstance.gonzález segarra,offic.trans.at.
