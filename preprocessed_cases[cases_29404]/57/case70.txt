appellant michelle audette,a police patrol officer in plymouth,massachusetts,appeals from the entry of summary judgment for the town of plymouth town,the plymouth police department department,and a number of the town and the department employees.audette claims that she suffered discrimination in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,and its massachusetts corollary,massachusetts general laws chapter,when the defendants failed to accommodate her request for transfer to another position in the department after she sustained an injury.audette further alleges that she suffered illegal retaliation when she attempted to assert her rights under the ada and that she suffered discrimination on the basis of her gender in violation of massachusetts law.we affirm the district court rejection of these claims.
the following facts are undisputed,except as noted.
audette ankle injuries 
audette began her career as a patrol officer for the plymouth police department in.while working on october,she sustained the first of two injuries to her right ankle.these injuries led to visits to many doctors,two surgeries,and rounds of physical therapy.to this day,she has yet to fully recover.
audette doctors have prescribed physical limitations to her movement in order to aid in her recovery.these limitations have varied at times,but include strictly sedentary work,shorter working shifts four or six hours,rather than the typical,working in an boot,working with the use of crutches,limited standing or walking to minutes out of every hour,and limited bending.according to the plymouth police department rules and regulations manual,a patrol officer duties include patrolling by foot and in a vehicle,responding to emergencies,providing services on an emergency basis,aiding individuals who are in danger of physical harm,preserving crime scenes,and apprehending criminal offenders.since the initial injury,audette limitations have prevented her from fulfilling her standard responsibilities as an active patrol officer,except for a brief period between august and january,when she sustained a second injury to the same ankle.
nevertheless,the plymouth police department continues to employ audette as a patrol officer.when doctors limitations on her working conditions have permitted,audette has received pay for working shifts in a capacity as a station officer when her doctors limitations have not allowed her to work as a station officer,audette has been afforded full pay while taking injured on duty iod leave the department has also granted her other accommodations not available to other patrol officers,including an elevator key and a designated,convenient parking spot.
b.the department national reporting system 
like many police departments across the nation,the plymouth police department participates in the national reporting system nibrs.nibrs is an reporting system used by law enforcement agencies to collect and report data on crimes.local,state,and federal agencies compile and maintain data in nibrs as part of their records management responsibilities.ordinarily,two department employees are responsible for nibrs data the department records sergeant who oversees all records maintenance,including nibrs,and a civilian clerical worker.in july,the records sergeant was also assisted by detective robert morse,who oversaw the department evidence management responsibilities.after the records sergeant announced his retirement in september,morse temporarily took over nibrs oversight responsibilities.
in may when audette was out of work due to her first ankle surgery morse announced that he would retire.on may,patrol officer benjamin dexter returned to work after sustaining an injury,and he was placed on light duty.plymouth police chief michael botieri assigned dexter to train with morse and assist in getting caught up with the nibrs records.by october,the department had sufficiently caught up with its backlog,and dexter was reassigned as a station officer for the remainder of his status.the department never appointed another patrol officer on light duty to assist with the nibrs data outside of dexter assignment in in november,dexter returned to status as a patrol officer,and sergeant michael ferazzi was appointed as the new records sergeant and became responsible for nibrs oversight.
audette accommodation request 
audette underwent ankle surgery in june.later that summer her doctor issued a note stating that she could return to work on october.the only limitation the doctor placed on audette was based on symptoms.on october three days after officer dexter had been reassigned from nibrs data maintenance to station officer audette delivered a letter to chief botieri titled reasonable accommodation,which requested that she be allowed to work the nibrs position to which dexter had been assigned.we quote the letter in full 
i am requesting a reasonable accommodation as i would like to return to work and feel that i can be a productive member of this police department.
following a very extensive and painful ankle injury i am currently in the healing process after receiving surgery.i have recently received a doctor note allowing for me to return to work on october.the physical limitations are for hours,with walking and standing limited to symptoms.as i continue with my physical therapy i find that my symptoms vary day to day.
i recently became aware that a nontraditional light duty assignment had been offered to another officer and that this assignment is currently vacant.this assignment was utilized to aid in keeping the nibrs up to date.this assignment is mainly sitting while reading and completing data on a computer.
i am hopeful this same opportunity could be extended to me.being assigned to a seated position would allow me to feel productive as well as continue to heal and gain greater strength as i move towards returning to work full duty.
chief botieri met with audette and told her that the assignment to which her letter referred had been completed and that the only assignment available for patrol officers was the station officer position that she had intermittently worked before her surgery.he sent an email to audette on october confirming this information,which also stated that i f an assignment does become available and the work is within your limitations,i will notify you.
despite not receiving the accommodation she requested,audette returned to work as scheduled on october,and she continued to work as a station officer until september,when she took time off for her second ankle surgery.after the second surgery,audette again returned to work as a station officer in april under her doctor order that she work in a capacity for four hours per day with limited bending,and she has continued to work in that position.at no point has audette been assigned responsibilities that conflict with any doctor orders.nor has she ever indicated to chief botieri or anyone else in the department that she is unable to perform her assigned duties 
audette disciplinary proceedings 
at an early stage during audette medical ordeal,some events occurred that underlie her retaliation and gender discrimination claims.on the evening of november,one of audette fellow officers got into an altercation at a bar in downtown plymouth.as a result,the patrol officer contacted audette,as his union,and officer ray reid,his union steward,seeking assistance in getting placed into an alcohol treatment facility for police officers in brattleboro,vermont.the following day when reid was but audette was they went to the patrol officer house for about an.after meeting with the patrol officer,reid agreed to transport him to the alcohol treatment facility,and audette told reid that she would inform the department about what had occurred and that the patrol officer would be out sick while at the treatment facility.when audette left her patrol to attend to her colleague at his home around that morning,she notified a dispatcher that she would be tied up for a while.audette left her coworker home at but did not inform anyone in the department about what had occurred there,or that the coworker was on his way to the vermont facility,until sometime between that afternoon.
on april,audette met with the town human resources director,roberta kety,to discuss audette return to work at the department after sustaining her second ankle injury.audette alleges that as a result of this meeting,kety informed chief botieri that audette had complained about how she had been treated by the department and that she had asked for a reasonable accommodation,including,but not limited to,a sedentary position.three days after meeting with kety,audette met with chief botieri,and he broached the topic of audette early retirement 
a few days after their initial meeting,audette again met with chief botieri,who stated that there was an open discipline issue regarding her handling of the incident at her fellow patrol officer home,though chief botieri chose not to resolve the issue at that time.at some point during the next two weeks,audette was given the option of taking a suspension or receiving a letter of reprimand as a result of the disciplinary incident on may,chief botieri issued a letter of reprimand to audette that stated she had violated multiple rules of professional conduct,including engaging in conduct unbecoming of an officer and neglect of duty.the letter stated that it would be subject to review and removal from her personnel file within one year if she was involved in no other disciplinary incidents during that period.
rather than signing the letter of reprimand,audette opted for a disciplinary hearing.after the disciplinary hearing,there was a finding that audette had violated the department rules and regulations,and she received a new letter of reprimand on may.the second letter was identical to the first,except that it stated it would remain in audette personnel file for up to two years,rather than one.the letter of reprimand was the only disciplinary action taken against audette for the incident,and it did not affect her rank,pay,or duties as a patrol officer.
audette filed a demand for arbitration challenging the reprimand letter.in december the police officers union on audette behalf entered into a settlement agreement with the town of plymouth and chief botieri.the settlement agreement stated that the town would not rely on the reprimand for any future employment related purpose,that the town would remove the letter from audette file,that the settlement agreement did not constitute an admission of any party,and that the execution of the agreement shall constitute a waiver of any action arising under either contract or statute with regard to the issuance of the reprimand.because the letter had not been removed immediately from audette personnel file,despite the settlement agreement,chief botieri sent a letter to the town human resources department on may,notifying it that the letter should have been removed,and he instructed the department to do so.
procedural history 
in august,audette filed a complaint in massachusetts state court alleging a failure to accommodate under the ada and the rehabilitation act counts i and ii discrimination based on an actual handicap,a perceived handicap,and a record of handicap under massachusetts law counts iii,iv,and v gender and age discrimination under massachusetts law counts vi,vii,viii,and ix intentional infliction of emotional distress count x and conspiracy count xi.defendants removed the action to federal court and filed a motion for summary judgment in september.
after a hearing,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants,stating that audette had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to her being a qualified disabled individual,able to perform the essential functions of a patrol officer,so her disability discrimination claims must fail.it also found that she failed to raise genuine and material issues of fact regarding her other discrimination claims,noting that she had not submitted admissible evidence sufficient for a jury to infer that she has suffered an adverse employment action because of either her age or gender.finally,it concluded that she failed to establish a prima facie case for all of her remaining claims.audette timely appealed.
summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.mulloy acushnet,cir.quoting fed.civ.c.material facts are those which might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,and an issue is genuine if there is evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find for the party.id.quoting seaboard sur.town of greenfield,cir.

disability and handicap discrimination claims 
the ada prohibits employers from discriminating against a qualified individual defined as an individual who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires on the basis of disability,a lang stores east,cir.failing to provide reasonable accommodations for a qualified employee known physical or mental limitations constitutes discrimination,unless an employer can demonstrate that such an accommodation would impose an undue hardship lang,at b a.
to prevail at the summary judgment stage on a typical claim of failure to accommodate,a plaintiff must present sufficient evidence indicating that a she is disabled within the ada definition that b she could perform the job essential functions either with or without a reasonable accommodation and that c the employer knew of her disability,yet failed to reasonably accommodate it.lang,at.
however,the burden for the employee at the second step of the inquiry changes slightly when an employee becomes disabled,can no longer perform the essential functions of her job,and requests as an accommodation a transfer or complete reassignment of duties.instead of addressing the essential functions of her current position,an employee must demonstrate that she can perform the essential functions of the position she desires moreover,the employee must demonstrate that there is an actual vacant position to which she can transfer.lang,at.an employer is not required by the ada to create a new job for an employee,nor to a position that no longer exists.phelps optima health,cir.see also lang,at.
the parties agree that audette has presented evidence that she is disabled within the ada definition,and there is no dispute that audette is unable to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of an active patrol officer but audette argues that the ada entitles her to transfer to a clerical position maintaining nibrs data.
in an attempt to prove that such a vacancy existed,audette cites chief botieri testimony that nibrs data maintenance is a lot of work,takes a lot of time,and that at certain points the department was several months behind in logging all of its data.this testimony demonstrates only that the department had fallen behind on its obligations and that additional help was occasionally used to ease the department backlog.it does nothing to establish that the department had a vacancy that audette could have filled.
she next argues unpersuasively that the time frames clearly demonstrate that there was a vacant nibrs position available.although the department temporarily assigned an injured patrol officer,officer dexter,to assist with nibrs data entry during the summer that audette underwent her first ankle surgery,the department determined that it had sufficiently caught up on the project by early fall,reassigning dexter to work as a station officer on october.audette did not request a transfer to the position until three days after the department e
