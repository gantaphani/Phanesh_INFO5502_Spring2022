from august through january,plaintiff appellant joseph lalli plaintiff or lalli was employed by general nutrition centers,and general nutrition collectively,defendants or gnc as a store manager.lalli challenged his compensation arrangement under the fair labor standards act flsa,and the massachusetts minimum fair wage law state wage law.laws ch.upon gnc motion,the district court dismissed the complaint.lalli now appeals that decision.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
facts background 
the facts of the case are quite straightforward.gnc sells health and wellness products through stores throughout the united states.lalli was a store manager at a gnc store in massachusetts.as a store manager,lalli earned a guaranteed weekly salary regardless of the hours worked that week and a sales commission that varied based upon the amount of eligible sales attributed to him for that week.whenever lalli worked over forty hours in a given week,he was also paid an overtime premium for each hour worked in excess of the forty hours.in calculating lalli overtime,gnc used a fluctuating workweek fww method to calculate his overtime pay rate.under this method,gnc would add together both a the guaranteed salary for the week and b the commissions earned that week divide the total wages by the number of hours the employee logged for that week and pay an additional of the resulting per hour rate for any hour worked in excess of forty hours that week.
on december,lalli filed a complaint alleging violations of the flsa and the state wage law.lalli alleged that gnc method of calculating overtime violated the statutes,arguing that the fww calculation method lawfully applies only when a business pays a fixed amount for the week.because the commission earnings varied from week to week,lalli alleged that gnc did not pay him a fixed amount.one month later,gnc moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court allowed the motion,concluding that an employer may use the fww method to assess overtime pay rates even when an employee weekly pay varies as a result of commissions.lalli then filed the instant appeal.
ii.analysis 
the requires employers to compensate employees for each hour worked in excess of forty hours during a workweek at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which they are employed.a.t he regular rate refers to the hourly rate actually paid the employee for the normal,workweek for which he is employed.walling youngerman reynolds hardwood.
if an employee is paid a fixed salary each week regardless of the hours worked,the employer calculates the regular rate each week by dividing the weekly wages by the hours worked that particular week.overnight motor transp.missel,n.t hough week by week the regular rate varies with the number of hours worked,it is regular in the statutory sense inasmuch as the rate per hour does not vary for the entire week.id.at.the employer then multiplies the regular rate by to produce the additional overtime compensation that must be paid for every hour worked beyond forty that week.town of agawam,cir.only an additional half is required to satisfy the statute because the time in has already been compensated under the salary arrangement id.at.
all of these principles are echoed and illustrated in the interpretive bulletins issued by the department of labor dol.in,the dol lays out the general rule for calculating overtime pay 
the regular rate under the act is a rate per hour.the act does not require employers to compensate employees on an hourly rate basis their earnings may be determined on a,salary,commission,or other basis,but in such case the overtime compensation due to employees must be computed on the basis of the hourly rate derived therefrom the regular hourly rate of pay of an employee is determined by dividing his total remuneration for employment in any workweek by the total number of hours actually worked by him in that workweek for which such compensation was paid.
section then states that t he following sections give some examples of the proper method of determining the regular rate of pay in particular instances.
two examples of compliant pay structures warrant particularly close attention here.section describes what to do when an employee receives a f ixed salary for fluctuating hours.according to the dol,an employee may be employed on a salary basis and have hours which fluctuate from week to week if the salary is paid pursuant to an understanding with his employer that he will receive such fixed amount as straight time pay for whatever hours he is called upon to work in a workweek,whether few or many.a.where there is a clear mutual understanding that the fixed salary is compensation for the hours worked each workweek,whatever their number,such a salary arrangement is permitted by the act if the resulting regular rate is sufficient to provide compensation above the minimum wage rate.id.as in missel,the regular rate is determined by dividing the number of hours worked in the workweek into the amount of the salary.id.payment for overtime hours at such rate in addition to the salary satisfies the overtime pay requirement because such hours have already been compensated at the straight time regular rate.id.emphasis added.
in,we restated these conditions in a test 
the employee hours must fluctuate from week to week 
the employee must receive a fixed salary that does not vary with the number of hours worked during the week excluding overtime premiums 
the fixed amount must be sufficient to provide compensation every week at a regular rate that is at least equal to the minimum wage and 
the employer and employee must share a clear mutual understanding that the employer will pay that fixed salary regardless of the number of hours worked.
at.if the employer uses the fww method,it must satisfy a fifth factor in order to comply with the flsa overtime requirement the employee must receiv e a fifty percent overtime premium in addition to the fixed weekly salary for all hours worked in excess of during the week.see wills radioshack,d,emphasis added.
section,on the other hand,describes what to do when an employee receives a c ommission paid on a workweek basis.as an adjacent section points out commissions must be included in the regular rate.this is true regardless of whether the commission is the sole source of the employee compensation or is paid in addition to a guaranteed salary.when the commission is paid on a weekly basis,it is added to the employee other earnings for that workweek and the total is divided by the total number of hours worked in the workweek to obtain the employee regular hourly rate for the particular workweek.id.as with the overtime premium provided under section,where an employee compensation arrangement already accounts for the time in,the employee who earns a commission on a workweek basis must then be paid extra compensation at of that rate for each hour worked in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard.id.emphasis added.
in the instant case,defendants employed a pay structure that combines the example set out in section a fixed weekly salary regardless of hours worked with the example set out in section commissions paid weekly because each element reflects a permissible compensation scheme,one might suspect defendants to be on solid footing.instead,plaintiff contends that two rights make a wrong,and that the commission component of the pay arrangement takes the pay scheme as a whole outside the example provided in section.the district court rejected this contention,and we review its determination de novo.ruivo wells fargo bank,cir.
we agree with the district court and hold that the payment of a commission does not foreclose the application of section with respect to the salary portion of the pay structure at issue.
lalli was paid a fixed salary for whatever hours he worked,and lalli earned commissions were added to his regular rate calculation.gnc then paid lalli a premium on top of the regular rate for all overtime hours worked.based on the plain language of the federal regulations at issue,gnc compensation arrangement would seem to pass muster.plaintiff demurs,pointing first to our decision in and next to the dol interpretive bulletins.we turn to first.
in,this circuit considered whether the pay scheme established in a collective bargaining agreement cba between a town and its police officers satisfied the fixed salary requirement of a.at.under the cba,officers worked four shifts every six days,each shift being eight hours.id.at.officers received of a yearly base salary each week regardless of how many hours they worked that week.id.at.
the cba also included contractual overtime and pay.for the former,an officer would receive contractually stipulated overtime pay at a rate of for each hour worked in excess of eight hours on any given shift,whether or not the officer was entitled to overtime under the flsa at the end of the week id.at.for the latter,an officer would receive an additional per week for any week in which the officer worked a nighttime shift.id.at.
this circuit held that both the contractual overtime and the shift differential meant that the officers did not receive a fixed amount as pay for whatever hours they worked.id.at.for this reason,the compensation scheme did not meet the second,fixed salary condition of section test for calculating overtime.id.at.
plaintiff points to some of broader language in an attempt to extend its holding to the circumstances before us.this attempt fails.examined two forms of compensation that were ruled to be incompatible with section.neither of these forms of compensation is before us,and both are distinguishable from the commissions at hand.
with respect to contractual overtime,we noted that the officers receive d more or less pay depending on how many contractual overtime hours they work ed each week.id.at.this was inconsistent with section,which clearly states that the salary may be paid an employee pursuant to an understanding with his employer that he will receive such fixed amount as straight time pay for whatever hours he is called upon to work in a workweek,whether few or many.emphasis added.unlike in,the employee here received a fixed salary that did not vary based on the number of hours worked.thus,is inapposite on this point.
with respect to pay,however,the compensation varied even without reference to the number of hours worked.id.at.rather,the compensation varied with the type of hours worked because nighttime hours were more valuable than daytime hours.id.the court held that this too does not fit the mold and made quick work of the provision,pointing out that merely assuring a level of fixed minimum compensation is not sufficient to place a pay scheme within section.id.
although the town purported to pay a base salary,the salary could not actually be called fixed with respect to the hours worked because the compensation for those hours varied from week to week.simply put,one can not have a fixed salary based on all hours worked if all hours worked do not fall within that fixed salary.therefore,because the pay was part of the officers salary,it require d the larger conclusion that the officers did not receive a fixed salary as straight time pay for whatever hours they were called upon to work in the workweek.id.at,citing emphasis added.
plaintiff tries to draw a broader lesson from the language and argues that any additional form of compensation that must be factored into an employee regular rate removes the pay scheme as a whole from the purview of section because employees must receive a fixed amount for labor each week.see id.at.this is based on use of the term pay,which refers to pay for normal,hours.see manning bos.med.ctr,cir.
this view,while tenable,is ultimately unpersuasive because it inflates the import of a single sentence in our decision to find answers to questions that were not asked there.unlike in,the salary here remains fixed regardless of the number or type of hours worked.only the commissions vary.returning to the dol own language,it is evident that t he regulation does not expressly preclude payment of such bonuses.switzer wachovia,no.h,wl,at.
section,by its plain language,requires a fixed salary for hours worked,not a fixed total amount of compensation for the week 
an employee employed on a salary basis may have hours of work which fluctuate from week to week and the salary may be paid him pursuant to an understanding with his employer that he will receive such fixed amount as straight time pay for whatever hours he is called upon to work in a workweek,whether few or many.emphasis added.
the fixed amount as pay referred to in,at,is the same fixed amount as straight time pay referred to in the text above,a.this,in turn,refers to the fixed salary otherwise mentioned throughout the regulation.see id.and the term salary,of course,can not be read so broadly as to encompass all forms of compensation comprising the regular rate.as the district court pointed out,section speaks of commissions being paid in addition to a guaranteed salary,a phrase that makes little sense if commissions are already part of the employee salary.similarly,section states that it is the total remuneration except statutory exclusions that must be included in the calculation,suggesting that different types of remuneration,salary plus commissions may be combined in a compliant compensation plan.
the premiums in betrayed any claim that the officers salary could be described as fixed regardless of the hours worked,even if part of that salary the base salary did not fluctuate.as both the court and other courts have noted,the regulation requires that the fixed salary cover whatever hours are worked,not merely that the employees receiv e a minimum salary every week.see adeva intertek usa,no,wl,at,accord,at i t is not enough that the officers receive a fixed minimum sum each week.
in the instant case,the employee was paid on the combination of a salary basis under section and a commission basis under section.the employee had hours of work which fluctuate d from week to week and the salary was paid him pursuant to an understanding that he would receive such fixed amount as straight time pay for whatever hours he was called upon to work in the workweek.the fact that lalli was given additional commissions as pay for whatever eligible sales he made does not detract at all from the fact that he was given his salary as pay for whatever hours he worked.
plaintiff would have us rewrite section in the following manner to be restrictive rather than illustrative 
an employee may be employed on a salary basis for hours of work which fluctuate from week to week only if the salary is paid him pursuant to an understanding with his employer that he will receive only such fixed amount as straight time pay for the workweek.
we can not,and should not,ignore the plain language of the regulation,especially when doing so runs counter to the statute inherently flexible nature.see madison asselta,it was not the purpose of congress in enacting the flsa to impose upon the almost infinite variety of employment situations a single,rigid form of wage agreement.in short,lalli dissection of mistakes the forest for the trees.gnc compensation structure fits comfortably within dol regulations and nothing in compels us to hold otherwise.
not only is it therefore unnecessary to extend to encompass commissions,it would also be inappropriate to do so.that is because,under section,bonuses can not be said to vary based on the hours worked absent unusual circumstances not present here.although both bonuses and sales commissions may relate to the type of hours worked in some broad or conceptual sense insofar as some parts of the day may typically entail more sales than others,a bonus for particular hours worked necessarily varies by the hour worked whereas a commission for sales only incidentally varies by the hour worked.
when an employee is paid a bonus for working a nighttime shift,his pay fluctuates as a direct result of the hour he is called upon to work.his compensation,by definition,varies with respect to the particular hour without regard to whether that hour is spent productively or idly.thus,any underlying salary could not be called fixed with respect to whatever hours h
