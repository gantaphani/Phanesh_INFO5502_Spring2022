respondent abercrombie refused to hire samantha elauf,a practicing muslim,because the headscarf that she wore pursuant to her religious obligations conflicted with abercrombie employee dress policy.the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc filed suit on elauf behalf,alleging a violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,which,inter alia,prohibits a prospective employer from refusing to hire an applicant because of the applicant religious practice when the practice could be accommodated without undue hardship.the eeoc prevailed in the district court,but the tenth circuit reversed,awarding abercrombie summary judgment on the ground that liability attaches only when the applicant provides the employer with actual knowledge of his need for an accommodation.
held to prevail in a claim,an applicant need show only that his need for an accommodation was a motivating factor in the employer decision,not that the employer had knowledge of his need.title vii provision requires elauf to show that abercrombie fail ed to hire her because of her religion including a religious practice.a.and its because of standard is understood to mean that the protected characteristic can not be a motivating factor in an employment decision.m.thus,rather than imposing a knowledge standard,a prohibits certain motives,regardless of the state of the actor knowledge an employer may not make an applicant religious practice,confirmed or otherwise,a factor in employment decisions.title vii contains no knowledge requirement.furthermore,title vii definition of religion clearly indicates that challenges can be brought as claims.and title vii gives favored treatment to religious practices,rather than demanding that religious practices be treated no worse than other practices.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits a prospective employer from refusing to hire an applicant in order to avoid accommodating a religious practice that it could accommodate without undue hardship.the question presented is whether this prohibition applies only where an applicant has informed the employer of his need for an accommodation.
we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,against whom the tenth circuit granted summary judgment.respondent abercrombie fitch stores,operates several lines of clothing stores,each with its own style.consistent with the image abercrombie seeks to project for each store,the company imposes a look policy that governs its employees dress.the look policy prohibits caps a term the policy does not define as too informal for abercrombie desired image.
samantha elauf is a practicing muslim who,consistent with her understanding of her religion requirements,wears a headscarf.she applied for a position in an abercrombie store,and was interviewed by heather cooke,the store assistant manager.using abercrombie ordinary system for evaluating applicants,cooke gave elauf a rating that qualified her to be hired cooke was concerned,however,that elauf headscarf would conflict with the store look policy.
cooke sought the store manager guidance to clarify whether the headscarf was a forbidden cap.when this yielded no answer,cooke turned to randall johnson,the district manager.cooke informed johnson that she believed elauf wore her headscarf because of her faith.johnson told cooke that elauf headscarf would violate the look policy,as would all other headwear,religious or otherwise,and directed cooke not to hire elauf.
the eeoc sued abercrombie on elauf behalf,claiming that its refusal to hire elauf violated title vii.the district court granted the eeoc summary judgment on the issue of liability,supp.nd,held a trial on damages,and awarded.the tenth circuit reversed and awarded abercrombie summary judgment.it concluded that ordinarily an employer can not be liable under title vii for failing to accommodate a religious practice until the applicant or employee provides the employer with actual knowledge of his need for an accommodation,at.we granted certiorari.
title vii of the civil rights act of stat,as amended,prohibits two categories of employment.it is unlawful for an employer 
to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin or 
to limit,segregate,or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.
these two proscriptions,often referred to as the disparate treatment or intentional discrimination provision and the disparate impact provision,are the only causes of action under title vii.the word religion is defined to includ e all aspects of religious observance and practice,as well as belief,unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to a religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer business.j 
abercrombie primary argument is that an applicant can not show disparate treatment without first showing that an employer has actual knowledge of the applicant need for an accommodation.we disagree.instead,an applicant need only show that his need for an accommodation was a motivating factor in the employer decision 
the provision forbids employers to fail to hire an applicant because of such individual religion which includes his religious practice.here,of course,abercrombie failed to hire elauf.the parties concede that if elauf sincerely believes that her religion so requires elauf wearing of a headscarf is a religious practice.all that remains is whether she was not hired because of her religious practice.
the term because of appears frequently in antidiscrimination laws.it typically imports,at a minimum,the traditional standard of causation.university of.southwestern medical center nassar.title vii relaxes this standard,however,to prohibit even making a protected characteristic a motivating factor in an employment decision.m.because of in a links the forbidden consideration to each of the verbs preceding it an individual actual religious practice may not be a motivating factor in failing to hire,in refusing to hire,and so on.
it is significant that a does not impose a knowledge requirement.as abercrombie acknowledges,some antidiscrimination statutes do.for example,the americans with disabilities act of defines discrimination to include an employer failure to make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an applicant.b a emphasis added.title vii contains no such limitation.
instead,the intentional discrimination provision prohibits certain motives,regardless of the state of the actor knowledge.motive and knowledge are separate concepts.an employer who has actual knowledge of the need for an accommodation does not violate title vii by refusing to hire an applicant if avoiding that accommodation is not his motive.conversely,an employer who acts with the motive of avoiding accommodation may violate title vii even if he has no more than an unsubstantiated suspicion that accommodation would be needed.
thus,the rule for claims based on a failure to accommodate a religious practice is straightforward an employer may not make an applicant religious practice,confirmed or otherwise,a factor in employment decisions.for example,suppose that an employer thinks though he does not know for certain that a job applicant may be an orthodox jew who will observe the sabbath,and thus be unable to work on saturdays.if the applicant actually requires an accommodation of that religious practice,and the employer desire to avoid the prospective accommodation is a motivating factor in his decision,the employer violates title vii.
abercrombie urges this court to adopt the tenth circuit rule allocat ing the burden of raising a religious conflict.brief for respondent.this would require the employer to have actual knowledge of a conflict between an applicant religious practice and a work rule.the problem with this approach is the one that inheres in most incorrect interpretations of statutes it asks us to add words to the law to produce what is thought to be a desirable result.that is congress province.we construe title vii silence as exactly that silence.its provision prohibits actions taken with the motive of avoiding the need for accommodating a religious practice.a request for accommodation,or the employer certainty that the practice exists,may make it easier to infer motive,but is not a necessary condition of liability 
abercrombie argues in the alternative that a claim based on a failure to accommodate an applicant religious practice must be raised as a claim,not a claim.we think not.that might have been true if congress had limited the meaning of religion in title vii to religious belief so that discriminating against a particular religious practice would not be disparate treatment though it might have disparate impact.in fact,however,congress defined religion,for title vii purposes,as includ ing all aspects of religious observance and practice,as well as belief.j.thus,religious practice is one of the protected characteristics that can not be accorded disparate treatment and must be accommodated.
nor does the statute limit claims to only those employer policies that treat religious practices less favorably than similar secular practices.abercrombie argument that a neutral policy can not constitute intentional discrimination may make sense in other contexts.but title vii does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices that they be treated no worse than other practices.rather,it gives them favored treatment,affirmatively obligating employers not to fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual because of such individual religious observance and practice.an employer is surely entitled to have,for example,a policy as an ordinary matter.but when an applicant requires an accommodation as an aspec t of religious practice,it is no response that the fail ure to hire was due to an policy.title vii requires policies to give way to the need for an accommodation.
the tenth circuit misinterpreted title vii requirements in granting summary judgment.we reverse its judgment and remand the case for further consideration consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
alito,concurring in judgment 
equal employment opportunity commission,petitioner abercrombie fitch stores.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice alito,concurring in the judgment.
this case requires us to interpret a provision of title vii of the civil rights act of that prohibits an employer from taking an adverse employment action refusal to hire,discharge,against any individual because of such individual religion.a.another provision states that the term religion includes all aspects of religious observance and practice,as well as belief,unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee or prospective employee religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer business.j.when these two provisions are put together,the following rule expressed in somewhat simplified terms results an employer may not take an adverse employment action against an applicant or employee because of any aspect of that individual religious observance or practice unless the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate that observance or practice without undue hardship.
in this case,samantha elauf,a practicing muslim,wore a headscarf for a religious reason when she was interviewed for a job in a store operated by abercrombie fitch.she was rejected because her scarf violated abercrombie dress code for employees.there is sufficient evidence in the summary judgment record to support a finding that abercrombie decisionmakers knew that elauf was a muslim and that she wore the headscarf for a religious reason.but she was never asked why she wore the headscarf and did not volunteer that information.nor was she told that she would be prohibited from wearing the headscarf on the job.the tenth circuit held that abercrombie was entitled to summary judgment because,except perhaps in unusual circumstances,a pplicants or employees must initially inform employers of their religious practices that conflict with a work requirement and their need for a reasonable accommodation for them.emphasis deleted.
the relevant provisions of title vii,however,do not impose the notice requirement that formed the basis for the tenth circuit decision.while i interpret those provisions to require proof that abercrombie knew that elauf wore the headscarf for a religious reason,the evidence of abercrombie knowledge is sufficient to defeat summary judgment.
the opinion of the court states that a does not impose a knowledge requirement,ante,at,but then reserves decision on the question whether it is a condition of liability that the employer know or suspect that the practice he refuses to accommodate is a religious practice,ante,at,but in my view,the answer to this question,which may arise on remand is obvious.i would hold that an employer can not be held liable for taking an adverse action because of an employee religious practice unless the employer knows that the employee engages in the practice for a religious reason.if a really does not impose a knowledge requirement,ante at,it would be irrelevant in this case whether abercrombie had any inkling that elauf is a muslim or that she wore the headscarf for a religious reason.that would be very strange.
the scarves that elauf wore were not articles of clothing that were designed or marketed specifically for muslim women.instead,she generally purchased her scarves at ordinary clothing stores.in this case,the abercrombie employee who interviewed elauf had seen her wearing scarves on other occasions,and for reasons that the record does not make clear,came to the correct conclusion that she is a muslim.but suppose that the interviewer in this case had never seen elauf before.suppose that the interviewer thought elauf was wearing the scarf for a secular reason.suppose that nothing else about elauf made the interviewer even suspect that she was a muslim or that she was wearing the scarf for a religious reason.if a does not impose a knowledge requirement,abercrombie would still be liable.the eeoc,which sued on elauf behalf,does not adopt that interpretation,see,brief for petitioner,and it is surely wrong.
the statutory text does not compel such a strange result.it is entirely reasonable to understand the prohibition against an employer taking an adverse action because of a religious practice to mean that an employer may not take an adverse action because of a practice that the employer knows to be religious.consider the following sentences.the parole board granted the prisoner parole because of an exemplary record in prison.the court sanctioned the attorney because of a flagrant violation of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.no one is likely to understand these sentences to mean that the parole board granted parole because of a record that,unbeknownst to the board,happened to be exemplary or that the court sanctioned the attorney because of a violation that,unbeknownst to the court,happened to be flagrant.similarly,it is entirely reasonable to understand this statement the employer rejected the applicant because of a religious practice to mean that the employer rejected the applicant because of a practice that the employer knew to be religious.
this interpretation makes sense of the statutory provisions.those provisions prohibit intentional discrimination,which is blameworthy conduct,but if there is no knowledge requirement,an employer could be held liable without fault.the prohibition of discrimination because of religious practices is meant to force employers to consider whether those practices can be accommodated without undue hardship.see j.but the interpretation would deprive employers of that opportunity.for these reasons,an employer can not be liable for taking adverse action because of a religious practice if the employer does not know that the practice is religious.
a plaintiff need not show,however,that the employer took the adverse action because of the religious nature of the practice.post,at thomas,concurring in part and dissenting in part.suppose,for example,that an employer rejected all applicants who refuse to work on saturday,whether for religious or nonreligious reasons.applicants whose refusal to work on saturday was known by the employer to be based on religion will have been rejected because of a religious practice.
this conclusion follows from the reasonable accommodation requirement imposed by j.if neutral work rules,every employee must work on saturday,no employee may wear any head covering precluded liability,there would be no need to provide that defense,which allows an employer to escape liability for refusing to make an exception to a neutral work rule if doing so would impose an undue hardship.
this brings me to a final point.under the relevant statutory provisions,an employer failure to make a reasonable accommodation is not an element that the plaintiff must prove.i am therefore concerned about the court statement that it is the plaintiff burden to prove failure to accommodate.ante,at.this blatantly contradicts the language of the statutes.as i noted at the beginning,when a and j are combined,this is the result 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire any individual because of any aspect of such individual religious practice unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to the employee or prospective employee religious practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer business.emphasis added.
the clause that begins with the term unless unmistakably sets out an employer defense.if an employer chooses to assert that defense,it bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.a plaintiff,on the other hand,must prove the elements set out prior to the unless clause,but that portion of the rule makes no mention of accommodation.thus,a plaintiff need not plead or prove that the employer wished to avoid making an accommodation or could have done so without undue hardship.if a plaintiff shows that the employer took an adverse employment action because of a religious observance or practice,it is then up to the employer to plead and prove the defense.the court statement subverts the statutory text,and in close cases,the court reallocation of the burden of persuasion may be decisive.
in sum,the eeoc was required in this case to prove that abercrombie rejected elauf because of a practice that abercrombie knew was religious.it is undisputed that abercrombie rejected elauf because she wore a headscarf,and there is ample evidence in the summary judgment record to prove that abercrombie knew that elauf is a muslim and that she wore the scarf for a religious reason.the tenth circuit therefore erred in ordering the entry of summary judgment for abercrombie.on remand,the tenth circuit can consider whether there is sufficient evidence to support summary judgment in favor of the eeoc on the question of abercrombie knowledge.the tenth circuit will also be required to address abercrombie claim that it could not have accommodated elauf wearing the headscarf on the job without undue hardship.
opinion of thomas,
equal employment opportunity commission,petitioner abercrombie fitch stores.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice thomas,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
i agree with the court that there are two and only two causes of action under title vii of the civil rights act of as understood by our precedents a or claim and a claim.ante,at.our agreement ends there.unlike the majority,i adhere to what i had thought before today was an undisputed proposition mere application of a neutral policy can not constitute intentional discrimination.because the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc can prevail here only if abercrombie engaged in intentional discrimination,and because abercrombie application of its neutral look policy does not meet that description,i would affirm the judgment of the tenth circuit.
this case turns on whether abercrombie conduct constituted intentional discrimination within the meaning of a.that provision allows a title vii plaintiff to recover compensatory and punitive damages only against an employer who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination not an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact.the damages award eeoc obtained against abercrombie is thus proper only if that company engaged in intentional discrimination as opposed to an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact within the meaning of a.
the terms intentional discrimination and disparate impact have settled meanings in federal employment discrimination law.i ntentional discrimination occur s where an employer has treated a particular person less favorably than others because of a protected trait.ricci destefano,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.d claims,by contrast,involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and can not be justified by business necessity.raytheon hernandez,internal quotation marks omitted.conceived by this court in griggs duke power,this theory of discrimination provides that a facially neutral employment practice may be deemed illegally discriminatory without evidence of the employer subjective intent to discriminate that is required in a case,raytheon,supra,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
i would hold that abercrombie conduct did not constitute intentional discrimination.abercrombie refused to create an exception to its neutral look policy for samantha elauf religious practice of wearing a headscarf.ante,at.in doing so,it did not treat religious practices less favorably than similar secular practices,but instead remained neutral with regard to religious practices.to be sure,the effects of abercrombie neutral look policy,absent an accommodation,fall more harshly on those who wear headscarves as an aspect of their faith.but that is a classic case of an alleged disparate impact.it is not what we have previously understood to be a case of disparate treatment because elauf received the same treatment from abercrombie as any other applicant who appeared unable to comply with the company look policy.see app.because i can not classify abercrombie conduct as intentional discrimination,i would affirm.
resisting this straightforward application of,the majority expands the meaning of intentional discrimination to include a refusal to give a religious applicant favored treatment.ante,at.but contrary to the majority assumption,this novel theory of discrimination is not commanded by the relevant statutory text.
title vii makes it illegal for an employer to fail or refuse to hire any individual because of such individual religion.a.and as used in title vii,t he term religion includes all aspects of religious observance and practice,as well as belief,unless an employer demonstrates that h
