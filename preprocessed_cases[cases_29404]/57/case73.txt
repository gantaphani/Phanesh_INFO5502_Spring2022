this is a petition for review,in a federal railroad safety act frsa whistleblower retaliation action,of an agency decision resulting in the statutory maximum award of punitive damages against a railroad.the railroad brought charges of dishonesty and insubordination,as well as threats of dismissal,against an injured employee who had filed a complaint under the frsa with the occupational safety and health administration osha,alleging that he lied in that complaint about precisely how his accident happened,based on a purported discrepancy between the complaint and his prior story.an administrative law judge alj later found that those charges of dishonesty constituted unlawful retaliation against the employee for filing the osha complaint.
we agree with the department of labor administrative review board arb that substantial evidence supported the alj rejection of the railroad affirmative defense and the alj decision to impose punitive damages.the amount of the punitive damages award presents a closer question.the award seems high,and we might ourselves have chosen a different sum.in the end,however,we conclude that the alj decision to award punitive damages of,to punish and deter what he perceived to be a culture of intimidating employees and discouraging them from engaging in protected activity,was within the realm of his discretion.we deny the petition for review.
a.the frsa and raye injury 
this story begins with an accident in which jason raye,a train conductor for a subsidiary of petitioner pan am railways,pan am,injured his ankle and missed work as a result.the frsa employee protection provision forbids railroad carriers from retaliating against employees who engage in protected activity,such as reporting a workplace injury or filing an osha complaint.see.importantly,this case concerns frsa retaliation against raye for filing an osha complaint.
a few weeks before his accident,on october,raye noticed a pile of old railroad ties next to a track in a railyard in waterville,maine.he thought the pile a tripping hazard and reported it to his manager,dwynn williams.the pile was not removed before raye accident 
on october,during his shift,raye stepped off a train onto that same pile of railroad ties and badly sprained his ankle.we recount later his testimony about the accident.raye called his dispatcher for a ride to the hospital,where raye was diagnosed with the sprain.williams visited raye at the hospital,and raye explained that he had rolled his ankle on the same ties that he had turned in three weeks ago.in response,williams said that raye should probably expect a disciplinary hearing in the wake of the injury.
raye had two scheduled days off after his injury,but he needed three days to recover,so he missed a day of work.that missed day required pan am to report raye injury and the injury cause to the federal railroad administration fra.see d i.when raye returned to work on october,his superintendent,jim quinn,learned about the injury and the missed day.quinn told raye that the missed day change d everything and that t here w ould probably be a hearing for that fra reportable injury,for missing a day.
first pan am disciplinary proceeding brought against raye for his alleged safety violation 
on november,raye received a notice of hearing from pan am,signed by williams.the notice alleged that raye had violated pan am safety rule,which provides that b efore getting on and off a train,employees must carefully observe ground condition and be assured of firm footing.at the november,hearing,raye testified that he had stepped down from the train safely and cautiously,but had nonetheless lost his balance on the unstable pile of ties.raye also testified that after rolling his ankle he had caught him self and sat down on the ground rather than falling over.
on november,john schultz,pan am vice president of transportation,sent raye a letter stating that raye had failed to assure himself of firm footing before stepping onto the pile of ties.the letter itself serve d as discipline in the form of a formal r eprimand and a copy of it w as placed in raye personal file.
raye osha complaint,second pan am disciplinary proceeding for raye alleged dishonesty,and raye amended osha complaint charging retaliation 
raye retained a lawyer,who drafted and submitted a typed complaint to osha on december,without raye first reviewing or signing it.this initial complaint accused pan am of violating the frsa by retaliating against raye,both for reporting a safety hazard and for reporting his injury.see a,b a.the typed osha complaint was consistent with raye testimony at the earlier pan am disciplinary hearing,with one exception the complaint stated that raye fell hard to the ground at the time of the injury,rather than that he sat down on the ground.
on december,osha sent pan am a copy of raye complaint and sought pan am response to the allegations.at the request of pan am legal and human resources departments,schultz reviewed the osha complaint which he reasonably believed had been drafted by raye himself and thought there was a major discrepancy between the complaint statement about raye falling hard to the ground and raye prior hearing testimony that he had caught himself and sat down on the ground after stumbling.that discrepancy,schultz said later,caused pan am to make a collective determination to bring a second set of disciplinary charges against raye.pan am made that determination without any effort to first ask raye about the purported inconsistency.
on december,pan am sent raye a second notice of hearing,which directed him to appear at a second disciplinary proceeding,levied several serious charges against him,and threatened him with termination.osha and the alj would later find that retaliation against raye for filing the initial osha complaint was a contributing factor in pan am decision to bring these new charges.the notice alleged that raye had p rovid ed false statements to pan am a government agency,in connection with his description as to how the incident on october,took place.that purported dishonesty,the notice further alleged,violated two pan am safety rules rule,which threatens employees with dismissal if they commit act s of insubordination,hostility,or willful disregard of pan am interests or if they conduct themselves in such a manner that pan am will be subject to criticism or loss of good will and rule,which threatens employees with dismissal if they are dishonest,immoral,vicious,quarrelsome,and uncivil in deportment or careless of the safety of themselves or of others.the notice did not specify which of raye statements about the accident were alleged to have been dishonest or insubordinat e.
raye lawyer,in response,amended the osha complaint on december,to include an allegation that the second set of charges amounted to pan am retaliating against raye for having filed the original osha complaint.see a.he enclosed the new notice of hearing and asserted to osha that pan am was clearly bringing these additional charges in retaliation for the original osha complaint.
the second pan am disciplinary hearing,addressing the new charges of dishonesty and insubordination,took place on january.raye explained that his lawyer had written the statement in the osha complaint,that he himself had not been aware of the statement contents before the lawyer submitted the complaint to osha,that the discrepant portion of the statement was wrong,and that his testimony at the first hearing had been correct.the facts in the osha complaint,he confirmed,were otherwise accurate and consistent with his prior hearing testimony.finally,he testified that no one from pan am had approached him informally at any time before issuing the second notice of hearing to discuss the purported major discrepancy that schultz had identified 
in a letter dated january,pan am informed raye that the charges of rule violations ha d not been sustained and that no disciplinary action would be taken as a result of the second hearing.
on august,osha rejected raye claim that pan am had retaliated against him for reporting his injury or for reporting a safety hazard,finding that pan am had provided clear and convincing evidence that it would have reprimanded raye if it had observed the incident,even if no injury resulted.
osha agreed with raye,however,that pan am had unlawfully retaliated against him by bringing the second set of charges after he filed the original osha complaint.pan am had not provided clear and convincing evidence,osha found,that it would have taken the same adverse action even if raye had not engaged in protected activity.osha further noted that once a frsa allegation has been made to osha,it is osha responsibility,not an employer,to establish the truth of assertions made by both parties.
alj and arb proceedings 
on september,pan am objected to osha finding of retaliation and requested a de novo hearing before an alj.that hearing took place on february.the alj heard live testimony from raye and from schultz.pan am sought to introduce several exhibits documenting past instances of employee discipline,which it characterized as comparator evidence supporting its affirmative defense that it would have taken the same action even absent raye protected activity.the alj admitted the documents about which schultz could testify from personal experience,but excluded others for which pan am could provide no explanation or context.
the alj issued his decision and order on june.first,he found that raye protected activity filing an osha complaint had been a contributing factor in pan am decision to charge raye with dishonesty and to hold a second hearing.next,he rejected pan am affirmative defense,holding that pan am had not prove d by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent raye protected activity.he dismissed as inadequate pan am proffered comparator evidence because those instances of investigation and discipline were not fairly comparable to raye circumstances.
finally,the alj turned to what relief was necessary to make raye whole,e,and awarded raye in damages for emotional distress.he also imposed in punitive damages the maximum amount that the frsa allows,see id.e because pan am had utilized the disciplinary process to intimidate and discourage protected activity,not only by raye,but by other employees of pan am as well.
pan am appealed the alj decision to the arb,which affirmed.the arb held that substantial evidence supported the alj determination that pan am had failed to prove its affirmative defense by clear and convincing evidence.it also found no abuse of discretion in the award of.
the scope of our review of pan am petition for review of the arb final order is limited by the administrative procedure act.see d r b,llc dep t of labor,admin.review,cir.accordingly,we must deny the petition unless the arb legal conclusions are arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with law,or its factual conclusions are unsupported by substantial evidence.r b,at quoting clean harbors envtl,herman,cir.the substantial evidence standard is a hurdle notoriously difficult to overcome on appellate review.vieques air link,dep t of labor,cir.per curiam quoting bath iron works dep t of labor,cir.
pan am petition raises two issues.first,pan am argues that it established in the alj proceeding,by clear and convincing evidence,its affirmative defense that it would have issued the second notice of hearing and threatened raye with termination for dishonesty even if he had not engaged in protected activity by filing an osha complaint.second,pan am argues that the punitive damages award was unsupported by substantial evidence and clearly excessive.pan am does not challenge the abuse of discretion standard of judicial review as to the amount of punitive damages.
rejection of pan am affirmative defense that it would have charged raye with dishonesty even absent his protected activity 
under the frsa,an employee alleging retaliation bears the initial burden of demonstrating that his protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.b b iii see id.d a.pan am does not dispute that raye met his contributing factor burden and shifted the burden to pan am to prove,by clear and convincing evidence,that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of the protected activity.id.b b iv 
pan am takes two tacks in challenging the alj rejection of its affirmative defense.first,it argues that the alj abused his discretion by excluding material comparator evidence.second,it argues that the mere fact of discrepancy between the two accounts of raye accident is sufficient to meet pan am burden of proof.
pan am comparator evidence 
pan am faults the alj for excluding certain notices of investigation and records of arbitration awards,which pan am sought to introduce as additional comparator evidence.there was no abuse of discretion in the alj decision to exclude those exhibits.pan am contends that the exhibits were admissible as business records or public records.see a,a.but that argument misses the point the kalj excluded the exhibits not because they were hearsay,but rather because their probative value was minimal without a witness to explain their significance and in light of the exhibits already in evidence.see id.the alj was within his discretion in concluding that the proffered exhibits,without additional context,should not be admitted.
in any event,the record makes clear that any error was harmless.the excluded exhibits,on their face,merely suggested that pan am may have previously disciplined employees for false statements.the key issue,however,was whether the false statements in those instances were of a similar character as the discrepancy that pan am chose to investigate formally and aggressively in raye case.the excluded exhibits do not themselves describe circumstances that are reasonably comparable to raye,and no other evidence makes them so.there is no reason to believe that the alj would have afforded the exhibits any weight,or changed his mind,had they been admitted.see r b,at finding any purported evidentiary error harmless in light of the other evidence considered by the alj mekhoukh ashcroft,cir.the evidence not considered contains no information that materially affects the outcome of petitioner claims.
pan am also argues that the comparator evidence the alj did admit was sufficient to meet its burden to prove its affirmative defense.but those disciplinary records,too,had only indirect relevance to raye case they involved patently and materially false hearing testimony by the employees,rather than mere discrepancies,and the notices given there to the employees did not threaten to fire them after the employees had made a statement to osha.
rejection of pan am purportedly motive for charging raye with dishonesty 
pan am contends that the two accounts of raye accident were fundamentally irreconcilable and that the discrepancy gave pan am a motive to charge raye with violations and to hold a second formal hearing.but the alj had substantial evidence and reason not to credit pan am explanation.
first,the alj was entitled to evaluate the hearing testimony of schultz,pan am key decision maker,and decide whether schultz explanation was sufficiently credible.there were reasons to doubt schultz credibility.in his initial testimony,he mischaracterized the description of the accident contained in the osha complaint.only on did he admit his mischaracterization.the alj also reasonably gave weight to schultz failure simply to ask raye about the perceived discrepancy before rushing to charge raye formally with dishonesty and to threaten him with the loss of his job.again,the alj rejected pan am purported reasons for its failure to do so.
although there may be room for disagreement about the significance and extent of the discrepancy,we are not the triers of fact.substantial evidence supported the alj conclusion that pan am overstated the significance of the discrepancy and failed to prove that it would have taken the same adverse actions if raye had not filed the osha complaint.
pan am argues that the alj ignored an arb precedent requiring him to consider the proportional relationship between the adverse actions and the bases for the
