amilcar guilloty perez guilloty,an agent in the special investigation bureau of the puerto rico department of justice,brought suit against four officials in the department of justice alleging that they retaliated against him for exercising his first amendment rights.after an jury trial the district court granted the defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law under.guilloty now appeals,arguing that he presented sufficient evidence for the case to go to the jury.we agree with the district court that no reasonable jury could have rejected the defense of the government officials that they would have given guilloty negative evaluations and extended his probationary period even in the absence of his protected conduct.
guilloty brought suit under,arguing that certain department of justice officials retaliated against him after he reported instances of alleged corruption and improper handling of investigations within the special investigation bureau sib.before we reach the question of whether guilloty adduced sufficient evidence of protected activity and subsequent retaliation,we will summarize the relevant evidence produced during the trial.
a.the parties 
guilloty has been an agent with the department of justice since february.after completing his training in may,guilloty was assigned to the organized crime investigation division of the special investigation bureau,working out of the department ponce district office.armando sanchez was guilloty immediate supervisor in the ponce office from may until guilloty was transferred to a different office in october.domingo alvarez was the director of the organized crime investigation division from july until december,and was sanchez supervisor during that time.lydia morales was the director of the special investigation bureau from july through december,and served as alvarez supervisor.pedro pierluisi was the secretary of justice during the relevant time period until december.among his numerous other duties,he served as morales supervisor 
guilloty charges 
guilloty complained about three incidents involving the conduct of his supervisor sanchez and other agents in the ponce district office.the first incident and complaint related to a botched drug importation investigation.in may,guilloty went to see director alvarez to report that he had received information from an informant in august that a corrupt police officer not one of the defendants was providing protection for drug shipments guilloty told alvarez that he had passed this information on to his supervisor sanchez,and had also told sanchez that united states customs agents were investigating the same importation and and were interested in collaborating with the puerto rican agents on this investigation.guilloty told alvarez that while he made a number of reports between august and may and repeatedly asked sanchez if he could share his information with the federal agents working on the case,sanchez refused to act on the reports or make a final decision regarding agency cooperation.eventually,guilloty passed on the results of his investigation to the federal officers,and they arrested the corrupt police officer and seized a shipment of drugs in may.guilloty went to alvarez in may to complain about sanchez failure to fully authorize investigation of this drug shipment and after guilloty read in the newspaper about the arrests by the federal officers.
in august,a few months after his meeting with alvarez and after seeing no signs of an investigation,guilloty met with sib director morales and made the same charges against his supervisor,sanchez.morales told him she would order an internal investigation of the incident,but guilloty was never interviewed as part of such an investigation,and morales was never asked at trial whether any such investigation occurred.
at this august meeting with sib director morales,guilloty informed her of his suspicions that ponce district office agents including sanchez were receiving illegal gifts from the owner of a local stable that guilloty also suspected of being involved in illegal drug importation.guilloty had accompanied two agents to the stable where they received what he believed to be gifts of hay.during this visit,his fellow agents told him that he could obtain a horse from the owner of the stable,and that there was a horse waiting there for sanchez as well.director morales did not act on his information.morales testified at trial that guilloty never told her about his suspicions regarding bribes.
finally,guilloty blew the whistle on a fellow agent who allegedly made a false statement in an affidavit to support the seizure of an automobile.in january,a small group of ponce district agents,including guilloty,executed an arrest warrant for a suspect.one of the other agents involved in the arrest,maximino rivera laporte,filed a sworn statement to support the seizure of the suspect car.in that statement,he swore that the suspect was observed smoking marijuana in his car before his arrest.four months later,guilloty became aware of the contents of this sworn statement,and informed the agent in charge of the case,una sepulveda,that the contents of the sworn statement were suspect was not smoking marijuana in his car before his arrest.at this same time,sepulveda and guilloty also informed sanchez of the false statements.sanchez tried to convince guilloty to keep this incident quiet,offering him a transfer he had asked for previously and other benefits.instead,guilloty reported the incident to director alvarez when he met with him in may.guilloty then reported the situation to director morales at the august meeting.
these incidents of alleged corruption and questionable police botched drug investigation,the gifts from the stable,and the false statement and the bribe to keep it over an period between june and april,but guilloty first went to director alvarez in may,and then to director morales in august to report his suspicions.guilloty never met personally with secretary pierluisi.in november,the local newspaper el vocero published a series of articles discussing alleged corruption within the sib,citing an inside source.the parties do not dispute that guilloty was the inside source for these articles.
guilloty evaluations 
at trial,the defendants and their witnesses testified that guilloty was underperforming as an agent with the sib.in september,only three months after guilloty began working with the sib,sanchez,the supervisor of the sib in the ponce district office,sent a memorandum to director alvarez detailing a number of complaints raised by guilloty fellow agents.these agents described guilloty inappropriate questioning of confidential informants and otherwise questionable conduct while in the community.sanchez stated that he believed guilloty could be endangering his fellow agents by his conduct.director alvarez forwarded this memo to director morales,who instructed alvarez to acquire data on guilloty,including information on his history of conduct with the sib.alvarez and morales met to discuss the problems with guilloty.
in march,sanchez sent another memorandum to director alvarez describing more recent problems guilloty was experiencing on the job.specifically,sanchez explained that guilloty had recently disrupted a nighttime surveillance of suspected criminal behavior when he brought,and used,a flash camera to photograph the individuals under surveillance.according to sanchez memo,the subjects of the surveillance quickly dispersed after seeing the flash,and the investigation was scrapped.by the end of may,sanchez had sent alvarez three additional memos outlining problems he was having with guilloty.sometime before may,sanchez memos were given to juan reyes,an sib agent from a different district office,so that he could conduct an independent investigation of the charges listed therein.in august,reyes reported that the incidents described in the memos could be substantiated,and he recommended that the charges against guilloty be referred to the justice department inspector general.
during this time,guilloty was still in his probationary period as an agent and subject to regular evaluations his first evaluation,covering april to june,was generally negative,but his next three evaluations,covering three quarters from july to march,were generally positive.guilloty final two evaluations,delivered to him in november and january,were highly critical,revealing negative conclusions in nearly all categories listed 
guilloty lodged a formal complaint about these negative evaluations by writing a letter to alvarez,morales,and secretary pierluisi in this letter,along with challenging the evaluations directly,guilloty claimed that the negative evaluations were an attempt by sanchez to retaliate against him for speaking out about irregularities in the ponce district office.after some discussion between morales and secretary pierluisi office,morales held a meeting attended by guilloty,sanchez,alvarez,and a department attorney in september.guilloty was presented with the memos sanchez had written between september and may detailing guilloty errors on the job.guilloty insisted that his conduct was appropriate at all times,and sanchez and alvarez insisted that the negative evaluations and memoranda correctly described guilloty inappropriate conduct.guilloty mentioned again to morales the questionable activities in the ponce office,and he told morales that the negative evaluations sanchez gave him were in retaliation for his speaking to alvarez and morales about the irregularities in the ponce office.after the parties failed to arrive at a compromise solution,guilloty agreed to accept a transfer he had previously requested to a district office closer to his home.he was transferred the next month.
d.the district court decision 
at the close of the plaintiff case in chief,all four defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule.the court granted the motion of defendant secretary pierluisi,concluding that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff fail ed to show reckless disregard,callous disregard,for guilloty first amendment rights.the court denied the motion as to morales,alvarez and sanchez.after the close of the defendants cases,the three remaining defendants renewed their rule motions and also argued for qualified immunity.
the court granted judgment for all three defendants and subsequently filed an order explaining its decision.finding that guilloty complaints of corruption and questionable police tactics were generally unsupported and overly disruptive to the operation of the sib,the court concluded that his first amendment rights did not outweigh the rights of the department in efficient agency performance.see pickering bd.of,d.the court also found that guilloty could not show that his speaking out was a substantial factor motivating the negative evaluations he received,given that most of them were written before he began to complain about the department.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.even if guilloty had shown the requisite connection between the evaluations and his speaking out,the court concluded that the defendants met the burden of showing that they would have taken the same adverse actions against guilloty even if he had never spoken out on the alleged improprieties within the sib.sanchez,hl,slip op.at may.on the question of qualified immunity,the court concluded that the defendants were immune from suit because there was no clearly established law indicating that the department treatment of guilloty complaints was unconstitutional.

first amendment rights of government employees 
a government employee does not lose his first amendment right to comment on matters of public concern by virtue of his employment with the government.connick myers,d.when analyzing an employee claim that his governmental employer retaliated against him for speaking out,the court task is to seek a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.pickering,at.like the district court,we consider this complicated relationship between free speech and public employment through the prism of a test extracted from the supreme court decisions in connick,at,pickering,at,and healthy,at.see mullin town of fairhaven,cir setting forth test.
our first task,laid out by the supreme court in its opinion in connick,is to determine whether the speech at issue involves matters of public concern.id.at quoting connick,at.if an employee speaks out only on a matter of personal interest,the first amendment value of his words is low,and absent the most unusual circumstances,a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee behavior.connick,at.if the court concludes that the employee did speak out on a matter of public concern,the second step requires the court to balance the strength of plaintiffs and the public first amendment interests against the strength of the countervailing governmental interest in promoting efficient performance of the public service the government agency or entity must provide through its employees.mullin,at internal quotation marks omitted.this evaluation of the employee rights and the employer interests is referred to as the pickering balancing test.see,citing pickering,at.these first two parts of the connick matters of public concern and pickering balancing determinations depend on whether the employee statements are of a character which the principles of the first amendment protect,and,therefore,are questions of law subject to de novo review.steeves,cir quoting connick,at.
if the court determines that the pickering balance favors the employee first amendment rights over the efficiency interests of the government agency,the employee must next show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.mullin,at citing healthy,at.if the employee makes an adequate showing on this point,the defendants must counter by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the governmental agency would have taken the same action against the employee even in the absence of the protected conduct.healthy,at.if the employer can not adduce evidence of an alternative justification for the employment action,or if that evidence,once adduced,does not suffice to prove the point,the employee has established a constitutional violation.
application to guilloty case 
guilloty constitutional claim is based on the statements he made to sanchez,alvarez,and morales regarding three incidents at the ponce district office the allegedly mishandled drug investigation the improper gifts allegedly received by ponce district agents from a stable owner and a fellow agent false claims in a sworn statement.guilloty argues that his complaints to officials within his chain of command constituted activity protected under the first amendment,and that the named defendants violated his constitutional rights by giving him poor marks on his evaluations and withholding a determination on his status as a permanent agent for three years 
the connick public concern test 
turning to the connick inquiry,we conclude that the subjects of guilloty statements to his superior officers involved matters of public concern.whether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.connick,at.guilloty statements described his suspicion that the sib was mishandling a potentially important investigation and the possibilities of police corruption and perjury.the diligence and lawfulness of a police department activities are matters of great interest to the public.see branton city of dallas,cir exposure of official misconduct,especially within the police department,is generally of great consequence to the public.guilloty frustrations with the conduct of his fellow agents and his supervisor sanchez went beyond mere concerns over the internal working conditions of the department.see connick,at.concluding that plaintiff questionnaire regarding office transfer policy,morale and confidence in supervisors did not implicate matters of public concern tang rhode island,cir none of these matters constitutes an issue of public concern they are all individual personal complaints about working conditions.nor is there any indication that guilloty revealed his suspicions to alvarez and morales to benefit himself personally or professionally.see mullin,at recognizing that motive is relevant to the analysis of whether an issue raised by a government employee is of public concern.finding that guilloty statements addressed issues of public concern,we must move on to balance guilloty interest in making those statements against the department interests.
the pickering balancing test 
under pickering,we are required to balance the value of an employee the employee own interests and the public interest in the information the employee seeks to the employer legitimate government interest in preventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies in carrying out its public service mission,at citing pickering,at.as the supreme court explained in rankin mcpherson 
this balancing is necessary in order to accommodate the dual role of the public employer as a provider of public services and as a government entity operating under the constraints of the first amendment.on the one hand,public employers are employers,concerned with the efficient function of their operations on the other hand,the threat of dismissal from public employment is a potent means of inhibiting speech.pickering,at.vigilance is necessary to ensure that public employers do not use authority over employees to silence discourse,not because it hampers public functions but simply because superiors disagree with the content of employees speech.
in evaluating this balance,the content of the employee speech is once again relevant.the connick the subject of the employee speech was of public a gatekeeping function in these cases by permitting a court to award judgment to the defendant once it determines that the speech was not of public concern.but the principles of connick are also relevant to the pickering inquiry the greater the value of the subject of the speech to the public,the more the balance tilts towards permitting the employee to express himself.as we found in the previous section,guilloty reports to sanchez,alvarez and morales regarding misconduct and possible corruption within the sib contained information of great interest to the public.when balancing the rights of the employee against those of the employer,an employee first amendment interest is entitled to greater weight where he is acting as a whistleblower in exposing government corruption.conaway smith,cir see,at disclosures concerned alleged abuse of public office on the part of an elected official,a matter traditionally occupying the highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values.see also moore city of wynnewood,cir for example,moore did not disclose any wrongdoing or inefficiency or other malfeasance on the part of the government,which we have previously recognized as particularly important matters of public concern.quoting koch city of hutchinson,cir en banc alteration in original.the substantial public interest in guilloty observations as an agent with the sib heavily weight s the pickering scale in favor of first amendment protection against retaliation for guilloty speech,at.
on the other side of the balance is the department of justice legitimate interest in maintaining the effective functioning of the sib.the supreme court recognized in rankin a number of considerations pertinent to this analysis 
w hether the statement impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among,has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary,or impedes the performance of the speaker duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise.
at.see also mcdonough trs.of the of,cir outlining similar factors.the importance of discipline,maintenance of harmony among,and close working relationships requiring personal loyalty and confidence is greater in the context of a law enforcement agency like the sib than it might be in another type of government agency.see conaway,at comparing a police department to a building inspection agency see also oladeinde city of birmingham,cir recognizing the heightened need for order,loyalty,morale and harmony in a police department moore,at same.therefore,courts must be sensitive to the needs of law enforcement agencies in disciplining an employee whose expressive conduct interferes with these interests.
certainly,in theory,guilloty charges that his fellow agents were accepting inappropriate gifts could have caused conflict within the sib.there was also the potential for conflict in his complaints that his supervisor,sanchez,mishandled an investigation,and that a fellow agent submitted a false sworn statement to support the seizure of a car.nevertheless,the defendants failed to show that there were any such disruptions.guilloty did not go public with his complaints about the ponce district office until november,at least one month after he had been transferred out of the office.until that time,guilloty primarily aired his concerns only to his superior,alvarez,and morales there is no evidence that any internal investigations of his allegations occurred until after they were published in the newspaper.therefore,the possibility of internal conflict among agents who knew they were under investigation and still had to work alongside guilloty,the whistleblower,never materialized.
the district court stated in its written decision that the balancing at the second prong of the pickering test supported a finding that guilloty conduct had a detrimental impact on the working relationships of the ponce sib office.the evidence shows that a number of guilloty fellow agents did not have faith in him,slip op.at.after a thorough review of the record,we disagree with the district court finding of a link between any lack of faith in guilloty among his and guilloty complaints.the documentary evidence and testimony indicated that ponce district office agents were hesitant to work with guilloty because he made inappropriate comments to confidential informants and,in one instance,may have ruined an investigation because he used the wrong type of surveillance equipment.sanchez summarized these reasons that ponce district agents were unwilling to work with his september and march memos to alvarez.there is no evidence in the record that fellow agents had lost faith in guilloty or were unwilling to work with him because he had lodged complaints with sanchez,alvarez or morales 
in this manner,this case is similar to the situation presented in steeves,at.there,we concluded that the pickering balance weighed in favor of the employee because the defendant town had failed to demonstrate a legitimate interest in curtailing disclosures.although the town has shown considerable disruption in the department operations,and serious deterioration in the working relations between and steeves,it has not yet met its burden of showing that the disruption was attributable to the exercise of first amendment right to speak out on this subject.id.at emphasis added.and steeves had a dispute regarding authority over a town department that preceded public reporting of steeves questionable activities.id.at.similarly,in guilloty case,his fellow agents complaints about him preceded his engaging in protected activity.complaints concerning guilloty conduct as an agent are certainly relevant to this case because they provide an alternative reason justifying his negative evaluations nevertheless,complaints about his conduct that are not attributable to his protected activity have little relevance to the pickering balance.
in concluding that the pickering balance weighed in favor of the defendants,the district court also decided that two of the three incidents guilloty complained botched drug investigation and the gifts from the stable lacking in substance.guilloty perez,slip op.at.but as we have previously held,the mere fact that the statements made by the plaintiff were erroneous does not remove them from the constitution protection erroneous remarks are an inevitable of unrestrained public debate.brasslett cota,cir.unless guilloty knowingly or recklessly made false statements,the subsequent determination that his allegations were untrue will not deprive them of their constitutional protection.id.there is no such evidence in this case.
consequently,because the defendants have not shown that complaints about guilloty conduct as an agent are attributable to his protected activity,they have failed to show a countervailing governmental interest in quelling guilloty speech sufficient to overcome the strong first amendment interest in his whistleblowing speech thus,the pickering balance weighs in favor of guilloty.
the healthy substantial or motivating factor test 
even if the government employee adduces sufficient evidence to convince a court that his speech merits first amendment protection,he still must introduce sufficient evidence to permit a finding that his participation in this protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor behind the adverse employment action.healthy,at.in order to satisfy his burden of proof,the employee need not produce direct evidence of his employer motivation.see,brasslett,at t he letter of dismissal written by the defendant states unequivocally that brasslett comments to the press were the primary reason for his discharge.a s in other contexts where motivation is an issue,he can rely upon circumstantial evidence.lewis city of boston,cir.the healthy causation test is a test.if the plaintiff succeeds in establishing this causal relationship the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendants to prove by a preponderance of the evidence,that the adverse employment action would have been taken even in the absence of the protected conduct,healthy,at.
this question of motivation,though usually one for the factfinder,can be resolved by the court on a summary judgment or rule motion if the plaintiff evidentiary showing is insufficient.see,cir resolving the healthy question at the summary judgment stage lewis,at same.this determination is.wytrwal saco sch,cir.although we are to examine the evidence and all fair inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,katz,at,the plaintiff who must prove that the protected conduct was a motivating factor in the adverse employment action must produce some facts linking that action to his conduct.see rakovich wade,cir i n the directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict contexts,evidence of some disagreement or dislike must be accompanied by evidence linking it to the injury.more than mere speculation must serve as the basis for finding that such disagreement is the motivating cause.therefore,we will uphold a grant of judgment as a matter of law to a defendant only if the record evidence compelled the conclusion that the plaintiff would have suffered the adverse employment action in any event for nondiscriminatory reasons,or the plaintiff did not introduce sufficient evidence in the first instance to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendants,at emphasis added.
guilloty argues that sanchez,alvarez,morales,and pierluisi retaliated against him by returning negative evaluations and keeping him on probationary status three years longer than he should have been the district court held that guilloty protected activities could not have motivated the negative evaluations because the evidence showed that he began to receive these negative evaluations before he spoke out.guilloty perez,slip op.at.our review of the record indicates that this is not the case.guilloty received five evaluations while assigned to the ponce district office.his first evaluation,given to him in october and covering the period from april to june,is somewhat negative.it reports that guilloty did not meet expectations in two categories and excelled only in one category he met expectations in the other seven categories but his next evaluation is substantially better.given to guilloty in december and covering the period from july to october,this evaluation reports that guilloty excelled in eight categories of review and met the expectations in the other two categories.he was not below expectations in any categories.his next evaluation,given to him on march,is similarly positive.
guilloty did not receive another evaluation until january,months after he had met with alvarez and morales to complain about sanchez and the ponce district office.the two evaluations he received in january were clearly negative.in one evaluation,he received a positive remark in only one appearance.he received unsatisfactory remarks in all other categories of evaluation the second evaluation he received that month,supposedly the final evaluation of this probationary period,revealed unsatisfactory marks in three categories of evaluation.hence,on this record,as a matter of sequence,the evaluations guilloty received after he met with directors alvarez and morales to complain about sanchez and other officers were markedly lower than the evaluations he received before those meetings.the proximity in time between the protected activity and the alleged retaliation is circumstantial evidence of motive.ulrich city and county of san francisco,cir pike osborne,cir.
the defendants testified that the ratings in guilloty january evaluations were supported by a series of memoranda sanchez had written to alvarez chronicling guilloty problems in ponce.as discussed above,sanchez first memorialized in a memo to alvarez written in september a series of problems ponce district agents had with guilloty.between march and may,sanchez wrote an additional four memos not shown to guilloty until over a year later chronicling guilloty allegedly inappropriate behavior on the job,including guilloty unauthorized use of an official automobile,his use of a flash camera during a nighttime surveillance,and his sleeping in the backseat of a police car while another agent drove to and from a surveillance.but even though sanchez had been complaining about guilloty conduct since september,guilloty received positive evaluations from sanchez in both december and march he did not receive a negative evaluation until january,after he spoke with alvarez and morales.while the irregular and inappropriate incidents described in sanchez memos may have justified guilloty negative evaluations in january,so too would those incidents have justified negative evaluations in december and march.sanchez,though,refrained from giving guilloty negative evaluations until after guilloty spoke out against him and other agents in ponce.considering the proximity of sanchez change of attitude to guilloty complaints,we must find that guilloty introduced sufficient evidence of motivation to shift the burden of persuasion under healthy to the defendants.
in order to defeat guilloty claim,the defendants had to articulate a ground for his negative evaluations and the extension of his probationary period,and prove by a preponderanc
