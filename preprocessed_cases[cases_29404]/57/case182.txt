dena winslow appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the northern maine development commission,nmdc on her claim that nmdc failure to hire her when it became the fiscal agent for the workforce investment act grant constituted whistleblower retaliation under the maine whistleblowers protection act mwpa.tit,et.we agree with the district court that,on the undisputed facts,winslow is not a whistleblower under the mwpa and so affirm.
because this case comes before us on appeal from summary judgment,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to winslow.see valley forge ins.field,cir.
background 
this case stems from a report done by a federal agency reviewing a local area federal grant in maine for compliance with program requirements.under the workforce investment act of wia,et,maine has obtained federal funding to strengthen local workforces and career opportunities.as a condition of eligibility,maine was required to establish a state workforce investment board.the governor then designated local workforce investment areas in which wia activities are administered.a a.
aroostook county is in local area i,the largest workforce investment area in the state,and is under the authority of the local area i workforce investment board lwib.from until early,aroostook county was the grant for the lwib.in that capacity,the county acted as the fiscal agent for the grant and oversaw the administrative and financial operations of the relevant wia programs.
in march of,winslow was hired as the executive director of the lwib.consistent with the job description in place at the time,winslow reported to and was supervised by doug beaulieu,the aroostook county administrator.she received her salary and benefits from aroostook county,and the county used wia funds for this purpose.but apparently there was no explicit fiscal agent agreement between the lwib and the county and this raised concerns.winslow claims to have been a whistleblower as to those concerns.
federal monitoring visit 
in november,federal monitors from the department of labor undertook a compliance review of the wia grants in maine,including of the lwib.the monitors found that winslow job description was not in compliance with federal program because,absent an express agreement between the lwib and aroostook county,it was improper for winslow to report to the county rather than to the lwib.on november,the federal monitors conducted a preliminary exit interview at the office where beaulieu and winslow worked,which winslow attended.after the exit interview,federal monitor tim theberge went to beaulieu and told him of the monitors findings.beaulieu then spoke to winslow and instructed her to type up her notes from the exit interview meeting and email them to him.these exit interview notes included a section on findings,which stated,as item number five my job description indicates i am supervised by the county administrator,however,i work for the board,who supervise me.this is reflected in.the exit interview notes included a separate section on areas of concern.they also stated that the federal monitors would meet with the state during the week of january,and that the state would then draft a formal response,after which there would be a formal federal response.as to the local report,officials would be given until january to resolve these findings.
then,also at beaulieu direction,winslow sent the exit interview notes to barry mccrum,the lwib chairman,along with christopher gardner and norman fournier,the two local elected officials cleos of the lwib.the cleos and not the full lwib board are responsible for designating a wia fiscal agent.see d b i ii.those exit interview notes reporting on the federal monitors findings,circulated at beaulieu request,form the initial basis for winslow assertion that she is a whistleblower.defendant nmdc is a separate entity,not involved in the noncompliance findings regarding aroostook county.
at a december public aroostook county commissioners meeting,beaulieu informed the commissioners of the report from the federal monitoring visit.the minutes of the meeting reported that one of the findings of the compliance review is that the executive director should,under the law,report to the lwib board,not the county administrator.after the minutes were adopted at a later county commissioners meeting on december,they were posted online in full for public review.
during this period,beaulieu was in discussions with the two cleos and the chairman of the lwib about preparing an agreement making a different entity the new fiscal agent for the lwib.the proposal was that defendant nmdc be the fiscal agent.for this purpose,around december,beaulieu met with robert clark,the executive director of nmdc and also a member of the lwib board,to discuss the transition.in preparation for that meeting,clark completed a draft transition plan,which included as part of the process notification of staff termination december.on december,beaulieu forwarded to clark the draft of the letter that he had previously sent to the cleos for them to send to the maine department of labor.in that email to clark,beaulieu stated note how i dealt with the staffing issue.it leaves it up to you.the two cleos of the lwib did not object to the staff termination proposal.
on the broader topic of the transition to a new fiscal agent,beaulieu was also in communication with the cleos,including in a series of december emails.beaulieu indicated that federal law required there be an agreement between the lwib and nmdc,enclosed a draft,and stressed this agreement is mandated it is not optional.i just want to make sure we are in compliance,so we do jeopardize losing our local program.emphasis added.winslow played no role in these discussions.
in these december emails,beaulieu and the cleos agreed that the lwib board needed to be kept informed of the proposed fiscal agent agreement.beaulieu suggested that a notice to the full board by the cleos and the board chair would be the most appropriate route.on the topic of how to communicate the information to the full lwib board,beaulieu explained the position he was in 
it is generally not my function or prerogative to communicate directly with the board.that is a function of the board director winslow.as a practical matter,one of the findings of the feds,which said that the board director should not report to the county administrator,has made my ability to supervise the concerned individual difficult,if not impossible,to manage.so,as it relates to the board director,i can happily suggest actions,but i am unable to ensure compliance with the same.
while beaulieu was dealing with the lwib board leadership to effectuate a solution to the federal findings,winslow took steps on her own.on december,winslow visited clark office unannounced to drop off a cd of wia financial policies.while there,winslow held out her hands,looked up at the ceiling,and said so,where are you going to put me clark responded that they were looking at doing something different.
following this encounter,winslow believed that it was her responsibility as executive director to inform all lwib members of her view of the events.to that end,without obtaining permission from beaulieu,the lwib chairman,or the two cleos,on december,she sent all of the lwib members and interested parties including beaulieu an email she authored entitled opportunity.while it acknowledged that it was the cleos who had authority as to designating the fiscal agent,it nonetheless informed the other board members about their responsibilities as to the fiscal agent.the email also mentioned the proposal that the nmdc become the fiscal agent.it then outlined the large amount of work ahead,assuming that she would be the person working with the board.
the opportunity email then addressed her proposal that the lwib newly schedule an interim meeting,stating 
if you are interested in holding an interim board meeting prior to our next regularly scheduled meeting on february,please reply to all on this memo to request it.according to our board,if five board members request an interim meeting one will be scheduled.
this opportunity email provoked responses.
after receiving winslow email,beaulieu emailed chris gardner,a cleo,and said this is insubordination.lwib chair barry mccrum is upset.it was the chair responsibility to schedule meetings,and the next meeting had already been scheduled.and in a later email exchange with mccrum,clark wrote about the opportunity email if i was her boss she would be fired immediately for insubordination.
beaulieu scheduled a meeting with winslow on january to reprimand her for sending the opportunity email.at about nine that morning,in advance of the meeting,beaulieu emailed mccrum,the lwib chairman,and the lwib cleos the reprimand memo that he planned to give winslow at the meeting.he did not send it to clark.that memo objected to the opportunity email in that it essentially solicited interest in an interim board meeting without the knowledge or approval of our board chair,barry mccrum.it termed the email unprofessional,inappropriate and in direct contradiction to proper protocol and stated that winslow had created an embarrassing situation for the board,the county of aroostook and the business sector in both counties,in particular.
at that same morning,after he met with winslow,beaulieu emailed mccrum and the cleos,stating that he had a long,productive meeting with winslow,and that he had decided to rescind his earlier memo to her.winslow was copied on this email.
the next day,on january,winslow sent to beaulieu,mccrum,and the cleos,and addressed to the aroostook county commissioners a response that outlined her objections to beaulieu memo,now rescinded.in relevant part,winslow memo read 
the memo you were copied on yesterday from doug is an outrageous attempt to slander me.there is nothing embarrassing to the county of aroostook,nor to any of you,because i performed my job duties and responded to requests for information from board members.the information i provided as requested,was what federal law says,and what the board of director say.there is nothing there that should have been an embarrassment,and certainly nothing that is a secret.
mccrum forwarded winslow letter to clark later that day.
on january,chairman mccrum forwarded beaulieu original reprimand email to clark,to give clark some context for winslow january memo.in reference to beaulieu memo,clark responded well,that all true mccrum then responded hard to argue with the truth.
transition to nmdc 
on january,the two cleos of the lwib signed an agreement designating nmdc as the fiscal agent effective february the agreement included a subagreement that nmdc would s erve as staff to the local area workforce investment board lwib and perform duties assigned by the cleos and the lwib.this was intended to remedy the compliance issues found by the federal monitors and the cleos informed the commissioner of the maine department of labor of the impending transition the next day,january.in signing this agreement for the lwib,the lwib cleos knew that nmdc would provide staffing for the lwib and had planned to advertise and seek applications for a new director of workforce development,whose job would encompass the functions of the lwib executive director.
on january,a day after the agreement between nmdc and the lwib was signed and two weeks after winslow had sent the opportunity email,the lwib held a board meeting,during which winslow served as secretary and,in her capacity as executive director,gave a presentation on the federal monitoring visit and passed out copies of the wia.at beaulieu request,at this meeting winslow provided all of the lwib board members with copies of the exit interview notes.some members had received them earlier.as to what winslow said during her presentation,clark interrupted her at several points to loudly voice disagreement with what she was saying,and called her disgusting during the meeting.clark stated that he had read the entire wia law and that winslow had not presented some of the relevant parts.
on january,winslow was formally informed that nmdc intended to advertise for a new executive director after it became the fiscal agent for the lwib.at least by this point,if not before,winslow knew that the new fiscal agent would not necessarily employ her.as said,she met with clark unannounced on december and received no assurance she would be rehired.she sent her opportunity email on december.
in january,nmdc posted a job listing for a position it termed director of workforce development in addition to several other responsibilities,this director would also serve as the executive director of the lwib.while the director of workforce development position had the responsibilities of the lwib executive director,the two positions were not identical.in addition to lwib executive director responsibilities,the director of workforce development would provide professional management and administrative services at the board level in directing fiscal planning,budgeting,contract development,and assessment of workforce investment act wia programs in local area.the listing stated that i nterested applicants should possess a masters degree in public administration,or related field,or a combination of a bachelors degree and related experience in economic development,workforce development,and public administration.the application deadline was february.
on february,beaulieu,on behalf of aroostook,informed winslow via email that 
because the county of aroostook will no longer be involved with the administration of this program,at the february,county commissioners meeting,the aroostook board of county commissioners approved the termination of your employment as executive director of workforce investment act program for local area effective february.
nmdc assumption of responsibilities as the fiscal agent was to become effective on february.winslow applied for nmdc director of workforce development position.she was interviewed,although she did not have a master degree in this field.
on february,clark and ruby bradbury of nmdc interviewed winslow and three other applicants for the new job patricia boucher the lwib executive director for five years before winslow tenure,arthur faucher,and ryan pelletier.interview notes indicate that have to was written next to faucher and winslow names,and interview but no was written next to boucher name.ultimately,nmdc hired pelletier,who was also an nmdc board member.nmdc stated reasons for hiring pelletier were that he had a master degree in public administration had eleven years of management experience in local government served in other positions on various state and local boards and committees had business contacts in the area and possessed an understanding of the wia mission.
winslow was notified by a letter dated february,that she did not get the job.she filed this mwpa action on may,originally suing both aroostook county and nmdc for violating the whistleblower law.the district court granted nmdc motion for summary judgment on february,winslow timely appealed she has apparently resolved her dispute with aroostook and only her whistleblower claims against nmdc remain.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.fontánez núñez janssen ortho llc,cir.we have carefully viewed the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment,indulging all reasonable inferences in that party favor.suarez pueblo int l,cir quoting griggs ryan smith,cir internal quotation mark omitted.
maine whistleblowers protection act 
as we understand it,winslow state whistleblower claim against nmdc is that,but for her whistleblowing about the violation of federal law inherent in aroostook county being her employer absent a separate fiscal agent agreement,nmdc a separate entity would have hired her in its position of director of workforce development.
the mwpa states,in relevant part 
no employer may discharge,threaten,or otherwise discriminate against an employee regarding the employee compensation,terms,conditions,location or privileges of employment because t he employee,acting in good faith,reports orally or in writing to the employer or a public body what the employee has reasonable cause to believe is a violation of a law or rule adopted under the laws of the united states.
tit,a.the supreme judicial court of maine has held that this subsection,when read alongside the rest of section,unambiguously limit s the protection afforded by the m wpa to employees who report to an about a violation committed or practiced by that employer.costain sunbury primary care,me 
the mwpa embodies maine larger statutory public policy against discharge in retaliation for reporting illegal acts,a right to the discharged employee,and a remedial scheme to vindicate that right.fuhrmann staples office superstore,me quoting bard bath iron works,me internal quotation mark omitted.
to prevail on a claim of whistleblower discrimination under the mwpa,a plaintiff must show that she engaged in activity protected by the m wpa,she experienced an adverse employment action,and a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action.fuhrmann,at.part of the plaintiff burden of demonstrating that her activity was protected is to show that the plaintiff and defendant have a relationship that falls within the ambit of the mwpa.
the parties have not focused on whether nmdc,as opposed to aroostook county,was ever winslow employer,or whether her complaints were about violations which were committed or practiced by nmdc.at oral argument,winslow contended that nmdc had an obligation to hire her when it took over as the fiscal agent.there is no evidence in the record to support her contention that nmdc had any such obligation.and given the department of labor ultimate approval of the nmdc agreement,including the job description for the director of workforce development,there can be no claim that nmdc violated federal law in its decision to hire a new person for the new position.
by its terms,the mwpa only prohibits certain actions taken by an employer.tit,see costain,at requiring that in order to be protected by the mwpa,a whistleblower report must be made to an employer about a violation that was committed by that employer.the assumption of fiscal agent responsibilities by nmdc required a new contract between the lwib and nmdc which became effective on february,after winslow was terminated by aroostook county.we express doubt that nmdc ever was winslow employer within the meaning of the mwpa.
in the absence of any articulation by winslow,we assume,as the district court did,that winslow claim against nmdc is instead based on a failure to hire an applicant theory.that claim would arise under a of the maine human rights act mhra,which prohibits employers from fail ing to hire an applicant for employment because of previous actions taken by the applicant that are protected under the mwpa.tit,a.
we affirm the district court finding winslow did not engage in whistleblower conduct and so has no claim against nmdc under either section.
we start with the assumption,in winslow favor,that the federal monitor conclusion that aroostook could not be winslow employer unless it had a separate fiscal agent agreement was a violation of a law or rule within the meaning of the mwpa,committed by her employer aroostook county.nonetheless,the combination of several factors from the undisputed facts require the conclusion that she was not a whistleblower under maine law.
it was the federal monitors who uncovered the violation of the regulations,and not winslow.they also eventually published a formal report of their findings.it was the monitors who initially reported the findings to beaulieu winslow did not do so.the federal monitors met promptly with beaulieu to notify him directly of the violation and the need for corrective action,and it was beaulieu who took action to correct the problem.even assuming an mwpa plaintiff need not be the one to find the original violation or even the first to report it to the employer in other circumstances that does not help winslow.winslow was not even the one who published the results of the monitoring visit.
further,it was beaulieu who directed winslow to distribute the interview notes to lwib chairman mccrum and to gardner and fournier,the cleos of the lwib.only days later,on december,the aroostook county commissioners discussed the problem in a public session,at beaulieu insistence.plainly,there was no suppression by beaulieu or aroostook of the existence of a violation.
from the undisputed facts it is clear beaulieu and aroostook county were not trying to bury the problem of the violation reported to beaulieu by the federal monitors but to acknowledge it and deal with it.the same is true of the chairman of the lwib and the two lwib cleos,who had the authority to choose the next fiscal agent and who were involved in both structuring the agreement with nmdc and obtaining approval of the new organizational structure.
winslow makes the claim,plainly refuted by the record,that the lwib would not have known of the violation but for her reporting it to them.it was beaulieu who reported the information to the leadership of the lwib,particularly those who held the responsibility to pick a new fiscal agent,and it was beaulieu who urged a report to the full board although some other members,like clark,obviously were already aware.
to the extent winslow communicated information,she did so as part of her job responsibilities,either under direct instructions from beaulieu,or as to the opportunity email because she thought it was among her responsibilities to do so.
though there may be exceptions,the usual rule in maine is that a plaintiff reports are not whistleblowing if it is part of his or her job responsibilities to make such reports,particularly when instructed to do so by a superior.see,capalbo truck leasing,d,granting summary judgment in favor of defendant where plaintiff mwpa claim was based on reports he made at the direction of his employer.that is also true elsewhere.see,kidwell sybaritic,stating that when a company counsel advises the company on compliance issues,the lawyer is not sending a report for the purpose of exposing an illegality and the lawyer is not blowing the whistle willis dep t of,in reporting some of the farms that plaintiff monitored as being out of compliance,plaintiff did no more than carry out his required everyday job responsibilities and that can not itself constitute a protected disclosure under the federal wpa.similarly,in the fair labor standards act context,we have held that an employee who reports violations of laws or other requirements as part of his job is not engaging in protected activity for the purposes of an provision.claudio gotay becton dickinson caribe,cir.we see no reason to depart from that rationale here.
from the time the violation was uncovered by the federal monitors until the final management and services agreement was signed with nmdc,winslow superiors at both the lwib and aroostook county were engaged in an effort to bring about compliance with the wia.in spite of winslow protestations to the contrary,the facts are clear she was only one of several people who transmitted results of the federal monitoring visit,and she did so largely at beaulieu direction.winslow did not actually blow the proverbial whistle,tripp cole,no.civ.ps,wl,at,on any violations of law.
we affirm entry of summary judgment.costs are awarded to nmdc.
following the visit,the department of labor ultimately issued a report to the maine department of labor outlining its findings.the report was issued on april,slightly over a month before winslow initiated this suit.
apparently the exit interview notes reference to is a reference to section d b ii of the workforce investment act of.that section reads the functions of the local board shall include the following ii staff.the local board may employ staff.workforce investment act of,stat,codified at.
after working with both the federal monitors and maine department of labor officials to ensure that the new organizational structure was in compliance with the wia,nmdc entered into a final management and services agreement with the cleos on april.
in the district court,winslow also brought a claim that nmdc refused to employ her because of her physical disabiliti
