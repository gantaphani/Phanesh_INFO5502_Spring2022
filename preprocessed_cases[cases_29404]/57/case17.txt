held the sixth circuit decision rested on principles that are incompatible with ordinary principles of contract law.

c in,the sixth circuit found a provision governing retiree insurance benefits ambiguous as to the duration of those benefits and,looking to other provisions of the agreement,purported to apply ordinary contract law to resolve the ambiguity.first,the court inferred from the existence of termination provisions for other benefits that the absence of a termination provision specifically addressing retiree benefits expressed an intent to vest those benefits for life.the court then purported to apply the rule that contracts should be interpreted to avoid illusory promises,reasoning that,absent vesting,the promise would be illusory for the subset of retirees who would not become eligible for those benefits before the contract expired.finally,the court relied on the context of labor negotiations to resolve the ambiguity,inferring that the parties would have intended such benefits to vest for life because they are not mandatory subjects of collective bargaining are typically understood as a form of delayed compensation,at and are keyed to the acquisition of retirement status.the court concluded that these contextual clues outweigh ed any contrary implications derived from a routine duration clause.at.the sixth circuit has since extended its analysis in a series of other cases.
d the inferences applied in and its progeny do not represent ordinary principles of contract law.distorts the attempt to ascertain the intention of the parties by placing a thumb on the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits in all agreements.rather than relying on known customs and usages in a particular industry as proven by the parties,the court relied on its own suppositions about the intentions of parties negotiating retiree benefits.it then compounded the error by applying those suppositions indiscriminately across industries.furthermore,the sixth circuit refusal to apply general durational clauses to provisions governing retiree benefits distorts an agreement text and conflicts with the principle that a written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement of the parties.
perhaps tugged by its inferences,the sixth circuit also misapplied the illusory promises doctrine.it construed provisions that admittedly benefited some class of retirees as illusory merely because they did not benefit all retirees.that interpretation is a contradiction in terms a promise that is partly illusory is by definition not illusory.and its use of this doctrine is particularly inappropriate in the context of agreements,which often include provisions inapplicable to some category of employees.
the sixth circuit also failed even to consider other traditional contract principles,including the rule that courts should not construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises and the rule that contractual obligations will cease,in the ordinary course,upon termination of the bargaining agreement,litton financial printing,litton business systems,nlrb.
e though there is no doubt that and its progeny affected the outcome here,the sixth circuit should be the first to review the agreements under ordinary principles of contract law.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
this case arises out of a disagreement between a group of retired employees and their former employer about the meaning of certain expired agreements.the retirees and their former union claim that these agreements created a right to lifetime health care benefits for retirees,their surviving spouses,and their dependents.the employer,for its part,claims that those provisions terminated when the agreements expired.the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit sided with the retirees,relying on its conclusion in international union,united auto,aerospace,agricultural implement workers of am,that retiree health care benefits are unlikely to be left up to future negotiations.we granted certiorari and now conclude that such reasoning is incompatible with ordinary principles of contract law.we therefore vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for it to apply ordinary principles of contract law in the first instance.
respondents hobert freel tackett,woodrow pyles,and harlan conley worked at and retired from the point pleasant polyester plant in apple grove,west virginia hereinafter referred to as the plant.during their employment,respondent united steel,paper and forestry,rubber,manufacturing,energy,allied industrial and service workers international union,or its predecessor unions hereinafter referred to as the union,represented them in collective bargaining.tackett and pyles retired in,and conley retired in.they represent a class of retired employees from the plant,along with their surviving spouses and other dependents.petitioner polymers usa,llc,is the current owner of the plant.
when purchased the plant in,it entered a master agreement and a pension,insurance,and service award agreement p i agreement with the union,generally similar to agreements the union had negotiated with predecessor.the p i agreement provided for retiree health care benefits as follows 
employees who retire on or after january,and who are eligible for and receiving a monthly pension under the pension plan whose full years of attained age and full years of attained continuous service at the time of retirement equals or more points will receive a full company contribution towards the cost of health care benefits described in this exhibit.employees who have less than points at the time of retirement will receive a reduced company contribution.the company contribution will be reduced by for every point less than.employees will be required to pay the balance of the health care contribution,as estimated by the company annually in advance,for the health care benefits described in this exhibit.failure to pay the required medical contribution will result in cancellation of coverage.app.
exhibit,which described the health care benefits at issue,opened with the following durational clause effective january,and for the duration of this agreement thereafter,the employer will provide the following program of hospital benefits,benefits,surgical benefits and prescription drug benefits for eligible employees and their dependents at emphasis deleted.the p i agreement provided for renegotiation of its terms in three years 
in december,announced that it would begin requiring retirees to contribute to the cost of their health care benefits.respondent retirees,on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,sued and related entities,alleging that the decision to require these contributions breached both the agreement and the p i agreement,in violation of of the labor management relations act,lmra and a b of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat.specifically,the retirees alleged that had promised to provide lifetime health care benefits for them,their surviving spouses,and their dependents.they pointed to the language in the p i agreement providing that employees with a certain level of seniority will receive a full company contribution towards the cost of health care benefits described in exhibit.the retirees alleged that,with this promise,had created a vested right to such benefits that continued beyond the expiration of the p i agreement.
the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.supp,sd ohio.it concluded that the cited language unambiguously did not create a vested right to retiree benefits.
the court of appeals reversed based on the reasoning of its earlier decision in.tackett i.involved a similar claim that an employer had breached a agreement when it terminated retiree benefits,at.although the court found the text of the provision in that case ambiguous,it relied on the context of labor negotiations to resolve that ambiguity in favor of the retirees interpretation,at.specifically,the court inferred that parties to collective bargaining would intend retiree benefits to vest for life because such benefits are not mandatory or required to be included in agreements,are typically understood as a form of delayed compensation or reward for past services,and are keyed to the acquisition of retirement status.ibid.the court concluded that these inferences outweigh ed any contrary implications about the termination of retiree benefits derived from general termination clauses,at.
applying the inferences on review of the district court dismissal of the action,the court of appeals concluded that the retirees had stated a plausible claim.tackett i,at.keeping in mind the context of the negotiations identified in,the court found it unlikely that the union would agree to language that ensures its members a full company contribution,if the company could unilaterally change the level of contribution.ibid.the court construed the language about employees contributing to their health care premiums as limited to employees who had not attained the requisite seniority points to be entitled to a full company contribution.ibid.and it discerned an intent to vest lifetime health care benefits from provisions tying eligibility for health care benefits to eligibility for pension benefits,at.
on remand,the district court conducted a bench trial and ruled in favor of the retirees.it declined to revisit the question whether the p i agreement created a vested right to retiree benefits,concluding that the court of appeals had definitively resolved that issue.it then issued a permanent injunction ordering to reinstate health care benefits for the individual respondents and similarly situated retirees.supp.sd ohio.
the court of appeals affirmed,concluding that,although the district court had erred in treating tackett i as a conclusive resolution of the meaning of the p i agreement,it had not erred in presum ing that,in the absence of extrinsic evidence to the contrary,the agreements indicated an intent to vest lifetime benefits.tackett ii.and because the district court had concluded that the proffered extrinsic evidence was inapplicable,it had not clearly erred in finding that the agreement created those vested rights.
we granted certiorari,and now vacate and remand.
this case is about the interpretation of agreements that define rights to welfare benefits plans.the lmra grants federal courts jurisdiction to resolve disputes between employers and labor unions about agreements.when agreements create pension or welfare benefits plans,those plans are subject to rules established in erisa.erisa defines pension plans as plans,funds,or programs that provid e retirement income to employees or that resul t in a deferral of income.a.it defines welfare benefits plans as plans,funds,or programs established or maintained to provide participants with additional benefits,such as life insurance and disability coverage.
erisa treats these two types of plans differently.although erisa imposes elaborate minimum funding and vesting standards for pension plans,it explicitly exempts welfare benefits plans from those rules,a.welfare benefits plans must be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,a,but e mployers or other plan sponsors are generally free under erisa,for any reason at any time,to adopt,modify,or terminate welfare plans,schoonejongen.as we have previously recognized,e mployers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit.black decker dis ability plan nord.and,we have observed,the rule that contractual provisions ordinarily should be enforced as written is especially appropriate when enforcing an erisa welfare benefits plan.heimeshoff hartford life accident ins,slip,at.that is because the focus on the written terms of the plan is the linchpin of a system that is not so complex that administrative costs,or litigation expenses,unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefits plans in the first place.at slip,at internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.
we interpret agreements,including those establishing erisa plans,according to ordinary principles of contract law,at least when those principles are not inconsistent with federal labor policy.see textile workers lincoln mills of.in this endeavor,as with any other contract,the parties intentions control.animalfeeds int l,internal quotation marks omitted.where the words of a contract in writing are clear and unambiguous,its meaning is to be ascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent.lord,williston on contracts,ed.williston internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the court of appeals applied the inferences to conclude that,in the absence of extrinsic evidence to the contrary,the provisions of the contract indicated an intent to vest retirees with lifetime benefits.tackett ii,at.as we now explain,those inferences conflict with ordinary principles of contract law.
the court of appeals has long insisted that its inferences are drawn from ordinary contract law.in itself,the court purported to apply traditional rules for contractual interpretation.at.the court first concluded that the provision governing retiree insurance benefits which stated only that the employer will provide such benefits was ambiguous as to the duration of those benefits,at.to resolve that ambiguity,it looked to other provisions of the agreement.the agreement included provisions for terminating active employees insurance benefits in the case of layoffs and for terminating benefits for a retiree spouse and dependents in case of the retiree death before the expiration of the agreement,but no provision specifically addr
