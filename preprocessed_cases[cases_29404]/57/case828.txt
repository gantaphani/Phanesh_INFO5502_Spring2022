this case raises an issue of importance in the law of this circuit on social security appeals.the issue is this after an administrative law judge alj has erred,when is it appropriate for a court to remand for further proceedings and when is it appropriate to order payment of social security benefits the commissioner of the social security appeals from a district court order requiring the commissioner to pay clayton seavey disability benefits,rather than conduct further proceedings,after the district court found that the social security alj had erred at step of the disability determination process.seavey apfel,wl.the commissioner concedes that the alj decision was in error,but argues that the proper remedy was for the district court to remand the case to the commissioner for further administrative proceedings.the district court disposed of the case based upon a rule it had established in a prior case,field chater,which adopted what appears to be either a per se or a preferential rule that when a court is faced with an error at step,the appropriate remedy is an order that the applicant be paid the benefits sought.the issue raised here is also raised in another case we decide today,freeman barnhart,cir.we use this case to express the general principles for decision.
we affirm the district court order of remand,but reverse the order for payment of benefits,and rule that,in this instance,remand to the commissioner with instructions for further proceedings is the appropriate remedy.
the social security administration is the federal agency charged with administering both the social security disability benefits program,which provides disability insurance for covered workers,and the supplemental security income program,which provides assistance for the indigent aged and disabled.in july,clayton seavey applied for benefits under both of these programs,claiming that pain relating to a back injury and heart problems rendered him unable to work.after his application was initially denied by the commissioner and the commissioner denied reconsideration,seavey received a hearing before an alj on august.
when considering applications,the commissioner employs a five step process to determine if an individual is disabled within the meaning of the social security act.all five steps are not applied to every applicant,as the determination may be concluded at any step along the process.id.the steps are if the applicant is engaged in substantial gainful work activity,the application is denied if the applicant does not have,or has not had within the relevant time period,a severe impairment or combination of impairments,the application is denied if the impairment meets the conditions for one of the listed impairments in the social security regulations,then the application is granted if the applicant residual functional capacity is such that he or she can still perform past relevant work,then the application is denied if the applicant,given his or her residual functional capacity,education,work experience,and age,is unable to do any other work,the application is granted.id.
once the applicant has met his or her burden at step to show that he or she is unable to do past work due to the significant limitation,the commissioner then has the burden at step of coming forward with evidence of specific jobs in the national economy that the applicant can still perform.arocho sec y of health human,cir.if the applicant limitations are exclusively exertional,then the commissioner can meet her burden through the use of a chart contained in the social security regulations.guidelines,pt,subpt.p,app,tables,cited in heckler campbell,d.the grid,as it is known,consists of a matrix of the applicant exertional capacity,age,education,and work experience.if the facts of the applicant situation fit within the grid categories,the grid directs a conclusion as to whether the individual is or is not disabled.pt,subpt.p,app,a,cited in.however,if the applicant has nonexertional limitations such as mental,sensory,or skin impairments,or environmental restrictions such as an inability to tolerate dust,id.e that restrict his ability to perform jobs he would otherwise be capable of performing,then the grid is only a framework to guide the decision,a d.see also pratts chater,cir discussing use of grid when applicant has nonexertional limitations.
seavey was when he applied for benefits.his work history is that of an unskilled laborer his education ended at seventh grade.at the alj hearing,seavey presented medical evidence concerning his back pain and the degree of limitation it imposes on him.he also presented evidence in the form of an expert report from a psychologist,greene.greene report stated that seavey appears to be a textbook example of an individual with personality disorder who may also meet the diagnostic criteria for avoidant personality disorder,and that he tested at the borderline verbal iq range.following the hearing,seavey attorney submitted a letter from greene along with psychological testing results,to clarify greene earlier findings,particularly her notation that seavey had an elevated score on the work interference scale,indicating behavioral attributes that would negatively affect his ability to work.greene letter stated that seavey may meet the diagnostic criteria for a reading disorder and that he would have great difficulty performing any jobs that require much reading.however,the letter also stated that seavey low iq and reading ability,combined with his desire to get the testing over with quickly,meant that the work interference score might not be valid.greene also noted that she had not observed any problems with seavey concentration,persistence,or pace during her interactions with him,and that she did not believe he would decompensate on the job.in addition,records from one of seavey treating physicians indicate that he did not appear to have any problems in understanding,concentration,or persistence.
the alj found that seavey is limited to light work by his back ailment.the alj decision did not mention greene report and letter or any psychological evidence but simply found that seavey has no significant limitations.the alj then used the grid to find him to be not disabled.seavey appealed to the social security appeals council,arguing that his mental and cognitive impairments were significant nonexertional limitations and therefore the grid was not dispositive of his claim.almost two years later,the appeals council denied his appeal.
seavey then sought review in federal district court.the district judge assigned the case to a magistrate judge,who prepared a report and recommendation.as to the supplemental security income claim,the magistrate judge found that the alj had erred by applying the grid to seavey after stating in the hearing that the psychological profile did not indicate anything of a disabling nature.seavey apfel,wl,at.the correct question,the magistrate judge report said,is not whether the nonexertional limitations are themselves disabling,but whether the nonexertional limitations significantly limit the applicant ability to perform work at a given exertional level in seavey case,light work.id.if so,then the grid is not dispositive.id.the magistrate judge report stated that the commissioner bears the burden of proof at step,and that when nonexertional limitations have more than a marginal effect,the commissioner must present testimony from a vocational expert.id.at.finally,the magistrate judge report recommended that the district judge order the commissioner to pay supplemental security income benefits to seavey id.although the magistrate judge review of the alj decision was to determine whether substantial evidence supported the findings of the alj,ward commissioner of social security,cir,the district court review of the magistrate judge decision is de novo as to objections raised.b c.
the district judge agreed with the magistrate judge report and,in a one paragraph order,vacated the alj decision and ordered the commissioner to pay benefits to seavey.
the commissioner argues that,although the alj erred in not discussing the evidence of psychological impairment,the evidence,including greene report,did not necessarily establish the existence of a significant nonexertional limitation.therefore,the commissioner says,the alj opinion could have been affirmed in its current state on the assumption that the alj had implicitly discredited greene letter and report.this argument is not persuasive because,although a nonexertional impairment can have a negligible effect,ordinarily the alj must back such a finding of negligible effect with the evidence to substantiate it,talbot heckler,cir,unless the matter is.
alternatively,the commissioner argues that the proper remedy would be a remand for further administrative proceedings.she argues that a remand with an order to pay benefits is only appropriate where the evidence shows a virtually certain entitlement to benefits.
the commissioner further maintains that this magistrate judge has a policy of remanding with an order to pay benefits,rather than remanding for further administrative proceedings,whenever it finds an error at step in the process counsel for seavey disputed that point at oral argument.the magistrate judge,in his report and recommendation for this case,relied upon his reasoning in a previous case,field chater,cited in seavey,wl,at.in field,the magistrate judge wrote that w hen the commissioner had a full and fair opportunity to develop the record and meet her burden at step,there is no reason for the court to remand for further factfinding.field.at.the opinion in field distinguished that case from a decision of this court,rose shalala,cir,in which we remanded for further proceedings because the alj error in applying the grid at step meant that the vocational expert had not been asked the proper questions about a nonexertional limitation.field.at.the opinion in field emphasized that where the problem is the more fundamental problem of insufficient evidence on an issue for which the commissioner carries the burden,further proceedings are not warranted.id.at.in this case,the magistrate judge looked no further than the field case to conclude that the c ommissioner failure to carry his burden at step requires remand for payment of benefits,seavey,wl,at,without analyzing the differences between the cases.
seavey responds that the commissioner is simply being held to the same standard as any other litigant in any other he does not meet his burden,then an order to pay benefits is appropriate.he claims that t he secretary who has the benefit of institutional expertise and a huge federal bureaucracy in effect argues that no matter how egregious the error they must be given one chance after another to remedy their mistake unless the record demonstrates with virtual certainty that the applicant will win on remand.in essence,seavey argues that the commissioner wants an impermissible second bite at the apple.
the premise of seavey position is that the commissioner should be treated like any other litigant and that remanding and allowing new evidence would be giving the commissioner an unfair advantage.the premise is not entirely correct.because of the nonadversarial nature of social security disability determinations,the commissioner is not a litigant and has no representative at the agency level.indeed,the model is investigatory,or inquisitorial,rather than adversarial.sims apfel,d.it is the alj duty to investigate and develop the facts and develop the arguments both for and against the granting of benefits.id.at the alj level,the applicant is the only litigant presenting evidence.while the agency may have already generated evidence and the alj may generate example,by sending the applicant for a consultative exam or by calling a medical or vocational experts function as consultants in the adjudicative process,assisting the alj in determining what the outcome should be.they are not experts retained in an effort to shore up an agency litigation position.that is because,until the alj renders a decision on whether an applicant is disabled or not,the agency has not taken a final position.consequently,when an alj improperly concludes that a nonexertional impairment has no significant impact on residual functional capacity,that is an adjudicator making a mistake,not a party litigator failing to present evidence.
standard of review 
judicial review of social security administrative determinations is authorized by g.both the fourth and sixth sentences of this subsection grant federal courts the power to remand cases to the commissioner.the fourth sentence of this subsection states that a reviewing court shall have power to enter,upon the pleadings and transcript of the record,a judgment affirming,modifying,or reversing the decision of the commissioner of social security,with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.g.the sixth sentence states that the court may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the commissioner of social security,but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.id.as discussed below,we view this case as governed by the fourth sentence of g.see sullivan finkelstein,d see also shalala schaefer,d.
our review of a district court decision to affirm or reverse a final decision of the commissioner is de novo and we use the same standard to review the correctness of the commissioner decision as does the district court that is,whether the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standard was used.g ward,at.questions of law are reviewed de novo,both by the district court and by this court.brown apfel,d,aff,cir.since the district court appears to have adopted a rule of law as to disposition on remand,our review of this rule is de novo.
some of our sister circuits have held that,although district court decisions reversing or affirming a decision of the commissioner are reviewed de novo,a district court decision as to whether to remand for proceedings or order payment once an error has been found should be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.see higgins apfel,cir harman apfel,cir,cert.denied,d nelson apfel,cir.seavey has urged us to adopt this approach,and the commissioner has not contested this point before us 
however,we find that the decision as to what remedy to apply under sentence four of g is largely dictated by the type of error made by the alj or commissioner,as discussed below,and therefore is not,for the most part,a matter of discretion.unlike in appeals where the district court has acted as the trial court,the district court here has no institutional advantage over this court.the district court reviews the same cold administrative record as do we,applying the same substantial evidence test.the first circuit has never recognized any distinction between the scope of a district court review of social security determinations and the scope of appellate review.see,ward,at nguyen chater,cir per curiam splude apfel,cir.similarly,under the administrative procedure act,courts of appeals directly review the administrative action and use the same standard of review as the district court.baystate alternative staffing,herman,cir.we are not convinced that we should now create an exception to this general rule for cases challenging the remand instructions when the commissioner or alj has erred.therefore,we review de novo the district court decision to order payment 
remedy upon remand 
applying our standard of review here,we hold that the district court committed error by remanding with instructions to pay.such a result is inconsistent with our precedent and an unnecessary abrogation of the commissioner authority to adjudicate applications for disability benefits 
the question of remedy is tied to the strictures of g the findings of the commissioner of social security as to any fact,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.g.hence,the responsibility for weighing conflicting evidence,where reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome,falls on the commissioner and his designee,the alj.walker bowen,cir.it does not fall on the reviewing court.the
