plaintiff jorge pérez cordero appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants,wal mart puerto rico,wal mart,madeline santiago,pablo falcón,and the falcón doe conjugal partnership,on all counts of his civil suit alleging employment discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of and puerto rico law.pérez cordero claims to have been sexually harassed by santiago,his female supervisor,and retaliated against by wal mart management,including santiago and falcón,for his attempts to oppose the harassment.
the district court granted summary judgment primarily on the ground that pérez cordero could not show that santiago conduct was unwelcome,pervasive,or because of sex.after a careful review of the record,we vacate the judgment in favor of the defendants and remand the case for further proceedings.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to pérez cordero as the party.see,agusty reyes dep t of educ.of,cir.
pérez cordero was hired as a butcher at wal mart sam club store in humacao,puerto rico,in.in the summer of,santiago transferred from another department within sam club to become team leader of the store meat department.as team leader,santiago had some supervisory authority over pérez cordero.among other things,her position provided her the authority to design work schedules for meat department employees and to initiate disciplinary proceedings.
early in her tenure as team leader,santiago would schedule her lunch breaks to coincide with those of pérez cordero.in his deposition,pérez cordero testified that santiago would ask him every day where he was planning to eat lunch.she would often appear at his stated lunch locale and ask to share a table with him.in pérez cordero words,everywhere i went to go have lunch she would show up even mcdonald,wendy,los chinos,la plazoletta.
initially,lunchtime conversations between santiago and pérez cordero were exclusively.soon,however,santiago began sharing details about her private life with pérez cordero that led him to believe that santiago was interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with him.around this time,pérez cordero also became aware that his were gossiping about him as a result of the attention that santiago was showing him.in one incident,he was confronted by two female meat wrappers who asked pérez cordero whether he had something to do with her and whether he was aware that santiago liked older men pérez cordero said that hearing his comments made him uncomfortable.he testified that he tried to cut off any situation and that he would not share anything but work.he also undertook to avoid santiago at lunch times.in his deposition,pérez cordero stated,i would simply bring my own lunch or would tell her i was going to wendy and went to mcdonald so that she did not find me.
in august,santiago began making more overt propositions to pérez cordero.on one occasion,while organizing items from a recent delivery to the store,santiago told pérez cordero that she was a single mother seeking a man with whom she could settle down.she asked pérez cordero whether he wanted to be that man.according to pérez cordero,it was clear that she was talking about was sic a sex partner.pérez cordero was explicit in his rejection he told santiago that he was not available,and that he was in a committed relationship with a woman whom he planned to marry.
that same week,pérez cordero asked his girlfriend to have lunch with him at the store,and he introduced her to santiago.santiago later remarked to pérez cordero that meeting his girlfriend had made her feel guilty because when i have something with you then i will know who your woman is.santiago made this remark in front of at least two other employees.pérez cordero again made clear that he did not like or welcome santiago advances.he told her,d o play like that,it is very ugly.
the who had witnessed the incident talked with pérez cordero about santiago obvious romantic interest.as pérez cordero described it,they told me what i already suspected.that she wanted to have a relationship with me and if i did not realize it i was blind because they had already talked about it among women,women things.pérez cordero told his that he had no interest in a relationship with santiago,but he described feeling pressured by their questions they asked me are you sure you do like anything about her,and i said no and they asked me that question it was like what is happening,what wrong 
when it became clear to santiago that pérez cordero did not share her interest in pursuing a romantic relationship,his working conditions began to change.santiago supervised pérez cordero more strictly than other employees and pressured him to improve his performance even though the quality of his work had not deteriorated.santiago also assigned to pérez cordero tasks which had previously been shared among all the employees in the meat department or which normally required several employees to complete.santiago consistently scheduled pérez cordero to work the closing shift,which had previously rotated among employees the closing shift required more work than other shifts and prevented pérez cordero from participating in the daily departmental meetings.additionally,santiago reallocated the duties associated with the closing shift,which had the effect of requiring pérez cordero to perform additional cleaning on top of his normal tasks.
as an example of santiago strict supervision of him,pérez cordero notes that on september,santiago called him at the store repeatedly,even though she had the day off.he described this as unusual behavior.in each call,she informed him that his evaluation was in her hands.she stated that she expected sales from ten thousand to fifteen thousand dollars,and that she wanted to ensure that everything was okay in the refrigerators,that the cleaning was done and everything was organized because she was going to check his work the next day.
pérez cordero also claims that two days later,on september,santiago yelled at him in front of his when he arrived at work.he referred to it as a scolding,as if i were a child,and described the incident as humiliating.santiago was purportedly upset with pérez cordero for failing to dispose of some boxes from the previous day.pérez cordero stated that it was the only time he had ever been yelled at during his employment at sam club,in part because it violated the store policy on respect for the rights of others.pérez cordero reported the yelling incident to santiago supervisor,meat manager luiz ortiz,the day it occurred.ortiz told pérez cordero that santiago was probably just under stress,and he volunteered to talk to her about it.
the next day,santiago approached pérez cordero while he was dressing for work at his locker.instead of greeting pérez cordero with a kiss on the cheek,as was the custom among the store employees,santiago grabbed pérez cordero and forcefully sucked on his neck.pérez cordero testified that he felt shocked and surprised by her actions,to the point that he was unable to say anything to her.santiago then turned to another employee,emilio benítez,and whispered a comment to him in which she implied that pérez cordero had become sexually aroused by her greeting.after telling pérez cordero about santiago comment,benítez told him,you have that woman crazy about you.
pérez cordero again sought out ortiz.he told ortiz about the incident that morning,and stated that he was uncomfortable with the hostile manner in which he was being treated by santiago.ortiz said that he had spoken with santiago about the yelling incident the previous day,and he appeared reluctant to confront her again about her conduct.
pérez cordero approached ortiz again three days later,on september,to emphasize the gravity of the situation and to request official action.pérez cordero suspected that ortiz had never spoken with santiago because the situation had continued to deteriorate.he described his interactions with santiago over the previous days as having been both impolite and uncomfortable.
by september,ortiz had still taken no action to resolve pérez cordero concerns.pérez cordero approached ortiz for a third time,informing him that,if he was unable to solve the problem,pérez cordero would take his complaints further up the chain of command.ortiz told pérez cordero not to worry and stated that he would schedule a meeting involving all the concerned parties for the following day.
when pérez cordero arrived for the september meeting,he was surprised to discover that the meeting was not to resolve his complaints over santiago harassment,but to subject pérez cordero to a disciplinary proceeding known as a coaching.the session had been initiated by santiago,purportedly because pérez cordero had failed to follow directions and regulations.at the conclusion of the meeting,ortiz spoke to pérez cordero privately.he indicated that he would not file the disciplinary form prepared by santiago,but he suggested that pérez cordero resolve his problems with santiago by going out with her,take advantage of the opportunity.
later that day,pérez cordero took his concerns about santiago to josé castro,the area supervisor,who accompanied him to speak with falcón,the store manager.falcón thanked pérez cordero for raising his concerns,stated that he would deal with the situation,and dismissed pérez cordero for the day because pérez cordero was feeling very well emotionally.falcón arranged a meeting with pérez cordero,santiago,and ortiz for september.in the interim,pérez cordero faxed a memorandum to the store human resources manager expressing his concerns about santiago treatment of him and detailing the steps he had already taken in his attempt to resolve the problem.
as reflected in notes taken contemporaneously,pérez cordero raised the following concerns at the september meeting 
misunderstanding disrespect 
blackmailing,harassment of a sexual nature and persecuted.
my emotional health and my job stability without mentioning the family.
let them measure with the same ruler.

remarks made by her to emilio i sure he got an erection.

santiago acknowledged having made the inappropriate remark to pérez cordero bentez and apologized to pérez cordero.although he accepted her apology on a personal level,pérez cordero stated that he did not feel comfortable continuing to work under her direction.he asked falcón to remove either santiago or himself from the meat department.in response,falcón stated that,because pérez cordero had involved the human resources department,the matter was out of his hands.he told pérez cordero to take no further action until monday,october.pérez cordero had not received confirmation of his fax from the human resources department and,indeed,would never receive any communication from them on the matter.
on october,pérez cordero again spoke with falcón.falcón instructed pérez cordero to leave things like that.he blamed pérez cordero for having built an ugly situation and told him that it is easier to find a new butcher than to find a team leader.although he informed pérez cordero that santiago would receive an official disciplinary action known as a decision day,pérez cordero did not believe him 
pérez cordero filed a charge of discrimination with the puerto rico department of labor antidiscrimination unit on october.however,the department of labor did not notify wal mart of the charge until january.
in the interim four months,despite pérez cordero request that wal mart remove either santiago or himself from the department,santiago continued to supervise pérez cordero in the meat department.pérez cordero described that period as a very difficult time in which santiago was trying to kick him out.he continued to suffer from inequitable and retaliatory work assignments,including a permanent assignment to the closing shift during the christmas season,and he continued to receive unwarranted scrutiny and discipline.in addition,santiago denied pérez cordero six weeks of required training on operating standards as well as his requested vacation time.according to falcón,the store could not remove santiago as team leader because there was no replacement for her.however,shortly after the department of labor notified wal mart of the charge pérez cordero had filed in october,it transferred santiago to another store and offered the team leader position to pérez cordero.he declined.
throughout the period of alleged harassment,pérez cordero suffered from,among other things,insomnia,anxiety,depression,and mental anguish for which he was being treated by a psychiatrist.a psychiatric evaluation included in the record reflects a diagnosis of stress disorder resulting from santiago harassment and further indicates that pérez cordero had been taking various prescription medications to combat his symptoms since at least.
pérez cordero filed this suit in october,alleging discrimination in violation of title vii and the puerto rico anti discrimination act also known as law,laws ann.tit.the district court entered a default against santiago in september for her failure to respond.see.a.two months later,on the motion of wal mart and falcón,the court dismissed the title vii claims against falcón and santiago on the ground that title vii permits suits only against employers,not individual supervisors the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the remaining claims in may.that judgment was vacated on appeal because the district court erroneously refused to consider pérez cordero opposition to the defendants motion.pérez cordero wal mart,cir.
we note with some dismay that,on remand,the case remained under advisement for more than three years.in august,the district court once again granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all remaining claims,in an order substantially similar to the one it issued in when it deemed the defendants motion for summary judgment unopposed it is from this most recent entry of judgment that pérez cordero now appeals.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of pérez cordero as the party.see,barton clancy,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where the evidence demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and the moving party entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.c.an issue is genuine if it can be resolved in favor of either party,and a fact is material if it has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case.calero cerezo dep t of justice,cir.summary judgment is not appropriate where the evidence on record is sufficiently to permit a rational fact finder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.farmers ins.exch.rnk,cir quoting maymí ports,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
governing law 
title vii provides a private right of action against any employer who discriminate s against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.the supreme court has interpreted the phrase terms,conditions,or privileges of employment as manifesting a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,quoting dep t of water power manhart.in furtherance of that broad goal,title vii also prohibits employer retaliation against those employees who oppose discriminatory employment practices.a.
the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc has promulgated making clear that sexual harassment constitutes employment discrimination in violation of title vii 
unwelcome sexual advances,requests for sexual favors,and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual employment,submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such an individual,or such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual work performance or creating an intimidating,hostile or offensive working environment.
we have recognized multiple ways in which sexual harassment can affect a term,condition,or privilege of employment,as required by title vii.see generally valentín almeyda municipality of aguadilla,cir delineating the legal standard for title vii claims.quid pro quo harassment,in which a supervisor uses employer processes to punish a subordinate for refusing to comply with sexual demands,hernandez loring universidad metropolitana,cir,is actionable because it involves explicit and tangible alterations in the terms or conditions of employment.see burlington,ellerth.harassment that creates a sexually hostile and abusive work environment is actionable when it is sufficiently severe and pervasive to effect constructive alterations in the terms or conditions of employment.see id.at.the supreme court has cautioned,however,that the rough demarcation between quid pro quo claims and hostile work environment claims may be of limited utility,other than to generally describe alternative approaches to proving employment discrimination.see id.at.
before the district court,pérez cordero argued that santiago conduct constituted quid pro quo harassment and created a hostile work environment for which wal mart was liable,and he further argued that wal mart had unlawfully retaliated against him for reporting santiago conduct.on appeal,pérez cordero pursues only his hostile work environment and retaliation claims.we address those claims seriatim 
hostile work environment 
the decision of the district court 
to succeed on a hostile work environment claim against wal mart,pérez cordero must establish six elements that he is a member of a protected class that he was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment that the harassment was based upon sex that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive work environment that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive,such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and that he in fact did perceive it to be so and that some basis for employer liability has been demonstrated.agusty reyes,at quoting valentín almeyda,at.
the district court concluded that pérez cordero could demonstrate the first and,if harassment had been shown,the last of these six elements,but that he had failed to produce sufficient evidence to raise a issue of fact with respect to the the other elements.it stated that pérez cordero could possibly also establish the second factor if he could prove his allegations that santiago grabbed and hugged him and forcefully sucked on his neck in front of an associate,and that subsequently she made sexually related remarks regarding pérez cordero reactions to her advances.but it added that he would have difficulty showing that the conduct was unwelcome because there is no indication that the kissing incident was out of the ordinary or customary sic.the court found that pérez cordero failed on the third element because he presented no evidence that the conduct alleged was either or at least slightly sexual,and that he failed on the fourth element because,absent an indication in the record that santiago would greet only male employees with a kiss or that the allegedly sexual remarks made by santiago were motivated by pérez cordero gender,pérez cordero could not demonstrate that these events were not simply marked by minor offensive sexual connotations.it also ruled that the conduct described was neither severe nor pervasive as a matter of law because there is no indication that these incidents were frequent,that the conduct increased in severity physically or otherwise,nor that it interfered with pérez cordero work performance.
application of the six element test 
applying the test articulated above to pérez cordero claim,we find that summary judgment is unwarranted.first,there can be no doubt,and wal mart does not dispute,that pérez cordero is a member of a protected class.see oncale sundowner offshore,title vii prohibition of discrimination because of sex protects men as well as women.alteration in original.second,pérez cordero has presented sufficient evidence to raise several genuine issues of material fact with respect to the remaining elements.
a.the harassment was unwelcome 
pérez cordero explained in his deposition testimony that he initially sought to avoid santiago attention by lying about his lunch locations,and that,when santiago escalated her pursuit by overtly propositioning him,he twice responded with a clear and unequivocal rejection.we disagree with the district court that pérez cordero acquiescence to the customary greeting among employees a kiss on the cheek is in any way probative of his receptiveness to santiago forcefully sucking on his neck.additionally,the record contains no evidence that pérez cordero welcomed the inequitable work assignments,public scolding,private threats,and attempted disciplinary action that constitutes much of the remainder of his claim.
b.the harassment was based upon sex 
we have previously explained that,when harassment is motivated by a failed attempt to establish a romantic relationship,the victim sex is inextricably linked to the harasser decision to harass.forrest brinker int l payroll,cir.moreover,santiago own comment to bentez suggesting that she had sexually aroused pérez cordero by sucking on his neck sufficiently conveys that her conduct was at least slightly sexual.contrary to the implication in the district court decision,pérez cordero is not required to demonstrate that santiago act was motivated by sexual desire,oncale,at,but merely that the harassment was.forrest,at.
taking the evidence in the light most favorable to pérez cordero,a jury could reasonably conclude that santiago was attempting to humiliate pérez cordero,as she had when she scolded him the previous day,through an unwelcome public act of sexual aggressiveness.marrero goya of,f d,cir considering,as evidence of a hostile work environment,that a supervisor criticized the plaintiff work unfairly,sometimes embarrassing her by yelling at her in front of her.thus viewed,santiago conduct is unquestionably a form of harassment.oakstone postmaster,d,concluding that a false allegation of physical abuse filed by a female employee against her male was harassment because it exploited sensitivities to violence cited with approval in forrest,at.the fact that not all of the conduct has obvious sexual connotations does not diminish the force of the evidence indicating animus.rosario dep t of the army,cir.
c.the harassment was severe and pervasive 
the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that the scope of title vii prohibition on discrimination covers more than terms and conditions in the narrow contractual sense.faragher city of boca raton,quoting oncale,at.title vii affords employees the right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult.meritor,at.nevertheless,harassment that does not directly result in tangible changes in employment hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits,ellerth,at must be severe and pervasive enough to bring the conduct within title vii requirement that workplace sex discrimination affects a term,condition,or privilege of employment.see meritor,at.
although the district court properly identified relevant factors from our precedents when it concluded that there was no indication that santiago conduct was frequent,increased in severity,or interfered with pérez cordero work performance,it applied those factors far too rigidly.see billings town of grafton,cir.the district court conclusions also reflect a basic misapprehension of pérez cordero claim.the single kissing incident on which the district court focused does not constitute the entirety of pérez cordero hostile environment claim,but rather stands as just one example of santiago retaliatory tactics in this instance,an effort to humiliate him in front of a.at this stage in the litigation,it is our responsibility to evaluate pérez cordero claim of harassment in light of the record as a whole and mindful of the totality of the circumstances.meritor,at citing b.
we have said that the hostility vel non of a workplace does not depend on any particular kind of conduct,billings,at holding that a supervisor harassment of his employee was sufficiently severe and pervasive even though the conduct alleged did not include touching,sexual advances,or overtly sexual comments to or about her,and that t here is no precise formula for establishing sufficiently egregious conditions.rosario,at.nor do particular factors that contributed to our finding a hostile work environment in prior cases set a baseline against which future cases must be measured.accord schiano quality payroll,cir.
as set forth above,pérez cordero offered evidence describing both an initial period in which santiago pursued him romantically and a subsequent campaign of retaliation by santiago as punishment for his rejection of her advances.santiago threatened pérez cordero with a negative evaluation,attempted to initiate a formal disciplinary proceeding against him,supervised his work scrupulously,and berated his performance in front of his.che.bay transp,cir finding sufficient evidence of severe and pervasive harassment in series of incidents of undeserved or excessive discipline marrero,at same.she assigned to him tasks that were physically demanding and that excluded him from staff meetings and training opportunities.city of providence,cir w here a plaintiff endures harassing conduct,although not explicitly sexual in nature,which undermines her ability to succeed at her job,those acts should be considered along with overtly sexually abusive conduct in assessing a hostile work environment claim.
wal mart contends,however,that additional undisputed facts in the record clearly demonstrate that any harassment by santiago was not severe or pervasive enough to interfere with pérez cordero performance of his work.in particular,wal mart emphasizes that pérez cordero was offered a promotion which he declined,was eventually paid for his unused vacation time,and generally received positive performance evaluations.these actions do not negate the impact of santiago conduct on pérez cordero work conditions.nor does pérez cordero perseverance in staying on the job undermine his claim of sexual harassment.we have never required an employee to falter under the weight of an abusive work environment before his or her claim becomes actionable.see billings,at the fact that billings managed to get her work done is by no means fatal to her hostile environment claim.in short,the conduct described by pérez cordero is sufficiently severe and pervasive to have altered the terms or conditions of his employment with wal mart.
d.the harassment was offensive 
santiago harassment of pérez cordero involved physical contact,embarrassing sexual remarks,public scolding,exclusion from meetings and training opportunities,threats of discipline,and an assignment to him of those tasks generally regarded as least desirable.pérez cordero complaint,his deposition testimony,notes taken in the september,meeting,and other record evidence all reveal that santiago harassment caused pérez cordero to suffer psychologically and emotionally.on september,he was sent home from work because he was not emotionally well.as early as september,he reported insomnia and stated that he was taking medication to enable him to sleep.he subsequently reported insomnia,anxiety,and depression to his doctor,began seeing a counselor,and was prescribed various medications to combat these symptoms.it is clear on the record before us that pérez cordero experienced santiago conduct as genuinely offensive.we can not say,as the district court did,that a reasonable person in his position would disagree with that subjective assessment.see id.at.
e.there is a basis for wal mart liability 
an employer is liable when a supervisor conduct creates a hostile work environment for employees unless the employer can demonstrate that it is entitled to the faragher ellerth defense.agusty reyes,at.the faragher ellerth defense comprises two necessary elements a that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,and b that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.ellerth,at.we agree with the district court that wal mart can not make that showing here.in light of pérez cordero repeated and undisputed complaints to wal mart management throughout september and october of,wal mart can not satisfy its summary judgment burden on the second element of the defense.therefore,at this stage in the litigation,pérez cordero has sufficiently demonstrated a basis for wal mart liability as santiago employer.
retaliation 
in addition to his sexual harassment claim,pérez cordero brought a claim under title vii claiming retaliation by wal mart management in response to pérez cordero reporting of santiago sexual harassment.in order to make out a retaliation claim under title vii,pérez cordero must show that he engaged in a protected activity and that he subsequently suffered some materially adverse action causally linked to his protected activity.collazo bristol myers squibb,cir.a materially adverse action is one that might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.burlington santa fe ry.white,internal quotation marks omitted.if a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of retaliation,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,reason for its conduct.collazo,at.if the defendant can meet that burden,the plaintiff must show that the proffered legitimate reason is in fact a pretext and that the job action was the result of the defendant retaliatory animus.roman potter,cir quoting enica principi,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
pérez cordero twice engaged in protected activities.he filed a charge of discrimination with the department of labor on october.it is undisputed that the filing of such a charge constitutes a protected activity under title vii.see generally a.however,wal mart was not notified of pérez cordero complaint to the department of labor until january.pérez cordero has not provided evidence of any retaliatory conduct during the two weeks that elapsed between wal mart receipt of this information and the date it responded by transferring santiago to another store and offering to promote pérez cordero to the vacant team leader position.
pérez cordero retaliation claim thus depends on the evidence of retaliation for his second protected activity,which took place both earlier and later than his formal complaint to the department of labor.that activity was his reporting of santiago conduct to ortiz,castro,and falcón throughout september and october.pérez cordero frequent complaints to his superiors about the harassment to which he was subjected suffice to show his opposition to that harassment,within the meaning of title vii.see crawford metro.gov t,stating that communicating to one employer a belief that the employer has engaged in employment discrimination virtually always constitutes opposition to the activity collazo,f d at finding that an employee opposed a supervisor harassment by,inter alia,speaking to the supervisor individually and eliciting a limited apology accord matima celli,cir providing examples of protected informal opposition to discrimination that include making complaints to management,writing critical letters to customers,and supporting who have filed formal charges.although pérez cordero did not suffer a tangible employment detriment in response to this protected activity,such as a retaliatory firing,we have previously held that the escalation of a supervisor harassment on the heels of an employee complaints about the supervisor is a sufficiently adverse action to support a claim of employer retaliation.agusty reyes,at.
the record reveals sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that santiago discriminatory harassment escalated in response to pérez cordero complaints.pérez cordero first complained to ortiz about santiago harassment on september.although the conduct pérez cordero complained of a public scolding was not itself sexual,it nevertheless constituted sexual harassment,as it was part of santiago reprisal against pérez cordero for her failed,public attempt to establish a romantic relationship with him.at the september meeting,ortiz promised to talk to santiago,and later confirmed to pérez cordero that he had done so pérez cordero was subjected to santiago inappropriate greeting and sexual comment the next day.several days later,after two more complaints by pérez cordero to ortiz,santiago and ortiz initiated a meeting to discipline pérez cordero,at the end of which ortiz encouraged pérez cordero to solve his problems by go ing out with santiago.
a reasonable jury could interpret santiago september greeting,the first overtly sexualized act of harassment alleged,as an escalation in both the nature and intensity of her harassment.similarly,because of the official imprimatur suggested by ortiz involvement and the fact that it implicated pérez cordero employment benefits,the disciplinary meeting on september can reasonably be viewed as both another increase in the severity of santiago retaliation and a weightier deterrent to subsequent complaints.lockridge of me,cir we think that,under certain circumstances,the denial of an employee request for office space could dissuade a reasonable person from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.valentín almeyda,at concluding that disadvantageous transfers or assignments can be materially adverse.in addition,the temporal proximity between pérez cordero initial complaints and these retaliatory actions is sufficient to establish the causal connection required for a prima facie case of retaliation.see collazo,at see also decaire mukasey,cir o ur law is that temporal proximity alone can suffice to meet the relatively light burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.quoting mariani colón dep t of homeland,cir.
there is admittedly some overlap between pérez cordero discrimination claim,which depends on proof that the hostile work environment was because of sex,and his retaliation claim,which seeks to characterize the same hostile work environment as caused by his protected activity.see burlington santa fe ry,at title vii substantive provision seeks to prevent injury based on who they are,their status.the provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do,their conduct.however,where,as here,the evidence can reasonably be viewed as demonstrating either discriminatory animus or retaliatory animus,we may consider the same evidence in assessing the sufficiency of both of the plaintiff claims.see agusty reyes,at finding sufficient evidence on appeal from summary judgment of both severe and pervasive harassment and retaliation through the escalation of that harassment morales vallellanes potter,cir reviewing an employer conduct to determine simultaneously the sufficiency of employee and retaliation claims.
in response to pérez cordero prima facie case of retaliation,the defendants have not attempted to advance a legitimate,reason for the conduct of wal mart managers,nor is one readily apparent from the record.consequently,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of wal mart on pérez cordero retaliation claim was erroneous.
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court entry of summary judgment for wal mart on pérez cordero claims alleging sexual harassment and retaliation under title vii.we likewise vacate the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of all defendants on pérez cordero claims under puerto rico law.we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.costs are awarded to the appellant.
so ordered.
santiago is considerably younger than pérez cordero.
at oral argument,the defendants disputed this contention and drew our attention to several handwritten work schedules in the record.even taking those work schedules at face value,they do not belie pérez cordero deposition testimony.first,they show that pérez cordero was,in fact,assigned the closing shift with greater frequency beginning around the end of august.second,the work schedules for several weeks central to this litigation are noticeably absent from the record.
a coaching is an administrative disciplinary procedure used to inform an employee that he has done something wrong.it is an intermediate step that typically follows an oral warning but that precedes serious sanction.employees who receive a coaching are not eligible to transfer,receive a raise,or be promoted for one year.
later in his deposition,pérez cordero described ortiz comment as you solve this,go out with her and that will ease the differences.nothing in our decision turns on the precise words used.
a decision day is the third and most severe level of internal disciplinary proceeding.pérez cordero was skeptical that the management would skip the first two disciplinary steps.he also claims that santiago was present at work the following week,which is inconsistent with the decision day practice of requiring the sanctioned employee to skip work to craft a written account of the problem.finally,he was informed by who were close to santiago that she did not receive a decision day,but that pérez cordero was simply told this in order to calm him down.
although the defendants contest this assertion by pointing to a certificate of achievement awarded to pérez cordero in october,we note that the certificate was awarded prior to pérez cordero taking six of the seven required examinations,four of which were eventually administered on the same day.this evidence is ambiguous enough to create a contested factual question as to whether pérez cordero was denied training.
although the validity of that dismissal is not before us,we note that,subsequent to the decision of the district court,we joined the majority of circuits in holding that title vii does not impose liability on individual employees.see fantini salem state,cir.pérez cordero law claim against falcón and santiago survived the motion to dismiss because of their supervisory positions within wal mart.the puerto rico supreme court has interpreted law,unlike title vii,to permit holding agents,officials,administrators,and supervisors civilly liable as employers under the statute.see otero merced preferred health,d,explaining the puerto rico supreme court decision in rosario toledo distribuidora kikuet,to that effect.
the district court also vacated the default judgment previously entered against santiago on the ground that the claim against her under law lacked a sufficient factual basis.
congress gave the eeoc the limited authority to issue procedural regulations to carry out the prohibitions on employment discrimination set forth in title vii.a.eeoc guidelines interpreting title vii are therefore not binding authority.see gilbert,superseded on other grounds by statute,pregnancy discrimination act of,stat codified at k.but as an administrative interpretation of title vii by the agency charged with its enforcement,the eeoc guidelines constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.meritor,at quoting gilbert,at internal quotation mark omitted.
although pérez cordero also pursues his law claim against all defendants on appeal,we do not separately address that claim.puerto rico law is a broad antidiscrimination statute analogous to title vii in many respects.see monteagudo asociación de empleados del estado libre asociado de,cir describing law as an analogue to title vii.as relevant here,the supreme court of puerto rico has stress ed that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination by reason of sex that is proscribed by law.sánchez power,offic.trans.moreover,puerto rico law,which is to be interpreted in pari materia with law and which merely identifies with greater sp
