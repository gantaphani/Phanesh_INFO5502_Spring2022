a.the plan 
boardman began working for digital on april.as a digital employee,boardman was covered by digital long term disability insurance plan the plan.prudential underwrites and is the claims administrator for the plan,which grants prudential discretion to determine entitlement to disability benefits and provides that benefits are paid upon proof of eligibility being furnished to prudential.under the terms of the plan,after an elimination period of weeks,a digital employee is eligible for long term disability benefits only if prudential finds that the requirements of total disability outlined in the plan have been met.the plan schedule of benefits defines initial duration as the elimination period plus months.during the initial duration,boardman had to demonstrate to prudential that,due to her illness,she was unable to perform the duties of her job as project manager.after months,in order to remain eligible for benefits,boardman had to show that she was unable to perform any job for which she is reasonably fitted by education,training and experience.the terms of the plan provide that prudential,at its own expense,has the right to examine the person whose loss is the basis of a claim.prudential may do this when and as often as is reasonable while the claim is pending.
boardman illness and her eligibility for benefits 
boardman stopped working for digital on december.at the time,she was employed as a project manager i,a position that entailed managing engineers and conducting site visits with customers,and required vision,hearing and speech in ordinary conversation.the position did not require lifting or carrying,and consisted of sixty percent sitting,twenty percent standing,and twenty percent walking.
in the years leading up to the termination of her employment,boardman suffered from diffuse symptoms.as reported by anthony esposito,an infectious disease specialist to whom boardman was referred by her primary physician,stephen neustat,boardman described her condition in january as follows 
for the past three to four years she has had fatigue,somnalence,recurrent colds and flu,and more recently,three to four episodes of parotitis the latter have been characterized by local pain,tenderness and swelling without fever or chills.
in a february,letter to neustat,esposito concluded that,based on the available data,boardman suffered from chronic persistent epstein barr viral disease characterized by both systemic manifestations as well as recurrent parotitis.in addition to neustat and esposito,boardman was treated by alan marks and alan brenner,both of whom are rheumatologists.
over the next several years,boardman continued to suffer from a large constellation of problems,although,according to marks,her doctors have never been able to pin down a specific diagnosis.although esposito concluded in february that boardman suffered from epstein barr viral disease,he conceded the possibility of other conditions that might be producing these manifestations and suggested that neustat refer boardman to a rheumatologist.on march,marks,one of boardman rheumatologists,opined that the most likely unifying diagnosis is sjogren syndrome and that he was not sure what role,if any,eb epstein barr virus is playing in this.by july,neustat reported to prudential that the symptoms were clearly recognizable as sjogren,which is a type of lupus,and that epstein barr virus is no longer an issue.however,in a june,letter,neustat reported that patient has chronic active epstein barr viral infection with recurrent parotitis,and on may,marks stated that i t is possible that she does have chronic fatigue,sicca syndrome,and myalgias related to ebv disease.on november,brenner opined that i do not believe a diagnosis of sjogren syndrome is appropriate or helpful.despite these varying diagnoses,boardman continued to suffer from chronic fatigue,musculoskeletal pain,and parotitis.
boardman applied for long term disability benefits under the plan on may.prudential approved the claim and benefits began on june.on may,digital informed prudential that it had received a letter indicating that boardman was working at her husband auto shop.in response,prudential contacted neustat on may,for an update on boardman medical condition,and on july,prudential conducted a home visit with boardman in order to review boardman claim status.neustat reported that boardman had more joint symptoms than ever before,had developed arthritis symptoms and swollen joints,and could hardly hold a pen or pencil.based on this information and prudential impressions of boardman during the home visit,boardman benefits were continued.
boardman initial duration period ended on june.thereafter,to remain eligible for benefits,boardman had to show that she was disabled from the duties of any job for which she is reasonably fitted by her education training or experience.accordingly,in april,prudential requested updated medical records from boardman doctors.included in marks records was a march,report stating that boardman suffers from extreme fatigue,bilateral parotid swelling,dryness of eyes,myalgias,and recurring neck pain,and concluding that b ecause of the above symptoms,particularly fatigue,arthralgias and myalgias,the patient is unable to work.in a letter to prudential dated june,neustat summarized boardman complex condition as reduced energy and recurrent parotitis with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections.prudential continued to pay benefits to boardman 
on february,prudential again sought an update of boardman medical status and sent an attending physician statement to boardman for her doctor to complete.on june,neustat completed the form,noting that patient has not made any significant improvement and that no changes are expected in near future to boardman permanent limitations.after receiving this information,prudential extended boardman benefits for an additional year.
termination of boardman benefits 
on march,consistent with its rights under the plan,prudential required boardman to undergo an independent medical examination ime with hubert caplan,a board certified rheumatologist.she was instructed to bring all,test results and medical records with her to the exam,and prudential forwarded to caplan a complete copy of the medical information in its file,which included information relating to boardman education,training and experience.prudential requested that caplan include in his report the patient history objective findings noted during the examination reasons that the patient could not perform her job or other jobs limitations and restrictions placed on the patient medications or therapy that would facilitate recovery activities,in relation to the patient job and other jobs,that she could perform now and when the patient might be able to return to work.
