the plaintiff,taymari delgado ecvhevarría delgado,appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of her former employer,astrazeneca pharmaceutical lp astrazeneca although delgado labors mightily to demonstrate the existence of a litany of genuine disputes of material fact,her inability to do so with respect to each of the essential elements of her claims compels us to affirm.
consistent with delgado effort to show the existence of a host of factual disputes in this case,each party brief provides an discussion of the facts.we prefer to take a different tack briefly sketching here the general background and setting forth in detail only those facts that are relevant to our disposition of this appeal,augmenting this background as necessary in the pages that follow.as in all other cases,we view the facts and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them in the light most favorable to delgado,the nonmovant.see garmon passenger,cir.
in,astrazeneca hired delgado to work as a pharmaceutical sales specialist pss.she was promoted to a hospital specialist in.with the new position came a new supervisor,maribel martínez martínez.
in november,delgado sought treatment for depression and anxiety with jorge sánchez cruz sánchez,a psychiatrist.nearly one year later,delgado learned that she had a pituitary microadenoma a small brain tumor,in layman terms.delgado informed martínez of the tumor and the two biopsy procedures that flowed from this diagnosis,but did not disclose her depression or anxiety.
on december,sánchez diagnosed delgado with severe depression and extreme anxiety,and he recommended that she refrain from working.later that day,delgado emailed an astrazeneca occupational health nurse in order to get the ball rolling on her application for benefits under the company disability std policy initially,astrazeneca denied delgado request for std benefits because chs determined that she had not submitted the necessary documentation.in response,sánchez provided additional paperwork on delgado behalf in which he estimated that she needed to be out on leave for about five months until may.
astrazeneca subsequently awarded delgado std benefits retroactive to december,until january,the record does not reflect the reason that astrazeneca did not grant delgado std benefits until may,as sánchez requested.astrazeneca periodically extended her benefits on several occasions.delgado received treatment in a hospital on an outpatient basis sometime in late january or early february,and her benefits were extended until february.delgado benefits were then extended again until march,and once more until march.
in two treatment records that sánchez submitted to astrazeneca on delgado behalf one dated february and the other dated march sánchez described delgado as m ildly i ll.on march,astrazeneca terminated delgado std benefits because she failed to submit what it viewed as adequate documentation of her disability.five days later,michael cohran cohran,the then senior employment practices partner in the human resources department at astrazeneca,sent a letter to delgado instructing her to return to work by march and informing her that,if she failed to do so,astrazeneca would presume that she resigned from her employment with the company.in response,sánchez requested that astrazeneca continue delgado medical leave until march.
when delgado did not return to work on march,cohran called her,put pressure on her to resign,offered her a severance package,and suggested that,once she took care of her health,she reapply for her position with astrazeneca in six months if her position was still open.the conversation was an upsetting one for delgado she became pretty hysterical,began to cry,was unable to finish the call,and suffered a relapse of her condition as a result.one week after cohran phone call with delgado,sánchez submitted additional documentation in support of his request that astrazeneca continue delgado medical leave sánchez characterized delgado as s everely i ll in this paperwork.astrazeneca then extended delgado std benefits until april.
by letter dated may,astrazeneca informed delgado that her std benefits terminated on april.cohran sent another letter to delgado on may informing her that,if she did not return to work on may,astrazeneca would presume that she resigned from the company.
delgado did not return to work on may.instead,sánchez faxed additional documentation to astrazeneca on delgado behalf that day in one section of astrazeneca leave form,sánchez related that delgado medical condition commenced in and would probably last more than a year.in another section of the same form,sánchez requested additional leave for delgado and indicated that she was unable to work at this time additionally,in response to a question on the form calling for an estimate of the beginning and ending dates for the period of incapacity,sánchez entered months.an astrazeneca occupational health nurse told cohran via email on may that she reviewed this form the same day that it was faxed to the company,determined it did not support reinstating delgado std benefits,and left delgado a voicemail later that day.astrazeneca did not follow up with delgado psychiatrist that day or at any point thereafter.
rather,on may,cohran sent delgado yet another letter.this letter reiterated that delgado had been required to return to work the day before or else be presumed to have resigned her employment with astrazeneca and confirmed that she had neither reported to work as instructed nor contacted her supervisor.the letter indicated that delgado termination effective date was july.the letter also noted another update that,due to a recent reorganization in field sales,we are making a offer of severance to you.finally,on july,with no other communications passing between astrazeneca and delgado in the interim,cohran sent delgado one more letter that informed her as outlined in my letter dated may,due to a recent reorganization in field sales your position was eliminated the july letter also reminded delgado of the effective date of her termination two days later and the offer.
delgado did not accept astrazeneca offer.instead,in february,she initiated this action against her former employer,alleging a host of claims under federal and puerto rico law.in particular,delgado alleged that astrazeneca violated the americans with disabilities act ada,by discriminating against her on account of her disability,failing to reasonably accommodate that disability,failing to engage in an interactive process to discuss reasonable accommodations,and retaliating against her for engaging in protected activity under the ada.delgado also alleged that astrazeneca violated several provisions of puerto rico law,including law,article,and law the district court entered summary judgment in astrazeneca favor.delgado timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review the entry of summary judgment de novo.fresenius health partners,pr,llc,wl,at cir,garmon,at.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ameen amphenol printed circuits,cir.we are free to affirm the entry of summary judgment on any basis apparent in the record.jones nationwide life ins,cir.quoting chiang verizon new eng,cir.
on appeal,delgado argues that the district court erred in entering summary judgment for astrazeneca on both her ada claims and puerto rico law claims.we address her ada claims first and then turn to her remaining claims.
ada claims 
delgado complaint asserted that astrazeneca violated the ada in several respects.those claims can be classified into one of two general categories disability discrimination and retaliation.we address each category in turn.
to withstand summary judgment on an ada claim,delgado needs to show the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact as to all three elements of her prima facie case that she is disabled under the ada that she is qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation and that she was discharged or otherwise adversely affected in whole or in part because of her disability.jones,at.in this case,the district court assumed,without deciding,that delgado was disabled under the ada on account of her depression and anxiety,and we do the same.delgado and astrazeneca spar over the remaining elements.
we narrow our focus to the element,which imposes a burden on delgado to show that she possesses the requisite skill,experience,education and other requirements for the position and that she is able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation.mulloy acushnet,cir.astrazeneca does not dispute that delgado satisfies this first requirement her qualification for the position and delgado does not contend that she was able to perform the essential functions of her position without a reasonable accommodation thus,the scope of our inquiry shrinks further still we need only address whether delgado has shown a genuine dispute of material fact that she was able to perform the essential functions of her position with a reasonable accommodation.see id.
the ada compels an employer to make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee,unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on its operation of the business,wl,at quoting b a see also airways,barnett,explaining that the ada prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual with a disability who,with reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the job quoting a,b.the plaintiff bears the burden of showing the existence of a reasonable accommodation.see reed lepage bakeries,cir.to satisfy that burden,a plaintiff needs to show not only that the proposed accommodation would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job,but also that,at least on the face of things,it is feasible for the employer under the circumstances.id.at see also jones,at freadman,at mulloy,at.we have referred to the second aspect of this burden as an obligation to show that the requested accommodation is facially reasonable.reed,at.
delgado argues that her may request for an additional twelve months of leave was a reasonable accommodation the district court thought otherwise,concluding that,in essence,delgado was seeking indefinite leave an accommodation that is not reasonable under the ada see fiumara president fellows of harvard,app x,cir.watkins j s oil,cir.see also robert bd.of cty.comm rs of brown,cir.having set the stage,we now provide our take.
first things first all agree that a leave of absence or a leave extension can constitute a reasonable accommodation under the ada in some circumstances.lederle parenterals,cir.see also criado ibm,cir.and,to be sure,w hether a leave request is reasonable turns on the facts of the case,at alterations in original quoting criado,at.but the nature of the inquiry does not insulate cases from summary judgment.to the contrary,a plaintiff must show,even at the stage,that the requested accommodation is facially reasonable.see reed,at.and,where a plaintiff fails to show facial reasonableness,summary judgment for the defendant is appropriate.see,jones,at.so it is here.
the combined effect of two aspects of this case convince us that delgado has failed to show that her request for twelve more months of leave was a reasonable accommodation.first,it seems doubtful that delgado shouldered her burden of showing that the requested accommodation would have enabled her to perform the essential functions of her position.second,delgado has not shown that additional leave for this duration is a facially reasonable accommodation,either in the circumstances of her particular case,reed,at,or in the run of cases,id.at.on appeal,delgado disputes both of these conclusions,but to no avail.
effectiveness of accommodation 
delgado seems to assert that sánchez informed astrazeneca that the requested additional twelve months would have improved delgado condition and that she would have been able to return to work.upon closer inspection,however,this claim is dubious.
for starters,delgado relies,at least in part,on sánchez deposition testimony to support her assertion.this is problematic.even if sánchez opined during his deposition in that delgado would have been able to return to work after twelve more months of leave,t he facts relevant to a determination of whether a medical leave is a reasonable accommodation are the facts available to the at the time of the employment decision.amadio ford motor,cir.jones,at explaining that o ne element in the reasonableness equation is the likelihood of success and concluding that employee failed to show that requested accommodation an extension of time to take a test was reasonable because he did not show any reason for the employer to conclude he would pass the exam if given yet another opportunity to take it quoting evans fed.express,cir.henry united bank,cir.affirming entry of summary judgment on claim brought under analogous state law because,as of the date of her termination,the plaintiff had given the bank neither a relative time frame for her anticipated recovery nor any indication of when or whether she would ever be able to return to her credit analyst position in the future.with one possible exception discussed below,delgado has pointed us to no evidence in this record suggesting that sánchez communicated his opinion to astrazeneca in,a nd we will not become archeologists,devoting scarce to dig through the record in the hopes of finding something delgado should have found.belsito commc ns,decker,cir.
the closest thing in this record to evidence that sánchez informed astrazeneca that the requested twelve additional months of leave would likely enable delgado to return to work appears to be an entry in the form sánchez faxed to astrazeneca on may.delgado seizes upon this entry,but it hardly the golden ticket that she thinks it is.
in the space on the form calling for an estimate of the beginning and ending dates for the period of incapacity,sánchez wrote months.that all.as far as we can tell,delgado evidently believes that,because the form calls for an estimate of the ending date of the period of incapacity and sánchez wrote twelve months in response,the implication is that,after the twelve months elapsed,delgado would be ready to return to work.
although we are at this juncture to view the facts in the light most favorable to delgado and to draw all the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts in her favor,we are leery to conclude that the form could be reasonably understood to have conveyed to astrazeneca that the proposed accommodation of an additional twelve months of leave would allow delgado to return to work able to perform the essential functions of her position.read literally,this single entry on the form says no such thing.but,even if we accepted delgado argument that sánchez impliedly suggested by this entry that delgado would return to work after twelve additional months of leave and that astrazeneca should have understood as much by reading between the lines,delgado has not told us whether sánchez submitted any supporting medical documentation when he faxed the form to astrazeneca let alone that any such documentation supported what delgado views as sánchez implicit assertion that she would have been able to return to work after twelve more months of leave this barren record strikes us as a rather meager attempt,in the circumstances of this case,to demonstrate that the requested accommodation would have been effective.nonetheless,given our obligation to view the evidence in the light most favorable to delgado,we assume that she has met her burden on this score.
facial reasonableness 
there is an even larger flaw in delgado case she has failed to show that her proposed accommodation of an additional twelve months a lengthy period of leave is a facially reasonable accommodation.for starters,the sheer length of the delay,when coupled with her prior leave from december to may,jumps off the page.courts confronted with similar requests even ones for half the amount of time that delgado requested have concluded that such requests are not facially reasonable.see,hwang.state,cir.gorsuch,see also luke bd.of trustees of.a m,wl,at cir,holding that request for additional leave,after employee had already received nine months of leave,was request where employee would remain unable to perform essential function for another six months stallings detroit pub,app x,cir.holding that teacher request for four months leave was not a reasonable accommodation epps city of pine lawn,cir.concluding that employee failed to show that requested accommodation of six months of leave was reasonable larson united nat.foods,app x,cir.a n indefinite,but at least long,leave of absence to permit the employee to fulfill the professional treatment recommendations so that he might eventually be physically qualified under the dot regulations is not a reasonable accommodation.byrne avon,cir.suggesting that two months employee spent away from work for treatment for mental difficulties would not qualify as reasonable accommodation because i nability to work for a period removes a person from the class protected by the ada.
our newest judicial superior,justice gorsuch,then writing for the tenth circuit in hwang,nicely captured the dilemma that lengthy leave requests pose for employers 
by her own admission,the plaintiff could work at any point or in any manner for a period spanning more than six months.it perhaps goes without saying that an employee who is capable of working for so long is an employee capable of performing a job essential functions and that requiring an employer to keep a job open for so long does qualify as a reasonable accommodation.after all,reasonable accommodations typically things like adding ramps or allowing more flexible working hours are all about enabling employees to work,not to not work.
i t difficult to conceive how an employee absence for six months an absence in which she could not work from home,or in any way in any place could be consistent with discharging the essential functions of most any job in the national economy today.even if it were,it is difficult to conceive when requiring so much latitude from an employer might qualify as a reasonable accommodation.
at internal citations omitted compliance with a request for a lengthy period of leave imposes obvious burdens on an employer,not the least of which entails somehow covering the absent employee job responsibilities during the employee extended leave.delgado showing must take these obvious burdens into account.see reed,at t he difficulty of providing plaintiff proposed accommodation will often be relevant to the reasonableness of the accommodation plaintiff will often need to take such difficulties into account in proving whether the accommodation is facially practicable she has not done so.
in an attempt to show that her requested accommodation was facially reasonable,delgado points out that,under astrazeneca leave policy,employees are entitled to exhaust weeks of std leave and then also to receive ltd benefits after that.this is true as far as it goes,but it does take delgado very far.after all,employees are entitled to benefits only if they have sufficiently documented the need for them to the satisfaction of chs.astrazeneca determined that delgado may request for leave was not adequately supported by the provided documentation,and delgado did not challenge that determination through the internal,company appeals procedure outlined in astrazeneca std policy so,notwithstanding the theoretical availability of benefits under astrazeneca policy,delgado has not shown that,under the circumstances of this case,reed,at,her request for an additional twelve months of leave was facially reasonable.
undaunted,delgado claims that our decision in supports the reasonableness of her request for extended std leave.she is mistaken.as an initial matter,delgado misapprehends the precise accommodation request at issue in.contrary to her assertion that we held that a request for leave up to months did not constitute an undue burden,the only leave request at issue in that case was the plaintiff request for an additional two months of leave from the date of the request,at we reversed the entry of summary judgment for the employer in that case because the district court improperly applied per se rules rather than an individualized assessment of the facts.id.at.and the employee had demonstrated,in the circumstances of that case,that the requested accommodation of a few additional months of unsalaried leave,with the job functions being satisfactorily performed in the meantime,was reasonable.id.at.she pointed to evidence that showed that the employer was able to fill the employee position with individuals hired from temporary agencies and had no business need to replace the employee with an hire,and hence would not have suffered had it waited for several more months until the employee return.id.at.moreover,the employer did not contest the reasonableness of the accommodation except to embrace a per se rule that any leave beyond its reservation period was too long.id.at.
in this case,delgado request for twelve months of leave on top of the five months already taken is very different.our holding in was driven by the particular facts of that case.see id.at we add that our analysis,while applicable to these facts,may not be applicable in other cases.indeed,we acknowledged that,on different facts,a request for an extended leave could indeed be too long to be a reasonable accommodation and no reasonable factfinder could conclude otherwise.id.at.this coda seems for this case,where delgado leave request was for a far lengthier period of time,and her attempt to overcome the relatively obvious burdens associated with such a leave request is woefully deficient.in these circumstances,delgado has failed to shoulder her burden of showing facial reasonableness,and no reasonable factfinder could conclude that delgado leave request was reasonable.
finally,delgado points out that astrazeneca has failed to offer any evidence or argument that her request for an additional twelve months of leave would have imposed an undue hardship on it but this is beside the point here.because delgado failed to shoulder her burden to identify a reasonable accommodation,we need not consider the question of undue hardship.see mulloy,at.
we add that,as was true in,our conclusion today is a narrow one.although we have previously suggested that there may be requested leaves so lengthy or as to be an unreasonable accommodation in any situation,at,we need not and therefore do not decide that a request for a similarly lengthy period of leave will be an unreasonable accommodation in every case.it suffices to say that,in these circumstances,delgado failed to shoulder her burden of showing that a request for twelve more months of leave was facially reasonable.
there is one loose end to tie up.delgado also contends that astrazeneca violated the ada when it failed to engage in an interactive process after she requested the additional twelve months of leave and,true enough,a n employee request for accommodation sometimes creates a duty on the part of the employer to engage in an interactive process,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting eeoc kohl dep t stores,cir,though the specifics of what process is required var y depending on the circumstances of each case,id.but delgado contention need not detain us long.where,as here,the employee fails to satisfy her burden of showing that a reasonable accommodation existed,the employee can not maintain a claim for failure to engage in an interactive process.see lang stores,cir.t he omission of an interactive process is of no moment if the record forecloses a finding that the employee could do the essential duties of the job,with or without reasonable accommodation,which,for reasons already given,is the case here.citation omitted quoting kvorjak maine,cir.so we say no more about this claim.
that that for delgado ada claim.because delgado failed to argue that she was able to perform the essential functions of her position without accommodation and failed to show that her requested accommodation of twelve more months of leave is facially reasonable,she is unable to establish a genuine dispute of material fact as to the element of her prima facie case.see mulloy,at.therefore,astrazeneca was entitled to summary judgment on delgado ada claim.
ada retaliation claim 
in addition to her ada claim,delgado also asserts that astrazeneca violated the ada by retaliating against her because she engaged in protected activity.it is well settled that a n ada plaintiff may assert a claim for retaliation even if she fails to succeed on a disability discrimination claim.freadman,at.
because delgado retaliation claim is premised on circumstantial evidence,the familiar analysis applies.see of,cir.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ada,a plaintiff must show that she engaged in protected conduct,she suffered an adverse employment action,and there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action.freadman,at.if delgado succeeds in making this prima facie showing,the burden then shifts to astrazeneca to offer a legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for its actions,at.if astrazeneca meets its burden,the burden shifts back to delgado to show that the articulated reason was mere pretext.id.delgado bears the ultimate burden to create a plausible inference that the employer had a retaliatory motive.carreras sajo,garcía partners,cir.and,as we have repeatedly explained,e ven in employment discrimination cases where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue,summary judgment is appropriate if the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.ameen,at quoting benoit technical,cir.see also wyeth,cir.
delgado claims on appeal as she did below that her may request for an additional twelve months of leave was protected activity the district court accepted and astrazeneca did not contest delgado position that this leave request constituted protected activity,but it concluded that delgado failed to establish a causal connection between the request for leave and the adverse employment action delgado termination.in the district court view,delgado was terminated on may when cohran sent a letter to delgado instructing her to return to work three days later or else be presumed to have resigned from her employment.because the may request postdated delgado termination,the court reasoned,delgado could not establish the element of her prima facie case.on appeal,the parties stake out competing positions in favor of and against the district court conclusion.
we need not enter this fray,however.instead,we assume without deciding that delgado established her prima facie case of retaliation.see,at employing similar approach carreras,at same.and we readily conclude that astrazeneca has met its burden of offering a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for delgado termination.in fact,it offers two such reasons that delgado was terminated after her position was eliminated and that she went on std leave from which she did not return once it expired.astrazeneca repeatedly informed delgado that she would be presumed to have resigned from her employment with astrazeneca if she failed to return to work after her std benefits were terminated,and yet she failed to return to work as instructed on may.further,as explained below,the deposition testimony of cohran,martínez,and elsa saavedra saavedra,another astrazeneca supervisor,supports the notion that delgado territory and position were eliminated in reorganizations.
therefore,we now consider whether delgado can shoulder her ultimate burden of demonstrating that these articulated justifications were pretextual.to establish pretext she must show that the explanation s were lie s,which would let a factfinder infer that astrazeneca made the story up to cover its tracks,at.delgado makes several attempts to show pretext,but none persuades.
delgado first claims that the reasons given by astrazeneca for her termination elimination of position,failure to return to work,and resignation are inconsistent.we disagree.for starters,we see no inconsistency between the justification and the resignation justification on these facts.the may letter from cohran to delgado warned i f you do not return to work by thursday,may,you will be presumed to have resigned your employment with astrazeneca.emphasis added.similarly,cohran may letter reminded delgado y ou were to have returned to work by thursday,may,or you would be presumed to have resigned your employment with astrazeneca.thus,the letters,using language similar to that contained in the std policy,equated delgado failure to return to work with her presumed resignation.therefore,the fact that martínez,who filled out astrazeneca termination details form for delgado,entered that delgado resignation notice was turned in on may is unremarkable by not showing up to work on may as instructed,she was presumed to have resigned under the terms of the may letter 
nor do we agree that astrazeneca other stated justification for terminating delgado that her position was eliminated in a reorganization is inconsistent with the justification.to be sure,an employee can establish pretext by showing weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons such that a factfinder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted nondiscriminatory reasons.carreras,at emphasis omitted quoting centennial wireless,cir.see also,at.but delgado has failed to do so here.
the may termination letter first recounted the consequences of delgado failure to return to work.it then stated however,due to a recent reorganization in field sales,we are making a offer of severance to you.this reorganization was also referenced in the july letter,which provided as outlined in my letter dated may,due to a recent reorganization in field sales your position was eliminated and you were made an offer for a severance.although the elimination of her position was not referenced in the may letter,these two letters were consistent in the reference to a reorganization in field sales and the resultant severance offer.see,at.and delgado has not given us any basis to conclude that each termination letter had to give every reason astrazeneca had for terminating her.id.at.there is simply nothing contradictory,incoherent,implausible,or inconsistent in these two different legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for her termination a t the very least,the rationales are not so inconsistent as to be unworthy of credence,which is the test.id.at quoting hodgens dynamics,cir.
for similar reasons,we reject delgado argument that astrazeneca has,at various points in this litigation,offered inconsistent justifications for her termination.in support of this contention,delgado notes that astrazeneca relied on its justification in its answer to delgado complaint,its representations in the joint memorandum,and its answers to interrogatories,relied on its justification in its motion for summary judgment,and relied on both justifications in its appellate brief.but because,for reasons already explained,we perceive no inconsistency between these two justifications,we fail to see how astrazeneca reliance on one or the other in various documents through the course of this litigation renders these rationales so inconsistent as to be unworthy of credence.id.quoting hodgens,at.
delgado second pretext argument is grounded in astrazeneca policy.starting from the premise that an employer inadequately explained material deviation from standard procedure can establish a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the employer stated justifications are pretextual,see novartis,cir,delgado identifies two instances of astrazeneca failure to follow its applicable std policy that delgado was not placed in an unpaid extended disability leave,an option under astrazeneca std policy when an employee exhausts his or her std benefits and is still unable to return to work cohran unauthorized selection of a date,a task reserved for the chs case manager,in consultation with an employee treating physician after the physician approves the employee return to work.we are unpersuaded.
the provision relating to ltd benefits and unpaid extended disability leave is contained in a section entitled employment status after exhausting std benefits.consistent with this title,this section applies only to a n employee who is unable to return to work due to continuing disability after exhausting the full weeks of available std benefits.emphasis added.delgado did not exhaust her benefits,however.instead,chs terminated them after invoking its right under a separate section of the policy to terminate benefits when it determines that the employee is no longer totally disabled or the employee failed to submit adequate supporting documentation,and delgado did not challenge the termination of her benefits through the appeals procedure set forth in the policy and communicated to her in the letter.
delgado attempt to show pretext through cohran selection of her date fares no better because astrazeneca std policy is not as as delgado believes.although the policy contains a section section outlining the procedure and specifying that p rior to returning to work,the employee must submit to the chs case manager a completed physician s tatement,the policy also provides in a separate section section that,i f std benefits are suspended or denied and the employee does not return to work,the employee may be considered to have abandoned the employee job and be subject to immediate termination from employment.the policy is not clear on the need for a completed physician statement and the applicability of section where,as here,astrazeneca suspends an employee benefits under section even when the employee physician requests that the employee remain out of work 
delgado position that,even in this scenario,a date can not be established absent a statement from the employee doctor that the employee is safely able to return to work would allow a recalcitrant physician to remain steadfast in his or her opposition to astrazeneca benefits denial or termination,refuse to authorize the employee return to work,and thereby singlehandedly render section a nullity.we need not decide whether delgado interpretation of the policy language is erroneous it suffices that,because it is not clear that cohran selection of the date actually violated the policy in these circumstances,it does not create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether astrazeneca stated justifications for firing delgado were pretextual.
delgado third pretext argument asserts that astrazeneca stated justification that her position had been eliminated as part of the reorganization is completely false.relying on deposition testimony of martínez and saavedra,delgado insists that the reorganization eliminated her territory but not her position.this false justification,delgado argues,shows that astrazeneca justifications are pretextual.this argument rests on a flawed starting premise.
although martínez and saavedra did indeed discuss a reorganization involving the elimination of delgado territory,cohran discussed a second,separate reorganization in his deposition.according to cohran,in this second reorganization,the floating position to which delgado had been assigned as a result of the elimination of her territory in the first reorganization was itself eliminated.although astrazeneca noted this aspect of cohran testimony in its brief to this court,delgado failed to effectively address this testimony in either her opening or reply brief,and we say it again it is not our responsibility to dig through the record in the hopes of unearthing some nugget that creates a genuine dispute of material fact.see belsito commc ns,at.therefore,given delgado failure to address cohran deposition testimony that her position was eliminated in a second reorganization,it effectively stands unrebutted on appeal and compels us to reject delgado assertion that astrazeneca reorganization justification is completely false.
that leaves delgado argument about the temporal proximity between the may request for twelve more months of leave and the may termination letter.although such close temporal proximity may suffice for a prima facie case of retaliation,it does not,standing alone,satisfy delgado ultimate burden to establish that the true explanation for her firing was retaliation for engaging in protected conduct rather than the reasons articulated by astrazeneca.carreras,at.and we reiterate that,although the pretext inquiry entails consideration of elusive concepts,ameen,at,summary judgment may still be appropriate on that issue,see,at.
and it is in this case delgado can not shoulder her ultimate burden of showing pretext,and the district court therefore properly granted summary judgment to astrazeneca on delgado ada retaliation claim.
remaining claims 
now that we addressed delgado ada claims,we finally turn briefly to her claims sounding in puerto rico law.she asserts claims under three puerto rico statutes law,article,and law.we address each claim in turn.
we can make quick work of the first of these claims as delgado appropriately concedes,law and the ada are coterminous.ruiz rivera pfizer,llc,cir.therefore,because we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment on delgado ada claim,we affirm the entry of summary judgment on her law claim for the same reasons.see id.
we next examine delgado article claims.as we read her complaint,she asserts two article claims,one for negligence and the other for tortious infliction of emotional distress.we easily affirm the district court entry of summary judgment on delgado claim that astrazeneca in delgado words was negligent by not adhering to the requirements of law and the ada in accommodating the plaintiff in accordance with her doctor certifications.even assuming that such a claim is cognizable under article and we express no opinion on this issue delgado failure to prevail on her ada and law claims dooms her negligence claim premised on astrazeneca violation of those statutes.
with respect to delgado article claim,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of astrazeneca because the conduct underlying that claim was the same conduct that was arguably covered by the ada,law,and the fmla and,to the extent a specific labor or employment statute covers the conduct for which a plaintiff seeks damages,she is barred from using the same conduct to also bring a claim for damages under article.
in challenging the district court entry of summary judgment on appeal,delgado argument is not a model of clarity.indeed,it is tough for us to discern precisely what she is arguing,but we do the best we can.the main thrust of her argument seems to be that she alleged specific conduct that supports her tort action independent from her other claims.
but delgado has not told us what that specific other conduct is or explained how it is independent from the conduct giving rise to her other claims.according to the complaint,the conduct giving rise to her article claim consisted of various negative actions on the part of astrazeneca a fter plaintiff disclosed her diagnosis to her supervisor,including constant pressures to return to work while on a valid leave,threats of termination,ignor ing her doctor recommendations,and continued harassment.no real specifics were provided.similarly,in her briefing both below and on appeal,delgado makes vague references to cohran undue and unreasonable interference with delgado treatment and cohran negligent and reckless intervention without explaining how this conduct is independent from that giving rise to her other claims.she simply has not pointed to any record support for her assertion that her article claim is premised on independent conduct,and we reject it for that reason.
all that remains of delgado article arguments on appeal is the following cryptic assertion it is well settled that to the extent that the facts that comprise the actions executed against the plaintiff are not covered by the employment statutes,article must provide.the meaning of this sentence is not readily apparent.in support of this assertion,delgado cited rios municipality of guaynabo,supp.we suspect that delgado might have intended her cryptically phrased sentence and citation to rios to constitute an argument that,if astrazeneca conduct is not covered by the various employment and discrimination statutes undergirding her other claims by virtue of the district court entry of summary judgment on those claims,then her article claims necessarily survive.see id.declining to enter summary judgment on article and claims premised on the same conduct that gave rise to the retaliation claims for which summary judgment entered for defendants because such potentially tortious claims are no longer covered by any specific labor law.
the problem for delgado,however,is that j udges are not expected to be mindreaders.consequently,a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly,or else forever hold its peace.zannino,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting rivera gomez de castro,cir.see also town of norwood fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir.d eveloping a sustained argument out of legal precedents is the job of the appellant,not the reviewing court,as we have previously warned.delgado has failed to do her part with respect to this article argument.the combination of a single,confusing sentence and an unexplained citation to a case that offers an unsupported and unauthoritative view of the scope of article is no substitute for developed argumentation.see zannino,at i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.see also united states bulger,cir.explaining that we consider waived arguments confusingly constructed and lacking in coherence and declining to consider argument where litigant fail ed to provide us with intelligible analysis,or case law,to support his claim internal quotation marks omitted quoting rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir.therefore,we decline to consider this undeveloped argument.
because delgado has not presented us with a developed,coherent,and convincing argument for overturning the district court entry of summary judgment in astrazeneca favor on her article claims,we affirm on this issue.
that leaves delgado law claim for wrongful discharge.law provides a remedy to employees who are discharged without just cause.laws ann.tit,see also pérez horizon lines,cir.it employs the following framework one different from that applied in the ada context the employee must show that he or she has been discharged and allege that the dismissal was not justified the burden then shifts to the employer to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the dismissal was justified and if the employer shoulders that burden,the employee must rebut the showing of good cause.pérez,at.in this case,delgado has met her initial burden she has shown that she has been terminated and alleged in her complaint that her termination was not justified.
moving on to astrazeneca burden,law specifies several grounds that are considered good cause for termination,including t he employee repeated violations of the reasonable rules and regulations established for the operation of the establishment,provided a written copy thereof has been opportunely furnished to the employee,laws ann.tit,c,as well as three other grounds that relate to company restructuring or downsizing.am.airlines,cir.see also laws ann.tit,d f.the statute also provides that a discharge made by the mere whim of the employer or without cause relative to the proper and normal operation of the establishment shall not be considered as a discharge for good cause.laws ann.tit.
in order to shoulder its burden of establishing just cause,astrazeneca need only demonstrate that it had a reasonable basis to believe that delgado has engaged in one of those actions that the law identifies as establishing such cause.pérez,at.a just discharge,we have said,is one where an employer provides a considered,reason for an employee termination that bears some relationship to the business operation.id.this inquiry focuses not on the objective veracity of the employer action but instead on the employer reasonable belief even a perceived violation suffices to establish that the employer did not terminate the employee on a whim,but rather for a sensible reason.id.at quoting hoyos telecorp commc ns,cir.
for reasons we explained in our discussion of delgado retaliation claim,astrazeneca has shouldered its burden here by offering two potential bases for a finding of a termination her failure to return to work after termination of her std benefits and the elimination of her position.both of these reasons are considered,and bear some relationship to astrazeneca business operation.see id.at.therefore,a reasonable jury could only conclude that astrazeneca has met its burden of showing just cause.id.at.
because astrazeneca satisfied its burden,delgado can defeat summary judgment only if she can rebut astrazeneca showing.id.to shoulder her burden,delgado must do more than show that astrazeneca may have gotten some of the particulars wrong.instead,delgado had the burden to adduce probative evidence that astrazeneca did not genuinely believe in or did not in fact terminate delgado for the reason s given.id.at.to this end,delgado offers several reasons why,she contends,astrazeneca reasons are pretextual.see collazo,at vacating summary judgment on employee law claims because genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether employee termination was the result of retaliatory animus,rather than company reorganization and inadequate performance but we already considered and rejected each of these contentions in the course of affirming the entry of summary judgment on delgado retaliation claim.thus,for the same reasons,we conclude that delgado has failed to shoulder her burden to proceed to trial on her law claim.
conclusion 
for these reasons,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment in astrazeneca favor.each party shall bear its own costs.
delgado sued astrazeneca pharmaceutical lp and astrazeneca lp.taking our cue from delgado complaint,we refer to both entities collectively as astrazeneca.
a quick primer on that policy it provides full or partial income replacement for eligible employees during brief periods of disability,including disability due to mental illness,provided that the employee submits the medical information necessary to substantiate the benefits claim to the company corporate health services department chs.chs is tasked with approving or disapproving a request for benefits and,in the event of approval,determining how long benefits will be paid.the policy also declares that t he maximum period of time for which std benefits are payable is weeks for any single period of disability.after this window closes,the employee may be eligible for disability ltd benefits or an unpaid extended disability leave.however,chs can terminate benefits prior to the expiration of the period where,among other scenarios,it determines that the employee is no longer disabled or the employee fails to submit the necessary supporting documentation.the policy warns that,if benefits are suspended or denied and the employee does not return to work,the employee may be considered to have abandoned the employee job and be subject to immediate termination from employment.
from here on out,all specified dates are from the year unless otherwise noted.
we note that the record is not crystal clear on when sánchez faxed this documentation to astrazeneca.although a form that sánchez faxed to astrazeneca is dated may and sánchez testified in his deposition that he submitted the form on behalf of delgado on may,delgado states in her opening brief to this court that sánchez sent the form to astrazeneca o n may.additionally,as far as we can tell,the record does not reflect precisely when on may sánchez faxed this documentation to astrazeneca.the closest we can come to pinpointing that time is to note that,at,an astrazeneca occupational health nurse sent cohran an email explaining that she had reviewed the form and determined that it did not support reinstating delgado benefits.given the manner in which we resolve this appeal,we need not grapple with any uncertainty of when astrazeneca received the documentation.
sánchez later testified at his deposition that this entry was meant to convey his estimate that it would have been may,at a minimum,before delgado would be able to work and that his expectation was for her to resolve her problems and be able to return to work in months.
delgado also asserted claims of environment,interference with and retaliation for requesting leave under the family and medical leave act fmla,see,age discrimination in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,see id,and puerto rico law,as well as a claim for violation of puerto rico act.because delgado either withdrew these claims at the level or has not addressed the district court entry of summary judgment on these claims in her briefing before this court,however,we need not discuss these claims or the facts giving rise to them.
indeed,she concedes in her reply brief that she was unable to work at the time she was on leave,and at the time she requested an extension of her leave.
we have also recognized that a plaintiff may sometimes be able to establish the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation by showing it is a method of accommodation that is feasible in the run of cases,although we also added that this will not always be so.reed,at.
the record is unclear on whether delgado was seeking paid or unpaid leave.at oral argument,delgado counsel suggested that her client was seeking paid leave,although she also seemed to suggest that delgado had made payroll contributions to the source of the funds that would be used to pay for that leave.given this lurking uncertainty about the true nature of the leave requested,we assume,favorably to delgado,that she requested unpaid leave.
as delgado points out,the district court erroneously stated in its decision that sánchez asserted that the expected duration of delgado need for additional leave was for more than a year.actually,sánchez had indicated on the form he faxed to astrazeneca that the p robable duration of delgado condition was more than one year.emphasis added.in a separate section of the form asking for an estimate of the beginning and ending dates for the period of delgado incapacity,sánchez wrote months.emphasis added.so,sánchez did not indicate that delgado needed additional leave for more than one year.but,as we view things,the district court mistake is immaterial.jones,at while we agree with jones that several of the facts stated in the district court opinion are mistaken,none of those facts is material to our analysis.
relatedly,delgado brief appears to suggest that the request for twelve additional months of leave was reasonable simply because sánchez specified this number and his past treatment of delgado was effective.this suggestion to the extent delgado intended to make it is a nonstarter.as we explained in reed,an employee can not establish the reasonableness of the requested accommodation simply by showing that the accommodation will be effective,that it will allow the employee to perform the essential functions of her position instead,a plaintiff must also show that the accommodation is facially reasonable.see at rejecting eeoc argument that the only burden a plaintiff has on proving reasonable accommodation is to show that the accommodation would effectively enable her to perform her job because proving an accommodation effectiveness is part of the plaintiff burden,but it is not the whole and adopting instead a burden requiring plaintiff to show both an accommodation effectiveness and its facial reasonableness.
we note that,in addition to the form that sánchez signed on may and faxed to astrazeneca on may,delgado submitted two pages of sánchez treatment records,dated may,as a separate exhibit to support her opposition to astrazeneca motion for summary judgment.it is not clear whether these records accompanied the form that sánchez faxed to astrazeneca.even if they did,however,we see nothing in these two pages of medical records that contains any suggestion that delgado would be able to return to work in twelve months time.the astrazeneca occupational health nurse who reviewed whatever documents sánchez faxed to astrazeneca concluded that the documentation did not support reinstatement of delgado std benefits,and delgado has not pointed us to anything specific in the record to rebut that assessment.
hwang was a rehabilitation act case,not an ada case.see at.this matters not at all,however,because t he same standards apply to claims under the ada and under the rehabilitation act.t of justice,cir.
importantly,this does not mean that a plaintiff must show the absence of an undue hardship.the burden to show undue hardship always remains with the employer.reed,at.but where,as here,the costs of an accommodation are relatively obvious where they really are what they appear to be on the face of things plaintiff burden and defendant burden may in application be quite similar,even to the extent of being mirror images.id.at.
we note that each written notice that astrazeneca sent delgado explaining that her std benefits had been terminated clearly informed her of the company appeals process.for example,the may letter informed delgado that,i f you disagree with this decision,you may file an appeal with the administrator of the std policy or astrazeneca std administrative committee,and provided her with contact information for those entities.there is nothing in the record to suggest that delgado ever utilized this appeals procedure.similarly,the record does not reflect whether delgado ever pressed an erisa claim for benefits under either the std or ltd plans she presses no such claim in the case before us.
in her reply brief,delgado asserts that the leave request was for five additional months.but this assertion,too,is incorrect.we plainly stated in that the leave that garcía requested on june was for less than two months.at.we then noted that t he district court viewed the request as being for five months and explained in dictum that,e ven if the request were for an additional five months of unpaid leave,the result would not change.id.
in a single sentence in connection with this argument,delgado stated that an astrazeneca employee testified during a deposition that the accounts of plaintiff new assigned territory were already being visited by other pharmaceutical sales specialists.to the extent that delgado intended this observation to be part of her effort to show that the requested accommodation was facially reasonable in these circumstances as opposed to part of her misguided effort to criticize astrazeneca for its failure to put forth evidence of undue hardship,it is far too undeveloped to warrant our consideration.see united states zannino,cir.warning litigants that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.
delgado also raises a procedural objection to the district court consideration of this claim in the first place.because astrazeneca failed to address this claim in its initial memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment,delgado protests,the district court should not have considered its argument raised for the first time in its reply that it was entitled to summary judgment on this claim.although it true that courts routinely preclude a litigant from raising new arguments in a reply brief,this rule is not inflexible courts retain discretion to excuse parties from procedural gaffes such as this.united states,cir.recognizing that courts may excuse waivers and disregard stipulations where justice so requires.and we discern no abuse of discretion here.delgado complaint set forth seven separately titled causes of action,and failure to engage in an interactive process was not one of them.instead,that claim comprised two paragraphs within her first cause of action,which she labeled ada and law disability discrimination wrongful termination failure to accommodate.in these circumstances,the district court was not obligated to deem astrazeneca initial oversight inexcusable.moreover,delgad
