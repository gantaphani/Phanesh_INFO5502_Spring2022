plaintiffs here are individuals who contracted with defendant fedex ground package system,fedex to provide mile and delivery services.they claim that fedex should have treated and paid them as employees in certain respects,rather than as independent contractors,because fedex can not satisfy all three necessary requirements under the massachusetts independent contractor statute.laws ch,a the massachusetts statute.we find that the express preemption provision of the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaaa,c,preempts the application of one of those requirements to fedex.we also find that the preempted requirement is severable from the two remaining requirements of the massachusetts statute,and we remand for further consideration of whether plaintiffs may prevail on their claims under massachusetts law by relying on either of those requirements.
relevant facts 
fedex is a federally registered motor carrier that is licensed to provide nationwide package,transportation,and delivery services.as relevant to the claims in this case,fedex did not itself customarily perform what is called mile and delivery services to customers.instead,it contracted with individuals such as plaintiffs whom it treated as independent contractors to perform these services.fedex relationship with these individuals was governed by an operating agreement oa.
under the oa,each individual contractor acquired an exclusive and transferable interest in customer accounts located in a designated geographical area in return for assuming the responsibility of providing daily and delivery services for fedex in that area.the oa contemplated that such services may be performed by persons other than the individual contractor,and established a financial structure by which the contractors were compensated.the oa also provided that fedex shall not have authority to prescribe hours of work,whether or when the contractor is to take breaks,what route the contractor is to follow,or other details of performance.the contractor bore all costs and expenses incurred in providing the and delivery services,including but not limited to those associated with obtaining and using a suitable vehicle,fuel,compliant communications equipment,uniforms,and insurance.at least some of these costs and expenses were defrayed through forms of supplemental compensation paid to the contractor under the oa financial structure.
plaintiffs contend that fedex misclassified them as independent contractors and seek damages for loss of wages,improper wage deductions,and loss of benefits under the massachusetts statute and the massachusetts wage act the wage act.laws ch,as well as attorneys fees 
the relevant text of the massachusetts statute provides that an individual performing any service shall be considered to be an employee unless 
the individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service,both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact and 
the service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer and,
the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade,occupation,profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.

procedural history 
after discovery and a few procedural skirmishes,plaintiffs pursued a motion for partial summary judgment arguing that they were misclassified as independent contractors because fedex failed to satisfy prongs and of the massachusetts statute.fedex opposed the motion by arguing that there existed genuine issues of material fact relevant to whether plaintiffs were employees of fedex under prongs and.fedex also filed its own summary judgment motion requesting dismissal of all counts.in its memorandum in support of that motion,fedex argued that all of plaintiffs claims were preempted by the faaaa.
in reply to plaintiffs opposition to its summary judgment motion,fedex scaled back the scope of its preemption argument,eschewing any argument that prongs and of the massachusetts statute were preempted.fedex,rather,clarified in its reply brief that its motion instead is based on the specific,and unique,effects of usual course of business factor,while reminding the court that it had expressly stated in its initial brief that it does not oppose severance of the usual course of business factor from if that factor is deemed to be preempted.therefore,argued fedex,if the usual course of business factor is found preempted and the court finds it to be severable,then summary judgment on that factor should be granted and the case would proceed to trial on the issues of whether plaintiffs were employees of fedex under prongs and.
the district court initially granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment under prong.schwann fedex ground package,wl,at.july.it found that fedex could not satisfy prong because the and delivery services performed by plaintiffs were not outside fedex usual course of business.id.at.the district court also held that the massachusetts statute was not preempted by the express preemption provision of the faaaa because the state law did not sufficiently relate to fedex prices,routes,or services,and did not concern a motor carrier transportation of property.id.at 
the district court then certified several state law questions concerning damages under the wage act to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc and stayed the case pending a response.during the time the case was stayed,we decided massachusetts delivery ass coakley,cir mda.in mda,we reversed and remanded a district court decision that had found prong not preempted by the faaaa.id.at.we ruled that the district court in that case had applied an unduly narrow interpretation of the faaaa express preemption provision.id.
the district court in this case then called for supplemental briefing to address both the import of mda and plaintiffs summary judgment arguments under prong of the massachusetts statute.in their opening supplemental brief,plaintiffs argued that our decision in mda did not affect the district court finding that the massachusetts statute was not preempted by the faaaa.plaintiffs also argued that,even were prong preempted,the court should find on summary judgment that they were employees of fedex based on prong in its opening supplemental brief,fedex argued that mda required the court to vacate its previous ruling of and to find that prong was preempted fedex also disputed plaintiffs interpretation of prong and reiterated that there existed genuine issues of material fact relevant to whether plaintiffs were employees of fedex under that prong.then,in its reply to plaintiffs supplemental brief,fedex argued for the first time that prong,if preempted,was not severable from the remainder of the massachusetts statute.
thereafter the district court issued a second decision on the parties summary judgment motions in which it withdrew its prior opinion insofar as it granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on count i and granted fedex summary judgment on all counts.schwann fedex ground package,wl,at.tracking mda,the district court emphasized that a statute potential impact on carriers prices,routes,and services can be sufficient to trigger preemption if it is significant,rather than tenuous,remote,or peripheral,and that this impact need not by proven by empirical evidence,but may be proven by the logical effect that a particular scheme has on the delivery of services.id.at quoting mda,at.after considering such logical if indirect effects,the district court found that the massachusetts statute unquestionably ha s an impact on price,route s,and services by in effect proscribing the carrier preferred business model,id.second and third alterations in original quoting c the district court thus found that prong was preempted by the faaaa.id.at.
the district court next turned to plaintiffs summary judgment arguments under prong.id.it held that prong was not severable from the massachusetts statute as a whole because the court has no way of knowing whether the legislature would have chosen to rewrite the statute less restrictively to consist of only the first and third prongs,and thus the entire statute must be treated as preempted.id.the district court then added,sua sponte,a conclusion that fedex itself was not advocating that application of prongs and against motor carriers would also be preempted by the faaaa because motor carriers would be impacted by forbidding the preferred business model.id.
plaintiffs appealed.we now review the district court preemption and severability holdings de novo.see mda,at.
the faaaa express preemption provision provides that all state laws that relate to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property are preempted.c.congress,in writing the portion of this clause that is pertinent to this appeal,copied the language of the preemption clause of the airline deregulation act of ada,b.rowe motor transp.ass n,d.it did so in order to adopt the broad preemption interpretation of the ada adopted by the united states supreme court in morales trans world airlines,d.id.citing conf,at.as we observed in mda,the resulting scope of faaaa preemption is therefore both informed by interpretations of ada preemption and,like ada preemption,is purposely expansive.mda,at.
the supreme court has identified the dual objectives that account for this broad reach to ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,rowe,u.at quoting morales,at and to avoid a patchwork of state laws,rules,and regulations,id.at.in this manner,congress sought to help ensure transportation rates,routes,and services that reflect maximum reliance on competitive market forces,thereby stimulating efficiency,innovation,and low prices,as well as variety and quality.id.at quoting morales,at.
section c preemption may therefore occur even if a state law effect on rates,routes,or services is only indirect,id.at quoting morales,at,and applies at least where state laws have a significant impact related to congress deregulatory and objectives,id.at quoting morales,at.we summarized these principles in mda by explaining that a state statute is preempted if it expressly references,or has a significant impact on,carriers prices,routes,or services.mda,at.
congress itself acknowledged the breadth of this language by perceiving a need to include paragraph c of the statute to restrict from its otherwise broad preemptive scope certain specified areas traditionally governed by the states,such as the safety regulatory authority of a state with respect to motor vehicles and the authority of a state to impose highway route controls or limitations.c.the supreme court has explained that t he exceptions to c general rule of preemption identify matters a state may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded from doing so.dan city used cars,pelkey,d.
there is,of course,a necessary limit to the scope of faaaa preemption.mda,at.after all,in a broad sense,everything relates to everything else in some manner.see state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d if relate to were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,then for all practical purposes would never run its course.case law therefore excludes from the otherwise broad reach of c those state laws that have only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral impact on prices,routes,or services.see rowe,at quoting morales,at.as examples of such unpreempted laws,the supreme court has pointed to laws against gambling and prostitution,morales,at,and state regulation that broadly prohibits certain forms of conduct and affects,say,truckdrivers,only in their capacity as members of the public,a prohibition on smoking in certain public places,rowe at.these examples demonstrate both that there is a limit to the preemptive scope of c and that one must move quite far afield to confidently reach that limit.see difiore am.airlines,cir.exactly where the boundary lies between permissible and impermissible state regulation is not entirely clear.
in mda,the district court failed to apply this broad interpretation of c in finding that,based on facts similar to those in this case,prong effects did not sufficiently impact a motor carrier prices,routes,or services.mda,at.in our decision vacating the district court order,we noted that a statute potential impact on carriers prices,routes,and services need not be proven by empirical evidence rather,courts may look to the logical effect that a particular scheme has on the delivery of services.id.at alteration in original quoting motor transp.ass rowe,cir,aff,rowe,d.this logical effect,we said,can be sufficient even if indirect so that motor carriers can be immunized from state regulations that threaten to unravel congress purposeful deregulation in this area.id.because the district court in mda ultimately based its holding on an erroneous finding that c with respect to the transportation of property requirement had not been satisfied,we remanded that case to the district court so that it could decide,consistent with our opinion,whether the related to standard was met.id.at.
we now pick up where mda left off,as we have a district court considered application of c related to standard to prong of the massachusetts statute.we begin by defining precisely the question before us.whether prong is facially preempted in the abstract is not the question.unlike the provisions of the maine state statute in rowe specifically targeting the services provided by tobacco carriers,at,the massachusetts statute is a generally applicable law regulating the relationships between businesses and persons who perform services for those businesses.laws ch,a.thus,our preemption analysis in this case trains instead upon the manner in which prong of the massachusetts statute would apply to fedex operations.in this respect,our inquiry is analogous to that undertaken by the supreme court in northwest,ginsberg,d,where the question before it was not whether the state common law implied covenant theory was facially preempted,but whether ada preemption precluded the plaintiffs from employing that theory to add to the terms of a contract governing an airline frequent flyer program,id.at.
plaintiffs successful reliance on prong in this case would necessarily require that we first look at the service performed by plaintiffs on behalf of fedex,that we next determine that that service is not outside the usual course of the business of fedex,and that we then,in substance,bar fedex from using any individuals as independent contractors to perform that service.see.laws ch,a.for the following reasons,we find that prong,if applied in this way,would relate to the service of a motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c.
for starters,we observe the directly referential relationship between plaintiffs application of prong and fedex motor carrier services.by honing in on a service and then directing the court to determine whether that service fits within the usual course of business of fedex,see.laws a,prong requires a judicial determination of the extent and types of motor carrier services that fedex provides.the text of prong as applied in this w
