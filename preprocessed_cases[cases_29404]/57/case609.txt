appellee uni√≥n de tronquistas de puerto rico,local the union,represents a group of united parcel service ups employees who claim that the company owes them back wages for unpaid vacation time.the unpaid vacation consists primarily of days that accrued under expired collective bargaining agreements.when the union submitted the claim to arbitration,ups contended that the arbitrator could not adjudicate such claims.the arbitrator concluded otherwise,ruling that the claims could proceed.the district court refused to vacate the arbitration award,relying on the well established principle of deference to arbitrators rulings.on appeal,the company argues that the district court utilized the wrong standard of review and misapplied the law on survival of arbitration provisions.although we find legal error in the court approach,we conclude that it correctly left the dispute in the hands of the arbitrator.we therefore affirm its dismissal of the case.
background 
ups and the union have been parties to a series of collective bargaining agreements dating back to at least,each of which included a comprehensive procedure for handling employee grievances and broadly provided for arbitration of disputes.the union submitted the grievance in this case to arbitration in march,seeking compensation for accrued vacation time on behalf of dozens of employees.the employees assert that ups in erased vacation time they had accumulated before that year.the collective bargaining agreement then in effect covered the period between august,and july.most,if not all,of the alleged vacation leave at issue had accrued,however,under prior collective bargaining agreements.ups position is that the obligation to arbitrate the dispute over that vacation pay expired when the earlier agreements expired,and,indeed,the company appears to contend that the employees have retained no right at all to pursue claims arising from the earlier agreements 
the arbitrator,however,ruled that she had the authority to order payment of any compensation determined to be owed.in dismissing ups petition to vacate the arbitration award,the district court observed that it was obliged to enforce the award as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.opinion and order at internal citation omitted.the court found no flaw in the arbitrator award and accordingly entered judgment in the union favor.
on appeal,ups argues that the court made a pivotal error at the outset of its inquiry by implicitly deferring to the arbitrator on the threshold question of arbitrability.the company maintains that it was up to the court to decide in the first instance whether the arbitrator was empowered to decide the employees vacation dispute,and it therefore asserts that the district court first step should have been to consider that issue de novo.
ups goes on to argue that,had the court properly assumed its authority to make the threshold arbitrability determination,it should have found the dispute on the grounds asserted,that the applicable arbitration provision expired along with the rest of the prior collective bargaining agreement and that the arbitrator had no authority under the current agreement to delve into the issue.in brief,ups argument is that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction under any agreement to entertain the union claim on behalf of the employees.
we agree with ups that the district court should have made the initial decision on arbitrability.the district court apparently thought of this as a case requiring interpretation of the contract and therefore a matter for determination in the first instance by the arbitrator.but w hether or not a company is bound to arbitrate is a matter to be determined by the court,litton fin.printing div,d citing at t,communications workers,d see also howsam dean witter reynolds,d a gateway dispute about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause raises a question of arbitrability for a court to decide.such a duty must be performed even though it may require the court to interpret a bargaining agreement provision.see litton,at.because we conclude,however,that the arbitrator does have authority to resolve the vacation pay dispute,the court threshold error was harmless.we explain below the legal and factual foundation for that conclusion.
ii.discussion 
as we have noted,ups maintains that the vacation pay dispute may not be arbitrated because there is no applicable arbitration provision the one in the current collective bargaining agreement does not apply to benefits accrued before that agreement took effect,and the one that existed when the asserted benefits accrued has since expired.in our view,the case law is to the contrary.
in litton,the supreme court confirmed that a presumption exists in favor of postexpiration arbitration of matters unless negated expressly or by clear implication in the collective bargaining agreement.at.quoting nolde,bakery workers,d.the presumption is limited by a vital qualification the arbitration must concern matters and disputes arising out of the relation governed by the contract.id.a dispute can be said to arise under the contract 
only where it involves facts and occurrences that arose before expiration,where an action taken after expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement,or where,under normal principles of contract interpretation,the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.
id.at.our inquiry is thus we must determine if the particular dispute has its real source in the contract,id.at,and if so,we must consider whether postexpiration arbitration of the issue was negated expressly or by clear implication.
ups confusingly blends these two inquiries in its brief,and offers its argument on whether the disputed vacation time accrued under the prior agreement only in cursory fashion,embedded within its discussion of the arbitration clause survivability.nonetheless,viewing its effort generously,we consider ups implicit assertion that article of the collective bargaining agreement titled vacation resolves the first prong of the inquiry in its favor.we focus,as did the parties,specifically on whether the dispute involves a right that accrued or vested under the agreement.
section of article provides that e arned vacation will be taken each year.the section goes on to state that o nly one year earned vacation can be taken in each calendar year.ups maintains that the combined force of the clear and unequivocal language in these two statements confirms that vacation time does not accrue from year to year and likewise could not accrue from one collective bargaining agreement to the next.
in our view,ups overstates the reach of section.that vacations may be taken only in the year earned does not necessarily foreclose the employees from seeking compensation for unused,accrued vacation time.the idea of pay in lieu of vacation time is incorporated,in fact,in the collective bargaining agreement,which allows employees to elect pay instead of time off for all days in excess of ten vacation days.see article,section.the lack of an explicit paid vacation option in the earlier agreement does not negate its possible existence as a matter of practice indeed,the provision in the later agreement may have been added to reflect just such a practice.we thus reject the notion that the limitation on when vacation time may be enjoyed leads inevitably to the conclusion that vacation time not taken as specified is lost entirely.
the nature of earned vacation time,moreover,is materially different from the contractual right that the supreme court ruled did not vest or accrue in favor of the employees in litton.at issue there was the right to seniority in the case of layoffs.the agreement specified that layoffs would be based on aptitude and ability,as well as seniority.the supreme court observed that aptitude and ability do not remain constant,but change over time,and that the layoff provision there consequently can not be said to create a right that vested or accrued during the term of the agreement or a contractual o
