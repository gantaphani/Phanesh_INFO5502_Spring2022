torruella,circuit judge.nilda rodríguez appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of vida.the district court reviewed and sustained denial of rodríguez claim for disability ltd benefits under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.because the plan contained no clear delegation of authority to,we hold that decision was not entitled to deference.accordingly,we reverse and remand to the district court to decide the case under the de novo standard of review.
factual background 
the following facts have been drawn largely from the district court opinion in this case.
rodríguez history 
rodríguez,a licensed chemist,worked as a senior control laboratory supervisor for mova pharmaceutical corporation mova from to.her job required her to perform some physical activity,such as standing,walking,bending,reaching,lifting,carrying,and writing.
rodríguez first started to experience symptoms on march,which was also her last day of work and was then diagnosed with several physical and mental conditions.she was prescribed medications to mitigate some of the symptoms.she subsequently underwent a series of medical exams and began treatment with héctor cases,a neurologist,in june.cases filled out a functional capacity estimate form on november,where he concluded that she could not work or,even if her employer accommodated her limitations and restrictions.accordingly,rodríguez filed a claim for disability benefits under mova ltd plan.
plan provisions 
mova ltd plan is an employee welfare benefits plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.life insurance company originally issued a group policy the plan to mova.the summary plan description spd named mova as the plan sponsor and administrator,and stated that t he plan sponsor is granted the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the plan.
under the plan,the forms to claim benefits and proof of loss for a disability were to be submitted to.had the right,at its own expense,to examine the claimant,when and as often as was reasonably required while the claim was pending.if the claim was wholly or partially denied,would furnish a written notice that stated the specific reasons for the denial and the basis in the plan provisions,explain the plan claim review procedures,and describe any additional material or information needed to reconsider the decision.also,an officer designated by would review requests for review of a claim,and would furnish a written decision.
claims that at some point it replaced in the contractual relationship between mova and and that it notified mova that would pay the benefits provided under the plan,subject to all the policy provisions.thereafter,all the things that the plan stated would be performed by were actually performed by triples.the plan,however,was not amended to reflect this change.nor was a new spd or summary of material modifications furnished to plan participants notifying them of this change and naming as claims administrator insurer.
the plan offered ltd benefits due to total disability.to qualify for these benefits,the beneficiary had to comply with the plan definition of total disability or totally disabled and be under a doctor care during the entire time of the total disability.total disability means that you are unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of your occupation on a basis because of disability caused by injury or sickness and that started while you are insured.a beneficiary is totally disabled if she is unable to perform with reasonable continuity all of the material and substantial duties of her own or any other occupation for which she is or become s reasonably fitted by training,education,experience,age,and physical and mental capacity.benefits would be paid when the beneficiary is totally disabled for longer than the applicable elimination period until the earliest of the day the total disability ends,death,or the end of the maximum payment period.for mental illness,however,the plan limited payment of benefits to months 
rodríguez claim for ltd benefits 
received rodríguez application for ltd benefits on january,she claimed to be experiencing various symptoms which rendered her unable to work.she stated that she did not anticipate working in the near future,either in her previous occupation or in any other occupation,and was not interested in getting training or in working in another type of occupation or work activity.
rodríguez claim was initially denied,but it was later approved on administrative appeal once rodríguez supplemented her record with additional evidence.her ltd benefits were granted on october,under the mental illness disability provision of the plan,but it was effective retroactively to september.since the plan provided that disability benefits due to mental illness could be granted for a maximum term of months,rodríguez benefits expired september.rodríguez was not awarded ltd benefits for her physical ailments,but she was notified that her physical condition would be further investigated.
from to,rodríguez was notified on various occasions that her claim for ltd benefits for physical disability was being evaluated,as the plan term for mental illness had expired.during this time period,continued issuing the same monthly disability payments rodríguez had been receiving for her mental illness.on december,the social security administration found rodríguez to be disabled,retroactive to march.rodríguez submitted evidence of her social security claim to.since social security benefits were to be deducted from the amount payable for disability under the plan,requested a refund of all excess ltd benefits.
rodríguez also submitted updated copies of progress notes from her treating physicians,including her rheumatologist and endocrinologist,which stated that she was unable to perform a gainful job since her disability was permanent and total.after further medical exams were performed on rodríguez,her neurologist,cases,filled out additional functional capacity estimate forms on february,and january,where he stated that rodríguez was not able to work or.he certified that rodríguez was completely disabled,that she had reached the maximum medical improvement,and that she was not fit to return to work,despite any work accommodations available for her limitations and restrictions.rodríguez also filled out and submitted various resource questionnaires,in which she stated her symptoms and claimed to be unable to work because her conditions were permanent.
referred rodríguez case to alfonso bello,a rheumatologist,for an independent medical review of her medical file.after reviewing the medical file provided to him,bello concluded that,from a rheumatologic perspective,rodríguez medical record did not support a finding that she suffered from an active and disabling disorder,and,hence,she was not totally disabled.
also referred the case to a vocational specialist for an employability evaluation from a physical standpoint.the vocational specialist found that there were sedentary and light duty occupations,including her previous job,available in the san juan,caguas,and guaynabo metropolitan area,which rodríguez could perform given her education,training,and previous work experience,and that met or exceeded her reasonable wage of per hour.some of these jobs are similar to the work she performed at mova,including technical and supervisory duties in laboratories.
denial of claim and administrative appeal 
on july,denied rodríguez application for ltd benefits,finding she no longer met the plan definition of disabled.according to,her administrative record did not contain enough clinical evidence to support a finding that she was unable to physically perform the tasks of her previous job or any other occupation.also terminated her mental illness disability benefits,as the benefits had been paid beyond the limit allowed by the plan.it did not request reimbursement for the excess benefits paid.
in accordance with the plan internal appeal process,on august,rodríguez administratively appealed triples decision and submitted new evidence,copies of her medical files,and social security documents.rodríguez underwent additional medical exams that suggested deterioration of an injury when compared to the same study conducted in.
referred the case to inocencio cuesta,an internist with a in adult rheumatology,who performed an independent peer review on october.cuesta noted that,although the record sustained subjective evidence of pain and evidence of a rheumatologic condition,there was no objective evidence that indicated these findings impaired rodríguez.he opined that the record contained no clinical information as to how her physical ailments affected her ability to return to work and concluded that rodríguez did not suffer from physical deterioration based on a rheumatoid condition that would prevent her from working in a light or sedentary occupation.
another employability evaluation was conducted,taking into account only her physical condition.the occupational specialist concluded that there were jobs that rodríguez could perform given her education and experience that might not require additional training,modification,or restructuring,and that would meet or exceed her reasonable wage of per hour.
on december,notified rodríguez that it was denying benefits because the medical record did not support a finding that she suffered from a physical condition that prevented her from performing light or sedentary occupations,and that disability benefits under the mental illness provision of the ltd plan had already been exhausted,even if she continued to be disabled due to a mental health condition.she was also advised of her right to sue under a of erisa since she had already exhausted the administrative remedies.
procedural background 
on may,rodríguez filed suit in a puerto rico state court.removed the action to the federal district court.the parties for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted motion and denied rodríguez.in granting motion,the district court found that 
u pon review of the group policy,administrative documents,and related correspondence between rodríguez,her treating physician,her legal representatives,and,it is clear that had discretionary authority to determine benefits eligibility.under a iii,although mova was designated as plan administrator of the employee benefit plan,was plan fiduciary with administrative authority to interpret the terms of the plan and determine eligibility for and entitlement to plan benefits.
vida,wl at.it therefore applied the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.under this deferential standard,the district court concluded that,in light of the medical evidence in the administrative record,denial of ltd benefits for physical illness was reasonable and based on substantial evidence and,consequently,was neither arbitrary nor capricious.
on appeal,rodríguez contends that the district court employed an incorrect standard of review and that the denial of ltd benefits was insupportable under the more stringent de novo standard.
ii.discussion 
applicable law 
the question of what standard of review is applicable to a benefits decision governed by erisa is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.maher.hosp.long term disability plan,cir.citing smart gillette.long term disability plan,cir.
t he rights and responsibilities of parties in relation to employee pension and welfare plans are regulated by erisa.terry bayer,cir.erisa provides a cause of action for plan participants,and other beneficiaries,to recover benefits due to them under the terms of the plan.see a b.it is under this statutory provision that claims,such as this one,challenging denials and termination of disability benefits are brought.terry,at.
erisa does not establish the standard of review which courts should apply when reviewing determinations made regarding benefits claims.however,the supreme court has held that a denial of benefits challenged is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,see also stephanie blue cross blue shield of.hmo blue,cir.the default rule favors de novo review.if the plan gives the plan participant or covered beneficiary adequate notice of such reservation,then a deferential arbitrary and capricious or abuse of discretion standard is applied.gross sun life assur.of,cir.internal quotation marks omitted quoting maher,at see also id.at stephanie,at noting that discretionary authority must be expressly provided for,and notice of that reservation must appropriately be given to plan participants for the deferential standard to apply internal citations omitted.t he threshold question in determining the standard of review is whether the provisions of the benefit plan at issue reflect a clear grant of discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.gross,at quoting leahy raytheon,cir.although t here are no required magic words,id.quoting brigham sun life of,cir,to secure discretionary review,a plan administrator must offer more than subtle inferences drawn from unrevealing language,id.at.
the parties disagree on the standard of review that the district court should have applied in reviewing denial of rodríguez claim for benefits.rodríguez alleges that the plan did not reflect a clear grant of authority to to make eligibility determinations under the plan because such authority was explicitly delegated to mova.she alleges that if,as the district court found,this discretionary authority was at some later time transferred to,this would have constituted a contractual violation,since the plan required an amendment to change its provisions and no amendment was found in administrative record.thus,her argument goes,because it is not clear that has been granted discretionary authority under the plan,its determination to deny her ltd benefits was subject to the de novo standard of review.accordingly,she requests that the case be remanded to the district court so that determination be reviewed under the de novo standard.
in assessing whether a plan reflects a clear grant of discretionary authority we review the language of the plan de novo,just as we would review the language of any contract.stephanie,at quoting ramsey hercules,cir.a careful review of the language of the plan leads us to conclude that it does not reflect a clear grant of discretionary authority to to determine eligibility for benefits.
has not been able to point to any plan language specifically establishing that it had discretionary decisionmaking authority.rather,it argues that the plan grants this authority to mova but,because was actually making the benefit decisions in place of mova,it is implied that the discretionary authority has been transferred to.case law,however,requires that the delegation of discretionary authority to an administrator or fiduciary be clearly stated in the plan.see id.at finding language in plan certificate not sufficiently clear to give notice to either a plan participant or covered beneficiary that the claims administrator enjoys discretion in interpreting and applying plan provisions gross,at t he critical question is whether the plan gives the employee adequate notice that the plan administrator has the latitude to shape the application,interpretation,and content of the rules in each case.quoting díaz prudential ins.of,cir.the plan fails to meet this degree of clarity since it states that mova,not triples,had this authority.if wanted to benefit from the delegation of authority and the deferential standard it provides,the plan needed to clearly state it so that plan participants,such as rodríguez,received adequate notice that had been granted discretionary authority to interpret the plan.there is no evidence in the record that this was done.see stephanie,at,finding that ambiguity as to whether the claims administrator had discretionary authority could not be cured by document defining relationship between the employer and the claims administrator because there was no evidence that the document was ever dis
