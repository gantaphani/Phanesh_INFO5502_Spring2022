brendon lydon believes that his union local of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local runs its hiring hall in a discriminatory way,retaliated against him for complaining about the discrimination,and breached its duty of fair representation.so he sued local in district court,alleging violations of several federal labor laws.acting on a motion to dismiss,the district judge resolved the case in local favor.lydon appeals.and what follows is our explanation of why we must affirm.
background 
because the judge jettisoned the case on a motion to dismiss,we accept the facts in the operative complaint as true,construing them in the light most favorable to lydon as the nonmoving party.see,schatz republican state leadership,cir.of course,we can supplement these facts with implications from documents incorporated by reference into the complaint,facts subject to judicial notice,and concessions in plaintiff response to the motion to dismiss.id.at internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.
at all times relevant here,lydon has been a member of local,the chartered local of the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew.the ibew makes and enforces rules governing how locals carry out union activity.for example,the ibew publishes what is called a pattern agreement a document that sets minimum standards for agreements locals make with their counterparts on the employer side of the employment divide,namely,the local chapters of the national electrical contractors association neca.any departure from the pattern agreement terms requires the ibew constitution says pretty much the same thing but the ibew withholds approval if the agreement differs from category i language in the pattern agreement an example of category i language,lydon says,is the pattern agreement requirement that locals operate as exclusive hiring halls.a hiring hall is like an employment agency and the adjective exclusive means an employer like the neca must hire only through the hall 
the agreement cba between local and the boston neca chapter also stated that local is an exclusive hiring hall.and for a time local did in fact function as an exclusive hall,keeping a list of members looking for jobs and referring them to the neca in chronological order,with the person on the list the longest getting first dibs on an available neca job.members are not required to accept whatever job referral comes their way.but if they say no more than two times in a row,they are rolled back to the bottom of the referral list.
a change occurred in september when local and the boston neca chapter signed a memorandum of understanding mou allowing union members to get jobs another way as well thanks to the mou,members could now solicit work directly from boston neca employers.this change made local a non exclusive hiring hall.so said local business manager,mike monahan.local implemented the mou without first getting ibew approval such approval was not necessary,monahan told members at a membership meeting.
lydon asked local for a copy of the mou.but his request fell on deaf ears.so he turned things up a notch,writing a letter to the ibew president complaining about the solicitation system.and he followed that up with a formal complaint with the ibew vice president.but the ibew took no action.
in august local and the boston neca chapter agreed to a new cba.local then sent that document to the ibew for approval,along with the mou.eventually,lydon got a letter from the ibew president saying that the ibew had conditionally approved the cba.the letter,however,did not mention the mou or the solicitation system.
sometime before august,lydon signed onto something called the drug free program a local neca program through which members can land jobs with participating employers if they submit to drug testing.but he opted out of the program around the time local and the boston neca reached the new cba.his reason for doing so was that he had a good spot on the referral list to land a construction job set to open up a job that did not have a component,apparently.local never got his information,however,for reasons unknown.and local later counted his refusal to work for a employer as his third refusal even though he was no longer participating in that program.so he ended up back on the bottom of the referral list.
an unhappy lydon challenged the refusal rule application to his situation.but monahan the person who handled the challenge would not change the result.lydon appealed but was denied,his complaint says though he does not say there who did the denying.anyway,lydon claims that during this same period monahan told another member appealing a similar decision that the solicitation system was in place because there were undesirables like lydon in local.he also told the member that if your being rolled had happened at the time lydon was rolled,things could have been different.
lydon responded by filing charges against the ibew with the national labor relations board nlrb,alleging that the ibew had breached its duty of fair representation both by not disclosing requested information about the referral rule and by not representing him regarding referral issues.but the nlrb concluded that he had not shown an practice on the ibew part.so off to federal court he went.
suing local,lydon operative complaint simply called the complaint from now on has four counts.count alleges that local infracted the pattern agreement and the ibew constitution when it became a nonexclusive hiring hall a change,count claims,that discriminatorily favors members who solicit work over those who like him await referrals through the referral list.what local has done and is doing,count says,constitutes an practice as defined in the national labor relations act nlra,see,violating the labor management relations act lmra,see et.count contends that local retaliated against him for complaining about the new system,a violation of the labor management reporting and disclosure act lmrda,see et,count adds count charges that local breached its duty of fair representation by bargaining for the solicitation system,a system that flies in the face of ibew rules and that local runs in a discriminatory manner,or so count insists.and finally,count asserts a claim under count.
local later asked the judge to dismiss the complaint under.b or,alternatively,to resolve the case on summary judgment under.the judge granted a rule b dismissal,holding that lydon complaint failed to allege a plausible theory of relief.and that ruling triggered this appeal.
standard of review 
we give fresh review to the judge rule b decision,affirming if after accepting as true all facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in lydon favor the complaint fails to state a plausible claim.see,schatz,at.merely reciting elements of a claim will not do,obviously.see,ashcroft iqbal,d.nor will alleging facts that are too meager,vague,or conclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of conjecture sec tambone,cir.one more thing because the judge reasoning does not bind us,we are free to affirm his decision on any basis supported by the record and the law.see,rocket learning,rivera s√°nchez,cir.
with this discussion out of the way,we turn to the issues before us.
documents not considered 
kicking things off,lydon argues in his opening brief that the judge abused his discretion by not considering numerous declarations,documents,and otherwise useful information in opposition to local motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.on a motion to dismiss,he reminds us,quoting from one of our cases,a judge can mull over documents incorporated by reference in the complaint,matters of public record,and other matters susceptible to judicial notice.giragosian ryan,cir quoting in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir.the problem for lydon is that his initial brief never specifically identifies the numerous papers that the judge should have pondered but did not.and it never explains how these unnamed documents fit within the parameters of giragosian,let alone explain how they could have pushed his complaint across the plausibility threshold.given these circumstances,we hold the argument waived.see,hsbc realty credit usa,cir hsbc,from here on out stressing that arguments not developed in a party opening brief are waived.
the lmra claim 
disagreeing with the judge,lydon insists that he alleged enough to propel his count lmra claim past mere possibility toward plausibility.that count,we remind the reader,complains that the solicitation system violated the pattern agreement and the ibew constitution,and operates in a discriminatory fashion to boot.local actions flout section a of the lmra and section b of the nlra,count suggests.but unfortunately for lydon,there is a problem knocking about here.
as relevant to our decision,section a of the lmra empowers district courts to hear suits for breach of contract between two labor organizations see wooddell int l of workers,local,d.an international constitution is a contract between two labor organizations,the international and its local that is what our judicial superiors tell us.see id and members can sue to enforce the contract constitution as beneficiaries.see,wooddell,at.to be fair,count lmra claim does allege violations of the ibew constitution.but and it is a big but lydon makes no effort in his brief to flesh out a putative wooddell claim,supplying no argument or authority,for example,suggesting how or why that claim might work.so to the extent he could have made such claim,it is waived.see,hsbc,at.
wait,says lydon,in a letter,count lmra claim clearly mentions how local unfair labor practices discriminated against those who only use the referral system.true,count does indeed say that.and we also agree with him that a union commits an unfair labor practice under section when it causes an employer to discriminate in hiring,tenure,or terms of employment either to encourage or discourage union membership.see b,a.but the nlrb not the courts has primary jurisdiction over an action that is arguably subject to section.marquez screen actors guild,d internal quotation marks omitted.that said,an claim which targets discriminatory or arbitrary conduct,see hines anchor motor freight,d is cognizable in the first instance in federal court.marquez,at.and generously read,the discrimination allegations in count lmra claim basically mimic the discrimination allegations in count claim.so we can consider count discrimination charges to the extent they sync up with count accusations.and we will do just that shortly when we take on count.but first we must deal with count.
the lmrda claim 
lydon believes the judge missed the boat by ruling he had no lmrda claim under count.that count the reader will recall alleged that local disciplined him within the meaning of the lmrda by dropping him to the bottom of the referral list in retaliation for his complaining to the ibew about the solicitation system.we find no fault with the judge conclusion,however.
among its constellation of provisions,the lmrda guarantees rights to e very member of a labor organization,see a makes it illegal for a union to fine,suspend,expel,or otherwise discipline any of its members for exercising any right to which he is entitled,see id.emphasis added and permits civil actions to protect his rights,see id.critically for our purposes,discipline does not include all acts that deter the exercise of rights protected under the lmrda rather it denote s only punishment authorized by the union as a collective entity to enforce its rules.breininger sheet metal workers int l ass local union,d.discipline,then,signif ies penalties applied by the union in its official capacity rather than ad hoc retaliation by individual union officers.id.at.so to state a claim a plaintiff can not allege simply that union officers carried out personal vendettas against him,id.at no,he must allege that he experienced t he opprobrium of the union as an entity,with the retaliation resulting from an established disciplinary process,id.at.
none of local alleged conduct amounts to discipline,so defined.yes,a loss of job referrals may possibly be discipline if imposed by a union on a member to punish a violation of union rules.id.at.and yes,lydon butted heads with monahan the local business manager who,remember,both upheld the three refusals in lydon case and allegedly said the solicitation system kept undesirables like lydon from getting jobs.but nothing monahan supposedly did or said involved punishment by the union as a collective entity or in its official capacity,to use breininger parlance.sure,the complaint accuses monahan of using his union position to retaliate against lydon for complaining about the solicitation scheme.and from that allegation he asks us to conclude that monahan actions brought the union opprobrium on him.but this we can not do,for an obvious reason if every union official action constituted union action simply because of his position,then the distinction between ad hoc retaliation by individual union officers and discipline imposed by the union as an entity would vanish.see id.at.
perhaps sensing a grave problem with count theory,lydon says in his opening brief that a union tribunal called the appeals committee of which monahan was a member,apparently actually upheld the three refusals.and the argument continues because the appeals committee wielded the full weight of local power,the union really disciplined lydon.but his complaint itself never mentions the appeals committee,much less allege how much union authority the committee wields.so his argument does him no good.
bottom line lydon has issues with monahan,certainly.and his complaint is thick with allegations.but he alleges no facts plausibly suggesting action by the union as an entity,to say nothing of union action resulting from an established disciplinary process.linnane,cir finding no discipline for lmrda purposes where plaintiff did not allege that the union as a body in a proceeding formal or informal,deliberately voted to take the action.ultimately,then,count fails the plausibility test.
the fair representation claim 
lastly,lydon asks us to undo the judge decision dismissing the claim in count.as a refresher,that count accuses local first of bargaining for a solicitation system that does not jibe with ibew rules and then of arbitrarily favoring members who use that system over those who do but after working our way through the law and the allegations,we uphold the judge ruling.
the duty of fair representation requires a union to serve its members honestly and in good faith and without invidious discrimination or arbitrary conduct.hines,at.a doctrine,see breininger,at,the duty applies to all union activity,including the union operations,see air line pilots ass n,int l,d,going forward.a breach occurs when a union treats its members arbitrarily,discriminatorily,or in bad faith.see,marquez,at.focusing as the parties basically do on arbitrariness,we see that a union conduct is arbitrary only if it is so far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be irrational,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,only if it is without any rational basis or explanation,marquez,at.that is a pretty high standard,indeed.
trying to squeeze his case into this framework,lydon first plays up how count alleges local irrationality in negotiating a solicitation system that is degrees away from what the ibew requires.ibew rules,he argues,require that local run an exclusive hiring hall.yet the mou between local and the boston neca turned the hall into a nonexclusive one.
here is the problem,however.a hiring hall,the high court tells us,is a matter of negotiation between the parties.local,int l of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers of am.nlrb,d.negotiation is the art of compromise,obviously,and human nature being what it is,not every member will love every compromise.rakestraw united airlines,cir easterbrook,commenting that o ften unions can achieve more for some of their members only by accepting less for others.but as the members bargaining representative,local enjoys great discretion in resolving the competing interests of its constituents,see humphrey moore,d which means judicial review is highly deferential,precluding judges from the union judgment just for the sa
