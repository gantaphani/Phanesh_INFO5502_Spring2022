we deal here with a suit by maría collazo rosado collazo against the university of puerto rico upr and marisol gómez mouakad gómez collazo former employer and supervisor,respectively.a crohn disease sufferer crohn is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine,collazo contends that the defendants did not renew her employment contract in retaliation for her complaining about an action that,she says,infracted a,which is the provision of the americans with disabilities act ada.she also contends that gómez conduct constituted first amendment retaliation under.but on summary judgment,the district court rejected these claims as a matter of law.and in the pages that follow,we explain why the court got it right.
background 
the relevant facts read in the light most flattering to collazo the loser,consistent with record support,see soto padró pub.bldgs,cir tell the following story.collazo has lived with crohn disease for many years,at least since.sometime in she interviewed for a position as mentorship coordinator of the academic support development center at the upr humacao campus.the center which is what we call it from now on is a program at the upr that as its name suggests offers students services,specifically in the area of natural sciences.collazo told her interviewer helena méndez medina méndez,the center that if she got the job,she would have to have access to a bathroom and be able to use accumulated sick leave to see her doctor or go for tests.these were reasonable accommodations,she told méndez.no problem,méndez replied or words to that effect.ultimately,the upr hired collazo in early winter on a contract set to expire in september.but twice the upr renewed her contract on a basis in september and again in september.
collazo job involved hiring and training students to mentor and tutor other students at the center supervising the center secretary,plus those students who worked and received services there preparing surveys and reports and managing the center functionality.those tasks were hers and hers alone.the center was open to and her shift ran from to 
about two months after starting at the center,méndez sent a memo to all personnel including collazo telling them to notify the administrative assistant first before missing work,arriving late,or leaving early.she also reminded everyone that they had to punch a time clock which was near collazo desk to signal their arrival at and departure from work.no attendance card will be signed,méndez added,if it contains entries made by hand or changes in the work schedule that ha ve not been properly.collazo,all agree,hand wrote her time on cards dozens of times before and after this memo,offering excuses like she forgot to punch in or the area was closed.
gómez became collazo immediate supervisor in august.chatting together one day around this time,collazo mentioned she had crohn disease.and she explained the reasonable accommodations she had received and hoped to continue receiving the ability to take frequent bathroom breaks and attend medical appointments.d o worry,gómez told her,though she did ask collazo to give center personnel a by telephone,email,or text whenever she was arriving late,leaving early,or away from her desk for any considerable span of time.the reason for this was that collazo job required that she be physically present at the center to supervise student mentors and tutors.
collazo,it turns out,normally gave prior notice when she had a medical appointment.normally is her word,not ours.and gómez granted every one of her leave and absence requests whether medically related or not and never expressly or even impliedly stated that she could not take bathroom breaks.
eventually,however,gómez became concerned that the center was not meeting the program goals and objectives.here is what happened in january the codirector of a center at the upr arecibo campus philippe scott told gómez that he too thought her center was underperforming,based on a comparison of the two centers.on top of that,other professors complained about how the tutoring system was running.professor rolando tremont,for example,director of the chemistry department at the upr humacao campus,told gómez he thought the center was not offering enough mentor and tutoring sessions to students in his department.he also complained that mentors and tutors were not regularly attending classes in his department.they needed to attend classes regularly,he said,because that way they would know what was being taught,which would make them better chemistry mentors and tutors at the center.
worried that the federal government might defund the program,gómez took a more active role in the center operations,zeroing in on the staff performance.she held meetings to discuss ways to improve.and she asked collazo to put on more and different workshops.she also issued a memo in march that basically mirrored the one méndez had issued two years earlier gómez reminded everyone including collazo that persons needing to modify their work schedule must give advance notice.t ime cards,gómez added,must be punched at the corresponding times,not earlier or later without justification.no attendance card will be signed if it contains entries made by hand or changes in the work schedule that ha ve not been properly.collazo signed the bottom of that memo.
keeping an eye on her underlings attendance,gómez saw that collazo was either coming in late,leaving early,or leaving her work area for long stretches without giving anyone any advance notice.so gómez wrote her up,noting that her actions left the students without supervision that they had talked about this problem many times before that her behavior was not permissible that she must follow proper protocol and that she had at her disposal a number of ways to give the required notice.collazo later tried to defend herself,saying if i was absent,well,i would call in.but they would hardly answer the telephone,she added probably,she speculated,because they checked the caller id before deciding whether to pick up.she also later claimed that she had justified all of these leaves with medical documents.but the record evidence she cites to is a doctor note dealing with just one absence.for what it is worth,the upr never lowered her salary because of her absences nor discounted the times that she was not at her work area.
regrettably,on at least one occasion the visiting boyfriend of the secretary at the center laughed and made comments every time collazo left the office,saying things like again.look,juliana,again.we infer that he was referring to collazo trips to the bathroom.collazo felt humiliated by the event.and she complained to gómez,apparently,who did nothing about it.the record shows,though,that gómez never made fun of collazo medical condition and never allowed any employee to make fun of her condition either.
fed up with what she thought was discriminatory treatment,collazo complained to her union,formally asked the upr for reasonable accommodations ready access to a bathroom and flexibility to attend medical appointments,and filed charges of discrimination and retaliation with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.to back up her position,she got a medical certificate from the director of the upr center for inflammatory bowel disease.the certificate read in part 
collazo condition is protected by the ada.she requires reasonable accommodation in her work.she needs ready access to the bathroom,and flexibility in her time schedule to allow for visits to the physician,laboratory or other diagnostic or treatment facility.she may unexpectedly become ill and require use of her sick leave without prior warning.
concluding that collazo request simply sought improv ed labor relations in the workplace,the upr committee recommended in june that the parties try to resolve their differences voluntarily through something called the employee assistance program.as for the eeoc matter,the record does not tell us what happened there.but neither the upr nor gómez argues that collazo failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.and because that issue does not go to our jurisdiction,see city of providence,cir,we say no more about that subject.
moving on,we see that gómez completed a written evaluation of collazo performance in june,giving her an overall b rating.b stands for below expectations.failed to meet expectations or met them only partially.gómez explained her thinking in writing,emphasizing that collazo had done a poor job training and supervising tutors and mentors had run workshops that did not meet the science and math departments needs had failed to conduct a required satisfaction survey with participating students and had failed to follow the attendance policy.i do agree with the evaluation,collazo wrote in response.it is subjective and does not respond to the reality of the process.
collazo employment contract was due to expire in september.and gómez recommended that the upr not renew it,noting that collazo performance was not up to snuff and that the program needed some restructuring.so in august,gómez wrote collazo and said the upr had decided not to her,citing the restructuring rationale.the letter pertinently provides 
during the past months we have discussed with the program director the functions,costs and projections of the center tutors and mentors coordinator position,which you occupy at present.
in response to these changes,we have decided not to extend you a new contract for the next year 
later,gómez appointed two persons to fill collazo old job.and the center performance dramatically improved with them at the helm the center offered more mentor and tutoring sessions,and the participating students got better grades as a result.
believing that she was the victim of retaliation for complaining about disability discrimination,collazo filed this lawsuit,naming the upr and gómez as defendants.besides a retaliation claim against the two under the ada,collazo also asserted a first amendment retaliation claim against gómez under on the recommendation of a magistrate judge,however,the district court granted summary judgment to the upr and gómez.accept ing that collazo had made out a prima facie claim,the court made two key findings first,that the upr and gómez had put forth legitimate,nonretaliatory reasons for not renewing her contract her not fulfilling the c enter goals,which required a restructuring at the c enter,and her not comply ing with the center attendance policy,to quote the court and second,that she had not shown that these reasons were really just pretext masking retaliatory intentions.the court then ruled that collazo first amendment retaliation claim failed because,as the court saw it,the ada constitutes an exclusive remedy here.which brings us to collazo appeal.
standard of review 
we give fresh review to the district court decision,construing all reasonable inferences in collazo favor and affirming only if no genuine issue of material fact remains and the upr and gómez are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see,nieves romero united states,cir soto padró,at.of course,conclusory assertions,improbable inferences,and sheer speculation can not save collazo from summary judgment.see,nieves romero,at soto padró,at.and we can sustain the grant of summary judgment on any basis the record supports,including one not relied on by the court.see,soto padró,at.
we now take on the issues in play,adding additional details as needed.
ada retaliation 
up first is whether the district court erred in rejecting collazo claim on summary judgment.we start with the basics.the ada,broadly speaking,makes it illegal for employers either to discriminate because of a person disability,see b,or to retaliate against someone because she opposes an act made unlawful by the ada,see a.the fight here focuses on retaliation.and because collazo tries to show retaliation through circumstantial evidence,we apply the familiar analysis.under that framework,collazo must first show that she engaged in activity that the upr and gómez took an adverse employment action against her and that a causal connection existed between their action and her activity.see,kelley.corr.med,cir.if she makes this prima facie showing,the burden shifts to the defendants to offer a legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for their actions,and then back to her to show that the reason was mere pretext.see id.to establish pretext she must show that the explanation was a lie,which would let a factfinder infer that the defendants made the story up to cover their tracks.see ronda pérez banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria,cir.it is not enough for her to show that they were wrong or tactless.see see also gonzalez el dia,cir.after all,the law does not empower courts to act as department s,looking to undo bad employment decisions.gonzalez,at parenthetically quoting mechnig sears,roebuck,cir.
the simplest way to decide a case is often the best,we have noted,strathmore ins,cir quoting chambers bowersox,cir arnold.and there is a simple way here.
like the district court,we assume without deciding that collazo established a prima facie inference of retaliation.also like the lower court,we accept for argument sake that the upr and gómez effectively rebutted her prima facie showing by responding that it did not renew her contract both because she failed to meet the goals set for the center,necessitating the center restructuring,and because she failed to follow the center attendance policy.that leaves us only with the pretext question 
one way to establish pretext is to show that the upr and gómez gave different and arguably inconsistent explanations for their actions.see domínguez cruz suttle caribe,cir.w eaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in their proffer can do the trick,see harrington aggregate.region,cir internal quotation marks omitted unless the record conclusively reveals that the real motive was an unstated reason that is nonretaliatory,see reeves sanderson plumbing.with that said,collazo pretext argument proceeds in five steps.one the nonrenewal notice from the upr and gómez mentioned the center restructuring as the reason for their decision.two yet they suggest in this court as they did in the district court that they had two valid reasons for the nonrenewal,a her not fulfilling the center objectives,requiring the center restructuring,and b her not following the center attendance program even though they never admonished her for her performance or disciplined her for her absences.three but to quote her brief they floated n one of these alleged reasons in the nonrenewal letter,concocting them after the fact.four and these sham justifications became a convenient pretextual basis for getting rid of her.five so summary judgment on the claim can not stand.
although cleverly crafted,we can not accept collazo argument.for starters,she cites no contract provision,regulation,statute,or caselaw suggesting that the upr and gómez had to give her every reason they had for not renewing her contract.consequently any argument in this direction is waived for lack of development.see,medina rivera mvm,cir deeming waived an argument not fully developed,lacking any citation to supporting authority or even a persuasive explanation of what the law should be,assuming they found no authority.
also,a key premise of her theory that performance and attendance issues are simply inventions,conjured out of thin air after the fact to hide retaliatory animus enjoys no record support.actually,and devastating to her thesis,the evidence cuts the other way.
as for performance,remember how scott and professor tremont gave gómez an earful on the center slipshod mentor and tutor program.and do not forget,collazo was the center frontline person,tasked with hiring,training,and supervising mentors and tutors,among other things.gómez convened staff meetings as well which collazo attended to discuss performance fixes,with one idea being offering other kinds of workshops.recall too how in evaluating her work,gómez stamped collazo net performance below expectations.and to mention just a few of collazo shortcomings,we remind the reader that gómez criticized her workshop offerings,her supervision of mentors and tutors,and her failure to follow
