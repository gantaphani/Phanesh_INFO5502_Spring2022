this case is before us upon an application for enforcement,and a for review,of an order of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board.although the dispute between the parties has involved many issues,there is one central issue in this appeal whether a may,letter of agreement the may agreement between the international brotherhood of teamsters,local local or the union and lynch lynch violated section e of the national labor relations act the act,e,by impermissibly preventing lynch from doing business with two subcontractors.the administrative law judge alj who originally heard the case found that the agreement did not violate section e with respect to one subcontractor,but did with respect to the other.upon review,the nlrb,emphasizing the plain terms of the may agreement,found that the agreement application to both subcontractors violated section e of the act and entered a remedial order.
the board now applies for enforcement of its order.in turn,local petitions for limited review of the nlrb decision,arguing that the nlrb erred in reversing the alj and that,because more than years passed between the events in question and the nlrb decision,it would be inappropriate to enforce the decision.
we conclude that the nlrb erred in finding that the may agreement violated section e of the act with respect to one of the subcontractors.in light of contradictory evidence in the record that the board failed to consider,the plain text of the may agreement is not substantial evidence supporting the board conclusion that the agreement had an impermissible intent.rather,as the alj found,the evidence in the record indicates that the agreement was intended to preserve union jobs at lynch,a lawful purpose under the act.therefore,we reverse the board finding with respect to this aspect of the may agreement.however,the union does not challenge the board finding as it relates to the other subcontractor,and thus the board is entitled to enforcement of that aspect of its order.accordingly,we grant the board application for enforcement only as to the agreement prohibition on lynch use of that second subcontractor.
a.the dispute 
lynch is a highway construction general contractor with facilities in rhode island,and a signatory of the construction industries of rhode island ciri collective bargaining agreement with local.ciri is an association representing construction industry employers in rhode island.as of,there were approximately rhode island employers who had joined the ciri collective bargaining agreement with local and were thus bound by its terms.local is the teamsters local union with jurisdiction over rhode island and portions of massachusetts.local is the longtime representative of truck drivers employed by lynch,although the number of members in local bargaining unit at lynch has been steadily declining.lynch employed local members in,in,and only in.according to local vice president and business agent,joseph boyajian,this decline is part of a concerted effort on the part of lynch to replace its unionized drivers with subcontractors.before the alj,he testified that,each time a truck driver retired,lynch would sell a truck and replace that person with a subcontractor,gradually reducing the number of bargaining unit employees.
lynch acknowledged that hiring subcontractor drivers was a common practice,noting that during particularly busy times it would hire as many as to additional trucks each day.these additional drivers were employed by several different subcontractors,many of which were employers.boyajian was especially troubled by lynch use of two subcontractors,northeast transportation,northeast and cullion excavating cullion,because these two subcontractors did not pay the prevailing rate to their drivers the collective bargaining agreement cba between local and ciri provides that employers are not permitted to use subcontractors unless employees of the subcontractors are paid the prevailing rate.over the course of several years,boyajian complained to lynch about its use of subcontractors,especially northeast,that did not pay the prevailing rate.finally,in may,local filed grievances with the nlrb complaining that the use of subcontractors who failed to pay the prevailing rate was a violation of the union cba with ciri 
after these grievances were filed,boyajian met with david lynch,the president of lynch,and billy cabral,lynch controller,to discuss the issue.at the meeting,lynch promised not to use northeast or cullion,and he subsequently sent a may,letter to boyajian memorializing the agreement between the parties.in relevant part,this letter states 
the trucking services of northeast transportation and cullion excavating will not be utilized.should a particular project come along that requires excessive trucking and we are not able to supplement our fleet adequately,we will notify you of the situation to allow us to amicably resolve the problem.the employer acknowledges the union right to strike to enforce this agreement.
this agreement is the primary subject of the dispute between the parties at this stage.
in april,boyajian learned that lynch was again using northeast for trucking services,even though northeast drivers still were not being paid the prevailing rate.after lynch indicated that it intended to continue to use northeast,local members went on strike on april,at lynch locations in cumberland and east providence.lynch sought a temporary restraining order enjoining the strike,which was eventually resolved by the union agreement to end the strike on april.in a separate lawsuit,lynch sought money damages against local for what it alleged to be an illegal strike 
b.the alj decision 
immediately following the strike,lynch filed several charges against local with the nlrb alleging violations of section b ii a b and e of the act these charges were consolidated with those filed by another employer and the case referred to an administrative law judge.with regard to the charges brought by lynch,the major issue was whether the parties may agreement violated section e of the act by impermissibly preventing lynch from doing business with a third party.as described in greater detail below,such an agreement is valid if its objective is the preservation of work for bargaining unit employees such an agreement involves primary activity.in contrast,if the purpose of the agreement is to further union objectives with respect to a third party,pressuring the third party to accept unionization of its employees,it involves secondary activity and violates section e.thus,the focus of the alj was an inquiry into local motives in entering into the may agreement.
after eight days of hearings,held between august and december of,the alj issued his decision on april.he found that the may agreement,memorialized by lynch may,letter,violated section e of the act with regard to cullion,but not northeast.the written decision explains that the may agreement is secondary activity with regards to cullion because the union has not established that cullion was performing work traditionally performed by lynch bargaining unit employees.in contrast,the alj found that the northeast drivers hired by lynch were doing bargaining unit work.therefore,
the agreement and the union efforts to enforce it with regard to northeast in april,were valid efforts at work preservation accordingly,the dispute with lynch over the use of northeast trucks is a primary dispute and therefore i find that the parties may agreement with regard to northeast did not violate section e.similarly,i find that the union efforts to enforce this agreement in april did not violate section b.
c.the nlrb decision 
the nlrb reversed the alj decision with respect to northeast.while it applied the same legal standard,and stated that it did not intend to disturb the alj findings of fact,the nlrb found that the may agreement between local and lynch violated section e on its face without regard to whether the work covered by the agreement was work traditionally performed by employees in the unit.
in reaching this conclusion,the nlrb focused on the fact that the may agreement singled out two companies,northeast and cullion.it acknowledged that an agreement that permits an employer to subcontract bargaining unit work only to subcontractors that honor the economic terms of the agreement serves a lawful primary purpose eliminating any economic incentive to take work away from employees in the unit.however,it found that the may agreement was more akin to a union signatory clause,which forbids an employer from subcontracting work to any person not party to an agreement with the union.focusing on the text of the agreement,the nlrb concluded that it was intended to achieve union objectives with respect to northeast and cullion and was not aimed at work preservation at lynch.accordingly,it found that the agreement violated section e of the act.because the nlrb found that the may agreement was unlawful,it also found that local violated section b ii a b of the act by attempting to enforce the agreement through its april strike.
to remedy these violations,the board order requires local to cease and desist from seeking to enforce the may agreement and from attempting to obtain any similar agreement with other employers.additionally,the order requires local to post a remedial notice at its office,and to distribute the notice to members,as well as send the notice to the nlrb regional director who will seek to post the notice at each of the affected companies.
with this background in mind,we turn to the legal standards governing our review of the board decision and order.
a.the substantial evidence standard 
we are typically deferential in reviewing decisions of the nlrb.as the board is primarily responsible for developing and applying a coherent national labor policy,we accord its decisions considerable deference.yesterday children,nlrb,cir quoting nlrb bos.dist.council of carpenters,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this deference means that w e may not substitute our judgment for the board when the choice is between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.id.quoting universal camera nlrb.thus,although w e review the board conclusion s of law de novo,we take the board findings of fact to be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.posadas de,nlrb,cir quoting nlrb beverly,cir citation omitted see also e the findings of the board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.
substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.posadas de,at quoting beverly,at.in considering whether a conclusion is supported by substantial evidence,w e must take contradictory evidence in the record into account.howard johnson nlrb,cir quoting universal camera,at.thus,the board is not free to prescribe what inferences from the evidence it will accept and reject,but must draw all those inferences that the evidence fairly demands.allentown mack sales and,nlrb,d.
in a case such as this,where the board and its appointed examiner,or alj,reach different conclusions,the supreme court has instructed that t he substantial evidence standard is not modified in any way.universal camera,at.the examiner findings and written decision are simply part of the record that the reviewing court must consider in determining whether the board decision is supported by substantial evidence.id.at.however,when the alj and board reach different conclusions there is,necessarily,evidence in the record contradicting the board conclusion.this circumstance has implications for our review of the board decision.in universal camera,the supreme court explained that evidence supporting a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial,experienced examiner who has observed the witnesses and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the board than when he has reached the same conclusion.id.at.putting the supreme court observation into practice,we have stated that where the board has reached a conclusion opposite of that of the alj,our review is slightly less deferential than it would be otherwise.haas,nlrb,cir quoting indus.mech.contractors,nlrb,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
section e of the act 
as noted,section e of the act makes it unlawful for any labor organization and employer to enter into any contract or agreement,express or implied,whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from doing business with any other person.e.however,the supreme court has held that this provision of the act is intended to reach only agreements with secondary objectives,not those with primary purposes protected by the act.nlrb int l longshoremen ass n,d.as we have previously explained,
t he basic test for distinguishing between primary and secondary activity is whether the union conduct was addressed to the labor relations of the employer against whom the pressure is exerted his own employees,and therefore primary,or whether the union conduct against a neutral employer was tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere,and therefore secondary.

the supreme court has observed that a mong the primary purposes protected by the act is the purpose of preserving for contracting employees themselves work traditionally done by them.longshoremen,at quoting nlrb pipefitters,d.it has established a test for identifying an agreement intended to serve this purpose,stating f irst,it must have as its objective the preservation of work traditionally performed by employees represented by the union,and,s econd,the contracting employer must have the power to give the employees the work in question.id.
with regard to the first element of this test,it is the intended purpose of an agreement,not its effect,that determines whether the agreement has a permissible primary object.in longshoremen,the court explained that t he effect of work preservation agreements on the employment opportunities of employees not represented by the union,no matter how severe,is of course irrelevant to the validity of the agreement so long as the union had no forbidden secondary purpose to affect the employment relations of the neutral employer.at emphasis added see also in re bituminous coal wage agreements,cir so long as the union has no forbidden secondary purpose to affect the employment relations of an outside employer,the agreement is valid even though it adversely affects the employment opportunities of workers.however,if an agreement is motivated by any secondary purpose,even if it be merely one purpose of many,it is in violation of section e.see local union,int l of teamsters nlrb,cir it is not necessary that the only object of the guild actions be a secondary one so long as an object is to pressure a neutral employer,the violation is complete.as to the second element of the test,the supreme court explained that if the contracting employer has no power to assign the work,it is reasonable to infer that the agreement has a secondary objective,that is,to influence whoever does have such power over the work.longshoremen,at.
as a result of this framework,there is an important distinction between a union standards clause and a union signatory clause 
union standards clauses prohibiting employers from contracting work normally performed by its union employees to others who are paid less than union wages are widely held to be permissible under the nlra.union signatory clauses on the other hand,prohibiting employers from contracting work to others not signatory to the collective bargaining agreement or otherwise approved by the union,have been held to be illegal secondary pressure that violates the nlra.
