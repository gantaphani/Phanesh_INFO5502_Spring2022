plaintiff reed sued her former employer mbna marketing systems,and two parent companies collectively,mbna,a major banking institution,claiming that she was sexually harassed by her supervisor,william appel.the district court granted mbna motion for summary judgment,and reed now appeals.we set forth the facts in the light most favorable to reed as the party opposing summary judgment.motorsport eng g,maserati,cir.
reed began working for mbna in june at the age of seventeen.she worked as a telemarketer in the mbna call center in orono,maine,under the supervision of appel,then aged.almost immediately,appel started misbehaving.appel told reed that if you ever catch me looking at you funny,it because you remind me of my.appel also frequently dropped green on reed desk claiming that they would make her horny.he also routinely complimented her on her clothes and appearance,comments which take color from his other remarks.
according to reed,a far more serious incident followed.in august,reed went to appel house to babysit for his son.when appel returned home,he and reed talked for a short period and then reed started to leave.as she was leaving,appel came up behind her,put his arm around her neck and dragged her into the living room where he pressed her to perform oral sex on him.afterwards,appel told reed that she should not tell anyone what had happened or they would both be fired,adding that his family had influence with the head of the company the details of what appel said are recounted below.
reed did not report the incident,and appel ignored reed at work for a few days thereafter.soon,appel again began making sexual comments to her,leaving green on her desk,and asking reed to babysit for him.reed stated later that these comments were an everyday thing he always made a comment to me about something every day.in the fall of,reed took a job elsewhere and left mbna without informing anyone there that appel had harassed or assaulted her.she claims that she left because of everything that happened because i was scared and i did know how he would act i was reminded of it every day because he would stop all the comments.
reed returned to work at mbna in may because she needed to make more money than she was earning at her other job.she was to appel team.after a few weeks appel resumed his earlier comments on her appearance and his practice of dropping green on her desk.in august,appel called reed into his office,asked if she would babysit for him again,and told her that she looked like she needed to wrestle.reed refused and claims that thereafter appel attitude became really mean,yelling at her for coming in late to work or wearing khakis,conduct that he had previously tolerated.
on august,reed told mbna officials about appel behavior including his assault of the year before and she requested a transfer.reed says that she decided to come forward because she heard that appel was asking other young women who worked on his team to babysit for him and she was afraid that they would be sexually assaulted as well.mbna began an investigation that day leading swiftly to a decision to terminate appel.appel resigned before the paperwork for his dismissal could be completed.
reed continued to work at mbna.on february,she filed a discrimination charge with the maine human rights commission,but the commission declined to pursue the complaint.reed left mbna in june,and on december,reed filed the present suit against mbna in state court,making claims under title vii,a the federal employment discrimination under the maine human rights act.tit,a,which the parties treat as coextensive with title vii for present purposes.other claims were made but are not pertinent to this appeal.
after removal of the case to federal court and discovery,the district court granted mbna motion for summary judgment.reed mbna mktg,d.the court held that,although appel conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter reed terms and conditions of employment,id.at,mbna was not vicariously liable for his conduct.the court found that,first,reed did not suffer a tangible employment action a term of art in the case,second,the company took reasonable care to prevent and correct sexually harassing behavior and reed unreasonably failed to invoke the company corrective mechanism.id.at.reed now appeals.
title vii makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.although title vii does not in its terms address sexual harassment,the supreme court has read the statute to include such conduct as a form of gender discrimination where,inter alia,it is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive work environment.oncale sundowner offshore,d.for purposes of this appeal mbna does not dispute that appel conduct met this test it does deny that it is vicariously liable for this harassment.
in two cases decided in city of boca raton,d burlington industries ellerth,d the supreme court itself devised a special framework for imposing vicarious liability on employers in cases involving harassment by supervisors the rules although unique were not made up entirely out of whole cloth rather,the new regime was stitched together out of disparate pieces of older law,including older agency doctrines,selected judicial precedent the cases offering a range of options,administrative regulations and multiple but conflicting policy concerns,faragher,at.the common language,identical in both opinions,follows 
an employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee.when no tangible employment action is taken,a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages,subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence,see fed.rule.civ.proc.c.the defense comprises two necessary elements a that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,and b that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.while proof that an employer had promulgated an antiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law,the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense.and while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer,a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer burden under the second element of the defense.no affirmative defense is available,however,when the supervisor harassment culminates in a tangible employment action,such as discharge,demotion,or undesirable reassignment.
id.at.ellerth,at.
notice,at the outset,that the affirmative defense does not apply where a tangible employment action is taken against the example,where in the course of the harassment,the supervisor illegitimately fires or demotes the employee.ellerth offered as instances of such tangible job action the following hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.ellerth,at.the reason for the exclusion,relevant to the first issue before us,is importantly that the supervisor in such a case is exercising official authority even if doing so for improper purposes and,in this instance,the courts treat the act as that of the employer,a course finding some limited basis in traditional agency law.id.at.
reed was not fired or demoted but she seeks to bring herself within this category of tangible employment action by describing her initial departure from the job in fall as a constructive discharge.the phrase constructive discharge usually describes harassment so severe and oppressive that staying on the job while seeking rule save in exceptional intolerable,keeler putnam fiduciary trust,cir and the concept has been used for various purposes,such as allowing the employee to claim damages not only for emotional harm due to the harassment but also for lost wages after departure.de,cir.
here,the district court rejected reed claim that,by calling the conduct here a constructive discharge,she could avoid mbna effort to prove an affirmative defense.case law in the third and eighth circuits treats constructive discharge as a tangible employment action cases in the second and sixth circuits lean the other way because the conduct differs from case to case,we see no reason to adopt a blanket rule one way or the other.here,it is clear to us that the constructive discharge label can not be used to preclude the affirmative defense but possibly,on rare facts,it might be appropriate for that purpose.
nothing is gained by arguing in the abstract about whether a constructive discharge is or is not a discharge for some purposes or rubrics,it might be so treated,vega kodak caribbean,cir,and for others not.what matters is the supreme court rationale for excluding tangible employment actions from the affirmative defense,namely,that a supervisor who takes official action against an employee should be treated as acting for the employer.ellerth,at.there might indeed be cases in which official actions by the,an extremely dangerous job assignment to retaliate for spurned make employment intolerable,but nothing like that is present here.
rather,all of appel conduct was exceedingly unofficial and involved no direct exercise of company authority.with one possible qualification to which we will return,this premise is so clear that no extended discussion is needed.thus,appel behavior is exactly the kind of wholly unauthorized conduct for which the affirmative defense was designed.yes,appel supervisory status may have facilitated his harassment,but that is a reason for vicarious liability,ellerth,at,not for bypassing the affirmative defense.whether the conduct bears on the reasonableness of reed inaction in failing earlier to report appel is a different question.
reed this is the possible even if official action is needed for a tangible employment action,here appel told her that they would both be fired if she reported the assault.however,we think that this issue is controlled by the supreme court statement in ellerth that unfulfilled threats are not tangible employment actions.at.the court also stated that the concept of a tangible employment action is based on the distinction between cases in which threats are carried out and those where they are not or are absent altogether.id.at.
this brings us to the affirmative defense itself and we start with the first prong that the employer prove that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior ellerth,at.although the burden of proof lies on the employer as to both prongs of the affirmative defense,summary judgment for the employer is still possible so long as raw facts are undisputed or assumed in favor of the plaintiff.even then,however,the judgment call as to reasonableness is itself a jury issue unless no reasonable jury could decide it in the plaintiff favor.mota of.houston health sci,cir.
on the merits,the district court ruled that mbna did take reasonable precautions to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior by its employees.the district court noted that mbna had a policy against sexual harassment and a procedure that called for employees to present complaints either to their manager or directly to mbna personnel department officials.this gave reed an alternative route around appel even if complaining to appel own manager was infeasible.mbna offered evidence,by means proper at the summary judgment stage,both of its own procedures and of its efforts to publicize them.
reed admitted in her deposition that she attended an orientation on mbna sexual harassment policies before she started working at the company in and again when she returned in.she also told an investigator with the maine human rights commission that mbna stressed its sexual harassment policies.she conceded that she saw posters regarding sexual harassment in the workplace and knew she could go to personnel if she was sexually harassed.in any event,mbna began an investigation the day that reed reported appel conduct,and reed concedes that appel was removed from the workplace almost immediately.
reed argues that,although mbna policies were fine in theory,they failed in practice.she claims that several employees reported appel inappropriate conduct but mbna never took any action.however,although these reports indicated that appel was not a model manager,only one related to sexual harassment.in that instance appel conduct,while patently improper,was largely confined to remarks freighted with sexual innuendo made to or in the presence of another female subordinate.when the employee complained in october,mbna investigated the episode and reprimanded appel,warning him against such remarks in the future 
reed says that mbna should have taken stronger measures at that time and objects in particular to the deposition statement of the investigating mbna personnel official that i f there is any shadow of a doubt,then we give the doubt to the person because we are not going to place someone on corrective action if we are not percent sure.this statement,whatever its advisability if treated as a general company policy,was made simply in explaining why reed reported his harassment to given the opportunity to respond to her allegations.it does not show that mbna lacked a substantial program,and thus we agree with the district court that mbna satisfied the first prong of the affirmative defense.
the crux of this appeal concerns the second prong of the affirmative defense.mbna argues that reed unreasonably failed to take advantage of the company sexual harassment policy,which explicitly provided that employees who were sexually harassed should report that harassment to their manager or directly to personnel and that this could be done on a confidential basis.in contrast,arguing that reasonableness is at least a jury issue,reed points to her age,embarrassment,appel threat that they would both be fired,and his claim of family friendship with mbna owner.the district court responded as follows 
the reasons listed above,however,are not enough to excuse plaintiff from following the procedures adopted for her protection.given mbna practice of handling complaints confidentially,the fact that plaintiff was too embarrassed or ashamed to tell anyone does not constitute a valid reason for avoiding the company channels for dealing with sexual harassment.furthermore,even if plaintiff feared retaliation or further humiliation,no evidence suggests that defendants procedures were inadequate.in fact,in addition to directly addressing sexual harassment,defendants policy did not require that complaints be filed with an immediate supervisor,or for that matter,even management.therefore,plaintiff excuse that she was intimidated by appel and his close relationship to mbna management is not reasonable.
there is no rule as to when a failure to file a complaint becomes unreasonable,but faragher and ellerth do provide some indirect guidance.reporting sexually offensive conduct by a supervisor would for many or most employees be uncomfortable,scary or both.but because this will often or ordinarily be true,as the supreme court certainly knew,its regime necessarily requires the employee in normal circumstances to make this painful effort if the employee wants to impose vicarious liability on the employer and collect damages under title vii.in short,for policy reasons representing a compromise,more than ordinary fear or embarrassment is needed.see,matvia bald head island,cir.
several courts have therefore focused on whether the employee had concrete reason to apprehend that complaint wou
