after thomas locke,a airways mechanic at logan international airport,was discovered pilfering company property,he entered into a last chance agreement with airways.locke last chance at continued employment failed to materialize,however,after logan airport authorities denied his application for renewal of his security badge.locke now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on his claim that airways breached the last chance agreement by influencing the airport decision to deny his badge and by preventing him from transferring to philadelphia international airport.finding no triable basis for these contentions in the record,we affirm.
in august,airways received phone calls reporting ongoing theft from its aircraft and identifying locke as the culprit.michael bashar,airways station director at logan airport,responded by enlisting the assistance of the massachusetts state police.the state police conducted surveillance outside the airways hangar,and on september,observed locke exiting the hangar while carrying a large trash bag and a cooler.two officers stopped locke in the parking lot,and locke agreed to accompany them to the police barracks.after reading locke his miranda rights,the police interviewed him and searched the cooler and trash bag,finding sodas,beers,sandwiches,soap,toilet paper,and several other items taken from aircraft.locke admitted to filching the items.the officers released locke but retained his security badge,which granted him access to secure areas of logan airport.
later that evening,locke called his supervisor,robert andrews,and informed him that the state police had caught him taking items from aircraft and had confiscated his security badge.the following monday,september,andrews told his supervisor,nelson conarroe the regional director of technical operations,about the incident,and suspended locke pending further investigation.
the airline had little time to investigate,however.under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between airways and the international association of machinists,airways was obligated to make a disciplinary decision within five days of the underlying other words,by september.with this deadline looming,airways entered into a last chance agreement the agreement with locke on september i n lieu of termination and in order to provide locke a final opportunity to demonstrate his ability to comply with company policies and procedures.the agreement provided for locke return to work on october,but stated that reinstatement was contingent upon completion of any steps required by law,company policy,or the terms of this agreement,including,if applicable,a security screening.the agreement also empowered airways to convene a meeting with locke to determine whether he had violated its terms any such determination would be final and binding with respect to whether locke violated the terms of this agreement,and the imposition of discipline,up to and including termination.
in order to return to work at logan,locke needed a security badge.locke testified that he sought to reobtain his original badge from the state police as early as september,on which date andrews told locke that he would go to the police barracks and pick up the badge.after andrews apparently met with no success,locke himself went to the office of the badging authority,massport,on october.locke was informed that his badge had been lost and that he would need to reapply for a new badge by filling out an application and obtaining a signature from airways.following these instructions from massport,locke filed a badge application the next day,october,with a airways signature on the application form 
on november,major michael concannon,massport director of aviation security,issued a letter informing locke that his badge application had been denied and explaining the basis for the denial.the letter recited the details of locke september encounter with the state police and his admission of theft,and concluded 
holding a security badge for bostonlogan international airport is a privilege,and the security of the airport depends in large part on the authority being able to trust that security badge holders will faithfully discharge the security responsibilities that attend that privilege.your admission that you have been conducting an ongoing criminal enterprise at the airport vitiates that trust and renders you unfit to hold a security badge for boston logan international airport.
meanwhile,on the advice of conarroe,locke also applied for a comparable mechanic position with airways at philadelphia international airport.locke received this position on november.however,although conarroe promised locke that he would receive a security badge at philadelphia international,locke never in fact obtained such a badge and never began work in philadelphia.
on november,locke met with andrews,a union representative,and via telephone conarroe to discuss whether locke had complied with the terms of the agreement.conarroe inquired whether locke had obtained a security badge,and when locke admitted that he had not,conarroe provided him until the end of the week november to do so.on november,conarroe sent locke a letter stating that he had violated the terms of the agreement and terminating his employment forthwith.conarroe letter explained 
under the terms of the agreement you were required to return to work on october.the agreement also provided that your reinstatement was contingent upon completion of any steps required by law,company policy,or the terms of this agreement,including a security screening.you failed to obtain the required bos airport identification badge and failed to return to work on october.
thereafter,locke filed this suit,alleging breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and wrongful termination.us airways moved for,and the district court granted,summary judgment on all three counts this appeal followed.
on appeal,locke challenges the district court grant of summary judgment only as to his claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing he does not press his wrongful termination claim.we review the district court summary judgment order de novo i n so doing,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party while ignoring conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.alicea machete music,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.to withstand summary judgment,locke must therefore present definite,competent evidence in support of his claims bald assertions,empty conclusions,rank conjecture,or vitriolic invective will not suffice.pina children place,cir internal quotation marks omitted.proceeding in reverse order,we first address locke claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
good faith and fair dealing 
the district court made quick work of locke good faith and fair dealing claim,recognizing that although massachusetts law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract,in the employment context this doctrine provides merely that an employer is accountable to a discharged employee for unpaid compensation if the employee were terminated in bad faith and the compensation is clearly connected to work already performed.harrison netcentric,see also fortune cash register,because locke nowhere alleged a failure to compensate him for work he had already performed,the district court found this claim baseless.on appeal,locke mounts no meaningful challenge to this conclusion,and our own review of locke complaint reveals no basis for this claim.we accordingly affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to locke claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.
breach of contract 
locke advances two distinct theories as to how airways breached the agreement,arguing that the airline interfered with his application for a security badge at logan airport and precluded him from transferring to an airport in philadelphia,where locke avers that he could have easily gained security clearance.we address each theory in its turn.
badge application 
the november letter from nelson conarroe terminated locke for failing to obtain a security badge and for failing to return to work on october,the date specified in the agreement.locke primarily argues that his inability to obtain a badge was due to wrongful interference from bashar,the station director,placing airways in breach of the agreement.initially,however,locke raises the broader contention that the agreement did not require him to obtain a badge by any particular date and therefore furnished no ground for his termination on november.we address each issue separately.
deadline to obtain badge 
locke correctly points out that the agreement did not expressly state a deadline for him to obtain his badge.nevertheless,such a deadline is plainly implied from the following paragraph of the agreement 
concurrent with employee reinstatement to his former position,employee personnel file will reflect a disciplinary suspension without pay from sept,through employees sic return to work,october.employee and the union understand and agree that reinstatement is contingent upon completion of any preemployment steps required by law,company policy,or the terms of this agreement,including,if applicable,a security screening.
locke implores us to read these adjacent sentences in hermetic isolation,arguing that the time period in the first sentence refers only to the length of the suspension and not the date by when any steps must be completed and that the second sentence in turn does not indicate that the steps must be completed by a particular date.this is too strained a reading.the first sentence specifies october as the date of locke return to work the second sentence renders reinstatement conditional upon completion of a security screening and other preemployment steps.the only reasonable inference is that these steps had to be completed by the date of reinstatement,october.
a cursory review of the agreement backdrop compels the same conclusion.see generally mcadams.mut.life ins,cir under massachusetts law,agreements should be construed with reference to the situation of the parties when they made it and to the objects sought to be accomplished internal quotation marks omitted.the undisputed testimony of robert andrews,locke supervisor,established that the badge was necessary for locke to access the secure areas where he worked.indeed,locke himself testified that his reinstatement was contingent upon obtaining a security badge.because a security badge was a sine qua non of locke return to work both under the language of the agreement and under airport security policies,the agreement is properly construed as requiring locke to obtain a badge by october,the date of his return.
bashar interference 
locke contention that bashar foiled the issuance of his security badge and thereby placed airways in breach of the agreement warrants a somewhat lengthier analysis.at the outset,we note that locke identifies no specific provision of the agreement violated by bashar alleged interference.nevertheless,we accept the underlying premise that if airways prevented locke from obtaining his security badge,airways could not then terminate locke for failing to obtain a badge.see lobosco donovan,a promisor may not avoid his promised performance based on the nonoccurrence of a condition,where the promisor has himself hindered or prevented its occurrence.see also rigs sokol,mass restatement second of contracts cmt.a,illus.in other words,airways could not circumvent its obligations under the agreement simply by making a badge unattainable and thereby preventing locke from fulfilling a condition of his reinstatement.
that said,the record evidence is insufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the badge denial was in fact attributable to bashar and,by extension,to airways although locke points to evidence showing that bashar personally opposed his badge application,he fails to establish a triable issue on whether massport ultimately denied his badge application for that reason rather than because of independent security concerns.
locke claim rests primarily on an email exchange between bashar and massport security officials a few days prior to the november badge denial.on the evening of october,bashar received the following email from captain richard lane of the state police 
the major received a phone call from ltcol smith,msp field services,inquiring why we msp will mt sic give locke his badge back since he has served his two week suspension and us air wants mr locke back at work.ltcol smith still insists that major concannon send him an email on monday morning on whether or not we are going to give mr locke his badge back.
i need to know if usair position has changed on this issue.if it has not,then the aviation security director,concannon position will remain unchanged.
bashar replied late the following evening that usairways is okay with returning tom locke airport badge back to him.roughly ten minutes later,lane sent the following reply,copying concannon and others on the email 
this sudden change in position is extremely disturbing.however,if usair wants tom locke to have a sida badge he must reapply with usair as the sponsor.the process does not allow a badge to simply be in this matter.locke was removed from the system because he was arrested for offenses committed on massport property over a significant amount of time.
his badge was taken because the aviation security director has concerns that someone who would commit such crimes could also be compromised on security.
when and if locke application for a sida badge is filed it will be processed accordingly.
bashar then replied approximately an hour later 
i do not support the decision to return tom locke badge.i was informed by usairways labor relations department responsible for the maintenance department that once a decision was make sic i did not have the authority to prevent him from getting a sida badge.
if you could hold off processing his badge until i have a chance to talk to our legal department on monday i would appreciate.
bashar spoke to airways labor relations department the next day monday,november and was told that it was okay for locke to come back bashar then passed this information along to lane on the same day.concannon issued the letter denying locke badge application on the following day,november.
locke places great weight on bashar statement in the final email that he did not support the decision to return tom locke badge and on bashar accompanying request that the badge processing be held off.in his brief,he further claims that t he massachusetts state police had indicated that bashar direction would mandate that a badge would not be issued and that concannon acknowledged that bashar opposition had been a cause of the of the badge.
these latter allegations are unsupported in the record,however,leaving locke unable to establish a causal nexus between bashar email and massport decision to deny his badge application.although the record provides some tepid support for the proposition that us airways position was germane to the badging decision,there is no indication that bashar personal view had any bearing.indeed,bashar himself stated in the allegedly impugning email that he did not have the authority to prevent locke from getting a sida badge once airways had made a decision to support locke application.nor did bashar correspondence suggest that airways opposed badge issuance in fact,bashar reported that airways was okay with returning tom locke airport badge back to him.
concannon deposition testimony,upon which locke also relies,undermines rather than supports locke case.concannon initially testified that at the time he signed the letter denying locke badge application,his memory was that air was still discussing internally what its position was,and its position may have had some impact on his decision,but he did not make a decision solely based on what air would or would do.he then clarified 
mostly i would say if there was no sponsoring company,the point would be moot,and i would even have to make a decision because they were still discussing internally what their position was a
