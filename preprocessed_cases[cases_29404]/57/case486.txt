background

liason between national representatives,the dealership and the customer,resolving issues to assure complete and shipment of bike and accessories delivery.
the job description also stated the position qualifications,including a m inimum of five years experience in both customer service management and as a supervisor.buchbaum offered cash the position,which provided a annual salary,along with health insurance and vacation after one year.
cash accepted the offer and started working at boston harley on april.his duties included working with various boston harley departments to make sure that they outfitted and delivered each motorcycle according to the particular purchase order.if ordered parts were not installed,he was to contact the service manager,michael sienkiewicz,and tell him what needed to be done.once problems were resolved,cash was to tell the finance department that the motorcycle was ready.that department would then set up a time with the customer for delivery or pickup.cash then tracked the purchased motorcycles it was his job to stay in touch with the customers and make sure that they were satisfied so that they would provide positive reports.
as cash job worked out,he did not coordinate motorcycle ordering,delivery,or part installation.nor did he supervise or manage any employees.however,he attended management meetings,except when buchbaum instructed him not to.at these meetings,cash reported the status of previously ordered motorcycles and their scheduled time for pickup or delivery.often,after cash provided these reports,buchbaum told him to leave the meeting.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court entry of summary judgment.dávila corporación de para la difusión pública,cir.like the district court,we take the facts of record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant here,cash and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.id.summary judgment is appropriate only when the record show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
cash claims 
fair labor standards act 
the fair labor standards act establishes the general rule that employers must compensate each employee at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate for all overtime hours that an employee works.a.the act defines overtime as employment in excess of hours in a single workweek.id.
the act exempts from this general rule certain employees,any employee employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity id.a emphasis added.boston harley contends that cash was such a employee because he served in an administrative capacity.
an employer defending a suit under the act bears the burden of establishing that a particular employee job falls within such an exemption.reich john alden life ins,cir.additionally,the remedial nature of the statute requires that its exemptions be narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within the exemptions terms and spirit.id.quoting arnold ben kanowsky,d.
the secretary of labor has issued regulations that articulate some specific parameters of the exemption.john alden,at see.although the regulations merely state the secretary official position on how the statutes should be interpreted,a court must give them controlling weight unless the court finds them to be arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to the statute.john alden,at citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
according to the regulations,to establish that cash was an employee in a bona fide administrative capacity,boston harley must show that he was an employee 
c ompensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less than per week,exclusive of board,lodging or other facilities 
w hose primary duty is the performance of office or work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer customers and 
w hose primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.
emphasis added 
cash meets the compensation threshold in the regulation he received per week,except for the two weeks he received and.he argues,however,that boston harley did not pay him on a salary basis,because it reduced his pay for these two pay periods.the regulations state that a n employee will be considered to be paid on a salary basis if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a weekly,or less frequent,basis,a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee compensation,which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.id.a.subject to certain exceptions,an exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked.id.the district court,mistakenly stating that cash began work on thursday,august,instead of april,concluded that these two pay periods accurately reflected the weeks cash worked at this time.
regardless of this date error,boston harley prevails on this point.a regulation issued august,provides that an employer shall lose the exemption if the facts demonstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis.id.a.an actual practice of making improper deductions demonstrates this intent.id.emphasis added.an actual practice of making improper deductions is evidenced by the number of improper deductions.id.
we conclude that two aberrant paychecks out of the approximately that cash received do not amount to an actual practice.see kennedy commonwealth edison,cir identifying a few random,isolated,and negligible deductions is not enough to show an actual practice or policy of treating as hourly the theoretically salaried.indeed,even cash stated that he was earning a salary of per week.
accordingly,we conclude that boston harley paid cash on a salary basis.
b primary duty related to management and includes exercise of discretion 
the next questions are whether cash primary duty at boston harley a was the performance of office or work directly related to management or general business operations of boston harley or its customers,and b include d the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.
the term primary duty means the principal,main,major or most important duty that the employee performs.id.determination of an employee primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case,with the major emphasis on the character of the employee job as a whole.id.
the phrase directly related to the management or general business operations in the exemption second requirement refers to the type of work performed by the employee.id.a.to meet this requirement,an employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the business,as distinguished,for example,from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service establishment.id.work directly related to management or general business operations includes work in functional areas such as finance,quality control,and personnel management.id.b.
in general,the exercise of discretion and independent judgment,the exemption third requirement,involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct,and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.id.a.the term matters of significance,to which that discretion must apply,refers to the level of importance or consequence of the work performed.id.
regulation provides examples of employees who generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption.for instance,employees in the industry are generally exempt if their duties include work such as collecting and analyzing information regarding the customer income,assets,investments or debts determining which financial products best meet the customer needs and financial circumstances advising the customer regarding the advantages and disadvantages of different financial products and marketing,servicing or promoting the employer financial products.id.b.on the other hand,a employee whose primary duty is selling financial products does not qualify for the administrative exemption.id.similarly,managers who formulate,interpret,or implement employment policies generally meet the duties requirements for the exemption,but personnel clerks who merely screen applicants to obtain data regarding their minimum qualifications generally do not meet the duties requirements.id.e.
the caselaw is consistent with these examples.in john alden we affirmed a district court grant of summary judgment in favor of a company,concluding that the company marketing worked with outside agents to sell insurance policies to under the administrative exemption.at.the first salary basis requirement was not at issue.the court explained that the marketing representatives duties met the second management requirement because they were engaged in something more than routine selling efforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.rather,their agent contacts were aimed at promoting,increasing,developing,facilitating,maintaining customer sales generally.id.internal quotation marks omitted.their duties also met the third discretion requirement they had discretion in choosing which agents to contact on any given day,and concerning which products to discuss with each agent.id.at.in addition,the marketing representatives rel ied on their own knowledge of an agent business to help tailor proposals for the agent.id.t he content of a given conversation with an agent was dictated by the needs or customer base of that agent,or by the particular information sought by the marketing representative during that phone call.id.at.the court therefore concluded that the marketing representatives were not merely skilled workers who operate d within a strict set of rules,rather,they exercised significant discretion.id.consequently,the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the company.dalheim,cir holding that television station producers jobs did not fit into administrative exemption because they produced the station product and were not involved in the administrative operations.
in the to his employment,cash provided boston harley with his conception of the job that he would assume as the new relations manager.he described these duties as including the following i developing an overall customer service strategic plan ii developing a clear business plan to support organizational changes and iii taking appropriate action regarding delivery problems.
on the job,he performed some,but not all,of the functions that his proposed job description anticipated.he worked with various boston harley departments to ensure that motorcycles were properly outfitted and delivered.if ordered parts were not installed on the motorcycles,cash instructed the service manager concerning what needed to be done.he also was to stay in contact with the customers to make sure that they were happy with the service they were receiving.it is reasonable to infer that his performance of these duties was infused by his broader conception of his responsibilities.
cash employment at boston harley meets the management and discretion requirements of the administrative exemption.first,like the marketing representatives in john alden,cash was engaged in something more than routine selling efforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.at.rather,he focused on improving customer service generally,by coordinating with various boston harley departments to ensure that customers were satisfied with their purchase and that they would provide boston harley with positive feedback reports.b noting that a representative who determin es which financial products best meet the customer needs and financial circumstances is generally exempt,whereas a representative who merely sell s financial products is not.second,just as the marketing representatives in john alden exercised significant discretion by,among other things,fashioning bid proposals that me t the needs of the agent customers,at,cash exercised discretion in reacting to the unique needs of boston harley customers.thus,cash was not merely a skilled worker who operate d within a strict set of rules.id.moreover,in return for performing his duties,he earned a salary,which was greater or equal to that of all the other managers,except for buchbaum.cash attendance at management meetings,albeit in a limited fashion,further supports his status as a manager.in sum,cash did not simply produce a product he exercised independent judgment as he engaged in the company business operations.
cash meets each of requirements under the fair labor standards act boston harley therefore is not liable to pay him overtime wages.
massachusetts minimum fair wages act 
the massachusetts statute governing overtime pay mirrors the fair labor standards act.it states,in relevant part,that e xcept as otherwise provided in this section,no employer in the commonwealth shall employ any of his employees in an occupation for a work week longer than forty hours,unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of forty hours at a rate not less than one and one half times the regular rate at which he is employed.laws ch.the statute also provides for an exception where an employee is employed as a bona fide executive,or administrative or professional person earning more than eighty dollars per week.id.
the basic overtime provision of the massachusetts statute is essentially identical to the fair labor standards act.valerio putnam assocs,cir accord mclaughlin liberty mut.ins,referring to the filing of both claims as r iding that same horse.the supreme judicial court of massachusetts agrees w
