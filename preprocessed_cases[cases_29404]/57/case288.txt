this employment discrimination case presents a threshold question was caroline delia the defendant employee the district court answered in the negative and granted summary judgment to verizon communications,on delia state and federal statutory claims.the court also granted summary judgment to verizon on various common law claims.after careful review of the record,we affirm.
the basis of this lawsuit was caroline delia claim that she was sexually harassed in the workplace by a,and that her employer responded inadequately.her complaint names as defendants verizon communications,verizon directories services east,idearc media services east idearc,and the,malvern smallwood.the complaint alleges sexual harassment,in violation of.laws mgl ch.b and title vii,retaliation,in violation of title vii violation of the americans with disabilities act and state common law claims of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligent failure to provide a safe working environment,and breach of contract.most of the counts were asserted against all defendants the remainder only against idearc and verizon communications verizon verizon is the only defendant in this appeal.
we first sketch the background facts,which are undisputed unless otherwise indicated for roughly sixteen years,delia worked as an artist for idearc.known during almost all of delia time of employment as verizon directories services east,idearc was a subsidiary of verizon directories,which was itself a subsidiary of gte,itself a subsidiary of defendant verizon.during the relevant time period,delia was based in idearc middleton,massachusetts,office,where she was involved in the production of art for advertisements to be included in telephone directories.
defendant smallwood was delia supervisor in the middleton office.delia worked in a cubicle next to smallwood office.she alleged that over a period of several months in smallwood engaged in several acts of harassment.the final alleged incident took place on september,upon smallwood return from vacation.in response to delia handling of a customer problem while he was away,smallwood screamed at her in a threatening way,and berated her such that she feared for her safety and left work.delia never returned to the idearc office.the next day,delia informed her union representative and her department supervising manager that she could not go to the office because she feared smallwood.following an investigation by its human resource and security departments,idearc was unable to substantiate delia complaint and requested that she return to work.on october,delia reported smallwood behavior to verizon employment and ethics hotline.this triggered an investigation conducted by verizon equal employment opportunity eeo personnel,who conducted interviews,reported their findings,and made recommendations for corrective action.the eeo investigators determined that smallwood had engaged in unprofessional conduct,albeit not sexual harassment.idearc issued smallwood a final warning,notifying him that further unprofessional conduct would result in his termination 
various attempts at finding delia suitable alternative working arrangements failed.in october she began receiving disability benefits.when those expired one year later,delia began receiving disability benefits.in addition,in october,delia applied for social security disability benefits.the application was approved in early,effective march.both the disability and social security approvals were premised on delia demonstration that she had been unable to work since september.the final piece of the historical puzzle is that in november,delia filed a charge with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad in which she alleged a hostile work environment,sexual harassment and retaliation under state and federal employment laws.delia eventually removed the matter from the mcad in order to file this action in state court.verizon seasonably removed the action to federal court and subsequently moved for summary judgment.the district court granted verizon motion and this timely appeal followed 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.roberts delta air lines,cir.summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.as did the district court,we must take the record evidence in the light most favorable to delia,against whom summary judgment was entered,and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.farmers ins.exch.rnk,cir.a properly supported motion for summary judgment can not be defeated by relying upon conclusory allegations,improbable references,acrimonious invective,or rank speculation.ahearn shinseki,cir.against this backdrop,we analyze delia substantive legal claims.
sexual harassment,retaliation ada violation 
delia claims that smallwood actions constituted sexual harassment for which verizon is liable,asserting claims under both federal and massachusetts law.mgl ch.verizon argues that it can not be held liable under either statute because it is not delia employer,within the meaning of either statute.the district court agreed,and so do we.
both title vii and chapter protect employees from harassment.see alberty velez corporacion de puerto rico para la difusion publica,cir title vii modern.comm against discrimination,ch.but neither the federal nor state statutes contain definitions of employee that are of much use here.see nationwide mut.ins.darden,noting that statutory definition of employee in title vii is completely circular and explains nothing comey hill,recognizing that ch.defines employer and employee only in the negative 
we have construed supreme court decisions as establishing the proposition that the terms employer and employee under title vii are to be defined with reference to common law agency principles.lopez massachusetts,cir.as a further refinement,we have held that the element of control by the putative employer over the putative employee is the principal guidepost that should be followed id.at.similarly,we have noted that massachusetts cases have determined that an employer can be defined by who has direction and control of the employee and to whom the employee owe s obedience in respect of the performance of his work.roberts,at cir quoting fleming shaheen.
in this case,delia claims there are multiple issues of material fact regarding verizon control of her workplace.first,citing an affidavit that she submitted to the district court,delia claims she was an employee of verizon for years.such a conclusory statement is of little utility in trying to determine the nature and extent of the parties legal relationship.we do not doubt that delia may have thought verizon was her employer,but her subjective belief alone is insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact.wilson moulison,cir rejecting plaintiff subjective belief that was her supervisor,upon which claim against her employer was based lee crespo schering plough del caribe,cir observing that,in constructive discharge case,an employee subjective perceptions of working conditions do not govern.
next,delia premises an employment relationship with verizon on her assertion that she worked in verizon middleton,massachusetts,office and that her key card,which electronically controlled access to the office,bore verizon logo.but,as to the building,delia does not dispute that it was idearc office,her own subjective belief notwithstanding.nor is the logo on the key card indicating that the card itself is property of verizon probative of an employment relationship with verizon.while the key may literally control access to the building,it bears no relevance to the type of control necessary to establish the identity of delia employer.see camacho ports,cir rejecting claim that port authority was harbor pilots employer even though it issued pilots licenses because it did not behave as pilots employer in any practical sense.
delia next claims that verizon code of business conduct the code established various terms of her employment,and thus makes her a verizon employee.this claim does not withstand serious scr
