plaintiff appellant verizon new england,verizon appeals from an order dismissing its federal court action against the rhode island department of labor and training ridlt and claimant members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew,local,who claimed unemployment benefits following a work stoppage at verizon claimants.after careful consideration,we affirm the district court dismissal,but on the singular ground that dismissal is warranted under the younger abstention doctrine.
background 
factual background 
verizon was a party to a collective bargaining agreement cba with six ibew local unions the system council t,which included local.the cba was in effect from august,until august.between june,and august,the parties to the cba attempted to reach a new agreement through negotiations.during said negotiations,on july,verizon sent a letter to system council t notifying them in writing that,if we do not reach a new agreement by august,the arbitration provisions of the various labor contracts would not be in effect for grievances.
verizon and system council t were unable to reach a new agreement before the cba expired.system council t called for a work stoppage,and its members commenced picketing verizon facilities and remote work sites in new england.on or around august,verizon reached an agreement with system council t under which the members of the various unions would return to work under the terms of the expired cba.after the employees returned to work,approximately members of the various unions employed by verizon in rhode island applied for unemployment benefits before ridlt.
on august,the director of ridlt denied the claimants application for unemployment benefits,concluding that they became unemployed as a result of a strike and were thus barred from such benefits under section of the rhode island employment security act.section a of that act provides that an individual will not be entitled to benefits if he or she became unemployed because of a strike or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which he or she was employed,but section b,which governs lockouts,provides that an individual is entitled to benefits if unemployment is a result of his or her employer withholding of employment for the purpose of resisting collective bargaining demands or gaining collective bargaining concessions.
the claimants appealed the director denial of unemployment benefits to the ridlt board of review.on may,the board reversed the director denial of unemployment benefits and found that the claimants were entitled to receive unemployment benefits under section b.specifically,the board found a series of actions on the part of verizon to have constituted a constructive and actual lockout,including deleting of the arbitration provisions,which created a substantial change to the status quo allowing claimants to return to work if the current cba were modified by removing the arbitration provisions denying claimants access to verizon computers for employer business and claimants personal business,accounts,health insurance,sick and vacation time,in preparation for the impending job action collecting claimants cards,cell phones,laptops,various other tools and equipment locking doors,chaining gates,and,at various work sites,having no personnel to allow claimants access to work and violating its past practice of allowing employees to work under an expired unmodified agreement.the board also found that record testimony established that the constructive lockout morphed into an actual lockout when the employer took overt actions of chaining gates,locking doors,failing to staff security kiosks,and denying access to its computer system.verizon appealed the board decision to the sixth division district court,providence county,rhode island,where it remains pending.
procedural history 
while the matter was pending before the state court,verizon filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of rhode island challenging the board decision and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.specifically,verizon argued that the board decision should not be enforced as it was preempted by the national labor relations act nlra.
ridlt moved to dismiss verizon complaint for failure to state a claim on two grounds the board decision was not preempted by the nlra and in the alternative,the district court should abstain from hearing the matter under the younger abstention doctrine.the district court agreed with ridlt and dismissed the complaint on both grounds.on the preemption issue,it held that the supreme court decision in new york telephone new york state department of labor,which held that the nlra does not preempt a state ability to provide strikers unemployment benefits,governed.as to abstention,it held that the action must be dismissed as having met the applicable requirements under younger.verizon filed this timely appeal challenging both grounds of dismissal.
ii.discussion 
for purposes of this appeal,we accept as true the factual allegations in verizon complaint and draw all reasonable inferences from those allegations in its favor.lass bank of america,cir.since we find that the proper route in this case is to abstain from hearing it under younger harris,we do not reach the merits of verizon preemption claim.we thus proceed directly to discuss our abstention reasoning.
ongoing state court proceedings and younger abstention 
this court reviews a district court dismissal of a complaint on a motion to dismiss de novo.lass,at.we also review de novo whether younger mandates a district court abstention.colonial life accident ins.medley,cir.
in younger,the supreme court held that abstention is required where a plaintiff defending criminal charges in state court sought to have the federal court enjoin the ongoing state criminal proceedings.younger doctrine has been extended to civil actions,and is most commonly applied to suits seeking declaratory or injunctive relief.rossi gemma,cir.based on principles of comity,the doctrine instructs that,unless there are extraordinary circumstances,federal courts should not interfere with ongoing litigation,or,in some cases,with state administrative proceedings.id.quoting maymo meléndez álvarez ramírez,cir.in this circuit,abstention is appropriate when the requested relief would interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding that implicates an important state interest and that provides an adequate opportunity for the federal plaintiff to advance his federal constitutional challenge.id.at.
verizon does not seem to challenge that the three criteria for younger abstention were met here,and we agree with the district court that they were verizon focuses instead on the availability of an exception to the younger abstention doctrine when a preemption claim is facially conclusive.
the facially conclusive preemption exception evolved out of the supreme court suggestion in new orleans public service,city of new orleans nopsi,that younger abstention may not be appropriate if the federal plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury absent equitable relief.id.at quoting younger,at see also colonial life,at.the court offered an example of such an injury upon a showing that the challenged state statute is flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions.nopsi,at quoting younger,at.a facially conclusive claim of preemption,it found,could be sufficient to render abstention inappropriate.id.at.the court,however,did not elaborate on when such an exception would be applicable since it held that the proceedings and order at issue did not meet th e description of such a facially conclusive claim.id.it did explain that merely showing a substantial claim of federal preemption would not be enough,and stated that w hat requires further factual inquiry can hardly be deemed flagrantly unlawful for purposes of a threshold abstention determination.id.at.
subsequent to nopsi,this and other circuits have explicitly recognized that an exception to abstention exists where preemption is facially conclusive or readily apparent.see colonial life,at chaulk.comm against discrimination,cir see also midwe
