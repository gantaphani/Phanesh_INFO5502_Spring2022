petitioner kasten brought an antiretaliation suit against his former employer,respondent,under the fair labor standards act of act,which provides minimum wage,maximum hour,and overtime pay rules and which forbids employers to discharge any employee because such employee has filed any complaint alleging a violation of the act,a.in a related suit,the district court found that violated the act by placing timeclocks in a location that prevented workers from receiving credit for the time they spent donning and doffing protective gear.in this suit kasten claims that he was discharged because he orally complained to company officials about the timeclocks.the district court granted summary judgment,concluding that the act antiretaliation provision did not cover oral complaints.the seventh circuit affirmed.

a the interpretation of the statutory phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the statute purpose and context,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.dolan postal service.the text,taken alone,can not provide a conclusive answer here.some dictionary definitions of filed contemplate a writing while others permit using file in conjunction with oral material.in addition to dictionary definitions,state statutes and federal regulations sometimes contemplate oral filings,and contemporaneous judicial usage shows that oral filings were a known phenomenon at the time of the act passage.even if filed,considered alone,might suggest a narrow interpretation limited to writings,any complaint suggests a broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.thus,the phrase,taken by itself,can not answer the interpretive question.the act other references to filed also do not resolve the linguistic question.some of those provisions involve filed material that is virtually always in writing others specifically require a writing,and the remainder,like the provision here,leave the question unresolved.since filed any complaint lends itself linguistically to the broader,oral interpretation,the use of broader language in other statutes antiretaliation provisions does not indicate whether congress did or did not intend to leave oral grievances unprotected here.because the text,taken alone,might,or might not,encompass oral complaints,the court must look further.

given the delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies,their views about the meaning of the phrase should be given a degree of weight.the secretary of labor has consistently held the view that filed any complaint covers both oral and written complaints.the equal employment opportunity commission has set out a similar view in its compliance manual and in multiple briefs.these views are reasonable and consistent with the act.and the length of time they have been held suggests that they reflect careful consideration,not post hoc rationalizatio n.motor vehicle mfrs.of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins.

kevin kasten,petitioner performance plastics corporation 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the fair labor standards act of act sets forth employment rules concerning minimum wages,maximum hours,and overtime pay.stat,et.the act contains an antiretaliation provision that forbids employers 
to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to the act,or has testified or is about to testify in such proceeding,or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.a emphasis added.
we must decide whether the statutory term filed any complaint includes oral as well as written complaints within its scope.we conclude that it does.
the petitioner,kevin kasten,brought this antiretaliation lawsuit against his former employer,performance plastics corporation.kasten says that located its timeclocks between the area where kasten and other workers put on and take off their protective gear and the area where they carry out their assigned tasks.that location prevented workers from receiving credit for the time they spent putting on and taking off their work clothes contrary to the act requirements.in a related suit the district court agreed with kasten,finding that practice of not compensating for time spent donning and doffing certain required protective gear and walking to work areas violated the act.kasten performance plastics,supp,wd.in this suit kasten claims unlawful retaliation.he says that discharged him because he orally complained to officials about the timeclocks.
in particular,kasten says that he repeatedly called the unlawful timeclock location to attention in accordance with internal procedure.see brief for petitioner quoting code of ethics and business conduct as imposing upon every employee the responsibility to report suspected violations of any applicable law of which he or she becomes aware at quoting employee policy handbook as instructing employees with questions,complaints,and problems to c ontact their supervisor s immediately and if necessary take the issue to the next level of management,then to the local human resources manager,then to human resources personnel at the regional or headquarters level.
kasten adds that he raised a concern with his shift supervisor that it was illegal for the time clocks to be where they were because of exclusion of the time you come in and start doing stuff he told a human resources employee that if they were to get challenged on the location in court,they would lose he told his lead operator that the location was illegal and that he was thinking about starting a lawsuit about the placement of the time clocks and he told the human resources manager and the operations manager that he thought the location was illegal and that the company would lose in court.record in wd,doc,deposition of kevin kasten.this activity,kasten concludes,led the company to discipline him and,in december,to dismiss him.
presents a different version of events.it denies that kasten made any significant complaint about the timeclock location.and it says that it dismissed kasten simply because kasten,after being repeatedly warned,failed to record his comings and goings on the timeclock.
for present purposes we accept kasten version of these contested events as valid.see scott harris.that is because the district court entered summary judgment in favor.supp,wd.and it did so,not because it doubted kasten ability to prove the facts he alleged,but because it thought the act did not protect oral complaints,at.on appeal,the seventh circuit agreed with the district court that the act antiretaliation provision does not cover oral complaints.
kasten sought certiorari.and in light of conflict among the circuits as to whether an oral complaint is protected,we granted kasten petition.compare hagan echostar satellite,antiretaliation provision covers oral complaints lambert ackerley,en banc same with lambert genesee hospital,antiretaliation provision does not cover informal complaints to supervisors.see also pacheco whiting farms,antiretaliation provision covers unofficial assertion of rights eeoc white son enterprises,same moore freeman,assuming without discussion that oral complaints are covered brennan maxey yamaha,same.
the sole question presented is whether an oral complaint of a violation of the fair labor standards act is protected conduct under the act provision.pet.for cert.i.the act protects employees who have filed any complaint,a,and interpretation of this phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis,dolan postal service.this analysis leads us to conclude that the language of the provision,considered in isolation,may be open to competing interpretations.but considering the provision in conjunction with the purpose and context leads us to conclude that only one interpretation is permissible.
we begin with the text of the statute.the word filed has different relevant meanings in different contexts.some dictionary definitions of the word contemplate a writing.see,webster new international dictionary ed.def.a to file is to deliver a paper or instrument to the proper officer so that it is received by him to be kept on file,or among the records of his office emphasis added webster ninth new collegiate dictionary def.a one definition of file is to place among official records as prescribed by law 
but other dictionaries provide different definitions that permit the use of the word file in conjunction with oral material.one can,for example,file an oral statement that enters a matter into the order of business.funk wagnalls new standard dictionary of the english language ed.def.to file is to present in the regular way,as to a judicial or legislative body,so that it shall go upon the records or into the order of business this possibility is significant because it means that dictionary meanings,even if considered alone,do not necessarily limit the scope of the statutory phrase to written complaints.crawford metropolitan government of nashville and davidson,slip,at looking for the limits of a linguistic phrase rather than what exemplif ies its application.
in addition to the dictionary definitions,we have found that legislators,administrators,and judges have all sometimes used the word file in conjunction with oral statements.thus state statutes sometimes contemplate oral filings.see,alaska stat.a file a verbal or written complaint cal.health safety code ann.a west file an administrative complaint orally or in writing code a b filing his or her grievance,orally or in writing code ann.a,c,b to file a grievance,a person may submit an oral or written complaint code a file a grievance orally or in writing me.stat,tit,b filed through an oral request code ann.file a written or oral complaint stat.to have a complaint filed,a person shall write or cause to be written his grievance or shall state it orally stat.a,a oral or written complaint filed stat.ann.west written or oral complaint may be filed ins.law ann.a,a west file a grievance orally pub.health law ann.g west supp.file a grievance orally stat,tit,a b purdon file a written or oral complaint ins.code ann.a b west oral or written complaint must be file d code,complaints have been filed as the result of either an oral or a written complaint 
regulations promulgated by various federal agencies sometimes permit complaints to be filed orally.see,cfr f iling a claim may proceed orally or in writing cfr d file a grievance either orally or in writing d same b i file a grievance either orally or in writing e file an oral or written grievance cfr c f iling of motions must be in writing or orally on the record italics omitted cfr b ii file an appeal either orally or in writing 
and a review of contemporaneous judicial usage,utah evans,shows that oral filings were a known phenomenon when the act was passed.see,reed oil cain,appellee filed an oral complaint tingler lahti,complaint subsequently filed,either oral or written ex parte mosgrove.cr,only complaint filed against him was oral complaint of the town marshal indian fred state,filed an oral motion to quash dunn state.cr,filed an oral demurrer morrison lewis.app,filed an oral motion demurring brock cullum.civ.app.filed an oral motion to quash fike allen.civ.app.filed oral pleadings 
filings may more often be made in writing.see,ritter united states,finding words file a claim for refund to require a written request in context of tax code.but we are interested in the filing of any complaint.so even if the word filed,considered alone,might suggest a narrow interpretation limited to writings,the phrase any complaint suggests a broad interpretation that would include an oral complaint.see,republic of iraq beaty,slip,at.the upshot is that the phrase,taken by itself,can not answer the interpretive question.
we can look further to other appearances of the word filed in the act.see mci telecommunications american telephone telegraph,examining contextual indications of the meaning of a term.that word or a variant appears in numerous other provisions.but its appearance elsewhere in the act does not resolve the linguistic question before us.some of those other provisions involve filed material that,unlike a complaint,is of a kind that is virtually always in writing.see,l employers must have on file an unexpired certificate emphasis added a secretary must file in the court the record of the industry committee emphasis added ibid.industry committee must file its findings and recommendations.others specifically require a writing,see,c a requiring employee consent in writing to join collective action to be filed emphasis added b same.and the remainder leave the oral written question unresolved just as does the provision before us.see,b prohibiting a stay unless movant file s in court an undertaking emphasis added c a employee may file a petition for review of a special wage rate emphasis added.
looking beyond the act,we find other statutes that contain antiretaliation provisions.those statutes,however,use somewhat different language.see,a protecting an employee who has filed charges or given testimony d protecting those who opposed any unlawful practice emphasis added a,a same a similar.see also,a,supp.iii provided to the employer information relating to any violation emphasis added a similar c filed or made a complaint emphasis added a a notified his employer emphasis added a provided information emphasis added a same.some of this language is broader than the phrase before us,but,given the fact that the phrase before us lends itself linguistically to the broader,oral interpretation,the use of broader language elsewhere may mean that congress wanted to limit the scope of the phrase before us to writings,or that congress did not believe the different phraseology made a significant difference in this respect.the language alone does not tell us whether congress,if intending to protect orally expressed grievances elsewhere,did or did not intend to leave those oral grievances unprotected here.
the bottom line is that the text,taken alone,can not provide a conclusive answer to our interpretive question.the phrase filed any complaint might,or might not,encompass oral complaints.we must look further.
several functional considerations indicate that congress intended the antiretaliation provision to cover oral,as well as written,complaint s.first,an interpretation that limited the provision coverage to written complaints would undermine the act basic objectives.the act seeks to prohibit labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,efficiency,and general of workers.a.it does so in part by setting forth substantive wage,hour,and overtime standards.it relies for enforcement of these standards,not upon continuing detailed federal supervision or inspection of payrolls,but upon information and complaints received from employees seeking to vindicate rights claimed to have been denied.mitchell robert demario jewelry.and its antiretaliation provision makes this enforcement scheme effective by preventing fear of economic retaliation from inducing workers quietly to accept substandard conditions.ibid.
why would congress want to limit the enforcement scheme effectiveness by inhibiting use of the act complaint procedure by those who would find it difficult to reduce their complaints to writing,particularly illiterate,less educated,or overworked workers president franklin roosevelt pointed out at the time that these were the workers most in need of the act help.see message to congress,may,doc,seeking a bill to help the poorest of those who toil in factory 
in the years prior to the passage of the act,illiteracy rates were particularly high among the poor.see gordon gordon,literacy in america of world war i conscripts were illiterate of commerce,bureau of census,sixteenth census of the united states,population the labor force sample statistics occupational characteristics of manufacturing laborers in had less than five years of schooling.those rates remained high in certain industries for many years after the act passage.in,for example,the national war labor board wrote 
in many plants where there is a high degree of illiteracy,the writing of grievances by employees works a substantial hardship.in other plants where there is considerable dirt and special clothes must be worn,it is often not practicable to write up grievances during work hours.the termination report of the national war labor board.
to limit the scope of the antiretaliation provision to the filing of written complaints would also take needed flexibility from those charged with the act enforcement.it could prevent government agencies from using hotlines,interviews,and other oral methods of receiving complaints.and insofar as the antiretaliation provision covers complaints made to employers a matter we need not decide,see infra,at,it would discourage the use of desirable informal workplace grievance procedures to secure compliance with the act.burlington industries,ellerth,reading title vii to encourage the development of effective grievance procedures to deter misconduct mcpherson,gates,rogers,resolving grievances a practical approach describing the significant benefits of unwritten complaints.
given the need for effective enforcement of the national labor relations act nlra,this court has broadly interpreted the language of the nlra antiretaliation provision filed charges or given testimony,a as protecting workers who neither filed charges nor were called formally to testify but simply participate d in a national labor relations board investigation.nlrb scrivener,emphasis added.the similar enforcement needs of this related statute argue for an interpretation of the word complaint that would provide broad rather than narrow protection to the employee,at and would do so here without pressing statutory language to its limit.see also tennessee coal,iron muscoda local,the act remedial and humanitarian purpose cautions against narrow,grudging interpretations of its language.
replies that worker protection is not the only relevant statutory objective.the act also seeks to establish an enforcement system that is fair to employers.to do so,the employer must have fair notice that an employee is making a complaint that could subject the employer to a later claim of retaliation.if oral complaints suffice,adds,employers too often will be left in a state of uncertainty about whether an employee particularly an employee who seems unusually angry at the moment is in fact making a complaint about an act violation or just letting off steam.
we agree with that the statute requires fair notice.although the dictionary definitions,statutes,regulations,and judicial opinions we considered,see supra,at,do not distinguish between writings and oral statements,they do suggest that a filing is a serious occasion,rather than a triviality.as such,the phrase filed any complaint contemplates some degree of formality,certainly to the point where the recipient has been given fair notice that a grievance has been lodged and does,or should,reasonably understand the matter as part of its business concerns.
moreover,the statute prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee because such employee has filed any complaint.a emphasis added.and it is difficult to see how an employer who does not or should not know an employee has made a complaint could discriminate because of that complaint.but we also believe that a fair notice requirement does not necessarily mean that notice must be in writing.
at oral argument,the government said that a complaint is filed when a reasonable,objective person would have understood the employee to have put the employer on notice that the employee is asserting statutory rights under the act.tr.of oral arg.we agree.to fall within the scope of the antiretaliation provision,a complaint must be sufficiently clear and detailed for a reasonable employer to understand it,in light of both content and context,as an assertion of rights protected by the statute and a call for their protection.this standard can be met,however,by oral complaints,as well as by written ones.
second,given congress delegation of enforcement powers to federal administrative agencies,we also give a degree of weight to their views about the meaning of this enforcement language.see c vesting enforcement power in secretary of labor reorganization plan of,app,transferring to equal employment opportunity commission eeoc enforcement of this antiretaliation provision as part of its equal pay act enforcement responsibilities skidmore swift,giving weight to a persuasive articulation of views within an agency area of expertise.
the secretary of labor has consistently held the view that the words filed any complaint cover oral,as well as written,complaints.the department of labor articulated that view in an enforcement action filed many years ago,goldberg zenger,cch lc,d utah.it has subsequently reaffirmed that view in briefs.see,brief for secretary of labor as amicus curiae supporting petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing en banc in lambert ackerley.and more recently it has acted in accordance with that view by creating a hotline to receive oral complaints,see of labor,compliance assistance by law the fair labor standards act flsa,as visited,and available in clerk of court case file directing participants who wish to file a complaint to contact a local office or call the department wage and hour help line at 
the eeoc has set forth a similar view in its compliance manual,vol,b,and,and in multiple briefs,see,brief for eeoc as amicus curiae in support of petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing en banc in lambert ackerley,brief for appellee in eeoc white son enterprises.
these agency views are reasonable.they are consistent with the act.the length of time the agencies have held them suggests that they reflect careful consideration,not post hoc rationalizatio n.motor vehicle mfrs.of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins.and they consequently add force to our conclusion.skidmore,supra,at united states mead,court sometimes finds judicial deference intended even in absence of rulemaking authority babbitt sweet home chapter,communities for great,and agency views,where the law counsels deference,can clarify otherwise ambiguous statutory provisions.
finally,we note that invokes the rule of lenity in support of its written complaint interpretation.that rule applies primarily to the interpretation of criminal statutes.it leads us to favor a more lenient interpretation of a criminal statute when,after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction,we are left with an ambiguous statute.united states shabani.we agree with that those who violate the antiretaliation provision before us are subject to criminal sanction,a.and we have said that the rule of lenity can apply when a statute with criminal sanctions is applied in a noncriminal context.see leocal ashcroft.but after engaging in traditional methods of statutory interpretation,we can not find that the statute remains sufficiently ambiguous to warrant application of the rule of lenity here.
alternatively,claims that it should prevail because kasten complained to a private employer,not to the government and,in view,the antiretaliation provision applies only to complaints filed with the government.advanced this claim in the lower courts,which held to the contrary,at supp,at.but said nothing about it in response to kasten petition for certiorari.indeed,it did not mention the claim in this court until it filed its brief on the merits.
we do not normally consider a separate legal question not raised in the certiorari briefs.see this court rule caterpillar lewis.we see no reason to make an exception here.resolution of the employer question is not a predicate to an intelligent resolution of the question that we granted certiorari to decide.see ibid.quoting ohio robinette.that is to say,we can decide the question separately on its own.and we have done so.thus,we state no view on the merits of alternative claim.post,at scalia,dissenting.
we conclude that the seventh circuit erred in determining that oral complaints can not fall within the scope of the phrase filed any complaint in the act antiretaliation provision.we leave it to the lower courts to decide whether kasten will be able to satisfy the act notice requirement.we vacate the circuit judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
justice kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
kevin kasten,petitioner performance plastics corporation 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice scalia,with whom justice thomas joins as to all but footnote,dissenting.
the seventh circuit found for the employer because it held that the fair labor standards act of flsa,a,covers only written complaints to the employer.i would affirm the judgment on the ground that a does not cover complaints to the employer at all.
the flsa retaliation provision states that it shall be unlawful 
to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter,or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding,or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.ibid.
the phrase central to the outcome here is filed any complaint.in the courts below,kasten asserted a claim for retaliation based solely on allegations that he filed oral complaints with his employer argued that the retaliation provision protects only complaints that are in writing,and made to judicial or administrative bodies.i agree with at least the second part of contention.the plain meaning of the critical phrase and the context in which appears make clear that the retaliation provision contemplates an official grievance filed with a court or an agency,not oral complaints or even formal,written complaints from an employee to an employer.
in isolation,the word complaint could cover kasten objection it often has an expansive meaning,connoting any e xpression of grief,regret,pain or resentment.webster new international dictionary ed.hereinafter webster.but at the time the flsa was passed and still today the word when used in a legal context has borne a specialized meaning a formal allegation or charge against a party,made or presented to the appropriate court or officer.ibid.see also cambridge dictionary of american english a formal statement to a government authority that you have a legal cause to complain about the way you have been treated oxford english dictionary ed.a statement or injury or grievance laid before a court or judicial authority for purposes of prosecution or of redress 
there are several reasons to think that the word bears its specialized meaning here.first,every other use of the word complaint in the flsa refers to an official filing with a governmental body.sections b and c both state that the right to bring particular types of actions shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the secretary of labor,and c clarifies that the statute of limitations begins running in actions to recover unpaid wages on the date when the complaint is filed.these provisions unquestionably use complaint in the narrow legal sense.identical words used in different parts of a statute are presumed to have the same meaning absent contrary indication,ibp,alvarez,sullivan stroop.it is one thing to expand the meaning of complaint in a to include complaints filed with an agency instead of a court it is quite something else to wrench it from the legal context entirely,to include an employee objection to an employer.
second,the word complaint appears as part of the phrase filed any complaint and thus draws meaning from the verb with which it is connected.the choice of the word filed rather than a broader alternative like made,if it does not connote as the seventh circuit believed,and as i need not consider something in writing,at least suggests a degree of formality consistent with legal action and inconsistent at least in the less regulated work environment of with complaints.it is noteworthy that every definition of the verb filed that the court opinion provides,whether it supports the inclusion of oral content or not,envisions a formal,prescribed process of delivery or submission.ante,at comparing,for example,webster to file is to deliver a paper or instrument to the proper officer with funk wagnalls new standard dictionary of the english language ed.to file is to present in the regular way,as to a judicial or legislative body 
moreover,t he law uses familiar legal expressions in their familiar legal sense,henry united states.it is,i suppose,possible to speak of filing a complaint with an employer,but that is assuredly not common usage.thus,when the antiretaliation provision of the mine health and safety act used that phrase in a context that includes both complaints to an agency and complaints to the employer,it did not use filed alone,but supplemented that with or made and to boot specified including a complaint notifying the mine operator of an alleged danger or safety or health violation.c 
third,the phrase filed any complaint appears alongside three other protected activities institut ing or caus ing to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter,testif ying in any such proceeding,and serv ing on an industry committee.a.since each of these three activities involves an interaction with governmental authority,we can fairly attribute this characteristic to the phrase filed any complaint as well.that several
