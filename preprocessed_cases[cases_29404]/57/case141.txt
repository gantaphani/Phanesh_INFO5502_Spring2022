santiago acevedo p√©rez acevedo was an employee with united states immigration and customs enforcement ice in the department of homeland security dhs.following the denial of his administrative claim for employment discrimination on the basis of age and national origin,he filed a lawsuit claiming liability under the age discrimination in employment act,title vii of the civil rights act of,section,the federal torts claims act,and puerto rico law.the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendants on the grounds that the plaintiff did not present an ftca claim in his administrative complaint and that the other claims were.we affirm.
background 
acevedo was stationed in the san juan office.in july of,dhs headquarters in washington,was short of personnel and sought special agent volunteers at least two volunteers from the san juan office for lateral transfers.
the special agent in charge of the san juan office asked for volunteers to transfer.at least one employee,edward owens,volunteered and his transfer was approved.in order to fill the other transfer slot,the special agent in charge prepared a list of four agents based on seniority.on or about september,acevedo received a letter from the director of ice informing him of his reassignment to dhs headquarters.acevedo accepted the reassignment on september.
due to family problems,acevedo requested two extensions of time to relocate,which were granted by dhs.his third request for an extension of time was denied.on march,acevedo decided to retire rather than transfer.
on june,acevedo filed a complaint of employment discrimination with the office of equal employment opportunity and diversity division of dhs eeo alleging that he was constructively discharged on the basis of his age or national origin.the eeo ultimately denied acevedo claim in.it sent him a letter explaining the decision as well as a notice of appeal rights also called the right to sue letter,which he received on july.
acevedo commenced this action on september.his complaint alleges that he was forced to resign constructive discharge and that he was humiliated,retaliated,discriminated,harassed,and persecuted by his supervisors and his peers.he asserts claims under the age discrimination in employment act adea,and title vii of the civil rights act of title vii.acevedo also asserts a claim under that his constitutional right to due process has been violated,as well as claims under the federal torts claims act ftca,and articles and of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit.
defendants moved for summary judgment.finding the record incomplete on the issue of whether the action was timely filed,the district court ordered acevedo to supplement it by providing the right to sue letter the final determination of the eeo.after acevedo provided the requested documentary evidence,the court held a hearing and found the action by one day.before judgment was entered reflecting that ruling,plaintiff filed a motion seeking an order that the remaining claims,other than employment discrimination under the adea and title vii,were not.the district court denied that motion and entered judgment for the defendants on all claims this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
the decision appealed from here is the district court denial of plaintiff motion seeking an order that his claims are not and may proceed.the court ruling in effect completed its consideration of defendants motion for summary judgment,and we thus treat its decision as a grant of summary judgment for the defendants on all claims.accordingly,we review the decision de novo,dominguez cruz suttle caribe,cir,and may find that summary judgment was properly granted only if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
area and title vii 
upon ruling on acevedo claims the eeo issued a notice of appeal rights to him,which he received on july.the notice stated in pertinent part 
you have the right to appeal to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc or to file a civil action in an appropriate united states district court 
filing an appeal with eeoc 
you have the right to appeal this decision to eeoc within days of the day you receive this final decision 
filing a civil action 
you also have the right to file a civil action in an appropriate united states district court within days after you receive this final decision if you do not appeal to eeoc,or within days after receipt of eeoc final decision on appeal.you may also file a civil action after days from the date of filing an appeal with eeoc if there has been no final decision by eeoc.
acevedo filed his complaint in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico on september,days after receiving this notice.acevedo concedes on appeal,as he did before the district court,that his complaint was not timely with respect to the discrimination claims raised before the eeo.hence,we need not further address those claims 
ftca claims 
acevedo argues that the district court erred in finding that the entire action was time barred because he had an addendum to the eeo complaint that served as an administrative complaint for the purposes of the ftca.thus,he maintains that the complaint was timely as to the alleged ftca claim because,under the ftca,he had days from receipt of the final agency decision to file the complaint.
the ftca explicitly provides that 
an action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the united states for money damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail.
a emphasis added.
acevedo submitted his eeo complaint,accompanied by the addendum at issue,on june.the complaint itself indicated that he was alleging discrimination on the bases of national origin and age.the addendum discusses only those discrimination claims.in the context of describing the national origin discrimination claim,acevedo makes a seemingly allegation about the improper use of funds that he maintains should have been used only in puerto rico rather than for the relocation of employees to the dhs main office.acevedo links the funding issue to national origin discrimination,rather than raising an independent tort claim based on it.
after acevedo submitted his eeo complaint,he received a letter,dated june,formally acknowledging the complaint.the letter stated,in pertinent part 
your complaint has been assigned number hs ice and has been accepted on the bases of age and national origin puerto please be advised that all other references contained in the formal complaint will be used as background information to support the issues as stated.if you wish to report additional allegations or incidents,they must be submitted to the director,eeo,in writing.
acevedo submitted no document attempting to report additional allegations to the director.the eeo issued its final decision denying acevedo discrimination claims without making any reference to a potential ftca claim.
based on the documentation,which is all uncontested evidence in this matter,there can be no dispute that acevedo failed to present an ftca claim to the eeo.accordingly,acevedo has not exhausted his claim as required under a and,hence,he is not permitted to pursue an ftca claim in this action.we thus agree with the district court that,to the extent that the complaint asserts an ftca claim,it must be dismissed.
constitutional claims 
acevedo also argues that his complaint states a constitutional tort claim under for violation of the due process clause.specifically,he argues that he was deprived of a property interest his position at dhs without due process of law.
however,it is that claims borrow the forum state statute of limitations.see city of rancho palos verdes abrams,in puerto rico,the applicable limitations period is one year.se
