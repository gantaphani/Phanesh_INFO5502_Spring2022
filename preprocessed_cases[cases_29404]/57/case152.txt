the employee retirement income security act of erisa governs employee benefit plans.et.among other things,the statute permits beneficiaries to go to court to challenge their plan decision to deny or cut off their benefits.id.a b.before filing suit,however,beneficiaries must first use or,as it is often put,exhaust their plan procedures for making claims.madera marsh usa,cir.the main question for us concerns which document a benefit plan must use to set forth those procedures.
the beneficiary who brings this appeal,michele tetreault,argues that erisa requires a benefit plan to use one particular type of document,which the statute calls the written instrument.a.and she further argues that we should excuse her failure to comply with what her benefit plan contends was one of its claims procedures a day deadline for filing an internal appeal of an adverse benefits decision because the benefit plan written instrument did not mention it.but tetreault is mistaken on that point.that is because the written instrument in this case expressly incorporated a document that clearly sets forth the appeals deadline.for that reason,we affirm the district court decision to dismiss tetreault benefits challenge.we also affirm the district court dismissal of tetreault two other erisa claims,which,respectively,are for statutory penalties and for breach of fiduciary duty.
michele tetreault injured her back in while working as a store manager at the limited,a nationwide clothing retailer.she then filed a claim under the limited disability benefit plan,which is called the limited long term disability program.the benefit plan initially denied tetreault claim but then,in,reversed course after tetreault successfully challenged the denial in court.
the situation changed yet again in.by then,reliance standard life insurance company had started administering claims for the limited long term disability program.in that role,reliance standard informed tetreault on december that,after reviewing her medical records,it had determined she could perform sedentary work and thus was no longer eligible for the benefits she had been receiving.reliance standard also informed tetreault at that time that she could appeal the decision in writing to reliance standard,but that she would have to do so within days of your receipt of this letter or the last date to which we have paid,whichever is later.
on january,tetreault counsel wrote to reliance standard and requested t he summary plan description and the plan documents for the ltd plan.tetreault counsel also requested that reliance standard provide a complete copy of tetreault file in reliance possession.
nine days later,reliance standard responded.it sent tetreault counsel the requested file,which contained certain of her medical records as well as other documents that related to her claim for benefits.reliance standard also sent the document that established the version of the benefit plan.that document made no reference to an appeals deadline.
reliance standard did not at that time send the summary plan description tetreault counsel had requested.reliance standard also did not send some other documents that,though not then in its possession,are relevant to the merits of tetreault arguments to this court.these documents concerned a version of the limited long term disability program.they included both the document that established that version of the benefit plan and another document that described its terms.this last document,which identified itself as the summary plan description,set forth the day deadline for making an internal appeal of an adverse benefit decision.
on june,four days before the day period was set to run out tetreault counsel sent a letter to reliance standard stating that tetreault w ould be appealing the termination decision to reliance standard and that she expected to complete that appeal within days.reliance standard responded by letter faxed to tetreault counsel on june.the letter reminded tetreault counsel that the day period was about to expire.the letter also stated that reliance standard would not accept an appeal filed after that period.finally,the letter warned tetreault counsel that if he filed tetreault appeal late,the failure to exhaust defense would bar her from challenging the decision to terminate her benefits.
the appeals deadline expired on june.tetreault did not file an appeal with reliance standard until nearly a year later,on may.reliance standard then denied the appeal as untimely,at which point tetreault filed suit.
the district court declined to excuse tetreault failure to appeal to reliance standard within the day period.in doing so,the district court first rejected tetreault argument that erisa required the benefit plan to include the deadline in the written plan instrument.the district court then held in the alternative that tetreault suit could not proceed because the written plan instrument in this case actually did include the deadline through its express incorporation of the summary plan description.the district court also rejected additional erisa claims tetreault pressed that stemmed from reliance standard not having produced the documents that established and summarized the version of the benefit plan.
we begin with tetreault argument that we should excuse her failure to file her appeal with reliance standard within the day period.tetreault reads erisa to say that only the plan instrument to use her words can impose a claims procedure that a claimant must exhaust before going to court.from that premise,tetreault argues that her suit may proceed despite her failure to exhaust because the relevant plan instrument never set forth the day appeals deadline.
other courts including the district court in this case have considered whether erisa imposes the requirement tetreault describes.see,kaufmann prudential ins.of,d merigan liberty life assurance of bos,d.but we need not join in that inquiry.that is because tetreault is wrong to contend that in this case the plan instrument omitted the day deadline.
to explain why we reach this conclusion,we first need to say a bit more about that last quoted phrase plan instrument.those words do not actually appear in erisa.but a provision in erisa does require a benefit plan to be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.a.we thus understand tetreault to argue that the benefit plan document known under erisa as the written instrument must set forth a claims procedure.and so,we start by looking to see if the written instrument in this case contains the appeals deadline tetreault says was missing 
the limited long term disability program and reliance standard both say the written instrument does contain the deadline.for support,they point to the documents that concern the version of the benefit plan.the first of these documents refers to itself as the formal plan document.among other things,it specifies the procedures for funding,amending,and administering the benefit plan,just as erisa requires of a written instrument.b.there is thus no question this document is the written instrument for the version of the benefit plan,and the parties do not contend otherwise.
this document does not,however,set forth the appeals deadline.instead,it incorporates by reference the terms of the limited long term disability program as set forth in another document.this other document is the summary plan description for the version of the benefit plan,and it is this document that expressly sets forth the benefit plan claims procedures,including the day appeals deadline 
against this background,the question we must decide is a straightforward one of law that we review de novo,orndorf paul revere life ins,cir does erisa permit the benefit plan to incorporate the appeals deadline into the written instrument through the summary plan description if so,then the written instrument contains the very term tetreault says it omits.
background legal principles strongly suggest that such express incorporation is permitted.the supreme court in firestone tire rubber bruch held that established principles of trust law are relevant in construing erisa documents.the written instrument for the limited long term disability program identifies ohio law as the relevant state law for construing it,and we thus look to that state trust law for guidance on this issue.in ohio,i nterpreting a trust is akin to interpreting a contract,arnott arnott,ohio,so we treat ohio rules as instructive here.and what we find is,not surprisingly,that,i n ohio,under general principles of contract law,separate agreements may be incorporated by reference into a signed contract.keybank ass sw.greens of ohio,llc,ohio nash trs.of bos,cir following massachusetts contract principles governing fraud in the inducement as an appropriate model from which to fashion federal common law principles applicable under erisa.
as a general matter,erisa does nothing to disturb these background legal rules permitting incorporation by reference.erisa certainly permits more than one document to make up a benefit plan required written instrument.see wilson moog.pension plan,cir where the pension plan explicitly refers to,and attempts to incorporate a separate document,that document is a plan document that can not be ignored and it is not true that the written instrument erisa requires is the pension plan alone horn berdon.defined benefit pension plan,cir accepting documents claimed to collectively form the employee benefit plan even if not formally labeled as a written instrument fenton john hancock mut.life ins,cir discussing the need to identify which documents and instruments set forth the terms of the plan,although concluding on the facts that only one document did.and,at least prior to the supreme court decision in cigna amara,courts regularly concluded that erisa also counted summary plan descriptions as being among the documents that could make up a benefit plan written instrument.see pettaway teachers ins.annuity ass of,citing cases.
the only possible concern with the written instrument express incorporation of the summary plan description in this case,then,arises from some language in the supreme court decision in amara that drew distinctions between summary plan descriptions and written instruments.at.amara explained that a summary plan description is,like a plan written instrument,a creature of erisa.id.citing.and amara emphasized that erisa distinguishes between these two types of documents as to both their origins and their functions.
as to the two types of documents origins,amara said the distinction arises because,under erisa,the benefit plan sponsor creates the written instrument that establishes the benefit plan and sets forth its terms,while a different entity,the benefit plan administrator,typically writes the summary plan description.id.amara observed that,in consequence,making the summary plan description automatically binding would mix those responsibilities by giving the administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly by including them in the summary plan description.id.at.giving the administrator such power,amara said,might allow the plan administrator to circumvent the written instrument required procedure for making amendments.id.
as to the two types of documents functions,amara explained that the summary plan description is intended to give beneficiaries a account of the terms that the written instrument establishes.id.at.thus,amara stated,summary plan descriptions do not themselves constitute the terms of the plan.id.at.amara further explained that the syntax of the statutory provision that requires summary plan descriptions to describe rights under the plan suggests that the information about the plan provided by those disclosures is not itself part of the plan.id.at citing a.
tetreault seizes on amara description of these distinctions to argue that the limited long term disability program attempt to incorporate the summary plan description into the written instrument was impermissible.but amara does not support tetreault contention.
the problem for tetreault is that amara did not concern a case of express incorporation at all.instead,it concerned a case in which the written instrument for the benefit plan at issue was silent as to the significance of the language set forth in the benefit plan summary plan description.amara thus held only that terms from summary plan descriptions should not necessarily be enforced as terms of the benefit plan,and the court set forth the distinctions it identified between written instruments and summary plan descriptions solely in support of that conclusion.id.emphasis added.amara,in other words,simply did not address whether summary plan description terms could be enforced when the written instrument expressly indicated that they should be.
amara silence on that point is what matters for our purposes.for while it is true that,standing alone,a document that merely advises participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan does not itself create rights and duties,that may change when the document that unquestionably does create such rights and duties namely,the document that erisa calls the written instrument expressly states that the language in the advisory document does too.it is not surprising,therefore,that every court that has considered the issue has held that amara poses no automatic bar to a written instrument express incorporation of terms contained in a summary plan description.see,eugene horizon blue cross blue shield of,cir langlois.metro.life ins,d,henderson hartford life accident ins,wl,at utah june,
of course,it is possible that,even though generally permissible,the written instrument express incorporation of the terms of a summary plan description could in certain applications raise concerns under erisa.for example,such express incorporation might in some cases raise concerns that a plan administrator rather than a plan sponsor had changed the terms of the written instrument through its revision of the expressly incorporated summary plan description after the time at which the summary had been first incorporated.amara.at.but that possibility does not provide a reason to prohibit express incorporation of the summary plan description in all cases,as the express incorporation involved in this case demonstrates.the written instrument in this case incorporated the terms set forth in the summary plan description,and the summary plan description term at issue here the deadline was not subsequently revised.thus,there is no concern nor any contention by tetreault that the incorporation in this case resulted in the revision of the relevant parts of the written instrument through some means that erisa might prohibit.
similarly,this case shows there is no reason to worry that,in consequence of express incorporation,the summary plan description will necessarily fail to describe plan terms in the clear,simple communication that erisa intends for such summary documents.id.at.that is because the incorporation in this case concerns a particular type of term a deadline for making an internal appeal which by regulation the summary plan description must not merely summarize,but instead must set forth in full.c.s requiring that the procedures governing claims for benefits,including applicable time limits,be included in the summary plan description.and the summary plan description at issue here did exactly that in setting forth the day deadline.
our holding is a narrow one.we do not decide that claims procedures must be included in a benefit plan written instrument.nor do we address issues not presented in this case but that,in theory,might arise from the express incorporation of a summary plan description.we decide only that a benefit plan may expressly incorporate its internal appeals deadline into the written instrument through a summary plan description and that,when a benefit plan does so,a beneficiary failure to meet that deadline may bar her attempt to challenge an adverse benefit decision in court.having decided that much,though,we have necessarily decided an important issue in this appeal tetreault primary argument for excusing her failure to comply with the internal appeals deadline must fail
