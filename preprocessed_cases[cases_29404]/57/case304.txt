this is an appeal by putative current and former employees of the puerto rico telephone company prtc from an order of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico denying their motion to intervene in a suit brought by prtc and its affiliates plaintiffs against sistema de retiro de los empleados del gobierno y la judicatura the commonwealth retirement system or sistema de retiro and its administrator collectively,defendants.the hereinafter,intervenors or appellants sought to set aside a judgment declaring that puerto rico act of august,act,laws ann.tit,is ineffective because it is preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.act provides essentially that certain prtc employees,including appellants,may withdraw from coverage by prtc private retirement plans and instead enroll in the sistema de retiro plan.
prtc brought the action against sistema de retiro seeking a declaratory judgment that act is preempted by erisa and therefore void.early in the,at the first scheduling informed the district court that they would consent to a judgment that act was a nullity because it was preempted by erisa.shortly thereafter,and with the written consent of defendants,the district court issued an opinion proclaiming that conclusion and entered a declaratory judgment to that effect.see puerto rico.sistema de retiro,wl july.appellants moved to intervene,but their motion was denied without explanation.this appeal contests that ruling.appellants also brought a separate action against prtc seeking to enforce their rights under act,which suit is being held in abeyance in the district court pending the decision of this appeal.
plaintiffs defend the district court denial of intervention principally on the ground that the motion to intervene was untimely.as discussed below,we believe there are reasonable arguments to be made on both sides of the timeliness question,as well as strong reasons that favored granting to appellants,either in the context of the present action or in their separate suit,a full opportunity to advocate their contention that act is not preempted and should therefore be given effect.for these reasons,and,in part,because the district court gave us no clue on what basis it denied the motion to intervene,we believe that a remand is warranted for further consideration and explanation of the ruling.
our resolution in this appeal expresses no view on the merits of the question whether act is preempted by erisa.appellants,because they were not made parties to this action and were denied the opportunity to be heard in opposition,are not precluded from challenging the district court preemption ruling.nor should the court preemption ruling serve as a precedent of any value against their claim,given that it was not the product of contested litigation but rather was arrived at by consent of the parties,none of which was adversely affected by the ruling.thus,whether as intervenors in this action or in their separate suit against prtc,appellants are entitled to a meaningful opportunity to litigate the merits of the erisa preemption question.
background 
for purposes of this appeal,we assume the facts as stated in the district court opinion and in the parties memoranda on appeal.
prtc pension plans and act 
from until,prtc was a public corporation owned by the telephone authority of the commonwealth of puerto rico the telephone authority.on may,another entity,the puerto rico communications corporation prcc merged with the telephone authority.as a consequence of the merger,employees of prcc became employees of prtc.
prior to the merger,employees of prcc participated in the sistema de retiro retirement plan,a pension plan that is exempt from the provisions of erisa.according to appellants,prior to the merger closing,the prcc employees were consulted as to whether they wished to continue participating in sistema de retiro or if they would rather participate in the prtc retirement plans.according to appellants,they chose to stay with sistema de retiro.in the years following the merger,these employees,the former prcc employees made salary contributions to the sistema de retiro plan,and prtc made contributions to sistema de retiro on their behalf.
in,the commonwealth sold a controlling interest in prtc to the gte corporation.at the time of the sale,active prtc employees had accrued benefits under sistema de retiro.as part of the stock purchase agreement with gte,the commonwealth and gte agreed that those employees would participate in certain replacement plans sponsored by prtc.according to appellants,they were not given the option on this occasion of continuing with sistema de retiro.
approximately nine years later,on august,puerto rico act was enacted into law.the act grants to prtc active and retired employees who were participants in sistema de retiro at the time of the sale to gte in the eligible employees,including appellants,the right essentially to switch back to the sistema de retiro plan.under the act,the eligible employees would have the right to count any years of service worked at prtc after the sale as years of service under sistema de retiro for purposes of accruing pension benefits employees who had already retired would have the right to obtain a new calculation of benefits.
to take advantage of act provisions,eligible employees are required to return to sistema de retiro all the contributions that were distributed to them after they ceased to participate in the system pay the accumulated interest on the amount of contributions previously distributed pay the total principal amount of employee pension contributions due sistema de retiro for each year of service worked after the sale with any government branch,including prtc and pay the accumulated interest on the principal amount of such contributions for each year of service.act also sets up a payment plan for employees to pay any principal and interest owed.however,in order to participate in the payment plan,act states that the employee must pay what he or she owes of the principal and interest after the prtc retirement plan returns to sistema de retiro any contributions held for each participant.laws ann.tit.
on september,an official at sistema de retiro sent a letter to prtc requesting a list of all eligible employees and their salaries.on october,sistema de retiro administrator sent a letter to the president of prtc,furnishing information as to the act provisions.the letter advised that once eligible employees resume their participation in sistema de retiro,prtc will be required to deduct from their salaries the amount each employee will be contributing to sistema de retiro,and pay an additional amount equal to of each of said employee salaries as the employer component of the contribution.
prior to filing the instant case,several of the eligible employees requested that prtc transfer the pension contributions each had accumulated in the prtc retirement plans to sistema de retiro.some of these employees,including appellants,allegedly threatened to take legal action if prtc refused to make the transfers.
ii.district court proceedings 
prtc and certain of its affiliates brought this suit on january,for declaratory relief,inter alia,that act is preempted by erisa,both as enacted and as applied.the complaint named as defendants sistema de retiro and its administrator.on april,of whom have appeared in this their answer.the next day,the court set a date for an initial scheduling conference.
the initial scheduling conference was held on june.we are advised by prtc that during this conference sistema de retiro informed the court that it agreed with prtc that erisa preempted act and that they would consent to a judgment to that effect.the court suggested continuing the conference on july,to finalize a judgment on july,the parties and the court discussed a draft opinion and agreed to unspecified modifications,following which the court issued the opinion and entered judgment.
on july,the day before the scheduled conference,appellants instituted a new action by filing a class action complaint against prtc,on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated prtc employees,seeking a ruling that act is not preempted by erisa,and injunctive relief requiring that prtc comply with act provisions.rivera puerto rico,jp.two weeks later,on august,appellants moved to intervene in the suit in which this appeal is taken,to set aside the judgment,and to consolidate the two actions.the same day,the district court denied intervention and consolidation giving no reason for its ruling.and on august,the court denied the motion to set aside the judgment in the same summary fashion.on august,appellants timely filed a notice of appeal.
on september,in appellants separate action,dkt,the district court granted prtc motion to stay the proceedings until this court decision in the present appeal with the observation that the issue raised in the suit could become moot upon resolution of this appeal by the first circuit.rivera puerto rico,jp,wl,at.
discussion 
the intervenors ask that we overturn the district court denial of their motion to intervene.to succeed on a motion to intervene as of right pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a the movant must establish i the timeliness of its motion to intervene ii the existence of an interest relating to the property or transaction that forms the basis of the pending action iii a realistic threat that the disposition of the action will impede its ability to protect that interest and iv the lack of adequate representation of its position by any existing party.r g mortgage federal loan mortgage,cir see also.a.
we review the grant or denial of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion.r g mortgage,at.even where a decision is committed to the discretion of the district court,a federal appeals court is not limited in its review to either affirm the decision if it falls within the lawful exercise of the district court discretion or reverse if not.an appeals court may remand for reconsideration of a ruling that does not constitute an abuse of discretion on finding that the district court may with further analysis reach a fairer or more efficient result.although we find no abuse of discretion,we remand for such reconsideration.
prtc defends the district court denial of intervention principally by arguing that the petition to intervene was untimely,and that a district court disallowance of intervention based on a finding of untimeliness is entitled to considerable deference on appellate review.
there are,however,several problems with this argument.the district court conducted no hearings with respect to the petition and gave no explanation for its denial.we are not told whether the court denied the petition for untimeliness or for some other reason.furthermore,a conclusion that a petition to intervene is untimely involves consideration of a number of particular the prejudice that would be suffered by the original parties from allowance of the intervention,and the prejudice to the petitioner from its denial the court gave no explanation of any prejudice prtc and sistema de retiro might have suffered from allowance of the intervention.according to our perception of the record,they would have suffered no meaningful prejudice had the district court allowed intervention,and the prejudice to the intervenors from denial could be substantial.we have no indication what was the reasoning that underlay the district court denial.
in stressing the importance of timely filing of a petition to intervene,courts have repeatedly emphasized that the concept of timeliness of a petition is not measured,like a statute of limitations,in terms of specific units of time,but rather derives meaning from assessment of prejudice in the context of the particular litigation.fiandaca cunningham,cir explaining that t he timeliness requirement was not designed to penalize prospective intervenors for failing to act promptly,but rather to insure that existing parties to the litigation are not prejudiced by the failure of intervenors to act in a timely fashion quoting garrity gallen,cir see banco popular de puerto rico greenblatt,cir t he purpose of the basic requirement that the application to intervene be timely is to prevent last minute disruption of painstaking work by the parties and the court.quoting culbeath dukakis,cir caterino barry,cir noting that avoiding such prejudice to existing parties has been described as the basic purpose of the timeliness requirement,and that in that case permitting intervention inevitably would delay the start of the a detriment to the plaintiffs see also r g mortage,at the passage of time is measured in relative,not absolute terms w hat may constitute reasonably prompt action in one situation,may be unreasonably dilatory in another.thus,unjustified delay for a relatively short period of time can support denial of intervention where the prejudice to the other litigants would be significant.see naacp new york,motion to intervene brought three weeks after intervenors claim they learned of the suit,and only days after they learned of defendants consent to entry of judgment,found untimely,because by that point the suit had reached a critical stage and the granting of intervention possessed the potential for seriously disrupting the plaintiff state electoral process.similarly,much longer delays might not render the petition untimely where under the circumstances no prejudice would be suffered by the other litigants from allowance and the prejudice to the petitioner from denial would be serious.see geiger foley hoag llp ret.plan,cir motion to intervene brought after suit filing adjudged timely where the case had not progressed beyond the initial stages,and the balance of prejudices weigh ed heavily in favor of putative intervenor zurich capital markets,coglianese,motion to intervene filed over two years after putative intervenor was on notice that its interests might be impaired by suit found timely where plaintiff could point to no prejudice from the delay.
addressing first the duration of arguably unjustified delay,intervenors assert,and we have no reason to doubt,that prior to sistema de retiro filing at the end of may of its memorandum in preparation for the first scheduling conference with the district court,they had no reason to suspect that sistema de retiro would not aggressively advocate the validity of act.they further assert that their counsel who continues to represent them on appeal was unable to begin work on the matter until the first week of july,as the result of involvement in other litigation in this court in boston,followed by two weeks of illness.the motion to intervene was thus filed ten weeks after the intervenors were on theoretical notice that sistema de retiro would not adequately defend their interests in the suit,and only six weeks after intervenors counsel became aware of the fact.
when the court entered judgment and shortly thereafter denied appellants motion to intervene,there had been no adverse litigation between plaintiffs and defendants.the litigation was in its infancy.no depositions had been taken.no motions had been made.the court initial scheduling conference had barely been concluded.at that conference on june,the defendants advised the court that they would agree to the declaratory judgment the plaintiffs were seeking.the court therefore adjourned the conference to july for preparation of a judgment reflecting the agreement of the parties,at which time the parties discussed with the court the proposed text and agreed on wording,whereupon the court proceeded to enter the judgment.granting the appellants motion to intervene would not have required the parties to redo depositions already conducted nor would it have caused the waste or repetition of any previously conducted proceedings.the court might simply have set a proximate date for the intervenors to submit a brief in support of the viability of act,allowed a short time for response,and then decided whether,in the face of opposing arguments supporting the viability of act,the court nonetheless adhered to its conclusion,in which case it could simply have reentered the judgment.
not only would grant of intervention not have subjected the parties to inefficiency,repetition,or waste,but,quite
