abdela tum asks us to overturn his convictions for violating and conspiring to violate the federal statute,a law that at the risk of oversimplification criminalizes a scheme to defraud involving an communication.see u.and.tum attack basically comes in two waves.convinced that the evidence failed to show that he had caused an transmission,he argues first that his convictions can not stand.reminding us that conspiracy involves a knowing agreement between two or more parties to violate some other law,he protests that the evidence did not show the existence of a coconspirator,so the conspiracy conviction must fall too.
winning a sufficiency challenge like this is no easy thing,because we must examine the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the government,even though our review is de novo de novo being another way of saying that we give the judge legal ruling a fresh look.see,united states guerrier,cir.tum clearly faces a steep uphill fight.and it is one that he must lose,for reasons that will shortly become clear.
hiding the truth 
tum worked for barber foods in maine as a production worker for almost years,from to.his wife,sherifa hussen,worked there too.asthma left him unable to do his job.and eventually he started receiving short and then disability payments through a benefits policy issued to barber foods by unum life insurance company of america,which,the parties tell us,is a firm.when tum started working for barber foods,he spoke very little english.but when he was looking to the process about a decade and a half later we do not know exactly how,but at some point he did learn about the benefits policy,obviously,he had no trouble communicating with barber foods benefits manager.
for a person in tum,the policy in play here does a number of important things it considers him disabled in if he suffers an earning loss of or more caused by a sickness or injury that restricts him from performing the material and substantial duties of his regular occupation.it also lets him work while collecting disability benefits but warns that unum will reduce or stop payments depending on how much he earns the particulars of this are unimportant.on this last point the policy stresses that unum may require him to prove his earnings.over the next few months unum would remind tum more than once that he had to remain disabled as defined by the policy to keep getting benefits.
skipping over details not relevant to the issues on appeal,we see that unum began sending tum checks monthly sometime in checks that tum quickly deposited into an account at keybank in maine.in june,however,tum asked unum if it could deposit the funds directly into his keybank account instead.unum said yes,triggering a series of events that took place in various states,which we thumbnail this way.unum inputted tum bank account and routing numbers into a batch system,a system where information is collected,stored,and processed later,rather than in real time.see harry newton,newton telecom dictionary ed.the batch system server is in south carolina.jp morgan in florida then verified tum data as part of the next phase in the review process.everything checked out just fine,and so in july unum started electronically transferring funds it had with jp morgan in illinois to a keybank department in ohio funds that passed through the federal reserve system there is no federal reserve branch in maine,apparently but only after jp morgan in florida gave its illinois counterpart the each time.and that is how things pretty much went until december,when the fbi got involved.but we have gotten ahead of our story and so must back up a bit.
tum had a secret,and it was a doozy he had been working for home health care solutions hhcs,for short since march as a driver.a slew of documents,agreements between hhcs and tum,invoices from tum to hhcs,copies of checks from hhcs to tum,a letter from hhcs recording payment advances to tum,documents from hhcs to tum mortgage provider verifying his employment showed that,and this too that,given his hhcs earnings,tum was raking in disability benefits that he was not entitled to as the government argues and tum does not contest.
trying to do his best to keep from being found out an obvious inference from the record,tum did tell an unum disability specialist in december that he was thinking about getting a job.but he said not a word about the hhcs job that he already had.anyway,the specialist told tum that if he did return to work,he needed to call back with details regarding his employer,his new position and his pay so unum could verify his disability status.understood,tum said or something to that effect.
hard on the heels of this exchange,a number of significant things happened tum stopped submitting invoices to next invoice bore his wife name.hhcs created dual sets of invoices for work completed before the december conversation,one in tum name and the other in hussen,and started cutting checks payable to hussen,not tum.hhcs generated an agreement in hussen name too.also,an hhcs accountant prepared a form for hussen but not for tum that listed her supposed earnings.and tum had a tax specialist use that document in preparing the couple joint return,which the specialist then to the irs.adding to the intrigue,hussen would later tell federal agents that she never worked for hhcs a story the judge would later credit.
exchanges like the one tum had with unum in december happened a lot over the next two years.here are some highlights or lowlights,if you will 
in january tum told another unum employee that he was delivering newspapers for the portland press herald,pocketing cents per delivery,and he promised to provide unum with his portland press herald paystubs.but he again said nothing about his hhcs work even though by this time he had been with hhcs for nine months.
also,unum sent tum several letters in asking him to document his monthly earnings.having not gotten a proper and timely response,unum stopped paying disability benefits to him in october.at last stirred to action,tum faxed a handwritten note to unum in december,explaining that his income is very low because he has not been able to do meaningful work.he was delivering papers for the portland press herald,he added,making biweekly.enclosing an income report,he said that that number did not really reflect his true earnings,because he had to pay his expenses gassing up his car to make deliveries,for example out of his own pocket.not a peep about hhcs,though.
about two weeks later,unum sent tum a letter saying that it had reopened your claim and released your benefits tum wrote back in january,thanking unum for being concerned about people and for helping us to stay in our home.discussing his income,tum stressed that he presently earned under a year.i have applied everywhere for employment,he continued,but s o far there has been no response.right now i am trying to get a license to become a taxi cab driver.i believe this will make me self sufficient.following a familiar pattern,tum letter gave no hint that he was working with hhcs.
sometime in april,unum reviewed tum earnings with a critical eye and found that what he had told them and what he had told the irs were two different had given unum a smaller number,a discrepancy,unum concluded,that resulted in his getting a few thousand dollars more in benefits than he should have.obviously unum did not realize how large the discrepancy really was,given how tum was mum about his hhcs income.tum did say,though,that he could not pay any money back,as unum demanded,because the portland herald press had fired him over some late deliveries,adding that his only source of income now was his unum disability checks and his wife earnings at barber foods an untruth for sure,given the hhcs income that he was still keeping from unum.
arrest and fallout 
tum scheme came to a screeching halt in,when federal authorities filed a criminal complaint against him and his wife,hussen.a federal grand jury later indicted them each on sixteen counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiring with unnamed others to commit wire fraud.see and the two waived their right to a jury and asked for a bench trial.the judge granted their request.at the close of the government case,the pair moved for acquittal on all counts based on insufficient evidence.the judge reserved decision.see.b.the duo then presented some evidence in their own defense,calling a couple of witnesses who mostly talked about tum limited english language skills,and they renewed their motions for acquittal after they rested.the judge reserved ruling on those motions too,saying he wanted to hear closing arguments first.
eventually the judge acquitted hussen of all charges.for starters,he found no evidence that she knew what unum wanted tum to do or that his hhcs earnings could affect his benefits.sure,she probably should have suspected that tum was trying to scam unum,the judge added,but that not enough.proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required,he reminded the lawyers,and the evidence against hussen did not satisfy that standard on any of the counts.
but there was more than enough to find tum guilty of schem ing to defraud unum of its money in violation of the act,the judge ruled.and,zeroing in on the documents contracts,invoices,checks,letters,tax documents,the judge also found sufficient evidence of tum conspiring with hhcs to commit wire fraud.so he rejected tum acquittal pleas and found him guilty on all counts.
which brings us to today,with tum staking everything on convincing us that the judge erred on the sufficiency issues.we tackle his contentions in the next section,adding a few more details to this saga when needed.
issues and rulings 
first up is tum attack on the sufficiency of the evidence behind his challenge we review de novo and in the light most favorable to the judge guilty finding.see,guerrier,at.
to prove wire fraud,the government had to show beyond a reasonable doubt his knowing and willful participation in a scheme to defraud and the use of interstate wires to further that scheme.see,united states denson,cir.the scheme had to employ material falsehoods too,false or omitted statements that a reasonable person would consider important in deciding what to do.neder united states,d.also,the government need not have shown that he personally use d the wires,but only that such use was a reasonably foreseeable part of the scheme in which he participated.united states woodward,cir quoting united states sawyer,cir,which in turn was quoting united states boots,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also united states fermín castillo,cir explaining that w hether or not the appellant had foreknowledge of the precise series of electronic communications is beside the point,and stressing that a s long as some use of wires in the course of the endeavor was reasonably to be anticipated,the causation requirement is met.
taking aim at the requirement,tum claims that the government proof here fell short his thesis goes something like this unum has an office in maine.keybank is a maine bank.and tum lived in maine.consequently,the transferring of benefits had to have been done by intra state not inter state wire communications.
not so.recall what happened when tum asked unum to send his disability payments via direct deposit.yes,an unum employee in maine keyed tum banking information into the batch system.but,devastating to his take on events,the system server is in south carolina,and the data was transmitted to florida for.also,and equally hurtful to his cause,the electronic transferring of funds involved banks in illinois and ohio too.in other words,looking at the facts and inferences in the light most helpful to the government,see,e,guerrier,at,we believe that a factfinder could rationally find the use of interstate wires here.
still hoping against hope to avoid all this,tum tries to make two points.neither persuades.
his opening argument has three steps.step keybank told its customers in may and june that going forward,its checking statements would provide more details concerning the process,the new and improved wire descriptions will include the wire transfer sender name step the unum direct deposits lacked that information.step ergo,one can infer from this that no transfers happened.what hurts tum,however,is the standard of review,which compels us to draw all reasonable inferences in the government favor,not his.see,guerrier,at.and the judge had enough evidence to infer consistent with the government theory that an communication actually occurred.that tum interstate thesis may be plausible changes nothing,because the issue is not whether a factfinder rationally could have acquitted but whether it rationally could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states seng tan,cir.and read correctly again,in a way most agreeable to the judge guilty finding the testimony illumined above about the multistate process for direct deposit completely undoes tum very speculative suggestion that not a single transmission crossed state lines.he tries to play down this testimony,suggesting it only highlights how the process works generally,not how it worked here.but we think a factfinder could conclude otherwise.
next,tum insists that the government stumbled by not proving that the interstate nature of the wire transmissions was reasonably foreseeable to him.he is off base with this one too.the statute requirement is purely jurisdictional and not a substantive element of the offense,meaning the government did not have to prove that tum had reason to think that a communication would cross state lines instead,all that the government had to show was that it was reasonably foreseeable to a person in tum shoes that a wire communication would be made to further the scheme.see,woodward,at fermín castillo,at.and there was plenty of evidence of that for openers,a significant number of communications he got from unum came either directly from its south carolina benefits center or from its office but with the benefits center palmetto state address emblazoned on them.also,no one can deny that electronic communications go on all the time today,see united states mullins,cir,particularly in the world of banking,see,fermín castillo,at so having asked that benefit payments be deposited electronically into his account,a sensible person in tum position should have anticipated that wire transmissions involving unum and others would follow at least a reasonable factfinder using common sense could so conclude,which is all that is required.see woodward,at see generally united states ortiz,cir holding that,in grading a sufficiency challenge,factfinders need not divorce themselves from their common sense or abandon the dictates of mature experience.of course,the communication actually had to have crossed state lines,see generally united states lewis,cir explaining that the statute require s actual crossing of a state border,but the government proved that in spades,as we pointed out above.
the unavoidable bottom line is that the evidence was strong enough to uphold tum convictions.we shift focus,then,to his complaint about the adequacy of the evidence underpinning his conviction a complaint we likewise consider de novo,reading the record in the light most compatible with the government theory of the case.see,guerrier,at.to put his claim in context,we start with some basic principles of conspiracy law.
a conspiracy is an agreement between the defendant and another or others with a particular kind of object to commit a crime.see,united states fenton,cir.one must be a willing participant but need not know the exact scope and extent of the collective endeavor.united states ruiz,cir.knowing its essential nature suffices.see,united states,cir holding that the government need not establish that the members knew or agreed upon every detail of the conspiracy,but only the essential nature of the plan and their connections with it citation and internal quotation marks omitted also,the government may prove an agreement by circumstantial evidence say,for example,by showing a common purpose such as a purpose to sell illicit drugs,overlap of participants,and interdependence of various elements in the overall plan.martínez medina,at.and a criminal factfinder need not turn a blind eye to what is p
