when the government of puerto rico changed hands following the november general elections,the legislature enacted law law which repealed reorganization plan reorganization plan and in doing so purportedly abolished four positions that the reorganization plan had created.at the same time,the legislature also enacted several other laws creating new positions with substantially similar duties and removal limitations.when governor garcía padilla filled the new positions,several of the former officials brought suit in federal court.see,díaz carrasquillo garcía padilla,cv filed.
this is an interlocutory appeal from one of those suits,that of former veteran ombudsman agustin montañez allman.montañez allman brought federal claims under the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments,as well as commonwealth law claims for fault or negligence under article of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit.this interlocutory appeal concerns a preliminary injunction,granted on due process grounds,that,inter alia,reinstated montañez allman and vacated the political appointment of his replacement.
when this rather extraordinary relief issued,the puerto rico supreme court had not yet issued its opinion in the nearly identical case of díaz carrasquillo garcía padilla.that opinion,issued on june,confirmed the availability of relief in commonwealth court.díaz carrasquillo garcía padilla,tspr,wl,at,petition for cert.filed,certified translation provided by the parties.this,then,raises the question of whether montañez allman remains entitled to federal injunctive relief for his due process claim.acevedo feliciano ruiz hernández,cir.in light of the extraordinariness of the relief sought,the immense importance of this case to the commonwealth own constitutional balance of powers,and the relief now available under the puerto rico supreme court decision in díaz carrasquillo,which both parties agree is adequate,we remand with instructions to vacate the preliminary injunction within thirty days of the date of this opinion,and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
we provide only a limited summary of the facts as necessary to resolve the appeal.a more detailed description may be found in the district court opinion.see allman padilla,d.
in june,luis fortuño appointed montañez allman to a term as acting veteran ombudsman pursuant to the reorganization plan as relevant here,the reorganization plan established the fixed term,and placed limitations on the governor removal power.those limitations included a requirement of advance notice and the right to a hearing,and only permitted removal for total disability,gross negligence,or reprehensible conduct.
following the november general elections,the administration changed,and garcía padilla became governor.soon thereafter,in july,the legislature enacted law,which repealed the reorganization plan and purported to abolish the positions that the plan had created,including montañez allman position of veteran ombudsman.at the same time,the legislature also enacted laws,and,creating nearly identical positions as those purportedly destroyed.one of those,law,established the position of veteran advocate.the new position of veteran advocate had similar responsibilities and privileges,and a similar term,as the purportedly abolished veteran ombudsman.
in august,montañez allman was notified that the office of veteran ombudsman had ceased to exist under law,and that governor garcía padilla had appointed someone else,elizabeth lópez cabrera,to the new post of veteran advocate under law.he was informed he needed to turn over his files,equipment,and other agency resources to lópez cabrera as part of the transition.
in september,montañez filed this federal suit against governor garcía padilla,lópez cabrera,and various other officials who are members of the popular democratic party.he brought claims under for violations of the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments,and under commonwealth law for fault or negligence.he seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as damages,on the basis of these claims.he also sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.
on october,the district court granted montañez allman request for a preliminary injunction on the basis of his due process claim,but denied his request for an injunction on first amendment grounds.the injunction vacated the appointment of lópez cabrera as acting veteran advocate ordered that montañez allman be reinstated and enjoined montañez allman removal without due process of law.garcía padilla and lópez cabrera filed this interlocutory appeal on october.
when the district court issued its preliminary injunction,the supreme court of puerto rico had not yet responded to the questions certified in the nearly identical case of díaz carrasquillo garcía padilla concerning the existence of a property right under commonwealth law.the supreme court of puerto rico has since ruled,see díaz carrasquillo,wl,at,holding,inter alia,that montañez allman now has at least an equivalent remedy available in state court,and so he will not suffer irreparable injury if denied federal equitable relief see el dia,hernandez colon,cir.the parties at oral argument agreed that the state remedy would indeed be adequate.we now face the question of whether the rather extraordinary federal injunctive relief reinstating a commonwealth political appointment and removing the appointee replacement remains appropriate.id.
we have previously held that,in determining entitlement to federal relief for due process violations,a relevant consideration is the adequacy of existing state remedies.see acevedo feliciano,at bane registry of motor vehicles,cir per curiam unpublished disposition rumford pharmacy,city of providence,cir affirming dismissal of procedural due process claim for failure to allege inadequacy of state remedies and noting availability of adequate relief under claims commons condo.ass charlie arment trucking,cir recognizing that,in some circumstances,an remedy under state law may be adequate.this is particularly true i n shaping equitable remedies,where comity concerns can loom large.rosario torres hernandez colon,cir en banc see also comm of pullman,holding that federal courts administering equitable remedies must exercis e a wise discretion to avoid needless friction with state policies internal quotation marks omitted.simply because an equitable remedy may be available does not necessarily mean that it must automatically issue.el dia,at.
federal courts,as justice holmes once emphasized,are to strictly observe the important rule that no injunction ought to issue against officers of a state unless in a case reasonably free from doubt and when necessary to prevent great and irreparable injury.state grange benton.in light of the relief now available in puerto rico courts under díaz carrasquillo and the importance of this case to the commonwealth own constitutional balance of powers,this important rule is applicable here.under the altered and unusual circumstances of this case,the maintenance of continuing federal equitable relief is no longer appropriate.direct mktg.ass brohl,noting that,under the comity doctrine,federal courts refrain from interfer ing with the fiscal operations of the state governments in all cases where the federal rights of the persons could otherwise be preserved unimpaired alterations in original quoting levin commerce energy.
accordingly,we remand to the district court with instructions to vacate the preliminary injunction within thirty days of the date of this opinion to provide time to file suit in commonwealth court,to dismiss without prejudice montañez allman due process claim,to resolve montañez allman first amendment claim,and,if dismissed,to decline pendent jurisdiction over the remaining commonwealth claims.desjardins willard,cir ordering remand to state court of state law claims implicating state constitutional issues following dismissal of federal claims díaz carrasquillo garcía padilla,cv,opinion and order providing plaintiff time to file suit in commonwealth court before dismissal of federal case without prejudice beca
