two former managers of donuts stores in massachusetts brought this action claiming they were improperly denied overtime pay in violation of the fair labor standards act flsa.see a.based on facts it deemed undisputed,the district court rejected the recommendation of the magistrate judge and granted summary judgment for the defendant employers,finding that plaintiffs were bona fide executive s excluded from the statute overtime pay requirement.id.a.our review of the law and the record persuades us that material factual disputes remain concerning the exemption applicability to plaintiffs and,hence,we vacate the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
factual background 
in this appeal from a summary judgment,we present the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the nonmoving party.see ray ropes gray llp,cir.here we provide a brief recital of facts to set the stage for the analysis that follows.we provide additional detail later as part of that analysis.
plaintiff gassan marzuq worked as a manager at a donuts store in massachusetts from until his termination in and plaintiff lisa chantre was a manager at another massachusetts store from until her termination in both stores are among multiple donuts franchises owned and operated by three related corporate entities cadete enterprises,donuts,and samoset donuts,whose common president is john cadete.
pursuant to manager agreements they signed with cadete enterprises,marzuq and chantre were expected to work no less than a six day,hour work week.emphasis in original.often,however,store managers work more than sixty hours,in part because they substitute for crew members who are out sick or miss a shift for other reasons.marzuq testified in his deposition that his regular schedule added up to hours over six days,but that he was in fact there all the time,seven days a week.managers responsibilities include calibrating the equipment to donuts specifications,handling cash,keeping the store and grounds properly maintained,training and supervising the employees,periodic counting of every item in the store,and substantial paperwork.
marzuq and chantre were supervised by a district manager,aaron dermandy,who oversaw at least seven stores during the time plaintiffs were managers.among other duties,dermandy determined staffing levels,arranged maintenance,and ordered the baked goods for the stores.he visited each store every week,and was involved in both the hiring and firing of crew members.
marzuq viewed himself as in charge and the captain of his store,and his sons,both of whom worked at marzuq store,likewise saw him that way.sarmad marzuq testified that i t was always expected that if his father was around that he would be always on call,and ahmad gassan marzuq reported that no one else was in charge when his father was not at the store if anyone had questions,we would just call my father and he usually would come in a nd solve the problem for us.
the record,however,also contains evidence of marzuq difficulty in fulfilling his role as leader of th e team.in addition to reporting that he worked on sundays because his regular schedule was insufficient to get the necessary work done,marzuq testified that he did not have time actually to be the manager as required to be a manager.he elaborated as follows 
i always on the floor percent of my time,serving customers,cleaning,cleaning the outside,doing the landscaping,cleaning the papers out of the bushes,cleaning the bathroom,serving customers,covering shifts,employees that they call in,i have to cover.so really i do have time to be percent manager 
he explained that he could not routinely delegate the to crew members because you always short on staff.when asked about the company policy that employees take a day off,he responded how are you going to run the operation with no management to take care of that location so you have to work.
procedural background 
marzuq and chantre filed this action in february seeking overtime compensation under the flsa and the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment two years later that relied heavily on the depositions of marzuq and dermandy.in recommending that the motion be denied,the magistrate judge found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiffs fell within the flsa exclusion for employees serving in a bona fide executive capacity.a.
as described more fully below,the district court disagreed that a jury could find in plaintiffs favor.it concluded that the facts in this case are in substance indistinguishable from those we encountered in donovan burger king,cir burger king,where we held that certain assistant managers were exempt from the overtime provision.the court thus granted summary judgment for defendants,and this appeal followed.
before examining the district court conclusion that burger king controls the disposition of plaintiffs flsa claims,we review the governing law and the reasoning in burger king that led us to find the overtime exemption applicable there.
a.the flsa executive exemption 
the flsa requires employers to pay their employees at least one and times the regular rate for any hours worked in excess of a workweek.a.the overtime requirement has multiple exceptions.the one at issue in this case excludes any employee employed in a bona fide executive capacity.id.a.pursuant to regulations issued by the secretary of labor,an employer seeking to establish that an employee is an exempted executive must show the employee salary is at least per week,the employee primary duty is management,the employee customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees,and the employee has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring,firing,advancement,promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight.a each of these requirements must be met for the exemption to apply.
the regulations explicitly address the situation of an employee who concurrently performs exempt and nonexempt work,one who supervises other employees while also doing tasks along with those subordinates stating that such an employee may fall within the exemption so long as the four requirements of listed above are otherwise met.see id.whether an employee who concurrently performs both types of duties meets the requirements is determined on a basis.id.for example,a manager can supervise employees and serve customers at the same time without losing the exemption.id.b.hence,even a substantial overlap in the performance of and managerial work will not disqualify an employee from the exemption if the executive duties are his or her primary duty.id.
the regulations provide guidance on how to determine an employee primary duty,including a set of factors in boldface below to consider.see id.because the primary duty inquiry is central to this case,we reproduce all but the introductory line of the pertinent regulation 
a the term primary duty means the principal,main,major or most important duty that the employee performs.determination of an employee primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case,with the major emphasis on the character of the employee job as a whole.factors to consider when determining the primary duty of an employee include,but are not limited to,the relative importance of the exempt duties as compared with other types of duties the amount of time spent performing exempt work the employee relative freedom from direct supervision and the relationship between the employee salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work performed by the employee.
b the amount of time spent performing exempt work can be a useful guide in determining whether exempt work is the primary duty of an employee.thus,employees who spend more than percent of their time performing exempt work will generally satisfy the primary duty requirement.time alone,however,is not the sole test,and nothing in this section requires that exempt employees spend more than percent of their time performing exempt work.employees who do not spend more than percent of their time performing exempt duties may nonetheless meet the primary duty requirement if the other factors support such a conclusion.
c thus,for example,assistant managers in a retail establishment who perform exempt executive work such as supervising and directing the work of other employees,ordering merchandise,managing the budget and authorizing payment of bills may have management as their primary duty even if the assistant managers spend more than percent of the time performing nonexempt work such as running the cash register.however,if such assistant managers are closely supervised and earn little more than the nonexempt employees,the assistant managers generally would not satisfy the primary duty requirement.
id.emphasis added.briefly stated,the regulation explains that an employee primary duty is not determined solely by the amount of time he or she devotes to the different categories of tasks,exempt nonexempt but on the overall character of his or her position.
b.the burger king decision 
in burger king,the district court had found after a bench trial that the restaurant chain assistant managers did not have management as their primary duty and,hence,were entitled to overtime under the flsa.see at.among other tasks,the burger king assistant managers scheduled employees,oversaw product quality,spoke with customers,trained employees,and perform ed various recordkeeping,inventory,and cash reconciliation duties.id.at.however,the assistant managers also spent a substantial portion of their time more than percent of their weekly work hours,id.at performing many of the same tasks as hourly employees,such as taking orders,preparing food,and expediting orders.id.at.the district court found that,in the absence of the manager,the assistant manager on duty was de facto in charge of the store,id.at,but the court nonetheless concluded that assistant managers did not work primarily as managers as required for the flsa overtime exemption.
in reversing,we stated that,i n light of the district court finding here that the assistant managers were in charge of the restaurant during their shifts,its conclusion that they do not have management as their primary duty can not stand.id.at.we noted that employees may concurrently perform exempt and nonexempt tasks,and we observed that the regulation makes it quite clear that an employee can manage while performing other work,and that this other work does not negate the conclusion that his primary duty is management.id.at.we found applicable the proposition that the person in charge of a store has management as his primary duty,even though he spends the majority of his time on work and makes few significant decisions.id.at.
because the issue of primary duty was the only disputed factor for certain of the burger king assistant managers,our rejection of the district court finding on that issue meant that those managers fell within the flsa bona fide executive exemption.id.at accordingly,we vacated the district court judgment insofar as it ordered burger king to pay back overtime wages to the group of assistant managers earning at least per week.id.at 
c.the district court donuts decision 
the role played by the burger king assistant managers,as described in our decision,appears to largely coincide with the responsibilities of marzuq and chantre as depicted by the evidence recounted in section i above.given that factual similarity,the district court unsurprisingly looked to our analysis in burger king for guidance.the court stated that,like the burger king assistant managers,it is clear that plaintiffs were at all times in charge of their respective stores,including while serving customers like normal hourly employees.dist.op.at see also id.at noting that t he burger king court found that an employee can still be managing even while physically doing something else.the district court also expressly invoked the flsa regulation that provides that employees who perform exempt and nonexempt work concurrently are not disqualified from the executive exemption.id.at citing a.
hence,echoing our holding in burger king,the district court found it undisputed that plaintiffs had management as their primary duty,even though they spent much of their time on nonexempt work and had little discretion to make significant decisions.id.in addition,despite their limited authority overall,the court found that plaintiffs wielded influence over personnel decisions the other contested requirement for the exemption id.at.accordingly,the court held that the undisputed facts show that plaintiffs were employed in a bona fide executive capacity,and thus not entitled to overtime pay.id.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court failed to perform the analysis required by the flsa regulations to determine an employee primary duty and improperly gloss ed over a clear factual dispute as to whether marzuq was able to manage his store while also serving customers and completing other tasks.they further assert that the court reliance on burger king was misplaced,as that case involved a verdict entered after a bench trial rather than a ruling on summary judgment for which they are entitled to the benefit of favorable factual inferences.all told,plaintiffs contend that summary judgment was improper because the evidence in the record would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the overtime exemption does not apply to them.
standards of review 
we review the district court summary judgment ruling de novo,assessing the facts in the light most advantageous to plaintiffs and also drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor.ray,at.
the burden is on the employer to prove an exemption from the flsa requirements,cash cycle craft,cir,and the remedial nature of the statute requires that its exemptions be narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them,reich john alden life ins,cir quoting arnold ben kanowsky,d see also hines state room,cir stating that exemptions must be drawn narrowly against the employer wirtz keystone readers,cir noting the flsa dual mandates of broad coverage and narrow exemptions.
discussion 
as noted above,it is undisputed that plaintiffs meet two of the four criteria for the bona fide executive exemption from overtime pay they earned more than,and they customarily and regularly direct ed the work of two or more other employees.a.we thus begin with an examination of one of the remaining requirements that management be an exempted executive primary duty.
primary duty 
appellants argue that the district court improperly failed to consider the four factors listed in the governing regulation as pertinent to the determination the relative importance of the exempt duties as compared with other types of duties the amount of time spent performing exempt work the employee relative freedom from direct supervision and the relationship between the employee salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work performed by the employee.a.they further assert that the record evidence on these factors,viewed in their favor,does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that management was their primary duty thus taking this case outside the scope of our holding in burger king.
as an initial matter,we agree that burger king is not on all fours with this case.our analysis there rested on findings made by the district court after a bench trial,while on summary judgment we must construe the facts in plaintiffs favor.moreover,the reported facts in the two cases are not identical.in burger king,for example,the district court found that the assistant managers devoted more than percent of their time to duties,at,while marzuq testified that he was on the floor percent of the time doing nonexempt tasks like serving customers and cleaning.the difference between performing nonexempt work most of the time,percent and possibly less than half the time,more than percent could be significant in evaluating whether a manager is able to perform supervisory and nonexempt tasks concurrently.at least in some settings,a nominal manager who spends nearly his entire shift doing the same work as his subordinates might not be able to simultaneously manage the store.see morgan family dollar stores,cir noting,in a decision affirming jury finding that store managers did not have management as their primary duty,a distinction between managers who spent to of the time performing manual labor and those who spent or more than fifty percent of their time on nonexempt tasks.as discussed below,other differences also exist,including comparative pay rates.
importantly,when an employee performs both exempt and nonexempt work,the question of primary duty is determined on a basis in light of the factors specified by regulation and identified above.appellants correctly observe that the district court did not expressly examine those factors.instead,the court treated burger king as dispositive on the primary duty inquiry based on the court assessment that plaintiffs indisputably were in charge of their stores at all times.
notwithstanding the procedural and factual differences between the cases,burger king does articulate a principle that is relevant here a manager who is in charge when on the job can still be managing even while physically doing something else,id.at,and may have management as his primary duty even though he spends the majority of his time on work and makes few significant decisions,id.at.however,burger king was anchored in factual findings that the assistant managers were in charge of the restaurant during their shifts,and that they spent substantial time on managerial duties,see id.at.hence,our analysis implicitly assumed that being in charge is not merely a label belied by the realities of the workplace.we also observed that some of the pertinent regulatory factors quite clearly cut in favor of burger king contention that the plaintiffs primary duty was management,especially those related to freedom from supervision and a comparison of wages with other employees.id.at.
although this case resembles burger king in certain respects,the primary duty question can not be answered without the inquiry contemplated by regulation.whether plaintiffs are similarly situated to the burger king assistant managers depends both on whether they were in fact in charge while at their stores and whether,in the particular circumstances of this case,their being in charge compels the conclusion that management was their primary duty.to fully engage those issues,it is necessary to closely examine the record evidence on the factors specified in a as pertinent to the primary duty determination.we thus consider each factor in turn.
relative importance of plaintiffs exempt and other duties 
the record contains evidence that plaintiffs managerial and duties were both essential for the smooth functioning of their restaurants.marzuq testified to multiple tasks that only he performed,including recordkeeping,depositing cash,calibrating equipment,and setting schedules.in his supervisory role,he also interviewed potential employees,trained new hires,and generally oversaw the operation of the stores.these responsibilities reflected the expectations set in cadete formal employment documents,which portray the manager duties as almost exclusively supervisory.the cadete enterprises position profile lists more than two dozen managerial tasks expected of a restaurant manager,only one of which directly anticipates a manager assistance with nonexempt tasks supervise assist in quality customer service similarly,the restaurant manager position agreement states that t he restaurant manager majority of time is spent leading the team to meet guest expectations,recruiting,hiring,and training new crew members as required.
despite the corporate emphasis on supervisory responsibilities,marzuq testimony permits the conclusion that,as a factual matter,his work also was critical to the success of the restaurant.donovan burger king,cir.the bulk of marzuq workweek was spent performing nonexempt work,including serving customers and cleaning.as recounted above,he reported routinely substituting for hourly employees who were sick or absent for other reasons,explaining that every day it a challenge.he had particular difficulty finding replacements for certain shifts especially the midnight shift and the night shift on the weekend and would fill those slots himself he needed to do that nonexempt work,he explained,because he rarely was fully staffed with hourly employees o nce every five,six months.indeed,he stated that he had no choice but to come in on sundays the seventh day of his workweek to complete the paperwork required of him 
if,contrary to their job descriptions,managers could not prioritize their supervisory duties because quality customer service demanded that they regularly perform tasks ordinarily assigned to hourly employees,a factfinder could reasonably conclude that plaintiffs exempt and nonexempt duties were equally important to the successful operation of their restaurants.see,morgan,at upholding jury verdict that store managers are not exempt executives where ample evidence supported a finding that the tasks not only consumed of a store manager time but were of equal or greater importance to a store functioning and success.hence,whether the relative importance of duties factor supports the overtime exemption can not be determined without a factfinder judgment on the impact of the plaintiffs varied undertakings.see id.the jury was free to weigh the relative importance of the store managers managerial and duties.
amount of time spent on exempt work 
marzuq reported that his daily managerial activity included checking calibration on the equipment for about thirty minutes every morning,counting the cash at the end of the morning shift between am and noon entering sales and cash data into the computer,and depositing money at the bank.once a week,he also prepared employee schedules and twice a week he spent five or ten minutes placing an order for dry goods and frozen food items.in addition,he spent between ninety minutes and three hours on training when new employees were hired.more generally,he reported that he did his office work the money counting and deposit,schedules,payroll,inventories,ordering,customer count between and pm on weekdays,and from about noon to or pm on saturdays,and he completed paperwork on sunday mornings and evenings.
for marzuq,however,those administrative tasks added up to a relatively small portion of his workweek because he estimated that he was on the floor,supplementing the crew,for percent of his work hours.of course,working alongside the hourly employees on the floor does not necessarily signify that marzuq was engaged only in activity during those times.as explained above,the regulations contemplate the concurrent performance of exempt and nonexempt tasks.see,in re family dollar flsa,cir family dollar thus,while plaintiff unloaded freight or swept the floors,she was also the manager,and no one else was directly supervising her work.indeed,certain of marzuq managerial responsibilities would appear to be advanced by his working with his subordinates,including coaching them and correcting their mistakes.
nonetheless,the record contains evidence indicating that marzuq supervisory role was,at least at times,overwhelmed by his tasks.more than once,he clarified that he tried to exercise his managerial duties and he reported needing to do various tasks that would take him away from the customer service area of the store cleaning the bathroom,cleaning up outside the store,landscaping and,hence,appear inconsistent with employee supervision.by contrast,in family dollar,where the appellate panel affirmed summary judgment for the employer on an flsa overtime claim,the plaintiff acknowledged that,while she performed nonmanagerial tasks around the store as she determined necessary,she concurrently performed the managerial duties of running the store.at emphasis omitted 
the time factor is particularly complex in this case because marzuq routinely worked far in excess of the threshold required by the cadete manager agreement.his regular schedule called for hours over seven days but because he substituted for absent employees,his average workweek was seventy to eighty hours.in addition,he acted as captain of the s
