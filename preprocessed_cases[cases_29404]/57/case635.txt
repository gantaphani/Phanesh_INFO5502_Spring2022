plaintiff argues the district court erred in excluding her expert witness,alonso,from testifying at trial.specifically,plaintiff claims she fully disclosed alonso name as an expert witness almost six months prior to trial.further,plaintiff argues she satisfied the written expert report requirements under rule a b when she submitted alonso psychiatric evaluation,resume,and plaintiff medical records to defendant on various occasions.
plaintiff timely disclosed alonso as an expert witness plaintiff,however,failed to provide a written expert report.rule requires the disclosure of a witness who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the witness.a b.the written report must contain 
a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor the data or otherinformation considered by the witness in forming the opinions any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions the qualifications of the witness,including a list of all publications authored by the witness within the preceding ten years the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony and a listing of any other cases in which the witness has testified as an expert at trial or by deposition within the preceding four years.

in this case,plaintiff expert witness,alonso,did not prepare or submit a written report meeting the requirements of rule a b.although plaintiff appears to have submitted,at various times throughout discovery,a series of documents consisting of alonso psychiatric evaluation,his resume,and plaintiff medical records,such disclosures do not satisfy rule a.specifically,the documents did not explain the basis and reasons for alonso opinions describe any exhibits alonso planned on using list alonso publications or other cases in which he had testified previously or set forth alonso expected compensation for his testimony and services.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding alonso from testifying as an expert witness at trial.
moreover,even assuming the documents satisfied the requirements of rule a,the district court,in excluding alonso testimony,may have also relied on plaintiff failure to provide an english translation of alonso psychiatric evaluation and resume as the local rules require.see b noting a ll pleadings and proceedings in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico shall be conducted in the english language.the district court did not abuse its discretion.further,plaintiff did not attempt to remedy her omission before the district court or to obtain a stipulation from opposing counsel as to an accurate translation.thus,there is no occasion to consider whether plaintiff error could be rendered harmless by later events.see united states,cir.
