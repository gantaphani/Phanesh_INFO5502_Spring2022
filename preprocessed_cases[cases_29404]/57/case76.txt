this appeal involves a suit for pension benefits that george vendura brings against northrop grumman northrop and a number of related entities and individuals the key point of contention concerns the number of years of benefit service that should be credited to vendura in calculating his pension benefits under his pension plan.we affirm the judgment below,which grants summary judgment to defendants.
vendura was hired by trw trw in and became a participant in the trw salaried pension plan trw plan.after vendura worked for trw for seven years,he went on medical leave in june of,in consequence of injuries that he had suffered much earlier.during this leave,vendura received social security and disability benefits.vendura also applied for and,he contends,received workers compensation benefits during this time.
in,northrop acquired trw and renamed the company northrup grumman space and mission systems ngsmsc.soon thereafter,ngsmsc attempted to terminate vendura employment.vendura,however,challenged the attempt to lay him off,and,in,vendura and ngsmsc signed a settlement agreement that kept vendura on board at ngsmsc.
the settlement agreement provided that vendura would remain an employee of ngsmsc and receive all benefits and rights to which he is entitled pursuant to all benefit plans for which he is eligible.the settlement agreement further provided that vendura would cease to be a ngsmsc employee only when one of several specific conditions came to pass.one of those conditions was that vendura ltd disability status ends.
because this case concerns a dispute over pension benefits rather than employment,however,the settlement agreement matters only insofar as it relates to vendura pension plan.and,the relevant pension plan is the ngsmsc salaried pension plan ngsmsc plan,which,for former trw employees like vendura,incorporated the eligibility criteria set forth in the trw plan.
the trw plan provides that pension benefits for participants,like vendura,are to be calculated on the basis of the participant years of benefit service.section of the trw plan,in subsection a,makes clear that such years include ones in which a participant receives compensation for the performance of services.but,in the subsequent subsections of section,the trw plan allows participants to accrue years of benefit service even for periods of time in which the participant is absent from work,so long as that absence is for a reason that is specified in one of those subsections in section.
only two of the subsections are relevant here subsections b and c.until,these two subsections read as follows 
b absence without pay from work because of injury or occupational disease received in the course of his employment with the controlled group and for which he receives workers compensation disability benefits provided,however,that service credit shall be limited to a maximum of twelve months unless the participant has met the eligibility requirements for receiving long term disability benefits whether or not he actually receives such benefits 
c absence without pay from work due to a disability and for which he is entitled to receive disability benefits under any plan maintained by a member of the controlled group.
effective january,however,the trw plan was amended by,among other things,changing subsection c,subsection c reads as follows 
c absence without pay from work due to a disability and for which he is entitled to receive disability benefits under any plan maintained by a member of the controlled group,provided,however,with respect to an absence from work beginning on or after january,as a result of disability,i no more than sixty months of benefit service will be credited under this section c for a participant with five or more years of vesting service and ii no more than twelve months of benefit service will be credited under this section c for a participant with less than five years of vesting service at the time such absence from work commences.
emphasis added to highlight the newly added language.
the proper interpretation of these subsections became a subject of controversy after vendura disability insurer informed vendura in october of that his eligibility for disability benefits would expire in february of.vendura did not dispute that his disability benefits would expire at that time,or that,per the settlement agreement,his employment with ngsmsc would thus come to an end.for that reason,vendura inquired about his pension benefits and received a retirement kit from the northrop grumman benefits center 
in april of,vendura filed a claim for pension benefits with the administrative committee for the ngsmsc plan.under the documents comprising the ngsmsc plan,the administrative committee is the plan administrator under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,and possesses the full and sole discretionary authority to interpret all plan documents and to make all interpretive and factual determinations as to whether any individual is entitled to receive any benefit and the amount of such benefit under the terms of the plan.
in making his pension benefits claim to the administrative committee,vendura argued that he is entitled to twenty years of benefit service under the settlement agreement.vendura also argued that,even independent of the settlement agreement,he is entitled to that same number of years of benefit service under the plain terms of subsection b of section.finally,vendura argued that he is entitled to elect a distribution of his pension.
the administrative committee rejected vendura arguments in letters sent to him in may and june of.the letters informed vendura that he was eligible for a pension reflecting only twelve years of benefit service and not the twenty years of benefit service that vendura contended that he had accrued.the letters also rejected vendura contention that vendura was entitled to elect a distribution of his pension.
the administrative committee calculation of vendura years of benefit service reflected the following determinations.the administrative committee concluded that the settlement agreement does not provide for accrual of benefit service beyond the right of accrual under the ngsmsc plan itself.the administrative committee further found that,under the ngsmsc plan,by virtue of section of the trw plan that it incorporates,vendura was entitled only to five years of benefit service for the thirteen years in which he was both absent from work due to his disability and for which he was eligible for disability benefits.the administrative committee based that determination on the amended version of subsection c of section,which the administrative committee concluded barred a participant from accruing more than sixty months of benefit service based on the participant eligibility for disability benefits.the administrative committee therefore credited vendura with only twelve years of benefit service,based on the five years of benefit service that he accrued during his absence from work and the seven years of benefit service that he accrued under subsection a of section during his employment with trw and before his absence began.
vendura appealed the decision to the administrative committee,which issued its final decision denying vendura appeal with respect to each of these issues on december.so,in,vendura filed an complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against the defendants.
the main issue on appeal arises under erisa,which permits a pension plan participant to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.vendura invokes this provision of erisa in his complaint in requesting that the district court compel defendants to fulfill their obligations under the ngsmsc plan.vendura also brings a separate state law claim,in which he argues that defendants are in breach of their obligations under the settlement agreement,given what he contends is the agreement relationship to his rights under his pension plan.
after the defendants moved for summary judgment,the district court granted the motion.the district court ruled that the settlement agreement alone did not provide vendura any right to accrue years of benefit service beyond those to which he would otherwise have been entitled.the district court also ruled that the administrative committee interpretation of the ngsmsc plan,under which the cap on the accrual of years of benefit service that subsection c sets forth applies to vendura,was not arbitrary and capricious.and,on that basis,the district court ruled that vendura was not entitled to pension benefits calculated based on his having accrued twenty years of benefit service.finally,the district court ruled that,in light of its finding with respect to the number of years of benefit service to which vendura was entitled,vendura also was not entitled to elect a distribution of his pension.
this timely appeal of the summary judgment order followed.
we start with vendura claim based on the settlement agreement.he argues that because the settlement agreement makes clear that vendura remained an employee of ngsmsc until his eligibility for disability benefits expired,it necessarily also entitled him to continue to accrue years of benefit service for pension purposes up until that point in time.and,for that reason,vendura contends he is entitled to the full twenty years of benefit service under the settlement agreement.
the district court,like the administrative committee,rejected this argument.we review the district court interpretation of the settlement agreement de novo.see officemax,levesque,cir.contract interpretation is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.see also hannington sun life and health ins,cir.material is reviewed de novo.and,on de novo review,we conclude that vendura interpretation of the settlement agreement is without merit.
vendura is right that,under the settlement agreement,he remained an employee of ngsmsc until his eligibility for disability benefits expired.and he is right that his eligibility for those benefits did not expire until february of.but the settlement agreement merely provides that vendura is entitled to all benefits and rights to which he is entitled pursuant to all benefit plans for which he is eligible.thus,by its terms,the settlement agreement just provides that vendura retains the status of an employee and is entitled to receive whatever pension benefits under the ngsmsc plan that he would otherwise be entitled to by virtue of being an employee.for this reason,the settlement agreement does not help vendura.it merely directs us to examine those provisions of the ngsmsc plan,including those provisions of the trw plan that the ngsmsc plan incorporates,which bear on vendura right to accrue years of benefit service.and so we now turn to those provisions.
as we have noted,the ngsmsc plan vests the administrative committee with the authority to interpret and apply the relevant provisions.as a result,and in accord with the requirements of erisa,we review the administrative committee interpretations under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,which is functionally equivalent to the abuse of discretion standard.wright donnelley sons.grp.benefits plan,cir.and,under that standard,we must defer to plan administrators when they reasonably construe ambiguous plan terms.see,kolling am.power conversion,cir.
in assessing the administrative committee interpretation,it helps first to understand vendura proposed interpretation.under subsection a of section of the trw plan,vendura unquestionably accrued seven years of benefit service because he was compensated for his performance of services to trw for seven years.but,he readily concedes,due to the disability that he suffered from injuries and the extended absence from work that resulted,he was not in compliance with that condition thereafter.
vendura contends,however,that he was in compliance with the condition for accruing years of benefit service set forth in the very next subsection of section subsection b because he contends that he received workers compensation benefits due to his disability after he was no longer able to work he thus argues that he falls within the first half of subsection b,which provides for the accrual of benefit service for those participants who are absen t without pay from work because of injury or occupational disease received in the course of the participant employment with the controlled group and for which the participant receives workers compensation disability benefits.
but participants who meet the condition specified in the first half of subsection b are,the rest of subsection b makes clear,entitled to accrue only one year of benefit service on that basis.and,if that one year is added to the seven years for which vendura provided active service to trw and was compensated,for which subsection a entitled him to accrue seven years of benefit service,he would be entitled to only a total of eight years of benefit service.
vendura nevertheless continues undeterred.he explains that the second half of subsection b shows that he is in fact entitled to the extra twelve years of benefit service that he also contends that he accrued.vendura points out that the second half of subsection b provides that service credit shall be limited to a maximum of twelve months unless the participant has met the eligibility requirements for receiving long term disability benefits whether or not he actually receives such benefits emphasis added.he also points out that this highlighted language places no temporal limit on a participant right to accrue years of benefit service beyond the temporal limit on the participant eligibility for the disability benefits themselves.vendura therefore argues that the trailing language in the second half of subsection b sets forth a separate entitlement to accrue years of benefit service based on eligibility for disability that is distinct from the entitlement to years of benefit service based on receipt of workers compensation that is set forth in the first half of subsection b.and because his eligibility for disability benefits did not expire until february of,vendura contends that subsection b entitles him to accrue years of benefit service for the whole of that time.
the administrative committee counters vendura by pointing out that subsection b is not the only subsection that addresses a participant right to accrue years of benefit service on the basis of eligibility for disability benefits.in fact,the very next provision in section subsection c does so as well.and the administrative committee points to that provision and the cap on the accrual of years of benefit service that it contains in offering its competing interpretation of the trailing language in the second half of subsection b and how that language relates to subsection c.
specifically,in its june letter to vendura,the administrative committee described its view of the relationship between subsections b and c,and how they apply to a participant like vendura,as follows 
i f a participant receives workers compensation and disability benefits concurrently,his benefit service is based on the period during which he received disability benefits subject to the limit in subsection c described above.in your case,you received disability benefits once your leave of absence began in.as a result,any workers compensation benefits that you received during the same period are disregarded under the plan.
accordingly,that letter explained,vendura was subject to the cap on the accrual of years of benefit service in the amended subsection c.and,in a later letter,the administrative committee elaborated further and noted that,historically,w hen a participant received workers compensation and disability benefits concurrently his benefit service was always based on the period during which he received disability benefits.in that letter,the administrative committee rejected vendura contrary contention on the ground that subsection b did not create a loophole that would override the cap imposed by subsection c.
thus,the administrative committee rejects vendura view that the second half of subsection b c
