as ricardo ríos tells it,his professional life as a purchasing officer for the municipality of san juan became a nightmare when jorge santini became san juan mayor in.ríos is an ardent supporter of the popular democratic party pdp.santini belongs to a rival political party,the new progressive party npp.so does zenaida díaz,ríos supervisor.santini,díaz,and other npp operatives there pursued a purely political vendetta against him,ríos says,doing things like diminishing his responsibilities,paying him less than similarly situated colleagues,taunting him about his colon cancer,and menacing him with strange comments and gestures,during a may political rally santini screamed at ríos,you are alone and i am going to cut your head off,and then ran a finger across his throat,which led ríos to file a complaint with the police.building to a crescendo,ríos contends that members falsely accused him of disciplinary infractions as a excuse to fire him in july for his political leanings and for his speaking out on matters of public concern,his telling others about santini job performance and the frightening encounter at the may rally making sure,of course,to rig the hearing to reach a predetermined conclusion 
as santini and díaz tell it,ríos was a nightmare employee a vulgar person who routinely humiliated and terrorized coworkers and supervisors alike,by word and action.arrogant and defiant,ríos,they say,lied through his teeth about santini shouting and motion at the may rally.ríos,not santini,was the real villain,they insist.giving santini the middle finger,ríos yelled,you are going down.no one bought ríos story,they quickly add,because,after an investigation,prosecutors found no reason to charge santini with anything.ríos had a record of disciplinary problems as long as the proverbial arm,but everyone always treated him,all the way through the hearing and firing or so their argument goes.
proceedings 
convinced that he had been let go because of his pdp membership and his exercise of rights,ríos and his domestic partner,emma velázquez rodríguez,filed this suit under having apparently lived together since,the two consider themselves married for all intents and purposes,though no one has officially married them.no party has made anything of this,and so we follow their lead,treating her claims as derivative of his and referring to him as if he were the only plaintiff.
skipping over,ríos first sued the municipality,santini,and two unnamed defendants in april,alleging that his dismissal offended the first amendment a covering count claims of political harassment,discrimination,and retaliation.he also alleged that his firing infracted the fourteenth amendment an umbrella encompassing count and count claims.invoking the district court supplemental jurisdiction,he also asserted claims arising under local law in counts negligence and retaliatory employment discrimination.he later filed a notice voluntarily dismissing that complaint without prejudice,which the district judge noted in june.see.a.
in august ríos filed a second complaint,which was identical in all relevant respects to the first.he then amended that complaint in january,adding díaz as a defendant and a separate count against all defendants.that count became count,with the old count renumbered,the old count renumbered,and so on.
a word about ríos pleading style is appropriate.as pled,the component of count pivots off his contention that defendants fired him to retaliate for a his political affiliation and b his activity.allegation a is subsumed in count claim.allegation b is subsumed in count claim.see generally mercado berrios cancel alegría,cir discussing the elements of each claim.and that is how we will deal with these allegations.see generally alpine bank hubbell,cir explaining that courts can not rely solely on labels in a complaint but instead must probe deeper and examine the substance quoting minger green,cir internal quotation marks omitted minger,at stressing that the label which a plaintiff applies to a pleading does not determine the nature of the cause of action which he states quoting united states louisville nashville,cir internal quotation marks omitted charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at,ed noting that courts must make a determined effort to understand what the pleader is attempting to set forth and to construe the pleading in his or her favor,whenever the interest of justice so requires,adding too that a pleading will be judged by the quality of its substance rather than according to its form or label footnotes omitted.
now on to the rulings at issue here.after some discovery,the parties moved for summary judgment ríos on the claim,and santini,the municipality,and díaz on the entire gamut of federal and state claims.the judge denied ríos motion and granted the defendants.his reasoning ran this way 
ríos complains about events that happened between january or so when santini became mayor and july when ríos got fired,which triggered a protest from santini and the municipality.a claim is a federal claim,but the limitations period is drawn from state law here,puerto rico statute of limitations for actions.see,centro medico del turabo,feliciano de melecio,cir.tolling provisions apply too unless they clash with federal interests,which is not the case here.see,rodríguez garcía municipality of caguas,cir.under puerto rico law,the filing of a lawsuit tolls the limitations period.see,rodríguez suzuki motor,cir discussing laws ann.tit.if the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the suit without prejudice,the limitations clock resets and run s anew from th at date.see rodríguez garcía,at accord rodríguez,at.also,the earlier suit will toll the limitations period as to a suit if the two suits allege identical causes of action.see,rodríguez,at.and tolling a statute of limitations against one defendant tolls it against all solidarily liable defendants solidarily liable is a concept that is a close cousin to the doctrine of joint and several liability.tokyo marine fire ins,pérez,de puerto rico,cir.above and beyond all that,there is the doctrine,which to oversimplify slightly lets one put off suing until a series of acts by the future defendant blossoms into a wrongful injury on which suit can be brought.pérez sánchez public,cir quoting morales tañon puerto rico power,cir internal quotation marks omitted.one of the best examples happens to be a case based on the cumulative effect of individual acts,none of which is necessarily actionable on its own,that reveals itself over time,not discrete discriminatory acts that occur on a particular day.see passenger morgan,d.
applying these principles,the judge concluded that ríos causes of action had to have arisen from events occurring between april and april given this range,only claims tied to ríos may with santini and his later firing survived,the judge ruled.ríos could not use the doctrine to get other events in beyond the limitations period,the judge added each act was a separate actionable wrong.and ríos count which he unveiled for the first time in his january amended complaint fell because it failed the identicality requirement when measured against his earlier,suit.
as for the merits,the judge tossed the and harassment claims,finding that ríos presented no evidence that santini a knew ríos political affiliation,b abused ríos or encouraged or tolerated ríos abuse,or c had a hand in ríos firing.and the judge jettisoned the claim because it was just a rehash of the failed first amendment claims.the judge then rejected the claim,ruling that the record disclosed no evidence of santini meddling with the termination process.given that santini could not be liable under,the judge saw no basis for holding díaz solidarily liable.the judge also rejected any suggestion that the january amended complaint which added díaz as a defendant related back to the original complaint and,thus,under,cured any problems.and,finally,because santini could not be held liable for violations,the judge saw no reason for holding the municipality liable either.so,wrapping up,the judge denied ríos motion on the claim,granted the defendants motions on that and the other claims,and dismissed the supplemental claims without prejudice.he dismissed the unnamed parties from the case too.
the judge later declined to reconsider his decision,rejecting among other things ríos bid to fix a serious problem ignoring the court local rules ríos had submitted versions of two affidavits with his papers.when he tried to file the required certified english translations with his motion to reconsider,the judge called the effort too little and too late.
ríos with his wife now appeals,presenting a profusion of issues.after getting rid of several of them up front,we take on what remains,mindful of the standards of review that apply.for starters,we review summary judgment de novo,construing the record and all reasonable inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see,hernandez loring universidad metropolitana,cir.of course,the ground rules for summary judgment leave no room for credibility determinations,no room for the measured weighing of conflicting evidence such as the trial process entails,no room for the judge to superimpose his own ideas of probability and likelihood no matter how reasonable those ideas may be on the cold pages of the record.greenburg puerto rico.shipping,cir.also,that multiple parties for summary judgment on ríos claim does not affect this protocol in the slightest.see,d h therapy,llc boston mut.life ins,cir explaining that the district judge must assess each motion separately,drawing inferences against each moving party in turn,and that we must still exercise de novo review.next,we analyze the issue for abuse of discretion.see,ruiz rivera pfizer,llc,cir.when all is said and done,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for new proceedings.
it should go without saying that we deem waived claims not made or claims adverted to in a cursory fashion,unaccompanied by developed argument.see tejada batista morales,cir stressing that a n argument not seriously developed in the opening brief is lost see also grigous gonzáles,cir canto concord,cir.and we consider waived arguments confusingly constructed and lacking in coherence.united states eirby,cir.judges are not,so parties must spell out their issues clearly,highlighting the relevant facts and analyzing authority.see united states bongiorno,cir see also rodríguez señor frog de la isla,cir rodríguez garcía miranda marín,cir,cert.denied,d janeiro urological surgery prof l ass n,cir.and they must give us the raw materials transcripts spring quickly to mind so that we can do our work,or they may lose as a consequence.see,rodríguez,at citing campos orrego rivera,cir,and moore murphy,cir.
ríos handling of his,and claims falls short of satisfying these requirements.sure,he uses some buzzwords and insists that the judge stumbled in ruling on these claims.but he provides neither the necessary caselaw nor reasoned analysis to show that he is right about any of this.he offers no cases on the issue.he gives us one case on the question,but he cites no evidence that santini instigated or knowingly tolerated the harassment,and he makes no effort to show that the harassment was substantial enough to support a claim.he points to a smattering of cases on the topic and contends that the evidence shows a series of discriminatory acts,but he does not clearly specify what this series was.what he has done is hardly a serious treatment of complex issue s and is not sufficient to preserve these points for review,tayag lahey clinic,cir certainly not when his brief presents a passel of other issues,united states dunkel,cir per curiam.see also united states zannino,cir warning that it is not enough for litigants to mention arguments in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work.the upshot is that these claims are waived.
ríos does no better with his claim,for this reason he did not give us a complete english translation of the commission proceedings,which we would need to help decide whether process misfired here.so he loses this aspect of his appeal.see,rodríguez,at tejada batista,at.
similar problems affect ríos attempt to undo the ruling for díaz.he suggests that díaz is solidarily liable,which,again,is a rather complex tolling concept in puerto rico law.see,rodríguez,at.but he devotes only a single sentence in his opening brief to the issue,which simply asserts that he tolled the statute of limitations by suing parties including the municipality solidarily liable with appellee díaz.he does not explain how that concept works generally or how it works here.the net result is that this issue is waived.see,town of norwood fed.energy reg.comm n,cir emphasizing,yet again,that developing a sustained argument out of legal precedents is the job of the appellant,not the reviewing court.
finally,ríos does not challenge the judge decision dismissing the unnamed defendants from the suit.consequently,we need say no more about that as well.see,united states slade,cir.
we move along,then,to the issues.
summary judgment 
a political discrimination 
the first amendment shields public employees from political firings,unless,of course,partisan considerations are a legitimate requirement for the position in question.peñalbert rosa fortuño burset,cir.no one argues that ríos came within that exception,so we continue on.a plaintiff like ríos must show that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in his ouster.see,healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d peñalbert rosa,at.if he does,then the burden shifts to the defendants to show that they would have made the same decision regardless of his political ties a defense familiarly known as the healthy defense.padilla garcía guillermo rodríguez,cir discussing healthy,at.
ríos insists that the defendants drummed him out of municipal service because of his pdp affiliation.despite what the district judge thought,santini knew about ríos pdp membership,ríos says a point driven home by santini ranting at ríos during the may political rally that y ou are alone and i am going to cut your head off something others besides ríos testified they heard and saw too.ríos was a politically isolated target under santini,ríos quickly adds that was the gist of santini harangue.and,the argument continues,hot on the heels of this nasty affair,santini and the npp got ríos fired to retaliate for his not being an npper.
not so fast,the defendants say.santini did not know ríos,did not know his party affiliation,and did not say or do what ríos claims he said and did at the may political event.and assuming solely for purposes that santini hollered at ríos,you are alone and i am going to cut your head off,and then,on top of that,made a motion with his finger,santini and the municipality contend that none of this had anything to do with politics.at worst,what santini supposedly said and did,they insist,simply amounted to a threat to physically assault ríos.
we are not persuaded.consider the context.viewing the record and all reasonable inferences drawn from it in the light most flattering to ríos,we see that some of ríos knew he was a pdp member.his knew too.the political atmosphere there was highly partisan.and ríos was on the wrong side.special aide díaz drove that point home,calling him the isolated popular recall that the first p in pdp stands for popular.not to be outdone,executive officer miguel orta called him that fucking popular.
to the may political rally.a tumultuous clash between the legislature and the in puerto rico led to a government shutdown.rallying to the npp cause,santini held an vigil near the governor mansion.a good crowd showed up.politicians were milling about.partisanship was in the air,clearly.santini spotted ríos.and then he allegedly made the you alone and i comments.given the group at the scene,a rational finder of fact could infer,quite easily,that santini was not saying that ríos was simply hanging out alone at the rally.actually,santini you alone statement is eerily similar to díaz gibe about ríos being the isolated popular at work.from all this,a rational factfinder could infer that santini knew ríos and ríos politics,which were on the outs with the ruling npp.as if more were needed,another witness to the jeers santini directed at ríos at the rally also heard santini tell his escort that he,meaning ríos,is,like limited here in his capacity which certainly suggests that santini knew ríos.and a factfinder could deduce from this set of events that santini wanted ríos gone from his office that is the message behind santini i tirade,that santini was bent on eliminating ríos job with the municipality as an act of political payback.
this brings us to the multifaceted question of whether political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind ríos firing and if so whether santini participated in that decision.see,ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir peñalbert rosa,at.interpreting the record favorably to ríos,we answer yes to the first part,given the facts and inferences that we just noted not the least of which is santini administration putting the termination process into high gear a mere two days after santini menacing outburst at ríos.see peñalbert rosa,at noting that w hile there may have been some reason independent of political party for the firing,the opposite inference may be drawn from,among other things,the timing of the discharge we answer yes to the second part too,though it is a close call.
puerto rico law gives mayors like santini the ultimate authority over municipal hiring and firing decisions.see laws ann.tit,o.hoping to avoid the rather obvious implications of this,santini makes much of the fact that he had delegated to others the power to formulate charges against and to dismiss municipal employees.done way back in well before ríos lost his job,these delegations were on the,santini quickly adds.see id.x discussing the mayor right to delegate certain powers,functions and duties that are conferred by this subtitle.and those on the receiving end of santini delegations,maritza aguilar jusino and jorge colomer montes,filed affidavits saying that they neither consulted with nor took instructions from him concerning ríos termination.
but santini testified at his deposition that he did not normally participate in the termination process.normally does not mean always,of course.see walker exeter region coop.sch,cir.and,giving all reasonable factual inferences to ríos,santini statement leaves open the possibility that he did participate in ríos firing an inference that stands out in bold relief,given that santini does not point us to any place in the massive record where he personally denied participating in ríos dismissal.also,to the extent that this justifiable inference butts up against aguilar and colomer affidavits,that simply shows that a triable issue of fact exists as to santini participation see,mandel boston phoenix,cir.
we summarize concisely.as we have said many times,s ummary judgment is not a substitute for the trial of disputed factual issues.walgren howes,cir quoting charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at internal quotation marks omitted.and eyeing the record here in the light most agreeable to ríos,we see a genuine dispute about material facts,an actual controversy over facts that might affect the case outcome under the governing law.see,anderson liberty lobby,d.consequently,we reverse the grant of on the claim.
b free speech retaliation 
ríos also faults the judge for concluding that puerto rico tolling laws did not save the count,which first appeared in the january amended complaint.captioned violation of free speech guaranteed by the first amendment,count of the january amended complaint alleged that ríos denounced the death threat from santini and criticized santini policies speech that involved matters of public concern,overshadowed any countervailing governmental interest in promoting the efficient performance of public service,and was a motivating factor in his termination.to ríos way of thinking,a constellation of events reflected in his april complaint clearly points to a kindred free speech claim.and that,he says,makes the april complaint and the january amended complaint functionally identical for tolling purposes,despite what the judge held.ríos has a point,and it is a winning point too.
puerto rico identicality requirement has three essentials the causes of action must seek the same type of relief,be based on the same substantive claims,and,generally speaking,be asserted against the same defendants in the same capacities.rodríguez garcía,at.ríos asked for the same basic type of relief in both complaints.and both complaints allege the same basic substantive claims too.true,the april complaint is not emblazoned with the phrase free speech count like the january amended complaint.but one can readily infer claims from the facts pled in the april complaint.there,ríos discussed santini bizarre acts at the may political rally,explained how he complained to the police about them,stressed how the municipality gave notice of its intent to fire him days later,and,finally,accused the defendants of punishing him for making statements protected under the first amendment.also,ríos alleged that he exercised his rights to speak out on other matters of public concern,including,but not limited to,santini shoddy work as mayor,particularly when it came to keeping the city clean,adding that the defendants retaliated against him for doing just that.all of this parallels what he alleged in the january amended complaint.as for the requirement,ríos pressed these claims against the municipality and santini in both complaints,and he sued santini in the same capacities in both suits which put them on notice of his claims and allows us to check off this last factor.see id.at.
the bottom line is that the judge erred in scrapping count of the january amended complaint on grounds.but because we may affirm summary judgment on any basis supported in the record,see,pure,baker,cir,we soldier on.
as a fallback,santini and the municipality contend here as they did below that the undisputed facts entitle them to judgment as a matter of law on the claim.to establish retaliation,a plaintiff like ríos must show that he spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,that his interest in speaking outweighed the government interest,as his employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it provides an inquiry known as pickering balancing,see pickering bd.of,d,and that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor in his firing.see,foote town of bedford,cir quoting curran cousins,cir see also díaz bigio santini,cir.santini and the municipality argue like this a ríos presented zero evidence that santini had anything to do with the firing,which is a reprise of the delegation point.b ríos also could not show that santini knew that ríos had criticized his sanitation policies.and c ríos could therefore not show that his speech played a substantial or motivating role in his dismissal this argument fails.
we have already explained why their delegation argument falters.true,they are in saying that the record does not show that santini heard about ríos carping but that does not matter.after all,the core of ríos claim has two parts,as everyone seems to agree his sanitation critique and his reporting santini threat to the police.interestingly,santini and the municipality intimated below that santini did not know what ríos had said to the police.but the record contains evidence supporting santini knowledge of what ríos had told the authorities,a witness to the íos incident said that a prosecutor had interviewed him with santini lawyers present and santini himself admitted that he knew ríos had filed a complaint,that he had directed an attorney to look into the matter,and that he had been briefed on the situation too.ultimately,this evidence undoes the line of reasoning that they pursue here.
perhaps sensing their vulnerability on this issue,santini and the municipality attack ríos account on several fronts.but their complaints basically go to ríos credibility,and credibility is best resolved at trial rather than at the stage.see,sensin
