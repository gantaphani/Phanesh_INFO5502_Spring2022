michael dinan,a resident of maine,began working for alpha networks as a salesman in pursuant to a written employment agreement.in dinan ceased working for alpha because of a dispute over how much he was entitled to be paid in commissions.litigation followed.a jury ultimately found that the written agreement included no promise to pay dinan commissions on sales after,but that dinan was entitled to damages in the amount of for sales made in and.the question then remained whether to treble those damages and award attorneys fees under maine wage payment law,or instead to add on to the damage award only liquidated damages of under california law.finding the question to be a close one,the district court opted to rely on a provision in the written agreement calling for application of california law in certain disputes.agreeing that determining the correct choice of law on this unusual record is not straightforward,we nevertheless find that maine highest court would most likely deem dinan entitled to the full array of remedies set forth in maine wage payment law.we therefore vacate the award and remand the case so that the district court can treble damages,calculate interest,and entertain a request for attorneys fees under maine law.
background 
the parties do not dispute the basic facts on appeal.alpha is a designer and manufacturer of modems,routers,switches,and other computer hardware.rather than market its products under its own brand,alpha is a manufacturer,selling to other companies who market the devices under their brand names.dinan job was to sell alpha devices to those brands.when dinan joined alpha in,he lived in portland,maine.though he initially thought he might have to move to boston,alpha ultimately concluded that he could work from maine.prior to commencing work for alpha,dinan signed a letter from alpha specifying the terms of his employment the agreement which provided that alpha would pay him,in part,based on a specified commission structure.
after he joined alpha,dinan spent his first week and a half in california learning about alpha and its products.thereafter he worked from his home in portland except when he traveled to meet customers in other states,including texas,alabama,and massachusetts.in,alpha sent an email to dinan containing a new commission structure the compensation plan.dinan thought that the compensation plan was likely to compensate him less than the commission structure in the agreement.he expressed his unhappiness to his bosses and,according to his trial testimony,was promised a new compensation plan for sales in,though he was not promised that it would provide him with better terms than the compensation plan.no new compensation plan was ever announced.
dinan left alpha in march,having received no commissions on his sales in or aside from a payment that he received in december of.shortly thereafter,dinan filed suit in maine state court.after alpha removed the case to federal court it proceeded to trial.at trial,the jury was asked to consider,among other things,dinan claims for breach of contract and,alternatively,for damages.the jury concluded that dinan had not established that alpha and he entered into an employment agreement in which alpha promised to pay him commissions for and.it nevertheless also found that dinan had established that he was entitled to damages under,that the amount of those damages was,and that he had established that alpha failed to pay him his wages,including commissions.
after trial the parties disagreed about which state law governed whether and to what extent the jury award of damages should be augmented with additional remedies.under california law,the parties agree,dinan would be entitled to days wages which the jury valued at as liquidated damages in addition to the in compensatory damages awarded by the jury.see cal.the parties also agree that,under maine law,dinan would be entitled to a liquidated damages award of double his compensatory damages,equaling an additional,as well as attorneys fees and costs.see.tit.the district court found that california law applied.dinan also argued unsuccessfully below that he was entitled to prejudgment interest on any liquidated damages he was awarded.id.
ii.standard of review 
this appeal presents exclusively questions of law,not fact or discretion,hence our review is de novo.see,robidoux muholland,cir.with jurisdiction in the district of maine resting solely on diversity of citizenship,we answer these substantive questions of law as we expect maine highest court,its law court,would answer them.see,samaan joseph,cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the choice of law question 
resolving the issue central to this appeal begins with considering the parties agreement specifying the original terms of dinan employment.that agreement included the following clause 
the terms of this letter shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of california,without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule whether of the state of california or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of california.any term or provision of this letter agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.
see dinan alpha networks,d.under maine law,this choice of law provision would govern a claim for breach of the agreement unless california had no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction or applying california law would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than california as to the determination of this particular issue.schroeder.rynel,me restatement second of conflict of laws.
alpha in fact sought to build its defense at trial on the foundation of the agreement.it argued that the compensation plan was a modification of the employment agreement,that dinan accepted the modification by continuing to work for alpha,and that the agreement,as modified by the compensation plan,set forth the terms of alpha promise to pay commissions for and.consistent with this approach,alpha agreed to a jury instruction as follows 
the parties have presented evidence of a compensation plan and a compensation plan.if you determine that an agreement was in force in and,you must determine the terms of that agreement.alpha contends that a compensation plan modified the employment agreement.an employee who continues to work for his employer after the employer has given notice of changed terms and conditions of employment has accepted the changed terms and conditions.if you find the plan was in place during and,you may find that dinan is entitled to compensation under that plan.
this was a seemingly solid argument,but the jury rejected it.the jury found that alpha and dinan had no agreement that alpha would pay commissions for and.in one respect,this meant that alpha won the breach of contract claim.in another respect,though,the jury verdict is more clearly read as a finding that the agreement simply did not govern the terms of the parties relationship in and,in the words of the district court instruction,it was not in force in and.
the verdict form,accordingly,required the jury to proceed further and consider an alternative claim of if it found that there was no promise in an employment agreement to pay commissions for and.the jury verdict for dinan thus rested entirely upon a claim for breach of a.the jury instructions,to which alpha did not object,stated as follows 
dinan claims that even if he did not have a valid contract with alpha that entitled him to bonuses,he is entitled to payment for the services he rendered.this amounts to a claim that he and alpha had a quasi contract.
to prove a claim of breach for breach of a quasi contract,dinan must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that one,he rendered services to alpha two,the services were rendered with alpha knowledge and consent and,three,the services were rendered under circumstances that make it reasonable for the plaintiff to expect payment.
in finding alpha liable on this theory alone,the jury found alpha independently liable not by force of promise,but by virtue of knowingly having accepted services under circumstances that make it reasonable for dinan to expect payment.
this brings us back to the clause in alpha letter to dinan that constituted the agreement.while alpha claims that the clause governs disputes about the parties employment relationship,it is in fact narrower than that.it states only that t he terms of this letter are to be governed by and construed and enforced under california law.the question of what fair compensation is due dinan under a theory calls for no construction or enforcement of the terms of that letter.rather,instead of telling the jury to calculate damages based on a reading of the agreement,the court again without challenge told the jury to determine the reasonable value of the services.
alpha also argues that what really happened here is that the jury came up with a missing term of the agreement,a compensation plan for and.such an approach certainly would have made much sense in the abstract.the problem is that the jury clearly found no breach of any promise of any type,whether express or implied,under the agreement,instead effectively finding that the agreement simply did not deal with and commissions.and the agreement on its face disavows having any unexpressed terms,stating that it form s the complete and exclusive statement of dinan employment with alpha.in any event,since alpha agreed that the jury could consider a claim for breach of even where the parties had an actual contract,and since the jury found no breach of any promise in the agreement,it can not now say that the jury should only have been allowed to hold it liable for a breach of a term of the agreement,whether express or missing.
in sum,the parties agreement about the law to be applied in construing and enforcing the agreement does not apply to a duty that,the jury found,arose outside of that agreement.and while alpha argues that the jury verdict seems hard to reconcile with the facts,alpha has filed no challenging either the jury instructions or the jury finding on the claim,and so we must accept that finding of liability as a given.
anticipating that we might find that the provision in the agreement does not directly apply to dinan claim,alpha advances two arguments for applying the agreement indirectly.first,it argues that because claims are a type of contract claim,we should apply to the claim the same choice of law that the parties agreed would apply to a claim for breach of the agreement.while we agree with alpha that a claim shares much in common with a breach of contract claim,see paffhausen balano,me,it does not follow that a clause in the agreement must therefore apply to any issues arising under the claim.for example,even if parties have two actual contracts,only one of which has a clause concerning its enforcement,there is no reason simply to assume that the clause also applies to the second contract.instead,we would likely infer that the parties left out such a clause in the second contract because they did not want it.here,similarly,given the fact that the parties did not agree to a broad clause covering all dealings they might have,it makes sense to infer just the opposite of what alpha would have us infer.
second,alpha also points to decisions that apply contractual provisions to claims that are related to a contract brought by one party to the contract against the other.see ne.data,mcdonnell douglas computer,cir w hen parties agree that contract related claims will be tried under,say,the law of california,they do not mean that a claim of serious or breach of contract will be tried under massachusetts general laws chapter.stonyfield farm,agro farma,cv,wl at,applying contractual provision to tort claims predicated on breach of contract.it is precisely this argument that tipped the balance albeit with some hesitation for the able district court judge.dinan alpha networks,d.if dinan claim called for enforcing obligations arising from the terms of the agreement even using theories,this argument would get to first base.here,though,the obligation being enforced would have existed even had there never been a contract.in other words,while the concept of liability is certainly related to the concept of liability for breach of contract,the specific implied agreement found to exist here does not rest on the agreement between the parties that is the sole subject of the clause.it is,in short,not a breach of the agreement plus claim it is an even though no breach of the agreement claim.
having thus rejected the argument that the agreement resolves the issue,we must look elsewhere to determine what law applies to enforcing the,implied obligation upon which the jury rested its verdict.maine law provides no certain answer.while we might therefore certify the question to maine law court pursuant to maine revised statutes title,section,neither party so requests,the case has already once taken such a detour to resolve a question of state law and our analysis,described below,leaves us sufficiently confident that our own answer accurately predicts how the law court would resolve this question.
to determine what state law applies to enforcing the,dinan points to section of the restatement second of conflict of laws,which states 
the validity of a contract for the rendition of services and the rights created thereby are determined,in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties,by the local law of the state where the contract requires that the services,or a major portion of the services,be rendered,unless,with respect to the particular issue,some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in to the transaction and the parties,in which the event the local law of the other state will be applied.
comment b to section explains further that 
the importance in the process of the place where the services,or a major portion of the services,are to be rendered enjoys greatest significance when the work is to be more or less stationary and is to extend over a considerable period of time.this is true of a contract for employment on the ordinary labor force of a particular factory.by way of contrast,the place where the services are to be rendered is of lesser importance when the services are to be of relatively brief duration,such as when a workman is employed to do a minor repair job in a given state,or when the employee duties will require him to travel with fair frequency between two or more states.
maine has not expressly adopted section,but there is no reason to think it would not look to section in the absence of any maine precedent to the contrary.see schroeder rynel,me collecting past maine decisions favoring the use of the restatement to resolve choice of law disputes.
alpha does not directly respond to dinan reliance on section.indeed,it does not even mention section in its brief.it does argue in a footnote,however,that although dinan made his calls from his home in maine,alpha performed its obligations from california.section,though,looks primarily to where the party rendering services renders those services,not to where the party paying for the services operates.
we recognize that section applies to contracts,making no mention of.however,maine law pursuant to which we undertake this inquiry,see,butler balolia,cir recognizes that claims involve recovery for services or materials provided under an implied contract.paffhausen balano,me.while a involves no actual agreement,the parties here bear the same relationships to maine and california,and have behaved toward each other,for the most part,as they would have if they had a contract governing payment of commissions for and.nor is there any other section of the restatement more applicable to a claim than section.in short,the logic underlying section supports the application of the same principles to clams.
we have also reviewed the record as a whole,noting that di
