john hancock financial services,and john hancock life insurance company collectively,hancock appeal from the decision of the united states court of federal claims denying a claim for a tax refund.hancock invoked the tax benefit rule in an effort to obtain,for certain years,tax benefits that it was unable to use in earlier years.in a thorough opinion,the trial judge held that the tax benefit rule did not apply in the context of this case.john hancock fin,united states.we agree that the tax benefit rule is inapplicable in this case,and we therefore affirm.
stock life insurance companies are owned by shareholders,who receive shareholder dividends based on company earnings.stock companies also make payments known as policyholder dividends to their policyholders.policyholder dividends are price rebates that the company can deduct from its taxable earnings.shareholder dividends,on the other hand,constitute a disbursement of the company earnings and may not be deducted.
unlike stock companies,mutual life insurance companies are owned by their policyholders.they pay policyholder dividends to their policyholders,but because mutual companies have no separate group of shareholders,the policyholder dividends do not distinguish between price rebates and distributions of earnings.if mutual companies were allowed to deduct the entire amount of their policyholder dividends,they would have a potential tax advantage over stock companies because they would be allowed to deduct the component of their policyholder dividends constituting distributions of earnings,which for stock companies would be.
in the early congress sought to solve the problem of the differing tax treatment of stock and mutual companies by enacting legislation that permitted mutual companies to deduct only a portion of their policyholder dividends.deficit reduction act of,pub,stat,codified at supp.ii.the statute created a complex formula for calculating the portion of the policyholder dividends that a mutual company could deduct.that statute was in effect during all of the transactions at issue in this case,although it has recently been repealed.pension funding equity act of,pub,stat.
the statutory scheme for calculating the deduction for mutual companies in the affected years works as follows first,the current stock earnings rate is calculated.the current stock earnings rate is derived by averaging the earnings rates of major domestic stock life insurance companies for the previous three years.the current stock earnings rate is calculated after payment of the policyholder dividends but before payment of the shareholder dividends.next,the average mutual earnings rate is calculated.the average mutual earnings rate is based on the aggregate gain or loss from operations for all domestic mutual life insurance companies divided by their aggregate equity bases for a particular year.that rate is determined after the payment of policyholder dividends.
the statute next provides for the calculation of an imputed earnings rate.that rate is set by statute at percent in the case of taxable years beginning in.for later years,it is the amount that bears the same ratio to percent as the current stock earnings rate bears to the base period stock earnings rate,the average of the stock earnings rates calculated for calendar years,and.because the average of the stock earnings rates for through was percent,the imputed earnings rate is always equal to percent of the current stock earnings rate.
the next step is to determine an initial differential earnings rate,or der,which is the excess of the imputed earnings rate for the taxable year over the average mutual earnings rate for the second calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the taxable year begins.in the event that the average mutual earnings rate exceeds the imputed earnings rate,the der is treated as zero.see cuna mut.life ins.united states.
the initial der is then multiplied by the equity of the particular mutual company taxpayer.the resulting amount is subtracted from the deduction the mutual company is allowed to take based on its policyholder dividends.
once the actual earnings rate of the mutual companies is known,which usually happens in the following year,a recomputed der is calculated.this recomputed der is then compared to the initial der and the mutual companies are required to adjust their earnings for the subsequent year based on the relationship between the two amounts.if the recomputed der is greater than the initial der,the mutual companies are required to make an upward adjustment in their income for the subsequent year.if the recomputed der is less than the initial der,the mutual companies are permitted to reduce their income for the subsequent year by a corresponding amount.thus,the recomputed der ultimately determines the amount by which the policyholder deduction is reduced for a given year.
in,the actual average mutual earnings rate exceeded the imputed earnings rate,due in part to the fact that the imputed earnings rate is calculated based on a average of the stock earnings rate while the average mutual earnings rate is based on the average mutual earnings for a single year.several mutual companies sought to increase the amount of their policyholder deductions for taxable year based on the excess of the average mutual earnings rate over the imputed earnings rate.the courts,including this court,unanimously rejected that effort.the courts ruled that the statute did not permit mutual companies to take a policyholder dividend deduction greater than the amount of the policyholder dividends they actually paid,even if the average mutual earnings rate was greater than the imputed earnings rate in a particular year.thus,the courts declined the mutual companies invitation to construe the statute as recognizing a negative excess of the imputed earnings rate over the average mutual earnings rate that would generate an increase,rather than a reduction,in the policyholder dividend deduction.cuna,at indianapolis life ins.united states,cir am.mut.life ins.united states,cir.
following the court decisions rejecting the mutual companies negative excess argument,hancock conceded its claim.however,it then filed refund claims for and.in those claims,hancock asserted that,based on the excess of the actual average mutual earnings rate over the imputed earnings rate for the recomputed der,it should be permitted a corresponding decrease in the amount of the reduction in its policyholder dividend deduction required by section in and.hancock theory was that because it had been denied the use of the negative recomputed der for in its tax calculations,it had a deduction for that generated no tax benefit in that year.accordingly,hancock claimed,the tax benefit rule gave it the right to take advantage of that deduction in and,when the recomputed der was calculated for and.hancock did not seek to reduce its income based on the recomputed der for,because the actual mutual earnings rate again exceeded the imputed earnings rate for that year.
after the internal revenue service denied hancock refund claim,hancock filed this action in the court of federal claims.hancock again contended that even though the policyholder deduction for could not be increased based on the negative excess of the recomputed der,the company should nonetheless be permitted to obtain a tax benefit in the later years based on that negative excess.the court of federal claims rejected that argument,and hancock appealed.
the federal income tax system relies on a system of annual accounting in which income is segregated into units of one year in length.while annual accounting is convenient,it does not necessarily recognize transactions that remain open at the end of a year or that are reopened in a subsequent year.the tax benefit rule is a judicially created doctrine that has its roots in a statutory provision and is designed to approximate the results produced by a tax system based on transactional rather than annual accounting.hillsboro bank comm r,d.
