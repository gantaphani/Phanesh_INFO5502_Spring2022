we treat this interlocutory appeal from an order certifying a class in a securities fraud case as a companion case to in re polymedica.sec,cir,also decided this day.our determination in polymedica of the standard of efficiency to be used in the application of the theory informs the analysis in this case.xcelera,an internet holding company,and its directors,alexander and gustav vik collectively,defendants,argue that the district court erred in determining that the market for xcelera stock was efficient during the relevant time period,and certifying the class on that basis.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
alex stuebler,jim hicks,jack ladue,glover powell,and doug horan plaintiffs are purchasers of xcelera stock,who seek to represent a class of all purchasers of xcelera stock from april,through august,the class period according to plaintiffs,defendants issued a press release on april,stating that xcelera had acquired a majority interest in mirror image internet,mirror image,an internet holding company.more press releases and television appearances followed throughout the class period,touting xcelera ownership of mirror image.defendants allegedly did not disclose,however,that this acquisition was part of a joint venture with two other companies,kahnberget holding,and jam investments,collectively,jam,both of which had contributed a substantial portion of the funds used to acquire the majority interest,million,and which were therefore entitled to a significant portion of the mirror image stock pursuant to their agreement.defendants also allegedly did not disclose the risk of dilution to xcelera shareholders should defendants decide to issue xcelera stock in satisfaction of its obligation to jam.
plaintiffs contend that it was not until august,xcelera issued its annual report for that xcelera shareholders first learned that xcelera might be required to issue new shares of its stock to certain third parties in order to pay for its investment in mirror image,and that this may,in turn,result in a material dilution of xcelera stock.that same day,the price of xcelera stock fell by,from to per share.several days later,after a brief rise in stock price on august,the price of xcelera stock fell again,this time by approximately,from on august,to on august.
on april,plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint,alleging that defendants artificially inflated the price of xcelera stock during the class period by failing to disclose the ownership dispute surrounding the mirror image stock and the risk of dilution of xcelera stock.the complaint further alleged that alexander and gustav vik made insider sales of over million shares of xcelera stock to the unknowing public during the class period,reaping proceeds of over million.plaintiffs seek damages against defendants under b of the securities and exchange act of,b the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder,and against alexander and gustav vik under a and of the exchange act,a.
on november,plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of the class and the insider trading subclass pursuant to.a and b in order to satisfy rule b requirement that common questions of law and fact predominate over individual questions,plaintiffs relied upon the presumption of reliance.defendants opposed the motion,arguing that plaintiffs were not entitled to a presumption of reliance because the market was not efficient a prerequisite for presuming reliance.in support of this position,defendants submitted the affidavit of matthew richardson,a professor of finance at new york university and a research associate of the national bureau of economic research.he concluded that the market for xcelera stock was not efficient during the class period.plaintiffs responded by submitting the affidavit of scott hakala,director of cbiz valuation group,a national business and valuation firm,who came to the opposite conclusion.
at defendants request,the district court conducted a evidentiary hearing on november and.both parties presented oral argument,and each expert gave testimony concerning the meaning of market efficiency and whether the market for xcelera stock was efficient.defendants argued that the market for a particular stock is efficient if it rapidly and accurately reflects all material,publicly available information,and that xcelera market did not meet these standards.plaintiffs,on the other hand,argued that while efficiency requires that market price reflect all material,publicly available information relatively rapidly or within a reasonable period of time,the market price need not reflect such information accurately.according to plaintiffs,the standard of market efficiency that they advocate is satisfied by application of the factors set forth in cammer bloom,which weigh in favor of a finding of efficiency in the xcelera market.
on september,the district court issued its decision certifying both the class and the insider trading subclass the court credited plaintiffs expert analysis which largely tracked the cammer factors,and rejected defendants expert analysis as focusing too much on whether market price perfectly and correctly incorporate d as opposed to merely available information.
on february,we granted defendants petition for permission to appeal the district court order pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure defendants argue that the district court erred in adopting a definition of market efficiency which did not require that market price rapidly and accurately reflect all publicly available information.defendants further argue that the district court erred in applying only the cammer factors to determine market efficiency.
as we stated in polymedica,
t he formulation of the proper standard for efficiency is a purely legal question reviewed de novo.reviewing the application of that standard to the facts of a case involves the review of a mixed question of law and fact.given the various factors relevant to an efficiency determination,and the abundant evidence that can be developed with respect to each factor,the determination of whether a market is efficient is a inquiry.therefore,deferential review applies to that determination.the ultimate decision to certify a class is,of course,a discretionary one.
at internal citation omitted.
in a securities fraud action under b of the exchange act,and rule promulgated thereunder,plaintiffs are typically required to prove that they individually relied on a defendant misrepresentation.id.requiring proof of individualized reliance,of course,would effectively preclude securities fraud class actions under rule b.individual issues of reliance would necessarily overwhelm the common ones.the theory eliminates the need to prove individualized reliance by allowing a rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff relied on the integrity of the market price which reflected the misrepresentation.before an investor can be presumed to have relied upon the integrity of the market price,however,the market must be efficient.id.in an efficient market,the defendant misrepresentations are absorbed into,and reflected by,the market price.investors who rely on the market price,therefore,indirectly rely on those misrepresentations,thereby justifying a presumption of reliance under the theory.conversely,when a market lacks efficiency,there is no assurance that market price reflects the defendant misrepresentations and that investors therefore indirectly relied on those misrepresentations.
standard of market efficiency 
market efficiency under polymedica 
in polymedica,we held that an efficient market is one in which the market price of the stock fully reflects all publicly available information.id.this definition focuses on whether a market is efficient in the informational sense,that is,whether market prices respond rapidly to new information,such that prices impound all publicly available information and misinformation,thereby justifying a presumption of reliance under the theory.
the district court standard of efficiency 
according to the district court,an efficient market is one in which market price reflect s publicly available information.in re sec,at,unpublished opinion.this definition of market efficiency does not provide explicitly that market price must fully reflect all available information,the standard set forth in polymedica.however,the district court reliance upon cammer to determine whether the xcelera market was efficient means that it necessarily applied the standard of efficiency used in cammer,which tracks the definition we adopted in polymedica.see cammer.at stating that an efficient market is one in which current price reflects all available information,and citing economic commentator eugene fama definition of market efficiency as a market in which prices always fully reflect available information.
still,defendants argue that the district court definition of an efficient market is incomplete.missing from the court definition,defendants assert,is a requirement that in an efficient market,stock prices rapidly and accurately reflect all publicly available information.emphasis added.because of these omissions,defendants argue,the district court wrongfully concluded that xcelera market was efficient.
while we agree with defendants that an efficient market must rapidly reflect all publicly available information,and so stated in polymedica,that characteristic is implicit in the requirement that a market fully reflect all publicly available information.see polymedica.at stating that market price fully reflects all publicly available information when prices respond so quickly to new information that it is impossible for traders to make trading profits on the basis of that information internal quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,where,as here,the district court correctly determined that market price must fully reflect all publicly available information for purposes of defining market efficiency,the district court understood that market price must rapidly reflect such information in an efficient market.moreover,the district court reliance upon cammer,which emphasized the importance of an efficient market rapidly reflect ing new information in price.at,again indicates that the district court understood that an efficient market rapidly absorbs and reflects new information.
accurately 
defendants argue that an efficient market must also respond to information accurately.according to their expert witness,richardson,an efficient market accurately reflects all publicly available information when investors are rational and fac e no trading frictions such that stock prices equal their fundamental value.accuracy,richardson argues,thus hinges upon a stock price consistency with its fundamental value,which,in turn,hinges upon the market behaving rationally.
elaborating further,richardson explains that fundamental value is the discounted sum of expected future cash profits of the stock.in an efficient market,richardson states,information should tell you something about the expected cash flow of the asset or the risk of that asset,and that information should get incorporated into that price.richardson argues that fundamental,or true,value does not,however,mean ultimate future value,such that investors must be fortune tellers.rather,it means a fair price that incorporates all the information currently available to investors,such that price adjustments are accurate on average the prices should neither underreact nor overreact to particular news announcements.
but investors are not always rational,richardson contends the presence of irrational investors in the market causes prices to diverg e from fundamentals.the decisions of these irrational investors,richardson argues,begin to move prices away from their fundamental value away from expected risks and returns meaning they not reflecting the information in a rational way.richardson acknowledges,however,that the presence of these irrational investors is not enough per se to refute the hypothesis that the market is efficient.on the contrary,prices will eventually adjust until the mispricings disappear,so long as there are a sufficient number of rational investors active in the market,and provided that these rational investors are not limited in their ability to take advantage of,or arbitrage,these mispricings by purchas ing the underpriced securities,relative to fundamental value and sell ing the overpriced ones to the irrational investors.thus,in order for prices to not accurately reflect fundamental information,richardson contends,there must be a reason why asset prices diverged from fundamentals,the presence of irrational investors and there must be some limits to arbitrage that prevent rational capital from forcing prices and fundamental value to converge.
not surprisingly,plaintiffs insist that accuracy should be excluded from the definition of efficiency.according to hakala,their expert,a market is efficient when all relevant and publicly available information is impounded in share price.by requiring that market price accurately reflect public information,hakala argues that defendants are advocating a higher standard of market efficiency imposed by academics,which demands that markets must behave rationally so that stock prices will always conform to some idealized fundamental value that is demonstrated in retrospect.hakala contends that market efficiency demands only that market price reflects all public information so that an average investor wo ordinarily be able to beat the market it does say anything about whether the market was right or wrong in retrospect according to hakala,richardson analysis confuses market efficiency with a level of or perfect foresight on the part of market participants that is unrealistic and not required for a presumption of.this analysis,hakala contends,amounts to the market,concluding that the market,in retrospect was.
in response to arguments raised by the parties in polymedica,we have already resolved this debate in favor of plaintiffs.as we explained in polymedica,the presumption of reliance does not depend on the accuracy of the market price,and whether it mirror s the best possible estimates,in light of all available information,of the actual economic values of securities in terms of their expected risks and returns.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.rather,this presumption depends on whether the market price of the stock reflects all available information,such that an investor can be deemed to have indirectly relied on the misrepresentation.whether the stock was worth more or less in some fundamental value sense,while arguably relevant to the efficiency inquiry,is not essential to it.
as we stated in polymedica,w hile fundamental value efficiency may be the more comprehensive of the two concepts,encompassing both speed and accuracy,e fficiency is not an phenomenon.id.emphasis in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we explained that for purposes of establishing the presumption of reliance,therefore,investors need only show that the market was informationally efficient,not fundamental value efficient.see also id.stating that the theory does not require proof that the market correctly reflects some fundamental value of the security.to apply the theory,it is sufficient that the market for a security be efficient only in the sense that market prices reflect the available information about the security quoting in re verifone sec.at.
defendants do not,and can not,cite to any language in basic requiring that the market price of a stock must accurately reflect its fundamental value for purposes of demonstrating market efficiency.in fact,as we noted in polymedica,the supreme court in basic declined to explicitly address the meaning of market less a fundamental value theory of market that,w e do not intend conclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.id.quoting basic,at.
defendants contend that the district court,abetted by plaintiffs expert,misconstrued accuracy to mean that the xcelera market must correctly predict what the fundamental value of the security,the discounted sum of expected future cash profits of the stock will be in the future.on the contrary,defendants argue,accuracy means only that a stock price will reflect its fundamental value at any given moment.this is a disingenuous argument.like any lawsuit,the securities fraud action involves the recreation of past events through proof.proof of fundamental value at any given moment would necessarily be a retrospective analysis which,in the words of hakala,amounts to the market,concluding that the market,in retrospect was.if this retrospective judgment was that the stock price at a given moment was,that judgment would be tantamount to the conclusion that the stock price was a poor predictor of what subsequent analysis would reveal about fundamental value at that given moment.
we find no error in the district court determination that,pursuant to defendants definition of market efficiency,a robust stock market would always present a defense at the class certification stage and on the merits that depends on highly subjective,retrospective analysis of what people trading in a stock should have been thinking.the court reference to retrospective analysis is not incorrect.the analysis of the fundamental value of xcelera assets by defendants expert during the class period is necessarily retrospective.in addition,we find no error in the court rejection of defendants expert suggest ion that market efficiency is a rare phenomenon.defendants expert conceded that t he internet sector as a whole,at least the sample firms,was inefficient in aggregate,and relied on an economic treatise whose author concluded that financial markets in most scenarios are not expected to be efficient.market efficiency only emerges as an extreme special case,unlikely to hold under plausible circumstances.citing andrei shleifer,inefficient markets an introduction to behavioral finance.this emphasis on the rarity of efficient markets,grounded in the concept of fundamental value efficiency,would have the likely effect of making it unduly difficult to establish the presumption of reliance.
the district court was right to worry about these implications of defendants efficiency arguments it did not err by rejecting defendants proposed definition of market efficiency requiring consistency with fundamental value.by drawing on the standard of efficiency in cammer and holding that a share market price must reflect publicly available information,not perfectly and correctly incorporate it,the district court adopted the correct standard of efficiency.we must now decide whether the court correctly applied this standard in determining that the xcelera market was efficient.
level of inquiry 
in evaluating whether the xcelera market was efficient,the district court considered the persuasive and widely followed factors enumerated in cammer.xcelera,at.these factors are the stock average trading volume the number of securities analysts that followed and reported on the stock the presence of market makers and arbitrageurs the company eligibility to file a form registration statement and a relationship,over time,between unexpected corporate events or financial releases and an immediate response in stock price.cammer.at.these factors provide useful evidence from which market efficiency may be inferred,and are therefore relevant to a district court determination of whether a market is efficient.as we noted in polymedica,however,these factors are not exhaustive.at citing unger,at,noting that cammer factors are not exhaustive,and are an analytical tool,not a checklist.
crediting plaintiffs expert analysis,the district court concluded,without further discussion of the factors,that the stock trading volume was high xcelera received the attention of the press and analysts as well as the participation of sophisticated investors there were no undue limits to arbitrage,and that the stock price did respond to information.xcelera,wl at.plaintiffs argue that the district court correctly determined that these factors were satisfied and that the xcelera market was therefore efficient.defendants contend that the district court concise analysis of market efficiency is inconsistent with the searching inquiry demanded by rule.
we disagree.as plaintiffs point out,the district court received and reviewed hundreds of pages of briefing and exhibits focused on the issue of market efficiency,received multiple affidavits from experts on both sides and heard two days of testimony from those experts and arguments from counsel regarding market efficiency.in holding that xcelera market was efficient,the court specifically credited the testimony of plaintiffs expert over that of defendants expert,noting xcelera satisfaction of the cammer factors and rejecting defendants evidence that market price did not perfectly and correctly incorporate publicly available information.this is not a case where the district court simply presumed the facts in favor of an efficient market based on bare allegations raised in the plaintiff complaint.unger,at.
here,the district court properly engaged in a analysis that went well beyond the pleadings,weighing the competing evidence concerning market efficiency and offering a succinct explanation of its determination that the presumption should apply to this class action.polymedica,wl quoting waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir.the district court was not required to explain itself in greater detail.the more important issue is whether the evidence supports its determination to apply the presumption.
b.the cammer factors 
relationship 
starting with the fifth,and in many ways,the most important,cammer factor,plaintiffs contend that the district court correctly found a historical relationship between company disclosures and an immediate response in stock price.this relationship is,of course,the essence of an efficient market and the foundation for the fraud on the market theory.cammer.at.in the absence of such a relationship,there is little assurance that information is being absorbed into the market and reflected in its price.to demonstrate the existence of a relationship between corporate information and stock price,plaintiffs expert presented the results of a sophisticated event study analyzing how xcelera stock price reacted to events plaintiffs study lists more than forty separate instances,of which occurred during the class period,in which xcelera stock price rose or fell in several cases,by more than,and in one case,rose by more than within one day of the release of information.
for instance,on april,xcelera stock price increased following an announcement that xcelera had purchased a majority interest in mirror image that day on december,following the announcement of million investment in xcelera that day,xcelera stock increased a glowing report in the gilder technology report on february,caused xcelera stock price to increase on that day and on july,the day lazard freres released a negative analyst report on xcelera,the stock price dropped.conversely,plaintiffs expert also found that of old information,such as secondary announcements about acquisitions or new investments,resulted in only a modest stock price reaction or no reaction at all.based on these findings,plaintiffs expert concluded that the xcelera market reacted positively and new information concerning the company including,but not limited to,disclosures at issue in this case.
defendants argue that plaintiffs reliance upon various news events to demonstrate this relationship was an exercise in logic.in support of this argument,defendants cite to the fifth circuit decision in unger,in which the court concluded that such reasoning,without supporting expert statistical analysis,failed to take into account the many other factors that could affect stock price.at.in that case,however,the plaintiffs offered only sketchy evidence of a relationship,including affidavits,and unexplained internet printouts,and provided no expert statistical evidence whatsoever.id.at.
plaintiffs argue that in this case,by contrast,plaintiffs expert submitted an event study which sought to identify all or nearly all of the news and information pertaining to statistically significant or not in the form of published articles,press releases,reports,news bulletins and financial filings of xcelera,for the proposed class period.as noted above,in addition to this information,plaintiffs event study included a determination of how xcelera stock price reacted to and information,the kind of information the court found lacking in unger.id.at stating that statistical evidence touching on the daily market average national,local and economic news and competitors activities may be helpful to determination of efficiency.plaintiffs expert also supported his event study with two affidavits,and provided testimony at a hearing devoted,in part,to the findings of the event study.
the stock average trading volume 
plaintiffs presented evidence that the average weekly trading volume for xcelera stock,that is,the number of outstanding shares being traded on a weekly basis,was high.a high average weekly trading volume suggests market efficiency since it implies significant investor interest in the company and a likelihood that many investors are executing trades on the basis of newly available or disseminated corporate information.cammer.at.plaintiffs demonstrated that the average daily trading volume for xcelera stock exceeded shares per day throughout the class period.put another way,the average daily trading volume represented more than of approximately million total outstanding above the or figures suggested by several courts as the benchmark for supporting a presumption of efficiency.see,appel,cammer.at.
defendants argue that plaintiffs overstate the trading volume of xcelera shares by using shares as opposed to the smaller number of actual unadjusted shares.for instance,defendants object to plaintiffs calculation of the daily trading volume for august,using the shares traded that day,instead of the only unadjusted shares traded that day.yet defendants do not cite any authority for the proposition that plaintiffs may not adjust for stock splits in order to derive a uniform trading volume for the class period.
number of securities analysts 
both parties agree that the greater the number of securities analysts following and reporting on a company stock,the greater the likelihood that information released by a company is being relied upon by investors.as the court in cammer noted,the existence of a significant number of analysts implies that company reports are closely reviewed by investment professionals,who would in turn make recommendations to client investors.at.the parties also agree that only one analyst followed xcelera stock and issued only one report during the class fewer than the fifteen research reports on the company at issue in cammer,whose market was found to be efficient,id.at.
defendants argue that one analyst is not enough,see,at stating that m ajor corporations are closely followed by hundreds of securities analysts throughout the country,and that the news coverage relied upon by plaintiffs was more journalistic commentary than the kind of analysis that would help investors understand the published information about the company and invest on that basis.in addition,defendants argue that the xcelera market lacked the presence of sophisticated institutional investors who search out,distill,trade on,and disseminate information affecting an issuer and who are thus vital to an efficient market.see lehocky,at crediting plaintiff expert assertion that there is a general understanding that a high level of institutional interest in a security serves to increase the efficiency of the market.
notwithstanding the presence of only one securities analyst,plaintiffs contend that information about xcelera was widely distributed through news articles,press releases,television interviews and the company sec filings,and indirect coverage from numerous influential brokerage firms reporting on other internet and technology stocks.this media attention,plaintiffs argue,more than made up for the lack of securities analysts.see cheney cyberguard,stating that significant number of news items featuring defendant company indicat ed that information regarding the company may have been widely distributed,which would support a finding of efficiency.in addition,in response to defendants charge that the xcelera market lacked institutional investors,plaintiffs point to the fact that two major packard and exodus significant investments in xcelera,and that for the last six months of the class period,at least thirty other institutional investors also invested in xcelera.
number of and arbitrageurs 
a is o ne who helps establish a market for securities by reporting quotations the price a buyer will pay for a security and the price a seller will sell a security,black law dictionary ed,and who stand s ready to buy or sell at these publicly quoted prices,lehocky,at.according to plaintiffs expert,a,more particularly,is a brokerage firm or special securities firm that actively buys and sells stocks on its own account with the intention of holding them for a relatively short period of time so as to make a market.
while the court in cammer found that and arbitrageurs contribute to market efficiency by react ing swiftly to company news and reported financial results by buying or selling stock and driving it to a changed price level.at,defendants argue that the mere existence of,without more,is not meaningful.see,at stating that it is impossible to accord much significance to the number of market makers,until one knows the volume of shares that they committed to trade,the volume of shares they actually traded,and the prices at which they did so see also id.noting that the economic literature has criticized reliance upon the number of marker makers as an indicator of efficiency,and citing study which found no empirical correlation between the number of market makers and the efficiency of the market.defendants contend that plaintiffs evidence establishes only the presence of in the xcelera market,not whether they in fact contributed to market efficiency by buying or selling xcelera stock and driving it to a price reflective of all information bearing on value.
plaintiffs contend that more than twenty participated in the market for xcelera stock,with seven trading over one million shares each in the final quarter of the class period.they say that this evidence demonstrates not only that there was a sufficient number of present to facilitate trading,see,cheney,holding that presence of between fifteen and nineteen weighed in favor of finding of market efficiency citing cammer.at finding that presence of eleven weighed in favor of efficiency,but also that these were in fact conducting trades in significant volume 
c.the district court determination 
although defendants insist that the evidence we have summarized here did not support the district court finding of an efficient market on the basis of the cammer factors,we disagree.as we have already noted,the determination of whether a market is efficient is a inquiry.therefore,deferential review applies to that determination.the district court was entitled to resolve the evidentiary conflicts in favor of plaintiffs.there was no clear error in the district court evaluation of the evidence under cammer.
anticipating the obstacles posed by review,defendants attempt to inject into the analysis an argument that is more akin to a claim of legal error.defendants argue that even if the cammer factors were met,the district court should have concluded that xcelera market was inefficient based on other factors rejected by the court.according to defendants,the district court erroneously applied the cammer factors in isolation,rather than viewing them as part of a broader analysis of the structure of the xcelera market.t he ultimate question of market efficiency,defendants argue,is structural,and the cammer factors are only partial indicators of market structure.in order to determine whether the xcelera market was efficient,defendants argue that the district court should have analyzed whether xcelera market behaved rationally.
defendants contend that xcelera market was dominated by irrational investors not basing their decisions on analysis of the fundamental value of the stock in light of all currently available information.defendants further contend that con
