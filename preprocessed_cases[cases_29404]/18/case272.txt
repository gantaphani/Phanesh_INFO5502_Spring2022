this appeal raises two questions under section b of the securities and exchange act of,b,which provides for disgorgement of profits earned by an insider who buys and sells the issuer equity securities within six months.the questions concern the applicability of section b to i a hybrid transaction involving a fixed and floating price component and ii a purchase of a company holding warrants in the issuer within six months of the granting of a put.the transaction that gives rise to these questions took place when american telephone telegraph at t,as holder of a large block of shares in at home,granted a put to two communications and comcast online holdings in at home were an impediment to at t exercise of effective control over that company.the exercise price was the greater of or the trading average of at home shares for the days before and days after exercise of the put the maximum number of shares was the number that could be bought at the exercise price for a specified enormous dollar amount.within six months of the granting of the put,comcast purchased three cable systems that held warrants for at home stock among other considerable assets.
in count one of the complaint,at home as plaintiff seeks disgorgement on the theory that a section b sale occurred at exercise for these put options.the district court dismissed this claim,identifying the grant of the hybrid option as the relevant section b event,at home cox.commc ns,d,and we agree.in count two,at home seeks disgorgement on the theory that an acquisition of a company should be treated as a section b purchase when the acquisition target owned warrants to purchase stock of the issuer.the district court declined to match shares of different issuers to impose section b liability.id.at.although we disagree with the district court reasoning with respect to this count,we conclude that in the context of this case there was no matching sale and purchase.we therefore affirm.
background 
because the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,all facts are construed in at home favor.chambers time warner,cir.
at home corporation at home was a provider of always on internet to home users.cox and comcast,which allegedly acted together as a group,see d,collectively owned more than percent of at home outstanding common stock.by june,at t owned percent of at home common stock.although at t held the largest block of at home stock,cox and comcast together could prevent at t from unilaterally controlling at home board of directors.
to consolidate its control of at home,at t granted put options to cox and comcast a letter agreement entered march,letter agreement set out the options terms 
at t grants to each of cox and comcast the right to put to at t exercisable at any time from january,through june,up to an aggregate number of shares of at home stock equal to the maximum number t he maximum number with respect to cox will be a number of shares having an aggregate purchase price under the put equal to and the maximum number with respect to comcast will be a number of shares having an aggregate purchase price under the put equal to 
the per share purchase price under the put will be the greater of and the average per share trading price of the shares on the nasdaq during the consecutive trading day period beginning trading days immediately prior to and ending trading days immediately following at t receipt of the notice of exercise of put.
the letter agreement grants a hybrid option,because the pricing formula has both fixed and floating components.the fixed component sets the exercise price at per share if the options are executed while at home is trading below per share if at home shares trade consistently above per share,the exercise price is calculated using the floating price mechanism.in either event,the total sale price is capped by the maximum number billion for cox and billion for comcast.at home contends,erroneously,that the fixed aggregate transaction amount means that there was no real component 
comcast and cox exercised the put options on january.this opened the window during which at home share price would be tracked for comparison to the dollar price in order to determine both the final price and the number of shares to change hands.because at home shares traded well below the per share guaranteed price on january,to on february,the exercise price was calculated at the fixed price.
at home argues that,for the purposes of section b,the sale date was the exercise date january,in which case cox and comcast would each be liable for profits earned on any at home shares purchased between july,and july.cox and comcast argue and the district court agreed that because the letter agreement option was exercised at the fixed price,the date of sale for the purposes of section b was the date that the option was granted.
if the section b sale occurred as of the granting of the letter agreement option,it is undisputed that at home insider trading claim fails as to cox cox purchased no shares of at home in the six months before or after the date on which the option was granted.as to comcast,however,at home asserts in the alternative a theory of liability that treats the grant of the option as a sale,and would match that sale with comcast purchase of three cable systems whose holdings included warrants to purchase at home stock.
between january and august,comcast acquired three cable systems prime communications,jones intercable,and garden state cablevision for approximately billion.the acquired companies allegedly held warrants to purchase million shares of at home stock,and the acquisitions thus had the effect of placing those warrants in comcast hands.at home cox commc,d.at home argues that these acquisitions satisfy the purchase requirement of section b.
discussion 
the district court dismissed both claims pursuant to.b.at home cox.communications,d.in dismissing count one,the district court reasoned that the grant of a hybrid than its the only relevant section b event if the option is eventually exercised pursuant to the mechanism.in dismissing count two,the district court applied the unorthodox transaction rule of kern county land occidental petroleum,d,and determined that in the absence of any showing of manipulative intent,a sale of shares in one company can not be matched for section b purposes with a purchase of shares in another company,regardless of the holdings of either company.
we review de novo.chambers time warner,cir.
section b of the securities exchange act of requires insiders to disgorge profits earned in trading 
for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by an insider by reason of his relationship to the issuer,any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale,or any sale and purchase,of any equity security of such issuer within any period of less than six months shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of such insider in entering into such transaction 
b emphasis added.section b operates mechanically,with no required showing of intent,see steel partners ii,bell,cir,but as applied to complex financial arrangements such as hybrid options,the mechanism has wheels within wheels.when one transaction is a put option,there are two alternative potential dates of sale the acquisition date and the date of execution.
in,the sec promulgated new rules to answer section b questions posed by options.as to options with fixed price components,the sec is of the view that the greatest risk of profiteering arises at the point in time nearest the establishment of the option.see ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal securities holders,exchange act rel,see also,at home cox commc ns,d.the sec amendments to rule a account for that risk by providing that the establishment of a put equivalent position shall be deemed a sale of the underlying securities for purposes of section b of the act.a emphasis added.correspondingly,under rule b,the disposition of underlying securities at a fixed price due to the exercise of a put equivalent position sha
