appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york harold baer,judge,entered on september,dismissing plaintiffs putative securities class action complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.see landmen partners blackstone group,d.we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs complaint because plaintiffs plausibly allege that material information was omitted from,or misstated in,defendants initial public offering registration statement and prospectus in violation of sections and a of the securities act of.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
because this is an appeal from a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,the following facts,which we assume to be true,are drawn from plaintiffs consolidated amended class action complaint as filed on october.see slayton am.express,cir.where relevant,however,we include information from securities and exchange commission sec filings by the blackstone group,blackstone to which plaintiffs refer in their complaint,particularly the form registration statement registration statement and prospectus filed by blackstone in connection with its june,initial public offering ipo.see tellabs,makor issues rights,c ourts must consider the complaint in its entirety,as well as other sources,in particular,documents incorporated into the complaint by reference,and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.see also atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir w e may consider legally required public disclosure documents filed with the sec,and documents possessed by or known to the plaintiff and upon which it relied in bringing the suit.
lead plaintiffs martin litwin,max poulter,and francis brady,appointed by the district court on september,bring this putative securities class action on behalf of themselves and all others who purchased the common units of blackstone at the time of its ipo.plaintiffs seek remedies under sections,a,and of the securities act of securities act,a,for alleged material omissions from,and misstatements in,blackstone registration statement and prospectus defendants are blackstone and blackstone executives stephen schwarzman,michael puglisi,peter peterson,and hamilton james collectively referred to herein as blackstone.
blackstone is a leading global alternative asset manager and provider of financial advisory services and one of the largest independent alternative asset managers in the world,with total assets under management of approximately billion as of may.blackstone is divided into four business segments corporate private equity,which comprises its management of corporate private equity funds real estate,which comprises its management of general real estate funds and internationally focused real estate funds marketable alternative asset management,which comprises its management of hedge funds,mezzanine funds,senior debt vehicles,proprietary hedge funds,and publicly traded mutual funds and financial advisory,which comprises a variety of advisory services.the corporate private equity segment constitutes approximately of blackstone total assets under management billion of billion,and the real estate segment constitutes approximately of blackstone assets under management billion of billion.according to blackstone,b oth the corporate private equity fund and the two real estate opportunity funds taken together are among the largest funds ever raised in their respective sectors.blackstone further represents to prospective investors that its leadership in private equity has imbued the blackstone brand with value that enhances all of its different businesses and facilitates its ability to expand into complementary new businesses.
in preparation for its ipo,blackstone reorganized its corporate structure.prior to the ipo,blackstone business was operated through a large number of separately owned predecessor entities.on march,just prior to the launch of the ipo,blackstone was formed as a delaware limited partnership and eventually became the sole general partner of five newly formed holding partnerships into which the majority of the operating predecessor entities were contributed.blackstone receives a substantial portion of its revenues from two sources a management fee on its total assets under management and performance fees of of the profits generated from the capital it invests on behalf of its limited partners.under certain circumstances,when investments perform poorly,blackstone may be subject to a of already paid performance fees,in other words,the required return of fees which it had already collected.
on march,blackstone filed its form registration statement with the sec for the ipo.blackstone filed several amendments to its registration statement,and the prospectus,which formed part of the registration statement,finally became effective on june.at this time,million common units of blackstone were sold to the public,raising more than billion.the individual defendants and other blackstone insiders received nearly all of the net proceeds from the ipo.
plaintiffs principally allege that,at the time of the ipo,and unbeknownst to purchasers of blackstone common units,two of blackstone portfolio companies as well as its real estate fund investments were experiencing problems.blackstone allegedly knew of,and reasonably expected,these problems to subject it to a of performance fees and reduced performance fees,thereby materially affecting its future revenues.
fgic corporation 
in,a consortium of investors that included blackstone purchased an interest in fgic fgic,a monoline financial guarantor,from general electric for billion.fgic is the parent company of financial guaranty,which primarily provides insurance for bonds.although municipal bond insurance traditionally constituted the majority of financial guaranty business,in the years leading up to blackstone ipo it began writing insurance on collateralized debt obligations cdos including cdos backed by mortgages to borrowers.financial guaranty also began writing insurance on residential securities rmbss linked to and mortgages.this insurance on rmbss and cdos was in the form of credit default swaps cdss 
by the summer of,fgic,as a result of financial guaranty underwriting practices,was exposed to billions of dollars in mortgages,with its total cds exposure close to billion.from through,factors including rising interest rates,the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages,and a substantial slowing of appreciation and in some markets,depreciation caused many borrowers to be unable to refinance their existing loans when they could not meet their payment obligations.as a result,beginning in,there was a significant increase in rates,particularly for mortgage loans.by early,before the ipo,some of the top mortgage lenders with mortgage exposure began revealing large losses and warned of future market losses.all of these symptoms,plaintiffs allege,provided a strong indication that the problems plaguing lenders would generate substantial losses for fgic on the cdss it issued to its counterparties.this likelihood was allegedly exacerbated because,in many instances,fgic were able to demand accelerated payments from fgic even before a default event occurred on the underlying referenced assets.
blackstone equity interest in fgic was worth approximately million at the time of the ipo.plaintiffs allege that,due to this significant interest,blackstone was required to disclose the trends,events,or uncertainties related to fgic business that were reasonably likely to cause blackstone financial information not to be indicative of future operating results.following the ipo,in a march,press release,blackstone announced its and earnings.the company corporate private equity segment reported revenues of million,down from revenues.most significantly,blackstone reduced the value of its portfolio investment in fgic,which accounted for million,or,of the decline in revenues for the year.blackstone reported that its corporate private equity fourth quarter revenues of million were negative,as compared with revenues of million for the fourth quarter of,a change driven primarily by decreases in the value of blackstone portfolio investment in fgic and lower net appreciation of portfolio investments in other sectors as compared with the prior year.
freescale semiconductor,freescale,is a semiconductor designer and manufacturer.in,blackstone invested billion in freescale,the single largest investment by a blackstone corporate private equity fund since.the freescale investment accounted for of the corporate private equity segment assets under management and of blackstone total assets under management 
shortly before the ipo,in march,freescale lost an exclusive agreement to manufacture wireless chipsets for its largest customer,motorola,motorola.the loss of this exclusive agreement followed two years of manufacturing and production problems for freescale.on april,freescale management held an analysts call,on which it stated that revenue s in our wireless business were negatively impacted by a sales decline due to weak demand in our largest customer motorola during the last several weeks of the quarter,our main wireless customer began to reduce their orders.plaintiffs allege that t hese adverse facts had a material adverse effect on freescale business and,concomitantly,the material corporate private equity fund controlled by blackstone.plaintiffs argue that blackstone was required to disclose this material adverse development in its registration statement.
real estate investments 
as noted above,blackstone real estate segment constitutes of its total assets under management.although the parties seem to agree that the majority of blackstone real estate investments were in nature,the registration statement provides that its real estate opportunity funds have made a significant number of investments in lodging,major urban office buildings,residential properties,distribution and warehousing centers and a variety of real estate operating companies.moreover,blackstone concedes that its real estate funds maintained at least one residential real estate investment.there is no indication in the record,however,of the exact dollar amount of blackstone residential real estate investment s,and thus it is not possible to discern the exact percentage of the real estate segment assets under management attributable to residential properties 
as detailed above with respect to fgic,several factors were causing the real estate and mortgage securities markets to deteriorate by the time of the ipo,including the adverse effects of a series of negative developments in the credit markets.thus,plaintiffs allege,it was foreseeable that blackstone would have performance fees clawed back in connection with its real estate investments and that blackstone would not generate additional performance fees on those investments.
in addition to blackstone alleged material omission of information related to the downward trend in the real estate market and its likely impact on blackstone real estate investments,plaintiffs allege that the registration statement included the following affirmative material misstatement 
the real estate industry is also experiencing historically high levels of growth and liquidity driven by the strength of the economy and the availability of financing for acquiring real estate assets the strong investor demand for real estate assets is due to a number of factors,including persistent,reasonable levels of interest rates and the ability of lenders to repackage their loans into securitizations,thereby diversifying and limiting their risk.these factors have combined to significantly increase the capital committed to real estate funds from a variety of institutional investors.
gaap and risk disclosure allegations 
plaintiffs complaint includes additional allegations that are related to,and in many ways overlap with,the allegations detailed above.first,they allege that blackstone unaudited financial statements for the periods ending march,and march,respectively,which were included in the registration statement,violated generally accepted accounting principles gaap and materially overstated the values of blackstone real estate investments and its investment in fgic.plaintiffs also allege that blackstone disclosure of certain risk factors was too general and failed to inform investors adequately of the specific risks related to the real estate and credit markets.
procedural history and district court opinion 
the initial complaint was filed in the district court by landmen partners,on april.on september,the district court appointed martin litwin,max poulter,and francis brady as lead plaintiffs,and on october,the lead plaintiffs filed the operative,consolidated amended class action complaint.blackstone filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on december,and,following oral argument,the district court granted the motion,with prejudice,in an opinion dated september.see landmen partners blackstone group,d.
the district court opinion primarily focused on the materiality of the alleged omissions and misstatements concerning fgic,freescale,and blackstone real estate investments.first,the district court analyzed the relative scale or quantitative materiality of the alleged fgic and freescale omissions.after noting our and the sec acceptance of a threshold as an appropriate starting place or preliminary assumption of immateriality,the district court noted that blackstone million investment in fgic represented a mere of blackstone total assets under management at the time of the ipo.id.at citing eca local ibew joint pension trust jp morgan chase,cir.the district court then addressed plaintiffs argument that the materiality of the omissions is best illustrated by the effect the eventual million drop in value of blackstone fgic investment had on blackstone annual revenues.id.the district court found that while the decline in fgic investment value may have been significant relative to the corporate private equity segment annual revenues,it was quantitatively immaterial as compared with blackstone billion in total revenues for id.
the district court next looked at the quantitative materiality of the freescale omissions,again comparing blackstone investment to its total assets under management.the court stated that the billion investment in freescale represented of the total billion the company had under management at the time of the ipo.id.the district court did not mention that the investment in freescale accounted for of the corporate private equity segment billion of assets under management.the district court found it significant that the complaint did not and likely could not allege that freescale loss of its exclusive supplier relationship with motorola would cause blackstone investment in freescale to lose of its value.id.at.
the district court then pointed to the structure of the blackstone enterprise as further support for the immateriality of the alleged omissions.according to the district court,because the performance of individual portfolio companies only affects blackstone revenues after investment gains or losses are aggregated at the fund level,the poor performance of one investment may be offset by the strong performance of another.id.accordingly,there is no way to make a principled distinction between the negative information that plaintiff s claim was wrongfully omitted from the registration statement and information about every other portfolio company.id.the district court found that requiring disclosure of information about particular portfolio companies or investments would risk obfuscat ing truly material information in a flood of unnecessary detail,a result that the securities laws forbid.id.
next,recognizing that a quantitative analysis is not dispositive of materiality,the district court found that only one of the qualitative factors that we,or the sec,often consider were present in this case.specifically,the court found that none of the omissions concealed unlawful transactions or conduct the alleged omissions did not relate to a significant aspect of blackstone operations there was no significant market reaction to the public disclosure of the alleged omissions the alleged omissions did not hide a failure to meet analysts expectations the alleged omissions did not change a loss into income or vice versa and the alleged omissions did not affect blackstone compliance with loan covenants or other contractual requirements.the district court noted that the one qualitative factor it found present in this the alleged omissions had the effect of increasing blackstone management not enough,by itself,to make the omissions material.id.at.accordingly,the district court held that the alleged omissions concerning fgic and freescale were immaterial as a matter of law.id.at.
the district court then separately analyzed the alleged omissions and misstatements regarding blackstone real estate investments.the district court first noted that the complaint failed to identify a single real estate investment or allege a single fact capable of linking the problems in the subprime residential mortgage market in late and early and the roughly contemporaneous decline in home prices which are by the complaint to blackstone real estate investments,of which were in commercial and hotel properties.id.according to the district court,without further factual enhancement as to how the troubles in the residential mortgage markets could have a foreseeable material effect on blackstone real estate investments,plaintiffs allegations fell short of the plausibility standard set forth in bell atlantic twombly.in addition,the district court found that plaintiffs had failed to allege any facts that,if true,would render false those statements alleged to be affirmative misrepresentations.the district court further found that insofar as plaintiffs alleged that blackstone was required to disclose general market conditions,such omissions are not actionable because sections and a do not require disclosure of publicly available information the omission of generally known conditions is not material because such matters are already part of the total mix of information available to investors.landmen partners,d at.finally,the district court noted that the complaint contained no allegations that blackstone knew that market conditions were reasonably likely to have a material effect on its portfolio of real estate investments,id.at,and stated that generalized allegations that problems brewing in the market at large made it foreseeable that a particular set of unidentified investments would sour are insufficient to nudge the claims across the line from conceivable to plausible,id.at alterations in original quoting twombly,at.the district court opinion concluded with a brief analysis of the gaap allegations.the district court found that because those allegations were largely derivative of plaintiffs other allegations,they were insufficient to state a claim for essentially the same reasons that the primary allegations failed.accordingly,the district court granted blackstone motion to dismiss and dismissed plaintiffs claims with prejudice.judgment was entered in favor of blackstone on september.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal on october.

standard of review 
we review de novo the dismissal of a complaint under rule b,accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.eca local,at.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal.
notably,plaintiffs complaint explicitly does not allege fraud rather,it alleges that blackstone acted negligently in preparing its registration statement and prospectus.see rombach chang,cir fraud is not an element or a requisite to a claim under section or section a a plaintiff need allege no more than negligence to proceed under section and section a.moreover,blackstone does not argue on appeal that plaintiffs claims are premised on allegations of fraud.accordingly,as pleaded,plaintiffs claims are not subject to the heightened pleading standard of federal rule of civil procedure b.see id.holding that rule b heightened pleading standard applies to claims under section and section a only insofar as the claims are premised on allegations of fraud.stated differently,this is an ordinary notice pleading case,subject only to the short and plain statement requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a.
sections and a of the securities act 
section of the securities act imposes liability on issuers and other signatories of a registration statement that,upon becoming effective,contain s an untrue statement of a material fact or omit s to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.a.section a imposes liability under similar circumstances on issuers or sellers of securities by means of a prospectus.see id.a.so long as a plaintiff establishes one of the three bases for liability under these provisions a material misrepresentation a material omission in contravention of an affirmative legal disclosure obligation or a material omission of information that is necessary to prevent existing disclosures from being misleading,see in re morgan stanley info.fund sec,cir then,in a section case,the general rule is that an issuer liability is absolute.in re initial pub.offering sec,cir see also herman maclean huddleston,section was designed to assure compliance with the disclosure provisions of the securities act by imposing a stringent standard of liability on the parties who play a direct role in a registered offering although limited in scope,section places a relatively minimal burden on a plaintiff.footnote omitted.the primary issue before us is the second basis for liability that is,whether blackstone registration statement and prospectus omitted material information that blackstone was legally required to disclose 
required disclosures under item of regulation 
plaintiffs principally contend that item of sec regulation,a ii,provides the basis for blackstone disclosure obligation.pursuant to subsection a ii of item,a registrant must d escribe any known trends or uncertainties that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material unfavorable impact on revenues or income from continuing operations.instruction to paragraph a provides that t he discussion and analysis shall focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition.a instruction.the sec interpretive release regarding item clarifies that the regulation imposes a disclosure duty where a trend,demand,commitment,event or uncertainty is both presently known to management and reasonably likely to have material effects on the registrant financial condition or results of operations.management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,securities act release,exchange act release,investment company act release,sec docket may,hereinafter md a.
although the district court opinion and the parties on appeal primarily focus on the materiality of blackstone alleged omissions,blackstone does urge that plaintiffs complaint fails to adequately allege that blackstone was required by item to disclose trends in the real estate market for the purpose of sections and a.we disagree.plaintiffs allege that the downward trend in the real estate market was already known and existing at the time of the ipo,and that the trend or uncertainty in the market was reasonably likely to have a material impact on blackstone financial condition.therefore,plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a presently existing trend,event,or uncertainty,and the sole remaining issue is whether the effect of the known information was reasonably likely to be material for the purpose of item and,in turn,for the purpose of sections and a.
legal standard of materiality 
materiality is an inherently finding,basic levinson,that is satisfied when a plaintiff alleges a statement or omission that a reasonable investor would have considered significant in making investment decisions,ganino citizens utils,cir citing basic,at t here must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.however,it is not necessary to assert that the investor would have acted differently if an accurate disclosure was made.id.rather,when a district court is presented with a rule b motion,a complaint may not properly be dismissed on the ground that the alleged misstatements or omissions are not material unless they are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance.id.quoting goldman belden,cir see also tsc,northway,noting that even at the summary judgment stage,the determination of materiality requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.
w e have consistently rejected a formulaic approach to assessing the materiality of an alleged misrepresentation.ganino,at see also eca local ibew joint pension trust jp morgan chase,cir while ganino held that numerical tests for materiality are inappropriate,it did not exclude analysis based on,or even emphasis of,quantitative considerations.in both ganino and eca local,we cited with approval sec staff accounting bulletin.hereinafter sab,which provides relevant guidance regarding the proper assessment of materiality.see eca local,at ganino,at.
as the sec stated,
t he use of a percentage as a numerical threshold,such as,may provide the basis for a preliminary assumption that a deviation of less than the specified percentage with respect to a particular item is unlikely to be material but quantifying,in percentage terms,the magnitude of a misstatement can not appropriately be used as a substitute for a full analysis of all relevant considerations.
sab.at see also eca local,at noting that a five percent numerical threshold is a good starting place for assessing materiality emphasis added.accordingly,a court must consider both quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing an item materiality,sab.at,and that consideration should be undertaken in an integrative manner.see ganino,at see also in re kidder peabody sec,d,sab.at qualitative factors may cause misstatements of quantitatively small amounts to be material.
in this case,the district court confronted a rule b motion,a motion for which plaintiffs need only satisfy the basic notice pleading requirements of rule.so long as plaintiffs plausibly allege that blackstone omitted material information that it was required to disclose or made material misstatements in its offering documents,they meet the relatively minimal burden of stating a claim pursuant to sections and a,under which,should plaintiffs claims be substantiated,blackstone liability as an issuer is absolute.where the principal issue is materiality,an inherently finding,the burden on plaintiffs to state a claim is even lower.accordingly,we can not agree with the district court at this preliminary stage of litigation that the alleged omissions and misstatements are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance.ganino,at internal quotation marks omitted.
materiality of omissions related to fgic and freescale 
as to the materiality of the omissions related to fgic and freescale,blackstone first argues that the relevant information was public knowledge,and thus could not be material because it was already part of the total mix of information available to investors.specifically,blackstone contends that,as the complaint itself alleges based on citations to news articles and analysts calls,the shift in fgic strategy toward a less conservative approach to bond insurance and freescale loss of its exclusive contract with motorola were facts publicly known at the time of the ipo.
it is true that,as a general matter,the total mix of information may include information already in the public domain and facts known or reasonably available to potential investors.united paperworkers int l union int l paper,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also garber legg mason,d,holding that defendants had no duty under the securities laws to disclose the publicly reported departure of an asset manager,aff,app x cir summary order.but case law does not support the sweeping proposition that an issuer of securities is never required to disclose publicly available information.see,kapps torch offshore,cir holding that the definition of material under section is not strictly limited to information that is and and noting that the sec requires an issuer to disclose certain trends that could affect its business,and in appropriate circumstances this requirement may extend to certain trends that are not or are publicly available united paperworkers,at stating that the mere presence in the media of sporadic news reports should not be considered to be part of the total mix of information that would clarify or place in proper context the company representations in its proxy materials see also kronfeld trans world airlines,cir there are serious limitations on a corporation ability to charge its stockholders with knowledge of information omitted from a document such as a prospectus on the basis that the information is public knowledge and otherwise available to them,cert.denied.
in this case,the key information that plaintiffs assert should have been disclosed is whether,and to what extent,the particular known trend,event,or uncertainty might have been reasonably expected to materially affect blackstone investments.and this potential future impact was certainly not public knowledge,particularly in the case of fgic,which was not even mentioned in blackstone registration statement and thus can not be considered part of the total mix of information already available to investors.again,the focus of plaintiffs claims is the required disclosures under item are not seeking the disclosure of the mere fact of blackstone investment in fgic,of the downward trend in the real estate market,or of freescale loss of its exclusive contract with motorola.rather,plaintiffs claim that blackstone was required to disclose the manner in which those trends,events,or uncertainties might reasonably be expected to materially impact blackstone future revenues.
while it is true that blackstone investments in fgic and freescale fall below the presumptive threshold of materiality,we find that the district court erred in its analysis of certain qualitative factors related to materiality.first,the district court and blackstone place too much emphasis on blackstone structure and on the fact that a loss in one portfolio company might be offset by a gain in another portfolio company.blackstone is not permitted,in assessing materiality,to aggregate negative and positive effects on its performance fees in order to avoid disclosure of a particular material negative event.sab.at noting in the context of aggregating and netting multiple misstatements that r egistrants and their auditors first should consider whether each misstatement is material,irrespective of its effect when combined with other misstatements.were we to hold otherwise,we would effectively sanction misstatements in a registration statement or prospectus related to particular portfolio companies so long as the net effect on the revenues of a public private equity firm like blackstone was immaterial.the question,of course,is not whether a loss in a particular investment value will merely affect revenues,because even after aggregation of gains and losses at the fund level,it will almost certainly have some effect.the relevant question under item is whether blackstone reasonably expects the impact to be material.we see no principled basis for holding that an historically private equity company that has chosen to go public is somehow subject to a different standard under the securities disclosure laws and regulations than a traditional public company with numerous subsidiaries.see mohsen manesh,legal asymmetry and the end of corporate law,noting that blackstone,as a publicly listed entity,is substantively indistinguishable from its publicly traded corporate counterparts.in a case of pure omissions,to the extent that the securities laws require information to be disclosed and the information in question is material in the eyes of a reasonable investor,blackstone must disclose the information.blackstone structure is no defense on a motion to dismiss 
second,the district court erred in finding that the alleged omissions did not relate to a significant aspect of blackstone operations.in discussing considerations that may well render material a quantitatively small misstatement,sab provides that materiality may turn on where the misstatement appears in the financial statements s ituations may arise where the auditor will conclude that a matter relating to segment information is qualitatively material even though,in his or her judgment,it is quantitatively immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole.sab.at.sab also provides that one factor affecting qualitative materiality is whether the misstatement or omission relates to a segment that plays a significant role in the registrant business.id.in this case,blackstone makes clear in its offering documents that corporate private equity is its flagship segment,playing a significant role in the company history,operations,and value.blackstone states that its corporate private equity fund is among the largest ever raised,and that its leadership in private equity has imbued the blackstone brand with value that enhances all of its different businesses and facilitates its ability to expand into complementary new businesses.because blackstone corporate private equity segment plays such an important role in blackstone business and provides value to all of its other asset management and financial advisory services,a reasonable investor would almost certainly want to know information related to that segment that blackstone reasonably expects will have a material adverse effect on its future revenues.therefore,the alleged misstatements and omissions relating to fgic and freescale were plausibly material.
furthermore,with respect to freescale in particular,blackstone investment in the company accounted for of the corporate private equity segment assets under management,and the investment was nearly three times larger than the next largest investment in that segment as reported in blackstone prospectus.even where a misstatement or omission may be quantitatively small compared to a registrant financial results,its significance to a particularly important segment of a registrant business tends to show its materiality.see in re kidder peabody,d at noting that while amount of false profits may have been minor compared to ge earnings as a whole,they were quite significant to a subsidiary profits,which,in turn,represented a significant portion of ge balance sheet.viewed in that light,we can not hold that the alleged loss of freescale exclusive contract with its largest customer and the concomitant potential negative impact on one of the largest investments in blackstone corporate private equity segment was immaterial.
finally,the district court failed to consider another relevant qualitative the omissions mask a change in earnings or other trends.sab.at.such a possibility is precisely what the required disclosures under item aim to avoid.here,blackstone omitted information related to fgic and freescale that plaintiffs allege was reasonably likely to have a material effect on the revenues of blackstone corporate private equity segment and,in turn,on blackstone as a whole.blackstone failure to disclose that information masked a reasonably likely change in earnings,as well as the trend,event,or uncertainty that was likely to cause such a change.
all of these qualitative factors,together with the district court correct observation that the alleged omissions doubtless had the effect of increasing management compensation,see sab.at,show that the alleged omissions were material.accordingly,we hold that plaintiffs have adequately pleaded that blackstone omitted material information related to fgic and freescale that it was required to disclose under item of regulation.
materiality of omissions and misstatements related to real estate investments 
we also find that the district court erred in its analysis of the alleged omissions and misstatements related to blackstone real estate investments.first,the district court opinion implies that to state a plausible claim,plaintiffs complaint had to identify specific real estate investments made or assets held by blackstone funds that might have been at risk as a result of the trends in the real estate industry.see landmen partners blackstone group,d.this expectation,however,misses the very core of plaintiffs allegations,namely,that blackstone omitted material information that it had a duty to report.in other words,plaintiffs precise,actionable allegation is that blackstone failed to disclose material details of its real estate investments,and specifically that it failed to disclose the manner in which those unidentified,particular investments might be materially affected by the downward trend in housing prices,the increasing default rates for mortgage loans,and the pending problems for complex mortgage securities.that is all item requires in order to trigger a disclosure obligation a known trend that blackstone reasonably expected would materially affect its investments and revenues.plaintiffs allege that they were unaware of,but legally entitled to disclosure of,the very information that the district court held had to be specified in plaintiffs complaint.
moreover,there are two problems with the district court finding that plaintiffs claims fail because they can not establish any link between the declining residential real estate market and blackstone heavy investments in commercial real estate.see id.at.first,the offering documents indicate,and blackstone admits,that blackstone has at least one residential real estate investment,and,drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor,its residential real estate holdings might constitute as much as billion and of the real estate segment assets under management.see supra.this alone is enough on a rule b motion to establish a plausible link between the alleged trend in the residential real estate market and blackstone real estate investments.second,even if the overwhelming majority of blackstone real estate investments are commercial in nature,it is certainly plausible for plaintiffs to allege that a collapse in the residential real estate market,and,more importantly,in the market for complex securitizations of residential mortgages,might reasonably be expected to adversely affect commercial real estate investments.blackstone own disclosures in its registration statement make this link clear,given that it admits that the ability of lenders to repackage their residential loans into securitizations is one factor contributing to the significant increase in the capital committed to predominantly commercial real estate funds.
finally,the district court erred when it stated that plaintiff s fail to allege any facts that if true,would render false the few statements alleged to be affirmative misrepresentations.landmen partners,d at.to the contrary,plaintiffs provide significant factual detail about the general deterioration of the real estate market and specific facts that,drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor,directly contradict statements made by blackstone in its registration statement.first,the chart in plaintiffs complaint illustrating the seasonally adjusted price change in the u.housing market contradicts blackstone representation that the real estate industry was experiencing historically high levels o
