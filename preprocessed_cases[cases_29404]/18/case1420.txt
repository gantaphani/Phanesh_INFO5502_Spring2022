the trial court determined that plaintiff shashikant jogani had no right to a jury trial on his claims for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment,and the court entered an order striking his request for jury trial.jogani petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order.we conclude that the trial court erred because quantum meruit is an action at law and thus carries with it the right to a jury trial we therefore grant the petition.

discussion 
quantum meruit is an action at law,not in equity 
jogani contends that a common count for quantum meruit is a form of the common law action of assumpsit.on that basis,he argues that he has a right to a jury trial on his quantum meruit claim.we agree.

we consequently must determine whether in quantum meruit was an action at law.we conclude that it was.
at early common law,contracts,as we know them,were difficult to enforce in the king or queen courts of england.while contracts under seal were enforced in actions commenced by the writ of covenant and debts were collectible under the writ of debt,damages for breach of informal contracts,contracts not under seal was not an available remedy except in local,merchants and ecclesiastical courts as the demand for the enforcement of such promises in the royal courts arose,a remedy was invented to meet it.this remedy was afforded by the writ of assumpsit.trial was by jury.in the course of time,this writ was applied to the enforcement of promises actually made,whether express or implied in fact from conduct other than words,and also to the enforcement of obligations described as quasi contracts thereafter,for some centuries in our legal history,promises were enforced by the use of the common law writ of assumpsit,this word having the literal meaning he promised.corbin on contracts ed,fn.omitted.assumpsit was available for the collection of debts,whether for reasonable value quantum meruit for services,quantum valebant for goods or for a sum certain.under this writ,it was permissible to use a simplified form of pleading,the common counts,which are still in use in many jurisdictions that have abandoned other elements of common law pleading.id.at,fn.omitted.california has long permitted the pleading of common counts despite their divergence from the norms of code pleading.see,weitzenkorn lesser cal d,quantum valebant pike zadig cal,money had and received.
all of this development in the common law writ of the initial breakthrough allowing enforcement of contracts not under seal to the granting of relief in actions quantum meruit and quantum valebant not based on actual place well before.for example,blackstone commentaries on the laws of england,the final volume of which was published in,contains the following passage if i employ a person to transact any business for me,or perform any work,the law implies that i undertook,or assumed to pay him so much as his labour deserved.and if i neglect to make him amends,he has a remedy for this injury by bringing his action on the case upon this implied assumpsit wherein he is at liberty to suggest that i promised to pay him so much as he reasonably deserved,and then to aver that his trouble was really worth such a particular sum,which the defendant has omitted to pay.but this valuation of his trouble is submitted to the determination of a jury who will assess such a sum in damages as they think he really merited.this is called an assumpsit on a quantum meruit.blackstone,commentaries.
california case law provides ample authority for the proposition that quantum meruit,a action to recover the reasonable value of services rendered is a species of assumpsit.langford eckert d.quantum meruit,one of the several forms of assumpsit hargiss royal air properties,d.in an action in quantum meruit,the form of the complaint is in assumpsit malvich rockwell d,this action based on a quantum meruit was a suit in assumpsit hutchinson reclam.dist,keeling schastey vollmer,lacy los angeles gas,foltz cogswell cal,fuller reed cal.defendants cite no authority to the contrary.
the case law likewise contains ample authority for the proposition that assumpsit is an action at law,not in equity.morgan morgan d.assumpsit is an action at law even though it is governed by principles of equity beard melvin d,an ordinary action at law in assumpsit philpott superior court cal d,a common count for money had and received is an action for assumpsit,and the action is one at law dondero aparicio,this is not a suit in which equitable relief is sought,but is an ordinary action at law in assumpsit ventre tiscornia,actions at law in assumpsit garniss superior court cal,assumpsit,an action at law,and not in equity.again,defendants cite no authority to the contrary.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we conclude that quantum meruit was recognized as a form of the common law writ of assumpsit long before,and that the parties to a quantum meruit action consequently have a right to a jury trial.the trial court therefore erred by striking jogani request.
ii.defendants arguments are not persuasive 
defendants present several arguments for the conclusion that there is no right to a jury trial in a quantum meruit action.none has merit.
defendants principal argument is based on the supreme court opinion in c k engineering,supra,which contains the following language in determining whether the action was one triable by a jury at common law,the court is not bound by the form of the action but rather by the nature of the rights involved and the facts of the particular gist of the action.c k engineering,supra,cal d at,quoting people v.one chevrolet coupe,s
