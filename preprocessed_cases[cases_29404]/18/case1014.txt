appellant charles aalfs aalfs appeals a decision by the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirming the bankruptcy court judgment under a avoiding the transfer to aalfs of straightline investments,debtor or straightline accounts receivable which had a face value of approximately.in avoiding the transfer,the bankruptcy court ordered aalfs to pay the straightline trustee,the amount collected by aalfs on the transferred accounts,and to transfer back to the trustee all uncollected accounts receivable still in aalfs possession.
on appeal,aalfs contends that the transfer of accounts receivable was not an avoidable transfer under a because there was no depletion or diminution of the debtor estate.aalfs paid straightline for the accounts.aalfs argues that the transfer was an outright sale of receivables in the ordinary course of business,and the defenses of recoupment and earmarking should apply to bar recovery by the trustee.aalfs also argues that,even if the transfer was avoidable,the bankruptcy court awarded the wrong measure of recovery to the trustee under.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d,and we affirm both the bankruptcy court judgment and the bap decision upholding that judgment.
background 
straightline was initially in the business of leasing commercial property.in,it began operating a sawmill and engaging in custom lumber milling,kiln drying of lumber,and log cutting.on september,it filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.on september,straightline president,matthew galt,executed an agreement personally guarantee ing aalfs against all losses from any lending aalfs may do to sli straightline investments,on october,straightline filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking to borrow up to from aalfs pursuant to c.the bankruptcy court authorized straightline to borrow up to from aalfs,with the loan secured only by a junior lien on straightline equipment and a senior lien on straightline inventory.the bankruptcy court specifically denied requests to authorize any further borrowing,including loans secured by straightline accounts receivable.
despite this order of the bankruptcy court,beginning on september,and continuing through march,aalfs advanced money to straightline in exchange for accounts receivable.aalfs obtained a discount from straightline,paying a total of for the accounts,while the total face value of those accounts was approximately.aalfs collected only from the accounts.in his testimony before the bankruptcy court,aalfs referred to this arrangement with straightline as a factoring transaction 
in april,a chapter trustee was appointed for straightline,and the case was converted to a chapter proceeding.the trustee learned of the postpetition transfers of accounts receivable to aalfs and filed the complaint in this action to avoid those transactions.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the trustee complaint and issued its memorandum decision granting avoidance of the transfers of the accounts receivable.the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,and aalfs filed a notice of appeal to this court.we initially remanded the case to the bankruptcy court,concluding that the appeal was interlocutory because the bankruptcy court had not yet decided the trustee second cause of action regarding avoidance of a postpetition transfer of logs.aalfs sims in re straightline,cir.on remand,the bankruptcy court entered the same judgment on the accounts receivable claim and denied all of the trustee other claims.aalfs again appealed to the bap,the bap affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court,and this appeal followed.

avoidable transfer pursuant to 
under,a trustee may avoid a transfer of property of the estate that occurs after the commencement of the case and b that is not authorized under this title or by the court.a,b west.if a trustee seeks to recover a postpetition transfer under section,the trustee must show that a transfer occurred after the filing of the bankruptcy petition and that the transfer was not authorized by either the bankruptcy court or the bankruptcy code.mora vasquez in re mora,cir citations omitted.
a transfer is broadly defined by the code as every mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with property or with an interest in property id.quoting.therefore,regardless of whether we characterize the transaction between straightline and aalfs as a sale or a loan,it constituted a transfer under the bankruptcy code.
aalfs argues,however,that straightline had no control over the money which might be collected from the accounts receivable,and therefore,its transfer of the accounts to aalfs was not a transfer of estate property.in making this argument,aalfs fails to recognize the difference between the accounts receivable themselves and the funds paid by the account debtors.it is the transfer of the accounts that is at issue here.tavormina capital factors,in re jarax int l,finding no transfer of an interest of the debtor in property under because the debtor lacked the requisite control over the funds where the debtor and defendants had entered into a factoring agreement prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition.here,straightline had a legal interest in its accounts receivable in the form of a right to collect them when it transferred them to aalfs.see in re metro,at.therefore,a transfer of property of the estate occurred.see a.
the transfers occurred after the commencement of the bankruptcy case,beginning on september,nineteen days after straightline filed its chapter bankruptcy petition.the trustee also established that the transfer of accounts receivable from straightline to aalfs was not authorized by the bankruptcy court.see a b.the bankruptcy court authorization for a loan from aalfs to straightline did not include permission to transfer any of straightline accounts receivable to aalfs.aalfs conceded as much in his testimony before the bankruptcy court.
aalfs argues that straightline transfer of the accounts receivable to him is not avoidable under because the transfers were outright sales of the accounts which were conducted in the ordinary course of straightline business,and such sales are allowed under c.before addressing this argument,we first consider aalfs contention that the transfer of accounts receivable did not result in a depletion or diminution of straightline estate and therefore can not constitute an avoidable transfer under.
depletion or diminution of the estate 
of the three cases cited by aalfs in support of his estate depletion argument,only one of them tends to help him,and that is the in re cassis decision from the northern district of iowa,in which the court stated there must be a depletion of the estate for there to be an avoidable transfer under or.cambridge tempositions,cassis in re cassis,citing in re jarax int l,at.but neither in re cassis nor in re jarax applied the depletion of the estate proposition to a claim of an avoidable postpetition transfer under.instead,in re cassis dealt with a complaint to avoid a fraudulent transfer under,and the court in in re jarax only discussed depletion of the estate in the context of prepetition preferential transfers under and fraudulent transfers under,not postpetition transfers under.in re cassis,at in re jarax int l,at see also adams anderson in re superior stamp coin,cir applying the diminution of estate doctrine to determine whether transferred property belongs to the debtor for purposes of.the third case cited by re held that the trustee was not entitled to a money judgment for an avoidable postpetition transfer because there was no proof that the estate suffered damages on account of the defendant actions.ramette al alma supper club in re bame.
the question whether depletion of the estate is a requirement for finding a transfer avoidable under is an open question in this circuit.although the diminution of estate theory is commonly viewed as a prerequisite for avoidability of prepetition preferential transfers under and fraudulent transfers under,see in re superior stamp coin,at in re smith,cir nordberg sanchez in re chase sanborn,cir deel,levine,cir in re cassis,at in re jarax,at,only the sixth circuit has considered the diminution of estate doctrine in a case involving the avoidance of a transfer under.see peoples bank trust burns in re shelton.cir.in that case,the sixth circuit stated that the doctrine of earmarking was inapplicable.however,in an earlier decision in the same case the appellate panel had indicated that earmarking might apply if the transaction in question did not result in a diminution of the estate value.id.at citing the panel earlier decision,peoples bank trust burns in re shelton,cir.when the case came back after remand,the court stated the question was whether it should reconsider its earlier decision.id.at.the court decided it had no basis to do so because the parties had stipulated there had been no diminution of the bankruptcy estate and thus there would be no manifest injustice by letting the earlier decision stand,even though it contained an erroneous resolution of the earmarking question.id.at.
we decline to expand the diminution of estate doctrine,from its established application in and cases,to this case.although the primary purpose of is to allow the trustee to avoid transfers of property which deplete the estate,see lawrence king,collier on bankruptcy ed,the plaintiff failure to demonstrate a measurable depletion of the estate is not enough to allow a transfer to stand when it is otherwise avoidable under because it satisfies all of the explicit requirements of an avoidable postpetition transfer 
ordinary course of business 
aalfs also argues that the transfer to him of straightline accounts receivable falls within the ordinary course of business exception to avoidable postpetition transfers under c.section c of the bankruptcy code provides that i f the business of the debtor is authorized to be operated under section of this title and unless the court orders otherwise,the trustee may enter into transactions in the ordinary course of business,without notice or a hearing c west.section permits a trustee to operate a debtor business unless the bankruptcy court orders otherwise.id.additionally,grants a under chapter all of the same rights and powers as a trustee.id.a.a determination of whether a transaction falls outside the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends on the nature of industry practice.ganis credit anderson in re jan weilert rv,cir citing arrow,justus in re kaypro,cir.
two tests have emerged for determining whether a transaction is within the ordinary course of business for purposes of c the vertical dimension,or creditor expectation,test,and the horizontal dimension test.burlington dant russell,in re dant russell,cir.if both tests are satisfied,the court must conclude that the challenged transaction occurred in the debtor ordinary course of business.id.at see also credit alliance idaho asphalt supply,in re blumer,stating that the ninth circuit has determined that a transaction which meets both the horizontal and vertical dimension tests is in the ordinary course of business,but i t is unclear whether dant russell requires both the horizontal and vertical dimension tests to be satisfied in re media,if either test or dimension is not satisfied,most likely the disputed transaction is not in the ordinary course of business.
vertical test 
the vertical dimension,or creditor expectation test,views the disputed transaction from the vantage point of a hypothetical creditor and inquires whether the transaction subjects a creditor to economic risks of a nature different from those he accepted when he decided to extend credit.in re dant russell,at quoting comm.of litigants in re.in determining whether the transaction meets the vertical dimension test,courts often look to the debtor prepetition business practices.id.at.this conduct is then compared to the debtor postpetition business activities.in re,at.stated differently,t he vertical component necessarily includes an examination of the relationship between the debtor and his creditors to determine whether the transaction in question was ordinary in the context of that relationship.poff poff,in re poff.
it is difficult to make a fair comparison of the debtor business activities before and after its filing for bankruptcy because straightline only entered the custom milling business a few months before filing its bankruptcy petition.before that,it was in the business of leasing commercial real estate.there were no accounts receivable transferred from straightline to aalfs before september,the date that straightline filed its chapter petition.straightline president,matthew galt,testified that when straightline was in the custom milling business prior to filing its chapter petition,it often sold accounts receivable to its vendors,but the most common aspect of these sales was a prepaid discount of the customer accounts,rather than actual sales of the accounts to third parties.
straightline predecessor in the custom milling business,north coast hardwoods,had obtained loans from six rivers bank,and those loans were partially secured by accounts receivable.straightline had also obtained a loan from six rivers bank,but it was secured only by real estate.six rivers bank senior vice president,evelyn giddings,testified that she would not have expected straightline to sell its accounts receivable at the time it obtained a loan,but at that time,straightline was still only in the business of leasing real estate,and it had no accounts receivable.
the bankruptcy court found that,even if the transfer of straightline accounts receivable to aalfs was a true sale and not part of a disguised loan transaction,it was not accomplished in the ordinary course of business because straightline creditors would have expected notice and a hearing before such transactions occurred.that was because the bankruptcy court had previously been asked to rule on the possibility of straightline obtaining a loan using its accounts receivable as collateral,and that request had been denied.the bankruptcy court found that c reditors would have reasonably expected that from that time forward they would be given notice of any attempt to transfer the receivables.that finding is not clearly erroneous.
nor was the bankruptcy court clearly erroneous in its finding that the sales of accounts receivable to aalfs were actually part of a disguised loan transaction.aalfs had been given matthew galt personal guarantee of full repayment,and in correspondence between employees of straightline and aalfs there were references to aalfs payments for the accounts as advances.see fireman fund ins.grover in re the woodson,cir stating that guarantee against risk of loss is a feature that seems to result in a finding of a relationship in most cases and noting that l abels can not change the true nature of the underlying transactions netbank,fsb kipperman in re commercial money,cir stating that the bankruptcy court decision on the loan versus sale issue is a factual determination that we review for clear error.we conclude that the vertical dimension test is not satisfied.
horizontal test 
under the horizontal dimension test,the question is whether the postpetition transaction is of a type that other similar businesses would engage in as ordinary business.in re dant russell,at citations omitted.for example,raising a crop would not be in the ordinary course of business for a widget manufacturer because that is not a widget manufacturer ordinary business.johnston first in re waterfront.the purpose of the horizontal test is to assure that neither the debtor nor the creditor did anything abnormal to gain an advantage over other creditors in re dant russell,at quoting in re,at.
