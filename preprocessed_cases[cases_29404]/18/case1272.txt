the unclaimed property law upl code civ,et requires corporations to deliver to the state controller a duplicate certificate of unclaimed corporate stock in specified circumstances.section,subdivision d,provides that any holder of that unclaimed stock shall be relieved from all liability of every kind to any person for any losses or damages resulting to that person by the issuance and delivery to the controller of the duplicate certificate we granted review to determine the nature and scope of this immunity.we conclude that a corporation is entitled to section immunity only if it complies with other provisions of the upl.we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which reached a similar conclusion,and disapprove harris verizon communications th,d verizon,which reached a contrary conclusion.
procedural history 
plaintiff azure limited azure sued defendant corporation for breach of fiduciary duty.the complaint alleged the following azure acquired nearly shares of stock in and exchanged those shares in for nearly shares in a reverse stock split.in,azure learned that had transferred these shares to the state as escheated property.in october,azure requested the state to return its stock.the state responded that azure might not be able to receive the stock itself,and that it might instead receive proceeds from the sale of the stock.in november,when common stock was selling for per share,azure learned that the state had sold the stock in june for per share.
the complaint alleged that breached its fiduciary duty to azure by treating azure stock as abandoned property even though it knew azure location at all relevant times,by transferring the stock to the state without legal justification,and by failing to give azure notice of the transfer.it sought to recover as damages the difference between the proceeds from the june sale and the value of the stock as of november.
the superior court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of,finding that section immunized actions,and entered judgment accordingly.azure appealed.the court of appeal reversed the judgment.it held that the upl immunizes corporations from civil liability only when they transfer escheated shares to the state in compliance with the provisions of the upl.the upl does not immunize corporations like who allegedly transfer nonescheated shares to the state without giving the required notice.it remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to vacate its order granting judgment on the pleadings and instead deny the motion.
we granted review to resolve the conflict between the court of appeal opinion in this case and verizon,supra,th,d.
ii.discussion 
a.the statutory scheme 
the upl establishes the conditions under which certain unclaimed personal property escheats to the state.the upl is not a permanent or true escheat statute.instead,it gives the state custody and use of unclaimed property until such time as the owner claims it.its dual objectives are to protect unknown owners by locating them and restoring their property to them and to give the state rather than the holders of unclaimed property the benefit of the use of it,most of which experience shows will never be claimed.harris westly th,d,fn.omitted,quoting douglas aircraft cranston cal d.
this case involves shares of stock.section governs intangible interests in a business association,such as corporate stock.stock will escheat to the state if its owner has neither claimed a dividend nor corresponded in writing or otherwise indicated an interest in the stock for over three years,and the corporation does not know the owner location at the end of the period,subd.b.with respect to this stock,the statute provides that the corporation shall be deemed the holder.ibid.a corporation holding stock that has escheated under this provision must include the stock in a report filed yearly with the controller.before it can report any stock that may escheat,the corporation must make reasonable efforts to notify the stock owner of the impending escheat,subd.d.the corporation must give this notice between six and months before the stock becomes reportable to the controller.ibid.the notice must include a form by which the owner may confirm its current address.if that form is filled out,signed by the owner,and returned to the holder,it shall be deemed that the business association knows the location of the owner.ibid.otherwise,the corporation must include the stock in its yearly report to the controller.
section is critical to the issue before us.subdivision a of that section requires a corporation that has filed the report under section to deliver to the controller all escheated property specified in the report between seven months and seven months and days after the report is due.subdivision b of that section qualifies this requirement by providing that if,in the interim between the report and delivery,the owner of the stock establishes its right to the property to the satisfaction of the holder or it otherwise appears that the stock is not subject to escheat,the corporation must not deliver the property to the controller instead,the corporation must file a different report containing information pertaining to the property not subject to escheat,subd.b.
subdivision d of section concerns what to do with escheated stock.the first sentence of that subdivision provides the holder of any interest under subdivision b of section shall deliver a duplicate certificate to the controller or shall register the securities in uncertificated form in the name of the controller.the second and final sentence of that subdivision presents the precise issue before us upon delivering a duplicate certificate or providing evidence of registration of the securities in uncertificated form to the controller,the holder,any transfer agent,registrar,or other person acting for or on behalf of the holder in executing or delivering the duplicate certificate or registering the uncertificated securities,shall be relieved from all liability of every kind to any person including,but not limited to,any person acquiring the original certificate or the duplicate of the certificate issued to the controller for any losses or damages resulting to that person by the issuance and delivery to the controller of the duplicate certificate or the registration of the uncertificated securities to the controller,subd.d,italics added.
the controller assumes custody of escheated property it has received and,if it has commercial value,eventually sells it,subd.a.securities listed on an established stock exchange shall be sold at the prevailing prices on that exchange,subd.b.a person who claims an interest in the property may file a claim to the property or to the net proceeds from its sale,subd.a.if the controller grants the claim,the controller returns the property or the proceeds from its sale to the claimant fong westly th,d.additionally,any holder who has delivered personal property,including a certificate of any interest in a business association,to the state controller pursuant to this chapter may reclaim such personal property if still in the possession of the state controller without payment of any fee or other charges upon filing proof that the owner thereof has claimed such personal property from such holder,subd.d.although subdivision c of section formerly provided for the payment of interest fong westly,supra,at,d,in,that subdivision was amended to provide,as it does today,no interest shall be payable on any claim paid under this chapter.see stats,ch.
interpretation of section,subdivision d 
azure alleges that should not have delivered its stock to the controller for two reasons the stock was not subject to escheat under section,subdivision b,because knew azure location at all relevant times and did not provide the notice that section,subdivision d,requires.it also alleges that,even though it received the proceeds from the controller sale of the stock,it was damaged because the controller had previously sold the stock at a price much lower than its value when azure reclaimed the property.denies these allegations but recognizes that they have not yet been litigated.when reviewing a judgment on the pleadings,we must accept as true the material facts alleged in the complaint.foundation for taxpayer consumer rights nextel communications,th,d.thus,the legal issue before us is whether section immunizes from liability even if we assume that,when it delivered the stock to the controller,it knew azure address and failed to provide notice under section,subdivision d.
the court in verizon,supra,th,d,interpreted section as providing immunity to a corporation that issues and delivers to the controller a duplicate certificate,whether or not the delivery complies with the upl requirements.justice mallano dissented,arguing that the upl immunity provisions can not reasonably be interpreted to apply to the circumstances here,where plaintiffs allege that the defendant breached a fiduciary duty to give them a fair opportunity to prevent the operation of the upl in the first instance.verizon,supra,at,d.the court of appeal here disagreed with the verizon majority.it concluded that the upl does not immunize corporations like defendant who allegedly transfer nonescheated shares to the state without giving the required notice.we agree with this conclusion.
argues and the verizon court found that the immunity conferred by the upl is absolute.verizon,supra,th at,d.in one sense,this may be so.but the question is who receives this immunity.is it any corporation that transfers a duplicate certificate to the controller,or only one that does so in compliance with the upl 
section,subdivision d,states that t he holder of any interest under subdivision b of section must take certain action,and then it immunizes that holder for that action.we must determine when a corporation becomes a holder entitled to immunity under this provision.escheated stock differs from other escheated property in a crucial respect.usually,whoever delivers escheated property to the controller possesses that property.but the stockholder,not the corporation,normally possesses the certificate representing an intangible interest in the corporation.thus,section,subdivision d,requires the corporation to deliver a duplicate certificate of escheated stock to the controller.section,subdivision b,states that,with respect to escheated stock,the corporation shall be deemed the holder.this is so despite the fact the corporation might never actually possess the original certificate of escheated stock.what this means is that,although the corporation does not possess the original certificate,the upl deems the corporation to be the holder of the interest when the criteria of abandoned property is satisfied.until those criteria are satisfied,the corporation is not a holder,and therefore is not entitled to the immunity afforded a holder under section.thus,section,subdivision d,immunizes only the holder of stock that is actually subject to escheat under section,subdivision b.
section,which defines various terms used in the upl,is consistent with this conclusion.as relevant,section provides as used in the upl,unless the context otherwise requires e holder means any person in possession of property subject to this chapter belonging to another italics added.argues that the upl does not always refer to property that is actually subject to escheat but occasionally contains broader references.for example,section,subdivision d,imposes notice requirements on corporations possessing property that may escheat pursuant to subdivision b thus,argues,a holder includes corporations in possession of escheated and potentially escheatable property.we disagree.even assuming the definition in section,subdivision e,by itself,would support a broad interpretation of holder under section,subdivision d,the context otherwise requires a narrower interpretation.as we have explained,in context,the holder that section,subdivision d,immunizes is t he holder of any interest under subdivision b of section section,subdivision b,deems the corporation to be the holder only of stock actually subject to escheat 
this interpretation means that only a corporation delivering a duplicate certificate of stock actually subject to escheat under section,subdivision b,receives section,subdivision d immunity.if the corporation delivers to the controller stock that does not meet the requirements of section,subdivision b,it is not entitled to the statutory immunity.we believe the same is also true of a corporation that delivers the stock without complying with the notice requirements of section,subdivision d.the obvious purpose of such notice is to prevent the unauthorized delivery of stock to the controller.although section,subdivision d,does not specifically refer to the notice requirement of section,subdivision d,the upl,as a whole,makes clear that the corporation must not actually deliver stock to the controller without first complying with the notice requirements.this means the stock is not actually escheatable until the notice requirements are satisfied.indeed,the notice provision would be meaningless if corporations could ignore it and still receive immunity for their actions.
argues that section immunity can not be conditioned on satisfying the notice requirements of section,subdivision d,because the legislature did not add those notice requirements until and,when it did so,it did not change section immunity provision to require compliance with the new notice requirements as a condition of immunity.see stats,ch.argues that i f the legislature intended to make compliance with section,subdivision d a condition of immunity,it would have done so explicitly.but we think the fact that section immunity provision predated section,subdivision d notice requirement explains why the former does not reference the latter.this circumstance does not negate the fact that section,subdivision d,only governs the holder of any interest under section,subdivision b,property actually subject to escheat.as azure argues,it is unlikely the legislature intended to immunize a delivery that violated section notice requirements.
argues,and verizon concluded,that interpreting section immunity as conditioned on compliance with the upl other requirements would render the immunity meaningless because immunity comes into play when,and only when,the defendant is charged with wrongdoing.verizon,supra,th at,d.if a corporation acts in compliance with,and under compulsion of,the upl,the argument goes,there could be no liability even absent section immunity.thus,to be meaningful,and not mere surplusage,the immunity must be interpreted as covering wrongdoing,that is,covering actions where liability might otherwise exist.the argument is facially appealing,but we find it unpersuasive.first,it proves too much.as we explain below,the upl contains other immunity provisions that even recognizes are conditioned on compliance with the upl.if conditioning section immunity on compliance with the upl would render it meaningless surplusage,then the same would seem to be true of the immunity of sections and.in fact,good reason exists for the legislature to provide for this immunity expressly even if it is conditioned on compliance with the upl.
as noted above,because the corporation does not possess the escheated stock,it can not,under ordinary circumstances,transfer the stock without the participation of the owner.to deal with the absence of possession,the legislature has directed the holders of escheated stock to deliver a duplicate certificate to the controller or register the security in the controller name,subd.d.as amicus curiae controller stated at oral argument,issuing a duplicate stock certificate would be a very unorthodox act.this procedure is inconsistent with statutes governing the transfer of certificated and uncertificated securities.see cal,et absent section immunity provision,a corporation might be faced with conflicting demands to recognize a share of stock,and with potential liability to two owners of the same share.see cal,subd.b.that section is concerned with this particular potential liability is reflected in the provision language and context.the statute refers to liability resulting by the issuance and delivery to the controller of the duplicate certificate or the registration of the uncertificated securities to the controller,subd.d,rather than more generally to liability resulting from the transfer of intangible property to the controller.in addition,the statute specific reference to claims by any person acquiring the original certificate or the duplicate of the certificate issued to the controller ibid.focuses on liabilities related to the existence of both certificates.it is not meaningless for the legislature to assure corporations issuing duplicate stock certificates in compliance with the upl that they will incur no liability for doing so.the fact the legislature provided such assurance expressly does not mean the grant of immunity extends to actions that do not comply with the upl.
certainly,if section had not expressly immunized the delivery of duplicate stock certificates in compliance with the upl,it is likely the courts would have read the upl as implying such immunity.but this circumstance does not make the express grant of immunity meaningless or permit the courts to interpret the immunity as broader than the language otherwise permits.sometimes the legislature may choose to state expressly what would otherwise be implied to make the statute meaning entirely clear,avoid unnecessary litigation,and reassure entities that must comply with the statute.moreover,as the court of appeal explained in this case,corporations that comply with the upl are immunized from claims that the corporations breached contractual or fiduciary duties over and above the are immunized from claims that they should have done more than the upl requires.the value of this immunity is not lessened by maintaining the liability of corporations that do less than the upl demands.
cites other immunity provisions in the upl in support of its position.section,subdivision a,gives immunity to any person who pays or delivers escheated property to the state controller under this chapter section,subdivision a,requires the controller to defend and indemnify a holder who pays or delivers escheated property to the state controller in accordance with this chapter agrees that these grants of immunity are limited to actions that comply with the upl and do not extend to mistaken deliveries.indeed,the law revision commission comment to section states that section,subdivision a,like section,applies only in cases in which escheated property has been paid or delivered to the controller.if the holder mistakenly delivers to the controller property that has not escheated,this section does not require the controller to defend the claim of the owner or indemnify the holder.cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.ed.foll.
argues that the immunity provisions of sections and support its position in two respects.first,it argues that because these statutes immunize the delivery of property in compliance with the upl,section must be interpreted as providing absolute immunity to prevent it from simply duplicating sections and.second,it argues that these statutes show that the legislature knew how to condition immunity on full compliance with certain conditions when it wanted to do so.neither argument supports position.section does not duplicate sections and.sections and govern the delivery of escheated property.section governs the issuance and delivery of duplicate stock certificates.these are two different actions.the legislature could logically decide to have separate immunity provisions for these varying actions.we also agree that the legislature knows how to condition immunity on compliance with the upl,but it did so regarding section by giving immunity only to holders of property actually subject to escheat under section,subdivision b.
indeed,the circumstance that the immunity of sections and is conditioned on compliance with the upl supports a similar interpretation of section.we see no reason the legislature would condition immunity for delivering property on the property being actually subject to escheat and but grant absolute immunity for issuing and delivering a duplicate stock certificate even if the stock is not subject to escheat.instead,the legislature likely intended parallel grants of immunity.
argues,and the verizon court concluded,that the legislature adoption of a rule of absolute immunity is consistent with the purpose of the upl,which is to give the state rather than the holders of unclaimed property the benefit of its use.citation.without this protection,holders of unclaimed property concerned about lawsuits would likely err on the side of retaining rather than delivering unclaimed property to the controller,thereby depriving the state of the benefit of its use.verizon,supra,th at,d.on the contrary,conditioning immunity on compliance with the upl furthers its are to protect unknown owners and to give the state the benefit of the use of unclaimed property.see harris westly,supra,th at,d.requiring compliance with the,ensuring that the owners are in fact unknown and the property is in fact the purpose of protecting unknown owners.moreover,the state has no legitimate interest in receiving and using property that is not unclaimed.as the controller points out in an amicus curiae brief supporting azure on this issue,the state has no way of determining whether stock delivered to it is in fact subject to escheat under section,subdivision b.as the controller further states,only the corporation has access to the information needed to know whether property meets the upl conditions for escheat.thus,it makes sense for the legislature to immunize a corporation delivery of unclaimed stock,but to condition the immunity on the stock being actually subject to escheat.
also argues that recent legislation shows the legislature impliedly ratified the interpretation of section given in verizon,supra,th,d.as the court of appeal explained,i n,after verizon was decided,the legislature amended subdivision a of section,added new subdivisions,and redesignated subdivision b the immunity subdivision d without change.stats,ch.we agree with the court of appeal that this change does not ineluctably indicate legislative agreement with verizon interpretation we do not see how a nonsubstantive renumbering of the subdivision containing the immunity provision constitutes a legislative endorsement of verizon,or anything other than an attempt to make room for new subdivisions.under these circumstances we find little significance in the legislature failure to amend the immunity provision when it amended the upl in other respects.see communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that section,subdivision d,immunizes only corporations that deliver stock in compliance with the upl.we disapprove harris verizon communications,supra,th,d.
iii.conclusion 
we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision b which is part of the unclaimed property law upl,provides that any intangible interest in a business association,as evidenced by the stock records or membership records of the association,escheats to this state if the interest in the association is owned by a person who for more than three years has neither claimed a dividend or other sum nor corresponded in writing with the association and the association does not know the location of the owner at the end of the period.with respect to the interest,the business association shall be deemed the holder.
section,subdivision d,requires the holder of any interest under subdivision b of section to deliver a duplicate certificate to the controller.the statute provides a broadly worded immunity to the holder upon delivering a duplicate certificate the holder shall be relieved from all liability of every kind to any person for any losses or damages resulting to that person by the issuance and delivery to the controller of the duplicate certificate,subd.d.
the majority holds that this immunity is quite limited and applies only if the holder has complied with all of the provisions of the upl.i disagree.by its terms,the immunity applies once the holder delivers a copy of the duplicate certificate.the apparent purpose of the immunity is to protect the hold
