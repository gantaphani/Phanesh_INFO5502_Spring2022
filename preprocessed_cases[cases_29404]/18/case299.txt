this lawsuit arises from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic june liquidation of the golden pacific national bank the bank,which was based in manhattan chinatown neighborhood.the bank holding company,plaintiff golden pacific bancorp bancorp,alleges that the fdic should never have liquidated the bank in the first place,and,to make matters worse,that the fdic chose the most expensive liquidation method possible.bancorp further alleges that the fdic wastefully charged certain expenses to the receivership estate,and that,when the bank creditors were finally paid,the fdic depleted the remaining estate by improperly paying itself interest on the insurance funds it had disbursed to depositors on the bank behalf.bancorp seeks to recover against the fdic under theories of unjust enrichment,breach of fiduciary duty,and corporate waste.the district court granted the fdic summary judgment on all claims.
the primary issue on appeal is whether the fdic,as subrogee to the claims of a failed bank depositors,may collect interest on those claims from the failed bank estate.we hold that such interest payments are not improper.we also hold that bancorp evidence suggesting that the fdic breached its fiduciary duties by choosing an expensive method is too speculative to defeat summary judgment.finally,we hold that bancorp lacks standing to pursue certain waste claims because the bank outstanding obligations to a senior creditor,the internal revenue service irs,would preclude any potential recovery for.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
background 
on june,officials from the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the fdic,acting upon an informant tip,conducted a surprise examination of the bank for the purpose of scrutinizing certain custodial for their color as yellow cds which the bank had been issuing to its customers.the bank maintained that the yellow cds were actually investments placed with the bank as agent,as opposed to deposits,liabilities of the bank.the bank also told occ officials that,even if the yellow cds were considered liabilities,they were backed by sufficient assets to maintain the bank solvency.the occ disagreed on both points,and,by the end of the week,closed the bank and declared it insolvent.
the fdic insured the bank depositors,and the occ appointed the fdic also to serve as the bank receiver.the fdic dual roles as insurer and receiver arise by statutory design,and it is not uncommon for the fdic to serve in both capacities with respect to a single bank liquidation.see fdic bernstein,cir see also.am.bancshares,clarke,cir the separateness of these dual identities of the fdic has been well respected by federal courts.
as insurer,the fdic was statutorily required to either pay depositors the insured amounts in cash,or to make the depositors accounts available up to the insured amounts through another bank.see f.in this case,the fdic chose to address virtually all of its insurance obligations by soliciting bids from financially healthy banks to enter into a deposit insurance transfer and asset purchase agreement ditapa.under a ditapa,the healthy bank agrees to purchase certain of the failed bank assets at a premium in exchange for the fdic making the insured deposits of the failed bank available through the healthy bank which presumably is interested in the depositors business.
the fdic ultimately entered into a ditapa with the only bidder,hong kong and shanghai banking corporation hksb,which paid a premium of over million and agreed to purchase approximately million of the bank assets.the fdic covered its remaining insurance obligations pertaining to the bank various loan production offices outside new york either through a similar arrangement or by direct payment.by the end of,the fdic had paid over million in insurance claims,virtually all of which went to hksb as the bank paying agent under the ditapa.
by statute,the fdic was subrogated to the claims of insured depositors to the extent of the fdic insurance payments.see g.beginning in july,the fdic,as receiver,began repaying its creditors,the largest of which was itself,as insurer,for having covered the insured deposits.by early,the fdic had repaid the amount of all principal owed to all the bank creditors.
the fdic then began to make interest payments to creditors.based upon new york statutory judgment rate,the fdic determined that it owed itself approximately million and that it owed creditors approximately million by,those creditors had received just under half of the interest payments owed.the fdic inactivated the receivership in.
bancorp initiated this lawsuit in,seeking to recover against the fdic,in both its corporate capacity as insurer and in its capacity as the bank receiver,under theories of unjust enrichment,breach of fiduciary duty,and corporate waste.bancorp contends that the june regulatory ambush rashly dubbed the bank insolvent in the face of clear evidence to the contrary.see am.compl.bancorp alleges that the fdic breached its fiduciary duty to the bank by continuing with the liquidation in light of that evidence and by choosing,before performing the customary cost evaluation,to wind up the bank by the very costly ditapa method.
bancorp also asserts that the fdic breached its fiduciary duties and was unjustly enriched by awarding itself interest on its insurance payout.bancorp contends the interest award was improper altogether and,in any event,excessive.finally,bancorp claims that the fdic was wasteful in charging certain expenses to the receivership,such as professional fees and travel fees,and in paying itself the allegedly excessive interest.
in the two opinions that are the subject of this appeal,the district court granted the fdic summary judgment on all claims.see golden pac.bancorp fdic,civ,wl june,golden pac.bancorp fdic,civ,wl,
ii.standard of review 
on appeal,we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see golden,at.the court may grant summary judgment only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.

where,as here,the party would bear the burden of persuasion at trial,the moving party must first make a prima facie case by either identifying the portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact or pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.celotex catrett,d.after such a prima facie showing,the party must respond with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.to this end,t he party may not rely on mere conclusory allegations nor speculation,but instead must offer some hard evidence showing that its version of the events is not wholly fanciful.city of new york,cir.in other words,w hen the moving party has carried its burden under rule c,its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d footnote omitted.
throughout this inquiry,the court must credit the party evidence and draw all justifiable inferences in favor of that party.see anderson,at.
iii.discussion 
a.the liquidation method 
in its capacity as receiver,the fdic steps into the shoes of the failed bank and has a responsibility to marshal the assets of the bank and to distribute them to the bank creditors and shareholders.du pont de nemours fdic.generally speaking,a receiver owes a duty of strict impartiality to all persons interested in the receivership estate,and also must endeavor to realize the largest possible amount for assets of the estate.phelan middle states oil,cir internal quotation marks omitted it is undisputed that,as a receiver,the fdic owes a fiduciary duty to the bank creditors and to see golden,at.bancorp argues that the fdic breached that duty by mismanaging the receivership and leaving bancorp shareholders with nothing.
bancorp contends that the fdic first mistake was ignoring the fact that the bank was actually solvent when the fdic took over.as evidence of the bank solvency,bancorp points to the fdic own balance sheets and an independent auditing firm report showing that the bank was solvent before the fdic entered into the ditapa.bancorp also emphasizes that the irs had determined that the bank was solvent in and had attempted,against fdic resistance,to collect taxes accordingly.the fdic and irs ultimately settled the matter,on terms that bancorp contends are premised on the bank having actually been solvent in.
bancorp complaint faults the fdic for putting the bank into receivership in light of the evidence of solvency.this allegation ignores that the fdic was precluded by statute from refusing to accept the receivership appointment or otherwise attempting to undo the occ solvency determination.see,c.at oral argument,bancorp counsel conceded this point.bancorp nevertheless maintains that the fdic,knowing that the bank could cover its debts,should have proceeded on a less drastic course,such as simply continuing to operate the bank,creating a new bridge bank to manage the bank operations,or entering into a purchase and assumption p a agreement with a healthy bank.a p a resembles a merger but is structured as a purchase of assets that is,loans and assumption of liabilities that is,deposits of the failing bank by the acquiring bank,with the fdic making up the shortfall between the value of the liabilities assumed and the assets purchased.iii michael mallow,banking law and regulation,at see also fdic merchants bank of mobile,cir describing a p a.see generally barry zisman marquerite woung,the superpowers of the and their availability to third parties,banking,discussing the various alternatives available to the fdic in dealing with failed financial institutions.
we agree with the district court that bancorp arguments are unsupported and unavailing.as an initial matter,the statutory scheme at the time of the liquidation evinced a careful division of labor between the occ and the fdic the occ determined whether a bank was insolvent and,if so,the fdic was required to wind up the bank and cover its insurance obligations.see c stating that,after the occ determined an insured bank was insolvent,the occ shall appoint the fdic receiver id.stating that an appointed receiver shall proceed to close up an insolvent bank id.f stating that payment of the insured deposits shall be made by the fdic as soon as possible to the extent bancorp suggests that the fdic should have done anything short of an immediate of the bank,the statutes mandatory language leads us to conclude otherwise.
bancorp evidence that the fdic breached its fiduciary duties by failing to apply one of the allegedly milder methods available,instead of the ditapa,falls far short of what is required to defeat summary judgment.bancorp clings principally to the vague and isolated comment of one fdic official that small banks typically lose percent of the value of their assets when liquidating those assets.bancorp would have the court infer from that general statement that one of bancorp suggested alternative may have kept the bank business alive either as golden pacific or through another have saved the liquidation costs associated with ending the bank business altogether under the ditapa and would have ultimately preserved more receivership assets for bancorp shareholders.without any additional compelling evidence,that inferential leap is so wide as to amount to sheer speculation.
bancorp general observation about liquidations does not even purport to compare the ditapa method with any other method generally,much less explain how any other method would have been preferential on the facts of this case.for example,bancorp has not suggested that any other particular bank would have been willing to enter into a p a and assume the liabilities of the bank,which at the time was subject to investigation for financial improprieties in connection with the yellow cds.bancorp has not offered the comparative costs of either creating a new bank or covering the excess liabilities involved in a p a,as applied to this case moreover,bancorp does not even allege that the bank would have been considered a small bank,or that its liquidation incurred losses typical of a small bank liquidation.
bancorp also directs the court attention to judicial opinions and journal articles for the general proposition that p a arrangements are the preferred method of winding up a failed bank.again,however,those general observations have no nexus to the facts of this case.none of the policy arguments presented in the sources cited by bancorp lends any evidentiary support to its position that the ditapa method is the most expensive one,or that its use by the fdic could amount to a breach of its fiduciary duties to a failed bank shareholders.along similar lines,bancorp alleges that the fdic deviated from its customary policy of performing a cost test before choosing a method of winding up a bank.such an allegation is immaterial in absence of any evidence that the cost test would have led the fdic to act differently.
in sum,bancorp speculation that the fdic chosen method which is expressly authorized by statute might have been more expensive than other options is insufficient to defeat summary judgment,especially absent any meaningful evidence or analysis of the facts of this particular liquidation.
bancorp suggests there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the fdic acted properly in awarding itself nine percent interest on the funds it had previously paid to cover its insurance obligations.in particular,bancorp alleges that the payments resulted in an unjust enrichment and constituted a breach of fiduciary duty we disagree.
the statutory scheme at the relevant time stated that the fdic,after paying insured depositors,was subrogated to all the rights of the depositor against the closed bank to the extent of such insurance payment.g emphasis added.even more specifically,the fdic was entitled to receive the same dividends from the proceeds of the assets of such closed bank as would have been payable to the depositor on a claim for the insured deposit.id.under new york law,a depositor who prevails on a claim against a failed bank is entitled to collect the ordinary and inherent interest on his judgment after all the creditors are paid the principal owed.see people am.loan trust.moreover,the supreme court has long since recognized the general proposition that creditors to a liquidation are entitled to interest,just as any other judgment creditor,even absent specific statutory authorization.see bank of the commonwealth mechanics bank.the interest lawfully accruing upon each of the claims was as much a part of it as the original debt.see also stein delano,cir holding that creditors of insolvent bank are entitled to interest,just as any other judgment creditor it follows that the fdic,as the depositors subrogee,is entitled to interest.the only two cases we have found directly addressing the issue agree.see fdic citizens state bank of niangua,cir fdic iowa growthland financial in re receivership of first bank in humboldt,iowa.
furthermore,we note that to hold otherwise would give bancorp the windfall of essentially an loan,and leave the fdic with no compensation for the loss of the use of the funds it advanced.see citizens state bank,at neither the purpose of the act nor its legislative history evidences any philanthropic intent,in a situation such as this,to allow the use of the fdic funds to become a source of profit to stockholders of a defaulting bank,at the expense of the fdic.humboldt,at stating that the fiscal integrity of the fdic insurance should not be c
