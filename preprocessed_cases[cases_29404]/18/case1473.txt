the underlying case was dismissed by the trial court as a sanction for repeated failure to respond to discovery and comply with discovery orders.several months after terminating sanctions were issued,appellants sought to revive the litigation through a motion for relief from default or dismissal under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b section b.the court denied the motion.we conclude that dismissal was the result of an intentional strategic decision on the part of appellants counsel,and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
appellants jerry shell and others brought suit against equilon enterprises,llc,doing business as dba shell oil products equilon and certain individuals the complaint essentially alleged that equilon,a joint enterprise between shell and texaco,developed a plan to convert independent franchise dealers stations into stations or put them in the hands of the individual defendants,who were said to be favored dealers.it was alleged that equilon gave preferential treatment to the favored dealers and made it difficult or impossible for appellants to compete through various practices,including predatory pricing,delayed payment for credit card sales,and failure to make promised station repairs and improvements.appellants sought relief under california unfair business practices and franchise laws,and for breach of contract,intentional interference,and fraud.
in april,a few months after the second amended complaint was filed,the court appointed a discovery referee.the charges and expenses of the referee were to be advanced by equilon.
equilon discovery requests 
on december,equilon served written discovery on appellants,including one set of interrogatories directed to jerry shell,dagher,parungao,ramirez,sislian,tinsal enterprises,sitara management corporation,hjf,kalfayan,buczkowski,bisharat enterprises,hani and vivian maksimous,ibarra,mina shell,and coast village,one set of interrogatories directed to abel and merhi one set of interrogatories directed to fairview shell autocare,one set of interrogatories directed to marquez and twin oaks one set of interrogatories directed at sheibani and one set of document requests directed to all appellants 
the document requests asked for,among other things,documents relevant to damages the price the responding party paid equilon for gasoline and allegations in the complaint pertaining to agency,predatory pricing,and favored dealers.there were also requests for profit and loss statements,documents referencing profit margins,and documents relating to any attempt to sell a franchise.the interrogatories asked for,among other things,specific facts that supported the allegations of the complaint,such as the allegations that equilon engaged in predatory pricing,delayed payment for credit card sales,and failed to make station repairs.the interrogatories also asked for identification of each appellant marketing area,each service station located in that marketing area,and every date when every dealer paid lower or higher tank wagon prices.
first motion to compel responses 
on february,counsel for equilon wrote to counsel for appellants inquiring about responses which by that time were long overdue.no reply was received.
on march,equilon filed a motion to compel responses to both the interrogatories and requests for production of documents no written opposition to the motion was filed on behalf of appellants.however,appellants counsel,nikki fong,took part in the telephonic hearing.
on may,the discovery referee granted the motion to compel and ordered appellants to serve responses to the interrogatories by june,to provide responses to the document requests by june,and to produce documents for inspection and copying by june.under the order,the responses were to be without objection.appellants were also ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of.
appellants responses and second motion to compel 
on june,fong asked permission of equilon counsel to serve responses to interrogatories,which had been due on june,on june.on june,however,no responses were served.
a second motion to compel was filed by equilon on june,no written opposition was filed on behalf of appellants,and this time appellants counsel did not appear at the hearing.the motion was granted by order dated july.appellants were ordered to serve responses by august.the court warned that if appellants do not comply with this order,the court will be inclined to grant terminating sanctions.an additional in monetary sanctions was awarded.
nine of the appellants served responses on july.the responses contained a general objection to providing information protected by the privilege or work product doctrine.there was also an objection raised to an interrogatory that asked each appellant to define his,her,or its marketing area based on vagueness and ambiguousness.in addition,as to certain interrogatories,the responses stated that the answer would require the preparation of a compilation or summary from voluminous documents already produced and referred equilon to those documents.two or three interrogatories were unanswered.to the interrogatory seeking information on the responding party competitors,a multipage list of business and governmental entities and their addresses was attached.most of the entities listed were not service stations or competitors of service stations.
by letter dated august,counsel for equilon protested to fong that the nine responding parties had raised general objections applicable to all responses and specific objections to certain interrogatories that they had failed to provide any response to certain interrogatories,and have provided incomplete responses to others that some of the responses were not or tailored to each individual plaintiff and that the response to the interrogatory asking for identification of every competing service station was clearly not made in good faith.equilon counsel received no response.
motion for terminating sanctions 
in september,equilon filed a motion for terminating sanctions or issue sanctions against appellants sislian,dagher,ramirez,parungao,tinsal enterprises,fairview shell autocare,marquez,abel,and parties who had responded to the interrogatories.the ground for this motion was that the responses provided by these parties were insufficient.in particular,equilon pointed to the objections raised,the failure to answer certain interrogatories,incomplete responses,and responses that were generic.the response to the interrogatory concerning competitors in particular was said to be in bad faith.
a separate motion for terminating sanctions was filed as to appellants twin oaks,sheibani,jerry shell,sitara management corporation,hjf,kalfayan,buczkowski,bisharat enterprises,hani and vivian maksimous,ibarra,mina shell,and coast village,with respect to these parties,the basis for the motion was that they had not provided any responses.
on october,further responses were submitted by all appellants,except twin oaks.among other things,these responses attempted to clarify each party competitors by highlighting certain businesses on the multipage list of entities.in addition,all but one of the interrogatories had been given a response.
on october,equilon served notice to the court that no opposition to the motion for sanctions had been received from appellants,and informed the court that supplemental responses which purport to address many although by no means,all of the deficiencies in the prior responses had been served.
the court held a hearing on the motion for sanctions in both the underlying case and the companion case,hansen equilon,nonpub.opn,on october.fong attended the hearing.with respect to hansen,the court stated its tentative view that terminating sanctions should be granted because plaintiff responses are inconsistent with deposition testimony of various plaintiffs.based on this,respondents in good faith could not have provided responses to written interrogatories.persistent refusal with an order of production is tantamount to admission.the disobedient party has no meritorious claim.fong interjected that she did not realize the hansen matter was on calendar for a motion for terminating sanctions.the court confirmed that the hearing was calendared for that day and that the tentative was the ruling.fong replied well,we did file an opposition.i do know that i can argue anything.
the court then turned to the underlying case jerry s shell,pretty much on the same vein court grants terminating sanctions.persistent refusal to comply with an order we have received any opposition,so terminating sanctions are granted.fong stated the only issue is,your honor,is that responses were provided last week but i know have to bring some other sort of motion to get that set aside.
the court written order granting terminating sanctions against appellants was dated october.
motion for relief from default 
on january,appellants brought a motion for relief from the order granting terminating sanctions pursuant to section b.fong prepared a declaration in which the following facts were set forth.she had been delegated by lead counsel,thomas bleau,the responsibility for conduct of the litigation,including preparing discovery responses.during an extended period in,she experienced several medical problems,including a severe drop in blood sugar due to diabetes causing her to be hospitalized on september a case of food poisoning that led to dehydration on september numerous trips to doctors during the period from september to october,to stabilize her blood sugar and complications arising from pregnancy during the latter part of the year.consequently,she reduced her time in the office and delegated responsibility for the discovery during that time frame to another attorney,gennady lebedev.
on october,when fong returned to work,she discovered that lebedev had not finalized responses.she started to prepare them assuming that lebedev was still working on opposing any motions brought by equilon for sanctions.on october,she discovered for the first time that no opposition to the motion for terminating sanctions had been filed.lebedev admitted to fong that he had not prepared an opposition,but that he hoped that the provision of responses would make said motion for terminating sanctions moot.
with respect to the list of competitors provided in response to an interrogatory,fong stated that her law clerk was supposed to have highlighted the stations that each responding party believed was a competitor,but had mistakenly served unhighlighted copies of the multipage list of entities.in addition,neither she nor her clerk had realized that some of the interrogatories were unanswered or left blank in the earlier responses 
fong also attempted to explain why the motion for relief from default had been filed so long after the order imposing terminating sanctions had been issued.according to her declaration,it was her intention to file this motion for relief no more than two weeks after the october,hearing.she had,however,suffered further complications from the diabetes and pregnancy,and suffered a miscarriage in december.consequently,she was unable to concentrate on work or any matters through the month.
equilon opposition 
in opposition to the motion for relief,equilon asked the court to take judicial notice of a declaration filed by fong in another litigation in which her firm client had suffered a default and relief had been sought under section b.in it,fong related a similar account of hospitalization due to drop in blood sugar levels and food poisoning,but provided different dates for those occurrences.for example,she stated that she collapsed in her office on july,and was taken to an emergency room where she was diagnosed with dehydration due to food poisoning.then she had to be given emergency medical treatment on august,when her blood sugar level dropped precipitously.she claimed to have been in the hospital on that occasion until august.from august to september,she said she had remained at home and did not conduct any business due to the extreme nausea associated with the prescriptions she was given to combat damage to her kidneys.from september to she remained at home while she underwent monitoring for her kidney problems.on september,she learned she was pregnant and was readmitted to the hospital until october,and did not return to work until november.
counsel for equilon stated in a declaration,that,contrary to these representations of being hospitalized for lengthy periods in august,september,and october,fong had been present at the following court proceedings a mediation on august,and september a telephonic discovery hearing on september and a status conference on august.in addition,counsel for equilon stated that she had attended depositions and made telephonic contact with opposing counsel,as well as sending numerous,letters,and pleadings on separate days during the period.
appellants reply 
in a supplemental declaration,fong stated that,although she had been ordered to bed rest,she remained at home and worked from there on equilon matters,including making telephone calls and sending letters,faxes,and.
the court denied the motion for relief from default.the court noted at the hearing that although appellants failed to file an opposition to the motion for terminating sanctions,the mandatory relief provision was not applicable because appellants counsel appeared and did not oppose the termination hearing,and appellants were not,therefore,deprived of an opportunity to address the issues.the court found that for some reason,tactical or whatever,counsel chose not to oppose the terminating sanctions.
turning to the discretionary relief provision,the court stated appellants have failed to show excusable neglect.the motion was not filed in a reasonable time.there no basis for discretionary relief.appellants have failed to satisfy the procedural requirements.appellants have not met the burden of proof as to mistake,inadvertence,or surprise,and have repeatedly refused court orders and refused discovery and have never complied with the previous discovery motions.
in its written order,dated february,the court further stated that fong declaration lacks credibility.
notice of appeal was filed march.
discussion 
preliminarily,we must determine the scope of the appeal.appellants notice designated both the february,order denying relief under section b and the october,order granting terminating sanctions.generally,a party who waits months to file a request for relief under section b,as appellants did here,lose their right to appeal from the underlying order.for example,in english ikon business solutions,th,d,appellant february,notice of appeal purported to appeal from the judgment granted on august,and the order rejecting the motion for section b relief on january.id.at,d.the court pointed out that under the rules,a notice of appeal from a judgment shall be filed on or before the earliest of the following dates days after the date of mailing by the clerk of the court of a document entitled notice of entry of judgment days after the date of service of a document entitled notice of entry of judgment by any party upon the party filing the notice of appeal,or by the party filing the notice of appeal or days after the date of entry of the judgment,quoting former cal.rules of court,rule a.the time may be extended under rule b by the filing of a motion to vacate judgment under section b.however,in order to extend the jurisdictional time for filing a notice of appeal,the motion to vacate or set aside itself must have been served and filed within either the normal time period for filing a notice of appeal under california rules of court,rule,or any shorter time period prescribed by applicable statute.ibid,quoting in re marriage of king th,d,italics omitted.in the case before it,notice of entry had been served.because appellant did not file her motion to vacate the judgment until two weeks after the deadline for filing a notice of appeal from the judgment,the time within which to appeal from the judgment itself was not extended.
here,we have no indication that a notice of entry was served following the court issuance of the october,order granting terminating sanctions.accordingly,the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was days after the date of entry of the order.the motion to vacate was filed within that period.there is,therefore,no timeliness problem with the notice of appeal as it relates to the october,sanction order.
there is,however,a waiver problem.in their opening brief,appellants state that the questions presented are w hether the trial court erred in failing to grant appellants relief under section b when appellants counsel submitted an affidavit attesting to her neglect and appellants motion was filed within the six month statutory deadline and w hether there was sufficient evidence submitted by equilon to establish that the dismissal entered in this case,from which appellants sought relief under section b was not the result of counsel error and neglect.neither of these issues relates to the october,order granting terminating sanctions.the brief contains a section heading entitled,there was no basis for granting terminating sanctions against appellants in this action.however,the argument under this section rehashes the evidence of attorney fault and concludes by stating i t was error for the trial court not to have applied the mandatory relief provisions of section it,thus,appears that appellants have waived any challenge to the substance of the order granting terminating sanctions.see tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d,fn.
nor do we see any substantive basis for reversing the order granting terminating sanctions.repeated failure to respond to discovery and to comply with court orders compelling discovery provides ample grounds for imposition of the ultimate sanction.see,mileikowsky tenet healthsystem th,d ruvalcaba government employees ins.d.appellants here failed to respond to discovery requests propounded on december,until october.in the interim,two court orders were disregarded,including a july order warning that terminating sanctions would be the next step.attempts by counsel for equilon to meet and confer to discuss discovery deficiencies were also ignored.the court is not required to have infinite patience in these situations.a party who is unwilling to,or whose counsel is incapable of,performing the obligations of litigation with diligence should not be surprised when the right to proceed is lost.
we now turn to the question of whether section b provides relief where counsel chooses not to respond to discovery in a timely fashion or to oppose a motion for terminating sanctions,and the case is dismissed.
section b has two parts.the first allows the trial court upon any terms as may be just,to relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.italics added.whether or not to grant this type of relief is discretionary with the court.superior court th,d.
the second part of section b provides notwithstanding any other requirements of this section,the court shall,whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,is in proper form,and is accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,vacate any resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client,and which will result in entry of a default judgment,or resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client,unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.this is often referred to as the mandatory provision because it is said that w here there is an attorney affidavit of fault,the relief is mandatory unless it is determined that the attorney was not actually the cause in re marriage of hock th,d accord,lorenz commercial acceptance ins.th,d.
as this court explained in yeap leake th,d yeap,in the original version,section b mandatory provision applied only to defaults or default judgments.id.at,d.the words or dismissal were added to the provision in at the behest of the state bar to give parity to plaintiffs whose attorneys neglect,surprise,or inadvertence caused them to lose the opportunity to pursue their cases.id.at,d.the bar had persuaded the legislature that it was illogical and arbitrary to allow mandatory relief for defendants when a default judgment has been entered against them due to defense counsel mistakes and to not provide comparable relief to plaintiffs whose cases are dismissed for the same reason,quoting assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
we noted at that time that because dismissal is a much broader concept than default,courts find themselves wrestl ing with the question of whether to apply section to specific types of dismissals.ibid.we were clear in our view that the amendment was not written to cover every situation where dismissal occurs due to attorney misfeasance and section relief is sought and that the provision should be applied only where the dismissal occurs under circumstances similar to a default.id.at,d.we expressed our general concurrence with the court in peltier mccloud river th,d,wherein it was said under our reading of amended section,a plaintiff seeking relief is granted comparable relief to that obtained by a defaulting defendant.thus,a default judgment is entered when a defendant fails to appear,and,under section,relief is afforded where the failure to appear is the fault of counsel.similarly,under our view of the statute,a dismissal may be entered where plaintiff fails to appear in opposition to a dismissal motion,and relief is afforded where that failure to appear is the fault of counsel.the relief afforded to a dismissed plaintiff by our reading of the statute is therefore comparable to the relief afforded a defaulting defendant.
in yeap,we went on to hold,in a split decision,that plaintiff counsel failure to calendar an arbitration hearing combined with failure to request a trial de novo,resulting in a zero award,triggered the mandatory provision of section b.the majority concluded that the attorney actions resulted in a type of dismissal that was analogous to a default.th at,d.our position was supported by the decision in avila chua th,d,wherein the court held that the mandatory provision applied where dismissal was entered after the court struck plaintiff opposition to defendant motion for summary judgment and entered judgment for defendant.justice epstein in his dissent took a narrower view of the meaning of dismissal under the statute i n the context of pleadings and motions,a dismissal is the withdrawal of an application for judicial relief by the party seeking such relief,or the removal of the application by a court the dismissal provision was added to the mandatory portion of code of civil procedure section to give plaintiffs the functional equivalent of the default provision for defendants a remedy when a case is dismissed for failure to file a charging pleading or an answer there was no dismissal in this case.yeap,supra,at,d.justice epstein agreed that the majority was supported by the rationale in avila chua,but believed that that case suffered from the same deficiency there was neither a default nor a dismissal in avila,and to read the mandatory provision of code of civil procedure section to apply whenever a party loses his or her day in court due to attorney error goes far beyond anything the legislature has done.yeap,supra,at,d.
our decision in yeap was followed in in re marriage of hock,supra,where the court held that failure to appear on the date scheduled for trial due to new counsel unawareness of the trial date required the judgment entered to be vacated.th at,d.
more recently,however,justice epstein reasoning has found favor with courts that have similarly concluded that an overly expansive interpretation of the term dismissal should be avoided.in english ikon business solutions,supra,th,d,for example,counsel for plaintiff failed to oppose a summary judgment motion on the substance,but based the opposition solely on the need to conduct further discovery.after judgment was entered for defendant,counsel filed a motion under section b,stating in a declaration th
