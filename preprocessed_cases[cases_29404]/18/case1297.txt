relevant factual and procedural background 
wolf metals complaint,filed december,asserted claims for open book account,account stated,and breach of contract against rps.the complaint alleged that from march to august,wolf metals sold sheet metal to rps pursuant to an oral agreement.the complaint further alleged that rps owed wolf metals the sum of,which rps had failed to pay despite wolf metals demand.in february,rps answered the complaint.
in june,rps filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy protection et.the petition was executed by koh as rps president.as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding,the underlying action was stayed.in the course of the bankruptcy proceeding,wolf metals asserted a claim for as an unsecured creditor on the basis of g oods sold.koh and sgs also asserted claims as unsecured creditors.on july,the bankruptcy court ordered the case closed.in connection with that order,the docket for the bankruptcy proceeding states,no discharge.capitalization omitted.

rps did not satisfy the judgment.in december,in an effort to enforce the judgment,wolf metals arranged for a judgment debtor examination of koh and his wife,who is rps secretary and treasurer.after initially refusing to answer questions,they were examined and excused.later,when wolf metals propounded discovery seeking rps records,koh replied that he had none,stating that all such documents had been transferred to the bankruptcy trustee or discarded.in september,wolf metals filed motions to compel responses to its special interrogatories and request for the production of documents.the trial court granted the motions and issued an award of sanctions against rps totaling.in january,wolf metals conducted a second judgment debtor examination of koh.

discussion 
koh and sgs contend the trial court erred in amending the default judgment to include them as judgment debtors.for the reasons discussed below,we agree that under controlling authority koh was improperly named a judgment debtor on an alter ego theory,but conclude that sgs was properly named as a judgment debtor as rps successor corporation.
governing principles 
under code of civil procedure section,the trial court has jurisdiction to modify a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.mcclellan,supra,th at.the decision to modify the judgment is consigned to the trial court discretion.greenspan ladt llc th.to the extent the exercise of that discretion relies on factual findings,we review those findings for the existence of substantial evidence.mcclellan,supra,th at.
addition of judgment debtor as alter ego 
modification of a judgment may be proper when the defendant is an existing defendant alter ego.mcclellan,supra,th at.under the alter ego doctrine,when the corporate form is used to perpetrate a fraud,circumvent a statute,or accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose,the courts will ignore the corporate entity and deem the corporation acts to be those of the persons actually controlling the corporation,in most instances the equitable owners.citations.the alter ego doctrine prevents individuals from misusing the corporate laws by the device of a sham corporate entity formed for the purpose of committing fraud or other misdeeds.citation.sonora diamond superior court th.
in the case of default judgments,the application of the alter ego doctrine is subject to a limitation arising from considerations of due process.under code of civil procedure section,to amend a judgment to add a defendant,thereby imposing liability on the new defendant without trial,requires both that the new party be the alter ego of the old party and that the new party controlled the litigation,thereby having had the opportunity to litigate,in order to satisfy due process concerns.the due process considerations are in addition to,not in lieu of,the threshold alter ego issues.triplett farmers ins.exchange th.
the due requirement was first recognized by our supreme court in motores,supra,cal d.there,three individuals formed a corporation that engaged in the sale of used cars.id.at.when the plaintiff sued the corporation for failure to pay some loans,neither the corporation nor the individuals operating it appeared in the action,and a default judgment was entered against the corporation.ibid.when the plaintiff sought to modify the default judgment to include the three individuals as judgment debtors on an alter ego theory,the trial court declined to do so.id.at.affirming that ruling,the court concluded that the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution precluded the modification,stating that constitutional provision guarantees that any person against whom a claim is asserted in a judicial proceeding shall have the opportunity to be heard and to present his defenses.citations.to summarily add the three individuals to the judgment heretofore running only against the corporation without allowing them to litigate any questions beyond their relation to the allegedly alter ego corporation would patently violate this constitutional safeguard.they were under no duty to appear and defend personally in that action,since no claim had been made against them personally.motores,supra,at.
in nec electronics,hurt d,nec electronics,the appellate court reached a similar conclusion,even though the pertinent judgment arose from the corporate defendant failure to litigate its defenses at trial,rather than from a default.when the plaintiff sued the corporation for nonpayment of purchased goods,the corporation filed a general denial.id.at.prior to trial,the corporation chief executive officer who was also its sole shareholder discussed the corporation potential bankruptcy and reorganization with the plaintiff.ibid.shortly before trial,the corporation gave notice that it would not appear.id.at.after the plaintiff presented its evidence at trial,a judgment was entered in its favor against the corporation,which filed a bankruptcy petition.id.at.later,after the bankruptcy proceeding closed,the trial court granted the plaintiff petition to add the corporation chief executive officer as a judgment debtor,reasoning that he knew of the lawsuit and was involved in the corporation decisions regarding it.ibid.relying on motores,the appellate court reversed,concluding that the chief executive officer neither shared the corporation interests nor controlled its defense.id.at.the court remarked there was no defense for him to control.after the corporation filed its general denial,no further proceedings were conducted.id.at.
addition of judgment debtor as successor corporation 
modification of a judgment may also be proper under the successor corporation theory.mcclellan,supra,th at,italics omitted.according to that theory,when a corporation sells or transfers all of its assets to another corporation constituting its mere continuation,the latter is also liable for the former debts and liabilities.id.at,fn,quoting ray alad cal d.generally,california decisions holding that a corporation acquiring the assets of another corporation is the latter mere continuation and therefore liable for its debts have imposed such liability only upon a showing of one or both of the following factual elements no adequate consideration was given for the predecessor corporation assets and made available for meeting the claims of its unsecured creditors one or more persons were officers,directors,or stockholders of both corporations.citations.mcclellan,supra,th at,fn,quoting ray,supra,cal d at.
in view of the nexus between a corporation and a second corporation constituting its mere continuation,when a judgment is entered against the former due to a failure to present a defense,the judgment may be modified to name the latter as an additional judgment debtor without contravening due process.mcclellan,supra,th at,fn.in mcclellan,a corporation hired a contractor to repair its condominium complex.id.at.after the corporation did not pay for the services,the contractor initiated an arbitration proceeding against it.ibid.when the corporation failed to appear at the arbitration,the arbitrator issued a default award,and the contractor filed a petition for a judgment confirming the award.ibid.shortly before that judgment was entered,the corporation board of directors caused the creation of a new corporation and transferred the condominium complex to it.id.at.later,the trial court granted the contractor request to modify the judgment to include the new corporation as a judgment debtor,finding that it was the original corporation successor.id.at.
affirming,the appellate court concluded that the new corporation was the original corporation mere continuation.mcclellan,supra,th at.in so concluding,the court observed that both corporations shared the same board,which had transferred the condominium complex in contravention of the applicable covenants,conditions,and restrictions,and never dissolved the original corporation.mcclellan,supra,th at.the court rejected a contention under nec electronics that the new corporation lacked the opportunity to litigate in the underlying action,stating the new corporation is a mere continuation of the original corporation under a different name.therefore,the new corporation can not be heard to complain that because it did not exist at the time the arbitration award was entered,its interests were not represented in the underlying action.id.at.
underlying proceedings 
at the january judgment debtor examination,koh testified as rps president.according to koh,rps board of directors consisted of koh and his wife,who also served as rps secretary and treasurer.the sole shareholder was a koh family trust.rps engaged in s teel purchase and sales,that is,it bought steel coil from suppliers,including wolf metals,cut the coil,and then sold it as a finished product.rps always conducted its operations at a single location,and had to employees.
koh also operated sgs.as with rps,koh wife acted as sgs secretary and treasurer.while rps was active,sgs supplied steel to rps and cut the steel for rps.koh denied that sgs engaged in the same business as rps.
in the course of rps operations,koh and rps made loans to each other.at some point,rps secured a loan from koh,and discharged the loan by transferring equipment valued at to him.according to koh,no document expressly established the existence of the loan.he further testified that he had no records for rps because they had been discarded or transferred to the bankruptcy trustee.
in,upon initiating bankruptcy proceedings,rps stopped doing business and sold its remaining inventory.during the proceedings,sgs asserted an unsuccessful claim for as an unsecured creditor.
after the bankruptcy closed,rps never resumed operations.koh described its current status as n othing because it had filed no tax returns for several years.he further stated that because rps had been thrown away,sgs had taken possession of rps remaining furniture and other items,which he described as abandoned.when asked whether sgs employed any of rps employees,koh replied,yes.koh testified that rps would neither satisfy the judgment nor pay the sanctions owed to wolf metals,stating that rps was no longer there and that he was not rps anymore.
following the january judgment debtor examination,wolf metals filed its motion to amend the default judgment,contending that koh and sgs were rps alter egos and that sgs was a mere continuation of rps.in addition to koh testimony at the january examination,wolf metals submitted evidence that sgs was engaged in the same business as rps at its former location,and that koh was the agent for service of both entities.wolf metals showing included photos of rps building in and photos of the same building in,which then served as sgs business location.in,the building front sign displayed rps name,two phone numbers,and the following description of its services specialist on narrow cut slit coils max capacities thick to width round edged flat bars coils.in,when sgs occupied the building,rps name was absent,but the building front sign was otherwise unchanged,and advertised the same services.wolf metals also submitted an image of sgs web site as it appeared in.the description of sgs services on the web site closely tracked the advertisement on the building front sign.
appellants opposition neither disputed wolf metals evidentiary showing nor offered new evidence.in addition to contending that the proposed amendments were improper under motores and nec electronics,appellants argued that wolf metals failed to act with due diligence in seeking the amendments.
in granting the motion to amend the default judgment,the trial court found that koh and sgs were rps alter egos and that sgs was rps successor.the court rejected appellants contention that wolf metals had failed to act with due diligence,stating that rps did not respond to the discovery propounded by wolf metals,which learned of the extent to which sgs stepped into the shoes of rps at the january debtor examination.
as explained below,we conclude that under motores,koh was improperly added as a judgment debtor on an alter ego theory,and that sgs was properly added as a judgment debtor as a mere continuation of rps.
no discharge in the bankruptcy proceeding 
at the threshold,we examine appellants contention that the trial court ruling contravenes a determination by the bankruptcy trustee and the bankruptcy court.appellants rely on the bankruptcy trustee final report prior to the closing of the bankruptcy proceeding,which states i have made a diligent inquiry into the financial affairs of the debtor rps.t here is no property available for distribution from the estate over and above that exempted by law.i hereby certify that the estate of the debtor s has been fully administered.claims scheduled to be discharged without payment.notwithstanding the entry in the bankruptcy court docket reflecting that the proceeding closed with no discharge,appellants argue that the trustee report establishes the existence of a ruling that wolf metals claims against rps were to be discharged without payment.underlining omitted.
appellants contention fails,as no such ruling is available in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding.section a of title of the united states code expressly states the court shall grant the debtor a discharge unless the debtor is not an individual.thus,a corporation may not discharge its debts and liabilities in a chapter proceeding.better.supply cir.
