on june,comedy club,and al copeland investments,collectively cci executed a trademark license agreement trademark agreement with improv west associates improv west that granted cci an exclusive nationwide license to use improv west trademarks.a few years later,cci breached the agreement and sought to protect its interests in the trademarks in federal district court by filing a declaratory judgment action.after a complex procedural history,the parties were left with an arbitration award and two district court orders,one order compelling the parties to arbitrate,and another order confirming the arbitration award.cci appealed both district court orders.we have jurisdiction under.
in a prior opinion,published at,we determined that we lacked jurisdiction to review the district court order compelling arbitration.we affirmed in part and vacated in part the district court order confirming the arbitration award.the supreme court vacated that opinion and remanded this case to us for reconsideration in light of hall street associates mattel,d.we determine that hall street associates does not undermine our prior precedent,kyocera,cir en banc.as a result,in this circuit,an arbitrator manifest disregard of the law remains a valid ground for vacatur of an arbitration award under a of the federal arbitration act.therefore,we adhere to the outcome in our prior decision.
improv west is the founder of the improv comedy club and the creator and owner of the improv and improvisation trademarks improv marks.cci owns and operates restaurants and comedy clubs nationwide.on june,cci and improv west entered a trademark agreement that provided,inter alia that improv west granted cci an exclusive nationwide license to use the improv marks in connection with the opening of new comedy clubs that,according to a development schedule,cci was to open four improv clubs a year in through and that cci was prohibited from opening any comedy clubs during the term of the trademark agreement the trademark agreement also had an arbitration clause 
all disputes relating to or arising under this agreement or the asset purchase agreement shall be resolved by arbitration in los angeles,california in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.in any such arbitration,the parties shall be entitled to discovery in the same manner as if the dispute was being litigated in los angeles superior court.notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate,the parties,in addition to arbitration,shall be entitled to pursue equitable remedies and agree that the state and federal courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction for such purpose and for the purpose of compelling arbitration enforcing any arbitration award.the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts and agree that service of process in any such action may be made by certified mail.the prevailing party in any arbitration or action to enforce this agreement or the asset purchase agreement shall be entitled to its costs,including reasonable attorneys fees.
cci concedes that it failed to open eight improv clubs by and that it was in default of amended.of the trademark agreement.consistent with improv west sole remedy,as stated in.improv west sent cci a letter asserting that cci was in default of the trademark agreement,withdrawing cci license to use the improv marks and rights to open more improv clubs,and informing cci that improv west intended to begin opening its own improv clubs.
in response to improv west letter,cci filed a complaint in federal district court seeking declaratory relief.cci complaint sought a declaration that the covenant that cci could not open any comedy clubs was void under california business and professions code cbpc,and that cci failure to meet the development schedule did not revoke cci license to the improv marks or right to open improv clubs.improv west then filed a demand for arbitration seeking damages 
on august,the district court ordered the parties to arbitrate their dispute.cci did not appeal that order until may.
on february,the arbitrator entered a partial final arbitration award that stated that cci defaulted on the trademark agreement by failing to adhere to the development schedule listed in amended.that cci forfeited its rights to open improv clubs and its use of the improv marks license in connection with any clubs not open or under construction as of october,that improv west could open or license to third parties new improv clubs that.of the trademark agreement was a valid and enforceable covenant not to compete and remained valid for the remaining term of the agreement that cci and its affiliates were enjoined from opening or operating any other comedy clubs other than those open or under construction as of october,for the duration of the trademark agreement that neither cci nor its affiliates could change the name on any of its current clubs and that improv west was entitled to attorneys fees and costs.on april,the district court confirmed the partial award.cci timely appealed,tendering to us the issues addressed in this opinion 
in an opinion filed on september,and amended on january,we held that we did not have jurisdiction to review the district court order compelling the parties to arbitrate that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by arbitrating the equitable claims that the arbitrator did exceed his authority by issuing permanent injunctions that enjoined relatives who were not parties to the agreement that the arbitrator award was not completely irrational and that the arbitrator enforcement of the covenant not to compete was a manifest disregard for the law.the supreme court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari,vacated our prior opinion,and remanded this case to us to reconsider our decision in light of hall street associates mattel.
both parties agree that this remand only affects the portion of the prior opinion in which we found the arbitrator acted with a manifest disregard of the law.therefore,we continue to hold that we do not have jurisdiction over the district court order compelling arbitration.we also determine that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority when he arbitrated the equitable claims,but that he exceeded his authority regarding the permanent injunction that enjoined to the agreement.we also decide that the arbitrator award was not completely irrational.finally,addressing the issue raised by the supreme court remand,we conclude that hall street associates did not undermine the manifest disregard of law ground for vacatur,as understood in this circuit to be a violation of a of the federal arbitration act,and that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law.
cci first argues that the district court erred when it issued its order compelling the parties to arbitrate.improv west in turn contends that we lack jurisdiction over this issue because cci appeal of the district court order compelling arbitration is untimely.
the district court order compelling the parties to arbitrate dismissed cci claims when it sent the parties to arbitration.because the district court order dismissed cci claims,it is a final order.see green tree fin.randolph,d holding that a district court order dismissing the plaintiffs claims and compelling arbitration was a final decision because the order end ed the litigation on the merits and le ft nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment internal quotation marks omitted see also a an appeal may be taken from a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.a prac.cmt.instructing that subdivision a makes appealable a district court determination compelling arbitration that is a final decision bushley credit suisse first boston,cir adopting the principle that a dismissal renders an order appealable under a citation omitted.
a and federal rule of appellate procedure a require that a notice of appeal be filed in a civil case within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a.because the district court did not enter judgment on the order to compel arbitration,cci had days to appeal the order.see fed.a a ii see also bowles russell,d stating that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional internal quotation marks omitted.
cci filed its first notice of appeal of the district court order compelling arbitration on may,days after the order was entered on august.this is well beyond the days allowed by federal rule of appellate procedure a a ii.cci appeal of the district court order compelling arbitration is untimely,and we lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal of that issue.
we next consider cci contention that the district court erred by confirming the arbitration award.we review a district court confirmation of an arbitration award de novo.see first options of,kaplan,d.cci presents four arguments that the arbitrator lacked authority to arbitrate the equitable claims that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority by issuing two permanent injunctions that the arbitrator award is irrational and that the arbitrator award violates cbpc.we address each argument in turn.
cci submits that the arbitrator lacked authority to arbitrate because the arbitration clause in the trademark agreement grants state and federal courts an exclusive jurisdiction over equitable claims.we review the validity and scope of an arbitration clause de novo.see moore local of int l of workers,cir.
it is well established that where the contract contains an arbitration clause,there is a presumption of arbitrability.at t,commc ns workers of,d.a n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.see also three valleys mun.water dist.hutton,cir under the federal arbitration act any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
it is also well established that w hen deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options,at.only disputes that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration should be arbitrated.id.at.see also republic of nicar.standard fruit,cir stating that t he scope of the arbitration clause must be interpreted liberally.
under california contract law,if the language of a contract is clear and explicit,and does not involve an absurdity the language must govern the contract interpretation.cal.moreover,when a contract is written,the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone,if possible.cal.i f reasonably practicable a contract must be interpreted as a whole,so as to give effect to every part,each clause helping to interpret the other.cal.see also in re affordable hous.dev,cir.bap california law provides that one phrase of a contract should not be interpreted so as to render another phrase of the contract meaningless.however,i f a contract is capable of two different reasonable interpretations,the contract is ambiguous,oceanside,fid.fed.bank,th,d,and under the federal presumption in favor of arbitration,an arbitrator would have jurisdiction to arbitrate claims.see at t,at.three valleys,at.
applying these principles,we conclude that the trademark agreement arbitration clause grants the arbitrator authority over all disputes arising from the trademark agreement.there are three relevant clauses in the arbitration agreement a ll disputes relating to or arising under this agreement shall be resolved by arbitration n otwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate,the parties,in addition to arbitration,shall be entitled to pursue equitable remedies and agree that the state and federal courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction for such purpose and for the purpose of compelling arbitration enforcing any arbitration award and t he prevailing party in any arbitration or action to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to its costs,including reasonable attorneys fees.
cci contends that clause two is explicit that only state and federal courts,and not an arbitrator,have jurisdiction over equitable claims.improv west counters that the second clause only carved out equitable claims in aid of arbitration to maintain the status quo between the parties pending arbitration,and that the second clause did not supplant the arbitrator authority to decide all disputes under the trademark agreement.
a natural reading of clause two lends plausibility to improv west theory.the language in addition to arbitration in clause two suggests that arbitration still applies to all disputes,but that in addition,the parties are entitled to pursue equitable remedies before courts.if the parties intended to carve out an exception to arbitration for all equitable claims,they could have done so without the language in addition to arbitration.because the parties included this language,it is plausible and a permissible contract interpretation that the equitable claims exception in clause two was intended to apply only to claims designed to maintain the status quo between the parties.stated another way,it was a rational interpretation of the agreement to say that the arbitrator could decide both equitable and legal claims and that the provision for court jurisdiction on equitable matters was ancillary to the arbitration.moreover,the federal arbitration act,provides a court with the ability to stay trial of an action until such arbitration has been had,but it does not give a court the authority to issue equitable remedies,such as a temporary injunction,to maintain the status quo between the parties.thus,it makes sense that if the parties wanted to give themselves the ability to seek temporary equitable remedies in courts while arbitration was ongoing,they would add such a clause to the arbitration agreement.
to support its interpretation,cci cites language in clause three that awards costs and attorneys fees to the prevailing party in any arbitration or action to enforce this agreement,and phrasing in clause two that grants exclusive jurisdiction to courts for the purpose of equitable remedies.these phrases,although consistent with cci reading of the arbitration agreement,are equally consistent with improv west interpretation.these phrases can support that the arbitration agreement lets the parties pursue equitable remedies in courts in aid of the arbitration,and gives those courts exclusive jurisdiction over,and awards costs and attorneys fees to the prevailing party in,those actions.
we conclude that the arbitration agreement is capable of two different reasonable interpretations.oceanside,th at,d.under the federal presumption in favor of arbitration,because the arbitration agreement is ambiguous,it should be interpreted as granting arbitration coverage over all disputes arising from the trademark agreement.see at t,at.three valleys,at.we hold that the arbitration agreement gave the arbitrator authority over all disputes,equitable and legal,and that he did not exceed his authority by arbitrating equitable claims.
we next address cci argument that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority in issuing two permanent injunctions,which would provide grounds to vacate the arbitration award.see coutee barington capital group,cir a.
in his partial arbitration award,the arbitrator enjoined cci and its affiliates from opening or operating any other comedy clubs other than those open or under construction as of october,for the duration of the trademark agreement and enjoined cci and its affiliates from changing the name on any of their current clubs until the trademark agreement ended.cci argues that because the trademark agreement defines affiliates to include family members,family members of shareholders,all collateral relatives former spouses,and all collateral relatives of former spouses,the permanent injunctions attempt to bind persons beyond the scope of the arbitrator authority we agree.
a contract may bind such as an intended third party beneficiary,an agent,or an assignee.see benasra marciano,th,d.but generally arbitration clauses and contracts do not bind in the absence of such extraordinary relationships.as explained in buckner tamarin,th,d the strong public policy in favor of arbitration does not extend to those who are not parties to an arbitration agreement id.at,d internal quotation marks omitted see also norcal mut.ins.newton,th,d the common thread is the existence of an agency or similar relationship between the nonsignatory and one of the parties to the arbitration agreement.in the absence of such a relationship,courts have refused to hold nonsignatories to arbitration agreements.
here,the arbitrator injunctions,relying on the trademark agreement definition of affiliate,seek to prevent people such as cousins of former spouses of cci partners from opening or operating any comedy club within the united states until.these collateral relatives are not in privity with the trademark agreement signatories,or with cci shareholders,partners,or persons.as an example,it is not reasonable to preclude from gainful competition in the comedy club sphere relatives of of the cci principals who were not in an agency relationship with those principals.similarly,the arbitrator did not have authority to enjoin a grandmother of a cci partner from opening a restaurant with live stand up comedy performance until the year.under california law,the arbitrator lacked the authority to enjoin these from owning or operating businesses or restaurants.
improv west contends that federal rule of civil procedure d rule d establishes that an injunction may bind not only parties to the action but also their officers,agents,servants,employees,and attorneys,and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them.d.however,the wholesale inclusion of relatives as affiliates in the trademark agreement covenant not to compete,and the injunctions in the arbitrator partial award,go well beyond binding cci agents,employees,or people in active concert or participation with it as rule d permits.indeed,as mentioned above,by its own terms,reaches beyond persons with an agency or assignee relationship with cci partners,and literally purports to bind a cci person and his cousins,nephews,uncles,and aunts.the text of rule d is exclusive,stating that an injunction can permissibly bind only those persons listed in rule d.rule d does not list collateral relatives of former spouses,or even grandparents,as potential who may be bound by a contract or an arbitration award.and we do not think it is a proper use of equitable power to restrain all such persons.
moreover,precluding relatives or from opening or operating businesses or restaurants violates cbpc.cbpc provides,in relevant part,that every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business of any kind is to that extent void.id.this is a codification of the general rule in california that covenants not to compete are void.hill med.wycoff,th,d.by restricting relatives and from engaging in a lawful business,the injunctions,with respect to those persons,exceed the arbitrator authority.
we conclude that the arbitrator acted beyond the scope of his authority as a matter of california law in attempting to bind all of cci affiliates,including relatives who were not parties to the trademark agreement,and thus could not be bound by its provisions.if an arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority in issuing an award,and that award is divisible,we may vacate part of the award and leave the remainder in force.see lyle rodgers,wheat.marshall,stating that an award may be void in part,and good for the residue barington capital,at a federal court may vacate an arbitration award,or a portion thereof,if the arbitrators acted beyond their authority.we therefore conclude that the district court should vacate the arbitration award insofar as it enjoins any of cci affiliates who are not connected to the principals of cci as,by analogy to rule d,their officers,agents,servants,employees,and attorneys,and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them.we hold that a narrowing of the restrictive covenant on affiliates is required by cbpc and the principle that generally are not bound in arbitration.such can only be restrained to the extent permitted by rule d.
cci next contends that the partial arbitration award is irrational because it simultaneously revokes cci license to open improv clubs and prevents cci from opening or operating any other comedy clubs anywhere in the united states until or the termination of the trademark agreement.
review of an arbitration award is both limited and highly deferential and the arbitration award may be vacated only if it is completely irrational or constitutes manifest disregard of the law.poweragent data,cir quoting barington capital,at.we have not elaborated on what completely irrational means,but the eighth circuit has persuasively indicated that the completely irrational standard is extremely narrow and is satisfied only where the arbitration decision fails to draw its essence from the agreement.hoffman cargill,cir.this is a view that we adopt.
under the partial arbitration award,cci lost its exclusive right to open and operate any new improv clubs using improv west license.and because the arbitrator found the.covenant not to compete of the trademark agreement valid,cci also lost the right to open and operate any other new comedy clubs or restaurants under any other license or name anywhere in the contiguous united states as long as the trademark agreement remained in effect.thus,apart from allowing cci to continue to operate the handful of improv clubs that it had already opened or purchased,see supra note,the arbitrator ruling put cci out of the comedy club business.
cci argues that if it has lost all licensing rights,then there is no longer any licensing agreement.both parties agree that if the trademark agreement is no longer in effect then the.covenant not to compete similarly would no longer be in effect,and the arbitrator award would be considered irrational.
however,as improv west correctly asserts,improv west did not cancel the trademark agreement,neither party sought to terminate the trademark agreement as part of the underlying actions,and nothing in the parties submissions,the arbitrator rulings,or the district court orders suggest that the trademark agreement was cancelled.instead,cci was still bound under other sections of the trademark agreement to pay improv west royalties on the seven improv clubs it still operated at the conclusion of the arbitration.
a breach by a party to a contract does not in itself cancel the contract cancellation of a contract occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other.see bernard witkin,summary of california law ed internal quotation marks omitted see also restatement second of contracts arthur linton corbin,corbin on contracts ed.
at the time of arbitration,improv west had not cancelled,nor had the parties terminated,the contract.in the arbitration improv west did not seek to terminate the contract.by the arbitrator own award,the arbitrator did not modify the party contractual relationship,including the required payment of royalties,on the seven improv clubs that cci had opened or bought and was running.further,per the arbitrator award,the covenant not to compete ends when the trademark agreement ends.cci will then be able to open up other clubs.
cci entered into the trademark agreement with knowledge that there would be consequences if it defaulted on the development schedule in.of the trademark agreement.an arbitrator could rationally decide that the.covenant not to compete was valid to some degree,while at the same time upholding improv west remedy to end cci exclusive license rights to open other improv clubs.
the basic outline of what the arbitrator did,terminating an exclusive right to open improv clubs nationwide,because of contractually inadequate performance contrary to the agreed schedule,while keeping in force the restrictive covenant makes sense in so far as cci should not have an exclusive license on improv clubs absent complying with designated performance.and so long as cci was running some improv clubs,a restrictive covenant to some degree could protect improv west from damage caused by improper competition.because we can not say that there is no basis in the record for the arbitrator decision,we hold that the arbitrator award is not completely irrational.see nf m,at.
finally,we address cci claim that the partial arbitration award should be vacated because it is in violation of cbpc.cci argues that the arbitrator validation of.is in manifest disregard of the law.improv west counters that after the recent supreme court case,hall street associates,d,manifest disregard of the law is not a valid ground for vacatur.in hall street associates,the supreme court held that the faa provided exclusive grounds to modify or vacate an arbitration award.id.at.improv west argues that manifest disregard of the law is not among the statutory grounds for vacatur,and therefore we must amend our prior opinion that vacated this part of the arbitrator award for that reason.
we have already determined that the manifest disregard ground for vacatur is shorthand for a statutory ground under the faa,specifically a,which states that the court may vacate where the arbitrators exceeded their powers.kyocera t,cir en banc holding that arbitrators exceed their powers when the award is completely irrational,or exhibits a manifest disregard of law citations omitted.the supreme court did not reach the question of whether the manifest disregard of the law doctrine fits within or of the faa.hall street associates.at.instead,it listed several possible readings of the doctrine,including our own.id.or,as some courts have thought,manifest disregard may have been shorthand for a or a,the subsections authorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct or exceeded their powers.citing kyocera,at.we can not say that hall street associates is clearly irreconcilable with kyocera and thus we are bound by our prior precedent.see miller gammie,cir en banc.therefore,we conclude that,after hall street associates,manifest disregard of the law remains a valid ground for vacatur because it is a part of a.we note that we join the second circuit in this interpretation of hall street associates.transportation,cir.but see ups,cir.
we have stated that for an arbitrator award to be in manifest disregard of the law,i t must be clear from the record that the arbitrator recognized the applicable law and then ignored it.mut.ins.unigard sec.ins,cir.
under cbpc,it is well established that broad covenants not to compete are void unless they involve a situation where a person sells the goodwill of a business or where a partner agrees not to compete in anticipation of dissolution of a partnership,see kelton stravinski,th,d,cbpc,or they are necessary to protect trade secrets.whyte schlage lock,th,d.neither party alleges any of the above exceptions apply in this case.
the majority of cases interpreting cbpc under california law deal with or covenants not to compete.see,whyte schlage lock,th at,d thompson impaxx,th,d.in this case,the trademark agreement has not been terminated or canceled rather the contractual relationship between cci and improv west is ongoing and.can be viewed as an covenant not to compete 
we have not found,and the parties do not cite,any ninth circuit or california cases holding that covenants not to compete of any scope are necessarily valid.there are,however,cases addressing covenants not to compete,and we discuss several of those cases here because of the limitations that we believe they impose under,even in the context of a continuing covenant not to compete.
most significant to our analysis is dayton time lock service,silent watchman,d,in which the california court of appeal,addressed an exclusive dealing clause in a franchise agreement.id.at.the exclusive dealing clause provided in part that during the life of this contract,dayton time lock service,dtls will not sell or lease any locks,devices or service of any kind in competition with the business of silent watchman sw,or use any time recording lock not supplied by sw under this agreement.id.dtls argued that this provision,along with a separate postfranchise covenant not to compete,violated state and federal antitrust laws.id.the california court of appeal first noted that sw conceded that the covenant not to compete violated the state antitrust law cbpc.id.next,the court specifically addressed whether the covenant not to compete was valid.in this context,the court held that e contracts are not necessarily invalid,but t hey are proscribed when it is probable that performance of the contract will foreclose competition in a substantial share of the affected line of commerce.id.in doing so,dayton time lock imposed the standards analogous unto federal antitrust law when interpreting.see id.citing standard oil united states.
in kelton stravinski,the california court of appeal addressed another covenant not to compete,this time in a partnership context.th at,d the court held that even though the covenant not to compete was during an ongoing business relationship,it violated cbpc and was unenforceable.kelton,th at,d.the court in kelton limited dayton time lock to franchise agreements.however,in stressing cbpc strong policy against agreements,the court reaffirmed that in the franchise context,prohibits an covenant not to compete that will foreclose competition in a substantial share of the affected line of commerce.kelton,th at,d.
dayton time lock and kelton make evident that under cbpc an covenant not to compete in a agreement will be void if it foreclose s competition in a substantial share of a business,trade,or market.dayton time lock,d at.kelton,th at,d.also,california courts are less willing to approve covenants not to compete outside a franchise context because there is not a need to protect and maintain the franchisor trademark,trade name and goodwill.kelton,th at,d.keeping in mind these settled principles of california law that were set forth in dayton time lock and reaffirmed by kelton,which principles were expressly before the arbitrator,we proceed to evaluate whether the arbitrator decision was in manifest disregard of the law.
cci business is operating comedy clubs.cci currently operates at least seven improv clubs.see supra note.as interpreted by the arbitrator,the.covenant not to compete applies geographically to the contiguous united states,and does not end until.thus,the covenant not to compete has dramatic geographic and temporal scope.combined with the arbitrator ruling that cci forfeited its rights to use the improv marks license in any new location,the practical effect of the arbitrator award enforcing.is that for more than fourteen years the entire contiguous united states comedy club market,except for cci current improv clubs,is off limits to cci.this foreclose s competition in a substantial share of the comedy club business.dayton time lock,d at.see also commercial,at reasoning that a contract can not place a substantial segment of the market off limits.
in ruling on cci motion for reconsideration the arbitrator reasoned as follows 
dayton time lock is inapplicable.that case involved an attack on an exclusive dealing contract under the antitrust laws.the cases cited in the portion of the dayton opinion involved validity of exclusive dealing contracts under the federal sherman act.the type of rule of reason analysis applied in antitrust the determination whether a particular agreement unreasonably restricts competition generally in a defined geographic and product not applicable to a determination of illegality under section.california antitrust statute,the cartwright act,is separate and distinct from of the business professions code.
the arbitrator award,while aware of dayton time lock,interpreted it in a way to render it inapplicable to this case.however,as we have explained,dayton time lock established that under cbpc covenants not to compete can not prevent a party from engaging in its business or trade in a substantial section of the market.the arbitrator award effectively quarantines cci from engaging in its business in states until and does not follow california law.see dayto
