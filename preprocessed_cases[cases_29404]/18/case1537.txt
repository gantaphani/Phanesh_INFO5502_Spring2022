the court erred in refusing to vacate plaintiff voluntary dismissal and to enter a ruling sustaining the demurrer and a judgment dismissing with prejudice plaintiff action as to him 
he is entitled to mandatory indemnity under corporations code section,subdivision d because he was successful on the merits 
the court erred in interpreting corporations code section,subdivision e to require court approval of the voluntary dismissal before he could obtain permissive indemnity from the court.
gallagher also seeks his costs and fees in connection with this appeal.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff filed a verified complaint on september,against gallagher and others,alleging two derivative causes of action on behalf of groth,and an additional cause of action entitled conspiracy.gallagher answered the complaint.groth,joined by gallagher,moved pursuant to corporations code section,subdivision c to require plaintiff to post security as a prerequisite to prosecution of the derivative causes of action.the trial court granted groth motion and required plaintiff to post security in the sum of or,in the alternative,to amend his complaint to eliminate the derivative causes of action.plaintiff did not post security,but chose to file a first amended complaint eliminating the derivative causes of action and containing causes of action for involuntary dissolution of the corporation,removal of directors and injunctive relief.these were not directed to gallagher.gallagher demurred to the first amended complaint on the grounds that the dissolution and removal causes of action did not state a cause of action against him and that the remaining causes of action for conspiracy and injunctive relief were derivative in nature and barred by the court previous ruling.plaintiff did not file opposition to gallagher demurrers,but instead unsuccessfully attempted to file a second amended complaint without leave of court.
on april,the trial court issued a tentative ruling sustaining gallagher demurrers without leave to amend and directing that gallagher be dismissed from the action.plaintiff counsel apparently indicated that plaintiff would contest the tentative ruling,as he appeared at the demurrer hearing on april.at that time plaintiff counsel advised the court that because the clerk had rejected his attempt to file a second amended complaint plaintiff earlier that morning had filed a dismissal without prejudice of the entire action as to gallagher pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.counsel for gallagher objected,requesting the court to vacate the voluntary dismissal and enter a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of the demurrers without leave to amend.the court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to do so as a result of the filing of the voluntary dismissal by plaintiff before the hearing and final determination of the merits of the demurrers.the court refused to grant gallagher request for orders vacating the voluntary dismissal,sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend,and entering of a judgment of dismissal 
on may,plaintiff filed a second amended complaint that did not name gallagher as a defendant.on july,gallagher filed a motion for an order requiring groth to indemnify him for defense costs pursuant to corporations code section,subdivisions d and in the alternative e,based upon his status as a former officer and director of the corporation,and stating that he was sued by plaintiff due to his former corporate capacity.groth opposed the motion.on or about june,the board of directors of groth adopted a resolution refusing to indemnify gallagher for the fees and expenses he expended in his defense.
on august,the trial court denied gallagher request for indemnity.in its order and statement of decision,filed september,the court reasoned that a voluntary dismissal did not meet the statutory requirement of success on the merits for the purposes of triggering mandatory indemnification pursuant to corporations code section,subdivision d.the court also found gallagher was not entitled to permissive indemnification under corporations code section,subdivisions c and e,because the voluntary dismissal of gallagher by plaintiff without prejudice did not involve court approval,as required by the statute.gallagher timely appealed from the order.
after filing of the appeal by gallagher,plaintiff apparently posted the bond pursuant to corporations code section,subdivision c and then filed a third amended complaint reasserting derivative causes of action on behalf of groth and renaming gallagher as a defendant to those causes of action.
on may,groth moved this court for a dismissal of gallagher appeal on the grounds that the trial court order of september,denying his request for indemnification was not an appealable order.we denied the motion on june.
discussion 
the parties agree that the standard of review of the lower court denial of gallagher application for indemnity is de novo,as we are engaging in analysis and interpretation of corporations code section and code of civil procedure section,subdivision c and their application to undisputed facts.see,eisenberg,horvitz wiener,cal.prac.guide civil appeals writs the rutter group,citing international engine parts,feddersen cal th,d,among others.
gallagher contends he was entitled to mandatory indemnification under corporations code section,subdivision d,requiring success on the merits this argument is first premised upon his assertion that the trial court erred in refusing to vacate the voluntary dismissal and enter a judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice as to him.we agree the court erred in concluding it lacked jurisdiction to vacate the dismissal and to rule on the demurrer.
we are persuaded that the voluntary dismissal in this case falls within judicially created exceptions to the general rule that a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss an action at any time before actual commencement of trial.code civ,c.
t he right of a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss an action before commencement of trial is not absolute.citation.there are statutory exceptions to a plaintiff right of voluntary dismissal,and other limitations have evolved through the courts construction of the term commencement of trial.citation.the meaning of the term trial is not restricted to jury or court trials on the merits,but includes other procedures that effectively dispose of the case.wells marina city properties,cal d,a plaintiff is precluded from voluntarily dismissing an action without prejudice under various circumstances short of a full trial.those circumstances include a general demurrer sustained without leave to amend,a general demurrer sustained with leave to amend where no amendment is made within the allotted time,and where all issues have been deemed admitted in defendant favor.citations.mary morgan,melzark th,d.
the california supreme court in wells marina city properties,supra,cal d,wells,explored the reach of the plaintiff right to a voluntary dismissal in the context of a ruling on a demurrer.in wells,the trial court had sustained the defendant general demurrer to the plaintiff second amended complaint with leave to amend within days.upon the plaintiff failure to amend within the time limit,the defendant moved to dismiss the action with prejudice pursuant to former code of civil procedure section,subdivision.id.at.the plaintiff then sought to voluntarily dismiss the action without prejudice pursuant to former code of civil procedure section,subdivision the predecessor to code civ,subd.c.id.at.
the wells court reaffirmed the holding of goldtree spreckels cal,goldtree,that the plaintiff right to dismiss an action voluntarily was ended when a trial court order sustained a defendant general demurrer without leave to amend.id.at.in so holding,wells examin ed and resolve d an apparent conflict between two subdivisions of former code of civil procedure section.subdivision gives a plaintiff a right to dismiss his action without prejudice at any time before the actual commencement of trial.subdivision,on the other hand,affords a defendant a right to obtain dismissal of such action with prejudice after the trial court has sustained,with leave to amend,defendant general demurrer,and plaintiff has failed to so amend.we will conclude that in such a conflict,a defendant right to a dismissal with prejudice prevails.id.at.
the wells court refused to extend the right to voluntary dismissal beyond that recognized by goldtree.wells,supra,cal d at,see datner mann theatres d.wells embraced the reasons set forth in goldtree for refusing to allow the plaintiff to exercise its right to voluntarily dismiss an action where leave to amend was afforded but not exercised we held that the matter having been submitted to the court,a plaintiff no longer had the right to dismiss without prejudice.if he could do so,litigation would become interminable,because a party who was led to suppose a decision would be adverse to him could prevent such decision and begin anew,thus subjecting the defendant to annoying and continuous litigation.goldtree,at.an important additional interest has also been identified.but the injustice to the defendant is not the greatest evil of such a practice the wasting of the time and money of the people in a fruitless proceeding in the courts is something far more serious.citation.wells,supra,at.
wells recognized that to allow the plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice after allowing the time limit for amendment to pass would run counter to the legislature purpose in amending former code of civil procedure section to limit the plaintiff right of voluntary dismissal to the point of the commencement of trial id.at,and would subvert the statutory scheme.ibid.the obvious consequence of such a statutory construction would be to prolong,rather than to terminate,lawsuits.it would not serve the orderly and timely disposition of civil litigation.no good reason appears why encouragement should be given to such tactics,the effect of which is to expose defendants to duplicative annoying and continuous litigation,to burden our trial court with fruitless proceedings,and to delay the ultimate resolution of the validity of the plaintiff pleading.citations.id.at.
wells identified the issue before it as when does the trial of an issue of law commence id.at.the court concluded that once a general demurrer is sustained with leave to amend and plaintiff does not so amend within the time authorized by the court or otherwise extended by stipulation or appropriate order,he can no longer voluntarily dismiss his action pursuant to former section,subdivision,even if the trial court has yet to enter a judgment of dismissal on the sustained demurrer.id.at.however,the wells court also noted in dicta anticipating another possible source of procedural confusion citation,we note that such right of voluntary dismissal,which is not barred until expiration of plaintiff time to amend after the sustaining of the demurrer,would also not be impaired prior to a decision sustaining the demurrer.id.at,original italics.
wells was characterized by the court in datner mann theatres,supra,d.datner as reaffirming the holding of goldtree,supra,cal,that a plaintiff may as a matter of right dismiss an action until there has been a hearing on the demurrer filed by a defendant and the matter has been submitted to the court.see,datner,supra,at.datner relied upon wells to reverse a trial court vacation of a voluntary dismissal where the plaintiff filed a request for voluntary dismissal before hearing on the demurrer,but after the trial judge had indicated in chambers that he had tentatively decided that the demurrer was meritorious.according to datner in the case at bench,not only had the demurrer not been sustained at the time that appellant filed his request for dismissal,but the hearing upon such demurrer had not occurred and was not even set for that day.id.at.responding to the defendant argument that the court in chambers had advised counsel it had tentatively decided the demurrer was meritorious and should be sustained,the court was unpersuaded.id.at.we take judicial notice of the fact that many judges presiding in the law departments of superior and municipal courts issue tentative rulings on calendared cases prior to the time of hearing.this procedure is helpful to counsel and tends to expedite judicial administration.defendant argument,when analyzed,urges us to declare a new rule of law to the effect that a tentative ruling of the trial court issued during the pendency of a hearing upon a demurrer negates the statutory authority conferred by code of civil procedure,section,subdivision.we decline to so declare.id.at.
m r properties thomson th,d,further explored the effects of a tentative ruling in the context of the defendant right to dismiss an action for lack of prosecution under the statute.in that case,the court issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant motion to dismiss.the tentative ruling provided that any oral argument would be heard on september at and,consistent with local rules of court,required that a party desiring a hearing on the motion must contact the court and opposing counsel by of the day preceding the hearing.id.at,d.the plaintiffs did not request oral argument,but instead filed a request for a voluntary dismissal without prejudice on september at.the clerk entered the voluntary dismissal and the trial court vacated it and entered an order of mandatory dismissal.the court of appeal affirmed,recognizing that the case involved the conflicting rights of a defendant to a mandatory is intertwined with the duty of the trial court to dismiss an action for lack of of a plaintiff to a voluntary dismissal.id.at,d.the court determined the defendant right was stronger and concluded that plaintiff right to seek a voluntary dismissal is cut off by a ruling granting a defendant motion to dismiss the action for lack of prosecution.ibid.the court reasoned that the opinion in wells supports the conclusion that a plaintiff right to a voluntary dismissal is cut off no later than the time of a ruling effectively disposing of the case or at the end of a time period specified in that ruling,whether or not that disposition involves an adjudication of the actual merits of the action.id.at,d.
m r properties thomson,supra,th,d,is numbered among the cases construing local rules or policies on tentative rulings as holding that when the time window closes and the tentative ruling becomes final,plaintiff right to voluntarily dismiss,with or without prejudice,is cut off.citations.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group weil brown,citing m r properties thomson,supra,at,d and sweat hollister th,d,disapproved on other grounds in santisas goodin cal th,fn,see kyle carmon th,d,construing m r properties thomson,supra,as holding that a tentative ruling became formal ruling when plaintiff failed to request hearing by the time allotted.these cases interpret wells to mean that the right to voluntarily dismiss one action without prejudice continues until some sort of ruling,at least when the motion to dismiss might be denied.weil brown,supra,at,italics omitted,quoting m r properties thomson,supra,at,d.
nevertheless,several cases have held,in various contexts,that the plaintiff right to a voluntary dismissal without prejudice may be cut off where a dispositive motion is pending,but before a ruling thereon.hartbrodt burke th,d voluntary dismissal request filed day before hearing on motion for terminating sanction in a discovery dispute cravens stat
