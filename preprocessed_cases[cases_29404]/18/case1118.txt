on november,kim symes and christopher paul northcott,both united kingdom citizens,filed this federal action against stephen harris,magdalen harris,and ril,all colorado citizens.appellants appendix app.at.
the action is based upon a series of negotiations that plaintiffs allege resulted in a binding contract between harris and northcott to establish a business venture with and operations.id.at.in late,as part of this venture,the harrises formed ril as a colorado limited liability company,the founding documents of which reflect that and harris are each owners of ril.id.at.subsequently,symes incorporated rel in the united kingdom.id.at.the businesses were to distribute and sell metal bonding fasteners to businesses in the molding industry.id.at.
in an effort to further develop the venture,symes,harris,and northcott allegedly agreed that symes would become an investor and part owner of the business venture,splitting the ownership between symes,northcott,and the harrises.id.at.relying upon this agreement,symes allegedly paid a total of to ril,rel,and harris and northcott.id.at.notwithstanding symes investment,harris allegedly believes that symes has no ownership interest in the business and that northcott has no interest in ril revenues or profits.id.
based upon harris refusal to recognize the alleged agreement,plaintiffs complaint asserts the following causes of action declaratory relief declaring that until symes became an owner,the business venture was a partnership owned by northcott and the harrises an accounting of ril business affairs and assets declaratory relief declaring symes to be a owner of the business specific performance requiring the harrises to recognize symes and northcott ownership interests in ril and to pay symes and northcott their share of ril profits breach of contract and breach of the fiduciary duty that harris owed to symes and northcott as a partner in their business venture.id.at.

ii.discussion 
the plaintiffs appeal the district court order based upon two assignments of error first,the district court erroneously found diversity jurisdiction wanting because of events that might occur after the complaint was filed and second,the district court erroneously dismissed the action pursuant to.even though rel could be joined without destroying diversity.
the appellees have taken two inconsistent positions on this appeal.the appellees appellate brief takes no position on the legal issues presented and therefore does not address the district court holdings.see aplee.br.at.later at oral argument,however,the appellees asserted that the district court holdings should be affirmed on the same rationales set forth by the district court.
diversity jurisdiction 
we review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.us west,tristani,cir.
under,a party must show that complete diversity of citizenship exists between the adverse parties and that the amount in controversy exceeds.see also radil sanborn camps,cir.the question presented to us is whether the district court lacked jurisdiction when the remedy the plaintiffs seek,if granted,would retroactively render them part owners of the defendant ril and thereby destroy complete diversity.we hold that the district court had jurisdiction.
it has long been the rule that the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought,and that after vesting,it can not be ousted by subsequent events.mullan torrance,wheat.in grupo dataflux atlas global group,d,the supreme court explained that all challenges to jurisdiction premised upon diversity of citizenship are to be measured against the state of facts that existed at the time of filing put otherwise,jurisdiction depending on the condition of the parties,is governed by that condition as it was at the commencement of the suit.id.at.quoting conolly taylor,pet.the district court reasoned that the subject matter of the action is a dispute over the composition of ril membership the very condition that determines ril citizenship.app.at.consequently,the court reasoned,accepting the plaintiffs allegations as true would require a finding that they were members of ril earlier when the complaint was filed,thereby destroying diversity.id.
while the broad question is whether the district court retroactivity rationale squares with the rule that diversity is determined by the facts existing when the complaint was filed,the underlying question concerns the framework through which a district court may view the pleadings when determining whether the parties are diverse.in the instant case,the district court circumvented the fact that the plaintiffs were not members of ril when the suit was filed by erroneously assuming that the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint were true and subsequently dismissing the action based on a potential remedy available upon final judgment.
specifically,the district court found that the subject matter of the litigation whether the plaintiffs are entitled to membership in ril was intertwined with the jurisdictional issue the composition of ril membership for determining citizenship.app.at stating in his order of dismissal that t he subject matter of this action is a dispute over the composition of ril very condition that determines its citizenship.the district court then assumed the truth of the plaintiffs facts and concluded that the plaintiffs allegations would require a remedy rendering them part owners of ril,thereby destroying diversity.yet the essence of the rule is that the district court must determine the jurisdictional facts as they are when the complaint is filed,not as they might be upon final judgment.the district court finding that the subject matter of the litigation is intertwined with a jurisdictional fact does not obviate this basic principle and duty.
the district court failure to abide by this principle also highlights the district court error in determining the parties places of citizenship in light of the remedy that would apply if the plaintiffs facts were proved at trial.the district court speculation that a event could destroy diversity by virtue of the plaintiffs retroactive ownership of ril directly conflicts with the general rule that the court determines the parties citizenship as of the time when the complaint was filed.the plaintiffs were not members of ril when the complaint was fact explicitly alleged in the plaintiffs complaint.app.at alleging in paragraph of the complaint that magdalen harris,the wife of harris,and harris are both member and managers of ril and each own a interest in ril.the only way plaintiffs could become members of ril is for the plaintiffs to pre
