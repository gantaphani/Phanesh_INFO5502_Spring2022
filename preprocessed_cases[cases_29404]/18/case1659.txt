factual and procedural background 
a.the parties 
axcelis is a delaware corporation specializing in the manufacture of ion implantation and semiconductor equipment.axcelis stock is publicly traded on the nasdaq.westland is a michigan pension fund,that beneficially owns axcelis common stock.
in,axcelis and sumitomo heavy industries,shi,a japanese company,established,as equal partners,a joint venture called that joint venture develops,manufactures and sells semiconductor equipment and licenses technology from axcelis.
at all relevant times,axcelis board of directors the board consisted of seven members.chairwoman mary puma was axcelis president and ceo.the remaining six hardis,patrick nettles,brian thompson,william jennings,john fletcher,and geoffrey outside,directors and were independent directors under the nasdaq listing standards.
shi acquisition proposals 
on february,shi together with tpg capital llp made an unsolicited bid to acquire axcelis for per share.that day,axcelis shares closed at a price of per share.on february,axcelis informed shi that it would respond to its acquisition proposal after consulting with axcelis advisors.on february,the board issued a press release announcing its rejection of shi proposal.the board determined that the per share offered price materially discounted axcelis true worth,because it did not assign any value for axcelis opportunity to retrieve market share from its competitors,or for the synergistic value of axcelis interest in 
on march,shi made a second bid to acquire axcelis,this time for per share.that day,axcelis shares closed at a price of per share.on march,the board rejected shi second proposal,stating that the proposal undervalues axcelis and is not in the best interests of axcelis and its shareholders.the board expressed its willingness to meet with shi privately,however,to explore whether the parties could reach an agreement on a transaction involving 
c.the may axcelis shareholder meeting 
on may,axcelis held its annual shareholders meeting.axcelis had a classified board and the three directors standing for.hardis,fletcher and unopposed.axcelis follows the plurality voting provisions of delaware statutory law,under which a director may be elected without receiving a majority of the votes cast importantly,however,the axcelis board also had adopted a plurality plus governance policy,which provides that 
at any shareholder meeting at which directors are subject to an uncontested election,any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes withheld from his or her election than votes for such election shall submit to the board a letter of resignation for consideration by the nominating and governance committee.the nominating and governance committee shall recommend to the board the action to be taken with respect to such offer of resignation.the board shall act promptly with respect to each such letter of resignation and shall promptly notify the director concerned of its decision 
all three directors seeking reelection at the annual meeting received less than a majority of the votes cast,which triggered the plurality plus governance policy.therefore,in accordance with that policy,the three directors tendered letters of resignation.the board,however,decided not to accept the resignations,and in a may,press release,explained why 
t the board considered a number of factors relevant to the best interests of axcelis.the board noted that the three directors are experienced and knowledgeable about the company,and that if their resignations were accepted,the board would be left with only four remaining directors.one or more of the three directors serves on each of the key committees of the company and hardis serves as a lead director.the board believed that losing this experience and knowledge would harm the company.the board also noted that retention of these directors is particularly important if axcelis is able to move forward on discussions with shi following finalization of an appropriate agreement.
the board also expressed its intention to be responsive to the shareholder concerns that gave rise to the withhold votes.the board is seeking to engage in confidential discussions with shi and,prior to next year annual meeting,the board will consider recommending in favor of a declassification proposal at that meeting.
axcelis and shi renew their negotiations 
on june,axcelis and shi together with tpg capital llp entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate discussions concerning a possible acquisition of axcelis.axcelis management then furnished due diligence information to shi,and met with shi representatives to discuss shi due diligence requests.axcelis and shi agreed that shi would submit a revised acquisition proposal by august.
shortly thereafter,however,shi attempted to change that agreement.shi requested a seven week extension to perform due diligence,after which it would decide whether or not to submit a revised acquisition proposal.shi also indicated that if it made a proposal,it would need an additional five week period to conduct confirmatory due diligence.axcelis did not agree to shi requested extension,and informed shi that it would have until the end of august to submit a revised acquisition bid.axcelis also proposed that any combination should involve shi exchanging its sen shares for shares of axcelis.
shi never submitted a revised acquisition bid.instead,on september,shi informed axcelis that it was putting all discussions regarding an acquisition on hold.by september,after axcelis publicly announced that development,axcelis stock had dropped to per share.
westland demands axcelis books and records 
on december,westland sent a demand letter to axcelis under,requesting seven categories of books and records of axcelis and its subsidiaries the purpose of that demand,according to westland,was to investigate 
a the board members compliance with their fiduciary duties to the company and its shareholders as it relates to the board management of shi acquisition proposals and 
b the board members compliance with their fiduciary duties to the company and its shareholders as it relates to the board refusal to accept the resignations of directors stephen hardis,john fletcher,and brian thompson.
by letter dated december,axcelis rejected westland demand,on the ground that it did not satisfy the standard set forth in section and delaware jurisprudence interpreting section.
axcelis sells its stake in sen to shi 
on january,axcelis announced that it had failed to make a required payment of outstanding notes that were governed by a preexisting indenture agreement with bank national association.on february,the board announced that it had agreed to sell axcelis stake in sen to shi for approximately million.that sale closed on march,by which point axcelis shares were trading at per share.the proceeds from that sale were used to pay off the notes that had matured and fallen due two months earlier.
westland seeks to compel inspection of axcelis books and records 
on april,westland filed a complaint in the court of chancery seeking a inspection of axcelis books and records under.c.westland was required,under section c,to establish that it was seeking inspection for a proper purpose.westland claimed that it had stated a proper purpose for its,to investigate possible management wrongdoing specifically,westland claimed that the axcelis board rejection of both shi acquisition proposals and the directors resignations tendered as a result of the may election,established a credible basis from which the court could infer that wrongdoing may have occurred 
westland alleged in its complaint that the board rejection of the three directors tendered resignations established a credible basis to infer that the board intended to entrench those three directors and indeed the entire board in office.westland predicated its argument on blasius indus.atlas which holds that where a corporate board acts for the primary purpose of impeding the exercise of stockholder voting power the board bears the heavy burden of demonstrating a compelling justification for such action.here westland argued,the axcelis board decision to reject the tendered director resignations frustrated the shareholder vote,the intent and effect of which was to trigger and implement axcelis plurality plus governance policy.westland claimed that that board decision was sufficient,without more,to establish a credible inference of wrongdoing,rebuttable only if the axcelis board could prove a compelling justification.westland further alleged that the board rejections of shi acquisition proposals were defensive measures that created a credible suspicion of wrongdoing,board entrenchment under unocal mesa petroleum 
after a one day trial,based on a stipulation of uncontested facts,the court of chancery dismissed westland section action,holding that westland had failed to demonstrate a proper purpose for its demand for inspection.specifically,the vice chancellor found that westland had failed to present any evidence that the board refusal to accept the three directors resignations thwarted the will of the shareholders or impeded their voting franchise.rather,all the board did was exercise the discretion conferred by the axcelis plurality plus governance policy.the vice chancellor also found no credible basis from which to infer any possible wrongdoing from the board rejection of shi two acquisition proposals,because r ejecting an acquisition offer,without more,is not a defensive action under unocal.
this appeal followed.
westland claims on appeal 
westland claims that the court of chancery erred as a matter of law by misapplying the applicable legal standard.westland concedes that the court of chancery opinion invokes the proper,that a plaintiff seeking inspection of books and records must present some evidence,through documents,logic,testimony or otherwise,to suggest a credible basis from which the court of chancery could infer that wrongdoing may have occurred westland claims,however,that the court misapplied that standard by requiring westland to provide affirmative evidence of wrongdoing.westland urges that the undisputed facts are sufficient to discharge its burden because those facts,standing alone,established a credible basis to infer wrongdoing.additionally,westland urges this court to adopt the blasius standard in reviewing the board decision to reject the three directors tendered resignations.
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo whether or not a party stated purpose for seeking inspection under.b here,to investigate possible mismanagement is a proper purpose.a trial judge determination that a credible basis does or does not exist to infer managerial wrongdoing is a mixed finding of fact and law that is entitled to considerable deference 
the standard applicable to a section b demand is well established.a stockholder seeking to inspect the books and records of a corporation must demonstrate a proper purpose for the inspection.a proper purpose is one that is reasonably related to such person interest as a stockholder.
our law recognizes investigating possible wrongdoing or mismanagement as a proper purpose.to obtain section relief based on that purpose,the must present some evidence to suggest a credible basis from which a court could infer possible mismanagement that would warrant further investigation in seinfeld verizon comm n,this court reaffirmed the credible basis standard as striking the appropriate balance between on the one hand affording shareholders access to corporate records that may provide some evidence of possible wrongdoing and on the other safeguarding the corporation right to deny requests for inspection based solely upon suspicion or curiosity thus,a mere statement of a purpose to investigate possible general mismanagement,without more,will not entitle a shareholder to broad inspection relief.
a plaintiff may establish a credible basis to infer wrongdoing through documents,logic,testimony or otherwise.such evidence need not prove that wrongdoing,in fact,occurred because the credible basis standard sets the lowest possible burden of proof,any reduction of that burden would be tantamount to permitting inspection based on the mere suspicion of wrongdoing 
westland failed to establish a credible basis to infer wrongdoing 
westland books and records demand identified two allegedly suspect incidents of wrongdoing.the first was axcelis board handling of shi two acquisition proposals.the second was the board refusal to accept the resignations of the three directors who failed to receive an affirmative majority vote at the may annual meeting.westland evidence to support its purpose consisted of the parties joint stipulation of uncontested facts and exhibits thereto,and westland logical conclusions from those facts and exhibits that the axcelis board had acted out of improper entrenchment motives.the vice chancellor,however,drew different logical conclusions from those same uncontested facts,and determined that there was no support in the record of any entrenchment motive other than westland bare accusations suggesting such a motive 
westland claims that the court of chancery incorrectly applied the credible basis standard by requiring westland to present affirmative evidence of wrongdoing.for support,westland offers only its proposed interpretation of the uncontested facts,which westland asserts create a legitimate basis to believe that the board decisions might have been the product of improper entrenchment motives.by way of example,westland conclusorily asserts that i t can not seriously be disputed that shi acquisition proposals could have been deemed a threat to the axcelis board control over the company,and that the board rejection of the three directors resignations and denial of shi request for a modest extension,were made i n the face of this threat.essentially,westland disagrees with the vice chancellor inferences from the undisputed facts.westland disagreement,without any further affirmative showing,is insufficient.the vice chancellor concluded that axcelis rejection of shi unsolicited acquisition proposals,without more,was not a defensive action under unocal that conclusion must stand,because the record provides no credible basis to infer that the board rejections of those proposals,and its refusal to extend the deadline for shi to submit a revised acquisition bid,were other than good faith business decisions.
proper purpose to investigate suitability of directors 
westland second claim on appeal is that this court should adopt the blasius standard when reviewing a board of directors decision to reject director resignations in cases where a plurality plus governance policy or is triggered and requires that resignations be tendered.under blasius,a corporation board must demonstrate a compelling justification for boardadopted measures that interfere with,or frustrate,a shareholder vote westland claims that by withholding their votes in the may director triggering axcelis plurality plus governance majority of axcelis shareholders expressed their will that the three directors should be removed.because the board of the three directors resignations frustrated that shareholder will and vote westland urges,the axcelis board must be required to show a compelling justification for its decision.
the court of chancery rejected westland blasius argument.we have concluded that westland blasius argument lacks merit,because it improperly attempts to shift to axcelis westland burden to establish a proper purpose for a section inspection.accordingly,we agre
