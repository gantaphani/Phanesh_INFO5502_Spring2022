michelle leigh vieira,trustee in bankruptcy of beach first national bancshares,the trustee and bancshares,respectively filed this action against the former directors and officers of bancshares collectively,including both fiduciary capacities,the directors.the directors also all formerly served as the officers and directors of first national bank myrtle beach,sc the bank,a wholly owned subsidiary of bancshares.the bank was bancshares primary asset.
in,the united states office of the comptroller of the currency occ began monitoring the bank finding serious deficiencies with the management and operation of the bank,occ required the bank to take a number of corrective actions.these corrective actions failed to sustain the financial stability of the bank.consequently,on april,occ closed the bank and named the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as its receiver.the fdic subsequently liquidated all of the bank assets so that the bank ceased as a going concern or functional entity.
as a consequence of the bank failure,bancshares filed for bankruptcy under chapter on may,in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of south carolina.the trustee then filed this adversary proceeding,asserting breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against the directors in their capacity as the officers and directors of bancshares.specifically,the trustee alleged that the directors breached a number of duties to bancshares,resulting in mismanagement and lack of oversight of the bank and over bancshares interest in a real estate holding entity.
the directors moved the bankruptcy court to stay the adversary proceeding,withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court and transfer the action to the united states district court for the district of south carolina,or dismiss the case for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the bankruptcy court stayed the proceedings,and the district court granted the motion to withdraw the reference 
after briefing and argument,the district court granted the directors motion to dismiss,concluding that the trustee lacked standing to bring the action.see vieira anderson in re beach first bancshares,cv dcn,wl,at.in analyzing the trustee pleading,the district court determined that the trustee pled against the directors only claims derived from alleged defalcations in the directors operation of the bank.the district court then held that the trustee right to bring such derivative claims had been divested by statute in favor of the fdic.derivative claims of the nature asserted by the trustee,the district court determined,could be brought only by the fdic under the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act of firrea.to date,the fdic has not brought an action against the directors and has stated in communications to the trustee that it would likely not proceed against them.
from the judgment dismissing her complaint,the trustee now timely appeals.we have jurisdiction under.
in a nutshell,the trustee contends on appeal that the district court erred in granting the directors motion to dismiss for two reasons.first,the trustee argues that she did not plead derivative claims against the directors,but instead asserted direct claims that do not fall within the purview of the fdic.alternatively,the trustee contends that the claims against the directors,even if derivative in nature,remain hers to bring because the fdic has declined to act and has acquiesced in the trustee assertion of those claims.
we review a district court dismissal of an action under rule b de novo.see giarratano johnson,cir.when reviewing a rule b dismissal,we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.see erickson pardus,d per curiam.we review questions of law de novo.see logan jkv real estate servs.in re bogdan,cir.to the extent that we consider questions of state law to reach our decision,south carolina law applies 
applying those standards,we disagree,for the most part,with the trustee arguments for the reasons set forth below.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court,with the exception of its dismissal of the trustee claim regarding bancshares interest in a real estate holding entity.
a trustee in bankruptcy succeeds to all rights of the debtor,including the right to assert any causes of action belonging to the debtor.see am.ins.ruppert landscaping,cir.a debtor right to bring a legal claim is part of the bankruptcy estate under a.applying that foundational principle to the case at bar,the trustee has the authority to assert any cause of action that bancshares could have brought in its own right.absent statutory modification,this power includes the right to assert derivative claims of bancshares as the bank sole shareholder against the directors in their capacity as officers and directors of the bank.this is so because,under south carolina law,when an officer or director of a corporation causes injury to the corporation or fails to fulfill a duty to the corporation,that corporation may bring a direct action against the officer or director.see babb rothrock.when the corporation fails to bring a direct action,a shareholder may bring suit on behalf of the corporation in a derivative action.see rice marko wachovia.in this case,that shareholder is bancshares,now acting by virtue of the bankruptcy proceeding through the trustee.
under firrea,however,the fdic,when appointed receiver of a bank,succeeds to all rights,titles,powers,and privileges of the insured depository institution,and of any stockholder of such institution with respect to the institution and the assets of the institution.d a i emphasis added.the trustee does not dispute that derivative claims fall within the powers and privileges of a stockholder of a financial institution with respect to the institution as contemplated by d a i.
the district court concluded that the trustee brought only derivative claims against the directors because the directors and officers of bancshares and the bank were one and the same,and the harm caused to bancshares,the holding company,was the direct result of the failure of its subsidiary and primary asset,the bank.vieira,wl,at.in reviewing the basis of the directors liability to bancshares as pled by the trustee,the district court observed that the only harm pled result ed from the mismanagement and failure of its primary asset,the bank.id.at.in support of its conclusions,the district court cited its previous decision in fdic american bank trust shares,which held 
it is well settled under south carolina law,as well as the law of other jurisdictions,that causes of action for losses sustained because of the mismanagement and negligence of directors,officers,and employees of a bank belong to the bank itself,and not to the stockholders or creditors and in the event of its liquidation,such causes of action are vested in its receiver and may be conveyed and sold as any other asset.
vacated on other grounds,cir.the fourth circuit affirmed this principle in bauer sweeny,cir.those cases,however,involved individual shareholders asserting clearly derivative claims against officers and directors of an operating bank entity.they did not include the additional element,present in this case,of fiduciaries at the holding company and subsidiary bank levels.
the trustee correctly asserts that the fiduciary duties the directors owed to bancshares,as a distinct corporate entity from the bank,were separate from those duties the directors owed the bank.the actual basis of liability the trustee pled against the directors,however,flows only from the duties the directors may have violated in their operation and management of the bank with one exception discussed below.while the directors could,conceptually,have undertaken actions uniquely and separately harmful to bancshares as opposed to the bank,the trustee has pled primarily causes of action for liability derivative of the alleged failures at the bank level.
the trustee repeatedly pled that the directors allowed mismanagement of the bank,but such conduct caused injury first to the bank and then only indirectly to bancshares as the bank sole shareholder.for example
