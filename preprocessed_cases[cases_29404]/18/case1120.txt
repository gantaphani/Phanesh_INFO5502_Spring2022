this appeal arises out of the efforts of salt lake tribune publishing company tribune publishing to reacquire the salt lake tribune newspaper.an appraisal from management planning,mpi,which valued the assets of the salt lake tribune,is at the center of the present controversy.tribune publishing appeals the district court dismissal of its complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to,and reverse and remand.
tribune publishing has an option agreement to purchase the salt lake tribune from medianews group,and,llc,collectively medianews.under the option agreement,tribune publishing may reacquire the newspaper by paying the exercise price,which is the fair market value of the newspaper.the option agreement specifically defines fair market value.option agreement a.at.
if the parties can not agree on the fair market value,the option agreement prescribes an appraisal procedure.each party appoints an appraiser to calculate the fair market value of the newspaper assets.if one appraised value is greater than the other appraised value,then the two parties select a third appraiser.the fair market value depends upon the three appraised values 
t he fair market value of the tribune assets shall be equal to the average of the two closest appraised values reported by the three appraisers,provided,however,that if the highest and the lowest of such three appraised values differ from middle by an equal amount,then the fair market value of the tribune assets shall be equal to such middle determination.
option agreement b.at emphasis omitted.the option agreement further provides that e ach determination of the fair market value of the tribune assets in accordance with the appraisal provisions of this paragraph shall be final,binding and conclusive.option agreement d.at.although the parties agreed that each determination of the fair market value in accordance with paragraph would be final and binding,the option agreement expressly allowed the parties to enforce the agreement in court.the option agreement states that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this agreement in any court of the united states and seek other remedies at law or in equity.option agreement.at.tribune publishing appraiser valued the newspaper at million,while medianews appraiser valued it at million.because medianews appraised value was greater than that from tribune publishing,the parties agreed to a third appraisal by mpi.
the parties entered into an appraisal agreement with mpi,which requires mpi to comply with professional appraisal standards.the parties agreed to seek judicial review of any conflicts that arise between the terms of the option agreement and professional appraisal standards.mpi appraised the assets at million.
tribune publishing filed the present action on june,against medianews group,and mpi.tribune publishing asserts that mpi appraisal used a different definition of fair market value than the option agreement.first am.compl.at.tribune publishing further alleges that mpi ignored evidence relevant to valuing the newspaper assets.first am.compl.at.tribune publishing maintains that mpi violated professional appraisal standards,even though mpi agreed to comply with those standards in the appraisal agreement.first am.compl.at.tribune publishing seeks judicial invalidation of mpi appraisal and damages from mpi caused by the issuance of its appraisal.
earlier in this case,the district court granted a prior rule b motion to dismiss filed by medianews,concluding that mpi appraisal was an arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa.we reversed,holding that the appraisal was not an arbitration under the faa.salt lake tribune publ g mgmt.planning,cir tribune publ g ii.
on remand,the district court dismissed tribune publishing first amended complaint under rule b,again treating mpi appraisal as an arbitration.applying new jersey law,the district court concluded that the new jersey supreme court would treat an appraisal like an arbitration.the district court reasoned that,under new jersey law,an appraisal,like an arbitration,is not subject to judicial review absent allegations of fraud,corruption,or similar wrongdoing.then,by applying this standard to mpi appraisal,the district court concluded that it could not review tribune publishing challenge to mpi appraisal.the district court also dismissed tribune publishing claims against mpi,holding that the alleged injury was not ripe because tribune publishing has not paid the allegedly inflated purchase price.
on appeal,tribune publishing argues that the district court misinterpreted new jersey law in dismissing its claims seeking judicial invalidation of mpi appraisal.tribune publishing further argues that the district court erred in its ripeness analysis in dismissing tribune publishing claims for damages.

dismissal of claims seeking judicial invalidation of mpi appraisal 
the parties dispute whether a court may review mpi appraisal for reasons other than fraud,corruption,or similar wrongdoing under new jersey law specifically,the parties disagree whether a court may vacate an appraisal if the appraiser committed a mistake of law or failed to consider all of the relevant evidence.applying new jersey law,we hold that the district court may review mpi appraisal for a mistake of law or failure to consider the relevant evidence.
new jersey law 
we conclude that the district court misinterpreted new jersey law in determining the standard of judicial review for appraisals.

tribune publishing contends that the district court erred by disregarding the new jersey supreme court decision in elberon bathing ambassador ins,and by treating mpi appraisal like an arbitration.in elberon,the new jersey supreme court reviewed an appraisal when an appraiser and the umpire allegedly committed a mistake of law and failed to consider all of the relevant evidence.id.at.contrary to medianews assertions,the new jersey supreme court decision in elberon is binding on us.
medianews argues that we should interpret elberon narrowly by limiting it to a statutory appraisal,but the new jersey supreme court did not limit the decision in this way.elberon involved an insurance appraisal to value a building destroyed by a fire.id.at.the insurance policy and statute required the appraisers to deduct depreciation from the replacement cost to calculate actual cash value of the assets.id.at citing stat.ann.but one appraiser and the umpire failed to deduct depreciation.in holding that the appraiser and the umpire committed a mistake of law,the new jersey supreme court vacated the appraisal.throughout its decision,the new jersey supreme court emphasized the insurance policy,as well as the statute governing fire insurance policies.see elberon,at in failing to make such a depreciation deduction,the appraisers violated the terms of the policy and committed a mistake of law.emphasis added.as the court relied on both the policy and the statute,we do not read elberon as applying only to statutory appraisals.
medianews further argues that the standard of judicial review that applies to arbitrations should also apply to appraisals.medianews relies on two cases.the first case is a new jersey supreme court decision that concerned an arbitration under the new jersey arbitration act.tretina printing,fitzpatrick,per curiam.in tretina,the new jersey supreme court held that a court may not set aside an arbitration except for fraud,corruption,or similar wrongdoing on the part of the arbitrators.id.at.the second case medianews cites is a decision from new jersey intermediate appellate court,the superior court of new jersey,appellate division appellate division,which involved an agreement to value the stock and to arbitrate a binding settlement.cap city prods.louriero.the appellate division stated that elberon must be deemed modified by the subsequent holding in tretina.cap city,at.
we turn first to tretina.contrary to medianews argument,we do not read the new jersey supreme court decision in tretina as somehow modifying elberon.nor do we read tretina as applying to appraisals.in tretina,the new jersey supreme court held that a court may not vacate an arbitration award due to an arbitrator mistake of law.at.tretina neither mentioned elberon nor discussed an appraisal.in fact,tretina involves statutory arbitration subject to the arbitration act,not arbitration.at.given that tretina does not even apply to all arbitrations,it seems highly unlikely that the new jersey supreme court intended tretina to apply to all appraisals,especially since the court decision did not even mention appraisals.
we next address cap city,which medianews cites as clarifying the standard of judicial review applicable to appraisals.in cap city,the appellate division concluded that the new jersey supreme court ruling in tretina modified its prior ruling in elberon,even though tretina dealt with an arbitration and elberon dealt with an appraisal 
tretina does not represent a narrow holding applicable only to a specific case before the supreme court.rather,it lays out a broad,strong policy to the extent that statements in prior cases such as elberon bathing ambassador insurance,levine wiss,or lakewood township municipal utilities authority south lakewood water,suggest a different principle,or reach a different conclusion because the independent party performing the function is termed something other than an arbitrator,those cases must be deemed modified by the subsequent holding in tretina.
cap city,at.applying the narrow standard of review from tretina,the appellate division concluded that it could not vacate the valuation because of an alleged mistake of law.cap city,at.we conclude that the new jersey supreme court decision in elberon resolves the legal question presented in the case at bar,and the appellate division decision in cap city does not persuade us to abandon elberon.
the appellate division analysis in cap city conflicts with several decisions from the new jersey supreme court where it has distinguished arbitrations and appraisals based on whether the has authority to make legal determinations.see levine wiss,elberon,at.an arbitration ordinarily dispos es of the entire controversy between the parties,and judgment may be entered upon the award,whereas an appraisal establishes only the amount of loss and not liability.elberon,at.moreover,appraiser s can make no legal determinations.id.at.based on the differences between appraisals and arbitrations,the new jersey supreme court has applied different standards of judicial review for mistakes of law.while a court may not review an arbitration for an arbitrator mistake of law,a court may review an appraisal for an appraiser mistake of law.see id.at.
a subsequent decision from the appellate division further dilutes cap city persuasive power.two days after it decided cap city,the appellate division applied elberon in an appraisal case.see ward merrimack mut.fire ins.in ward,the appellate division considered a challenge to an appraisal that the umpire failed to consider all of the relevant evidence,but it rejected the challenge as lacking factual support.id.without mentioning cap city,the appellate division applied the standard of review for appraisals from elberon.see id.ward conflicts with the appellate division assertion in cap city that tretina modified elberon.
the new jersey supreme court has not departed from its ruling in elberon.further,we have no reason to predict that the new jersey supreme court would overrule elberon because it has given no indication it would do so.
tribune publishing first amended complaint 
tribune publishing argues that mpi appraisal should be set aside for four reasons 
mpi committed a mistake of law by defining fair market value differently than the option agreement 
mpi ignored evidence relevant to the valuation of the newspaper assets 
mpi exceeded the authority conferred in the option agreement and the appraisal agreement by using a different definition of fair market value and by violating professional appraisal standards and 
mpi displayed evident partiality in favor of medianews.
aplt.br.at.applying the new jersey supreme court decision from elberon to mpi appraisal,and accepting tribune publishing allegations as true,we conclude that the district court may review the appraisal to determine whether mpi committed a mistake of law,failed to consider relevant evidence,or exceeded its authority.
the parties disagree whether mpi appraisal is binding under the option agreement,which states that e ach determination of the fair market value in accordance with the appraisal provisions of this paragraph shall be final,binding and conclusive.option agreement d.at.when interpreting contracts,new jersey courts examine the plain language of the contract and the parties intent,as evidenced by the contract purpose and surrounding circumstances.state troopers fraternal ass new jersey.when the terms of a contract are unambiguous,as here,the court function is to enforce the contract as written and not to make a better contract for either party.schenck hji,internal quotation marks omitted.
medianews contends that mpi appraisal is binding and that no judicial review is permitted because paragraph d of the option agreement includes the words final,binding and conclusive.option agreement d.at.medianews interpretation fails for two reasons.
first,medianews interpretation ignores paragraph of the option agreement,which specifically allows the parties to enforce the option agreement in any court.a contract must be read as a whole,without artificial emphasis on one section,with a consequent disregard for others.borough of princeton bd.of chosen freeholders,aff.the plain language of the option agreement demonstrates the parties intent to allow the enforcement of the option agreement in any court.paragraph of the option agreement explicitly allows the parties to seek judicial review to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this agreement in any court of the united states and to seek any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.option agreement.at.medianews interpretation of paragraph d would render paragraph meaningless.see,cumberland county improvement auth.gsp recycling,stating that a contract should not be interpreted to render one of its terms meaningless.given the plain language in paragraph,we can not agree with medianews contention that mpi appraisal is binding and no judicial review of the appraisal is permitted.
second,medianews interpretation conflicts with the plain language in paragraph d,which makes the determination of a fair market value final,binding and conclusive only when it is in accordance with the appraisal provisions of this paragraph.option agreement d.at.disproportionate emphasis upon a word or clause or single provision does not serve the purpose of interpretation.words and phrases are not to be isolated but related to the context and the contractual scheme as a whole.newark publishers ass newark typographical union.tribune publishing has alleged that mpi disregarded the definition of fair market value in the option agreement.first am.compl.at.were we to accept this allegation as true as we must in review of a rule b dismissal,mpi appraisal would not be binding.
medianews concedes as much,acknowledging that a court could determine whether the parties violated the appraisal provisions in paragraph,but it contends that this does not include a challenge to the judgments of appraisers who were properly selected.medianews br.at.medianews can not have it both ways.just as a court has authority to review whether the parties violated paragraph,it may review whether mpi complied with paragraph,including the definition of fair market value.medianews argument invites us to revise the option agreement in their favor,which,of course,we can not do.see,camden bd.of educ.alexander.
in further support of its argument that the appraisal is binding,medianews cites cap city,but the contract in cap city is distinguishable from the contracts in this case.in cap city,the parties agreed to mutually select a third party to value the stock of a closed corporation and to arbitrate a binding settlement.at.the third had authority to value the stock and to arbitrate a binding settlement,regardless of the valuations from the appraisers.id.at.thus,in cap city,the parties agreed that the third had the authority to value the stock and to arbitrate a binding settlement.id.at.
in contrast to the contract in cap city,the option agreement did not authorize mpi to arbitrate.mpi did not function as an umpire deciding between two appraisals.instead,mpi merely supplied a data point that the parties may use in determining fair market value.tribune publ g ii,at.in our prior ruling in this case,we specifically discussed mpi role in the appraisal procedure 
sltpc and medianews fashioned an agreement where,in the event that they could not agree on a price and their chosen appraisers were too far apart,a third appraiser would contribute a value that may,or may not,be used to calculate the exercise price 
here,mpi appraisal would by no means definitively settle the dispute between tribune publishing and medianews.at most,mpi supplied a data point that the parties could use in establishing the exercise price.under the terms of the option agreement,a scenario existed where the parties would not use mpi report at all 
mpi was not asked to decide between two values established by tribune publishing and medianews,nor were they asked to assign independently a single value binding on the parties.indeed the parties did not even agree to average mpi figure with one or both of their own.the parties merely asked mpi to prepare a report evaluating the newspaper and establishing the fair market value of the newspaper assets,a value which the parties may,under certain circumstances,have used to fix the exercise price under the option agreement.mpi report would not necessarily settle a dispute between sltpc and medianews.
id.at.thus,the option agreement did not permit mpi,as the third appraiser,to set the fair market value on its own.
committing a mistake of law 
accepting tribune publishing allegations as true,the district court may review the appraisal to determine whether mpi committed a mistake of law.
a court may review an appraisal if it involves a mistake of law,but not if it involves a mistake of fact.elberon,at.where the parties have negotiated specific terms in a contract,courts may review the appraisal for the appraiser compliance with the contractual terms,melton,philadelphia fire marine ins,eq,collings carriage.ins,eq,invalidating an appraisal because the appraiser failed to comply with the requirements of the agreement of submission.the interpretation of a contractual term,such as fair market value,where its meaning is clear is a legal determination.see,driscoll const,state,dep t,bosshard hackensack.med.an appraiser commits a mistake of law in failing to follow a contractual provision.see elberon,at.
in its first amended complaint,tribune publishing alleges that mpi appraisal is invalid because its definition of fair market value differed from the definition set forth in the option agreement.first am.compl.at.accepting tribune publishing allegations as true,mpi committed a mistake of law.
failing to consider all relevant evidence 
additionally,the district court may review the appraisal to determine whether mpi failed to consider the relevant evidence.under new jersey law,a court may set aside an appraisal where the appraiser fails to consider the relevant evidence.see elberon,at vacating an appraisal where one appraiser and the umpire failed to consider the relevant evidence.
tribune publishing alleges that mpi failed to consider relevant evidence in its appraisal.first am.compl.at.the appraisal agreement allowed the parties to present evidence to mpi,and it required mpi to consult with them following release of its draft report.accepting these allegations as true,the district court may review the appraisal for mpi failure to consider relevant evidence.
medianews disputes the factual allegations in the complaint,maintaining that mpi considered plaintiff evidence in its report.despite medianews invitation,we do not weigh potential evidence when reviewing a dismissal pursuant to rule b.see,duran carris,cir.
exceeding its authority 
the district court may review the appraisal to determine whether mpi exceeded its contractual authority.
a court may review an appraisal where the appraiser exceeds the scope of his or her contractual authority.see levine,at considering an accountant valuation of a person interest in a company as an appraisal where the accountant was bound by professional standards governing accountancy internal quotation marks omitted.a exceeds his or her authority when he or she disregards the contractual limitations see,tpk.auth.tpk.supervisors ass n,county coll.of morris staff ass county coll.of morris,the scope of an arbitrator authority depends on the terms of the contract between the parties.commc ns workers of,local monmouth county bd.of soc,t he jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator are circumscribed by and limited to the powers delegated to him.a contract may limit authority both in the procedure that the arbitrator must apply in resolving disputes and the substantive matters that he may address.commc ns workers,at.
tribune publishing alleges that the appraisal agreement limited mpi authority in three ways.first,the appraisal agreement required mpi to use the definition of fair market value from the option agreement.first am.com pl.second,the appraisal agreement required mpi to comply with professional appraisal standards.id.third,the appraisal agreement required mpi to alert the parties if the option agreement definition of fair market value conflicts with professional appraisal standards so that the parties could seek judicial review.id.accepting these allegations as true,tribune publishing has alleged that mpi exceeded its authority,and the district court may review mpi appraisal on that ground.
evidencing partiality 
the parties discuss evident partiality as another ground for setting aside an appraisal,but tribune publishing has not alleged evident partiality,even when viewing its factual contentions in the most favorable light.on appeal,tribune publishing has not identified any paragraph in the amended complaint that alleges bias,the appearance of bias,or improper motive by mpi.in arguing that mpi displayed evident partiality in its briefs,tribune publishing merely restates its factual allegations that mpi applied the wrong definition of fair market value,violated professional appraisal standards,and failed to consider tribune publishing evi
