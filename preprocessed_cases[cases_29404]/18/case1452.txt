appellant is a grower who used a commission merchant to market his pomegranate crop.the respondents are various businesses that obtained the pomegranate crop in transactions with the commission merchant.appellant sued respondents alleging that they obtained the crop on a reconsignment basis,sold it,provided false or misleading documents about those sales,and kept money that should have been remitted to appellant.respondents moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that they had no privity of contract with appellant and therefore his claims must fail.the superior court agreed and granted respondents motion without leave to amend.
appellant argues that the common law and statutory duties imposed on commission merchants apply to respondents based on their status as reconsignees.respondents contend there were no reconsignments and that all of their transactions with the commission merchant were sales.
we conclude that the complaint,although ambiguous,does sufficiently allege that respondents were reconsignees and that the commission merchant was authorized by appellant to enter into reconsignment relationships.we further conclude that the complaint presents the legal theory that the commission merchant was appellant agent and respondents were subagents engaged by the commission merchant.california law recognizes that commission merchants are agents,an agent owes fiduciary duties to his or her principal,and a subagent owes the principal the same duties as the agent where the agent was authorized by the principal to retain subagents.applying these rules of law to the facts alleged in the complaint,appellant has presented the legal theory that respondents were appellant subagents and,as such,owed him a fiduciary duty.the appellant other allegations,when considered with this fiduciary duty,are sufficient to state claims for conversion,breach of fiduciary duty,accounting,and negligence.
as to appellant claims for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud,we conclude the allegations are insufficient to state those claims,but direct that the trial court grant leave to amend.
accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.we publish this opinion because,based on the rules of law applicable to subagents,it extends the ruling in fischer machado th,d fischer.in fischer,the court held that a commission merchant can be liable for the conversion of proceeds from the sale of farm products that he sells as an agent for the farmer.here,we hold that a subagent,like an agent,may be liable for converting sale proceeds.
