background 
symbol is a delaware corporation whose stock is traded on the new york stock exchange.individual defendants other than james simons were symbol directors at all relevant times,whereas james simons was elected to symbol board of directors on may.appellant herbert resnik was a symbol shareholder throughout the time period relevant to this action.
on february,symbol board of directors adopted,subject to shareholder approval,the directors stock option plan for directors the plan,awarding each director an option to purchase shares of symbol common stock.under the terms of the plan,each current director would have the right to exercise his options at the higher of two prices,symbol stock closing price on february,and symbol stock closing price on the date of shareholder approval of the plan.the plan further provided that any subsequently elected director would be granted the options on the date when he or she became a symbol director and would have the right to exercise them at symbol stock closing price on the date of the grant.the options granted to each director would become exercisable over a period,with an additional percent of the options becoming exercisable on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date.the plan also imposed substantial restrictions on option transfers,required that the grantees serve as directors continuously between the grant date and the exercise date,and specified a life span for the awarded options.
on march,symbol issued a proxy statement,soliciting shareholders proxies to vote at symbol annual shareholder meeting on may.among the items proposed for shareholders consideration were election of directors and approval of the plan.the proxy statement summarized the key terms of the plan in a section entitled management remuneration and transactions and was accompanied by an annex containing the full terms of the plan.the management remuneration and transactions section of the proxy statement also stated that directors received an annual retainer of and a fee of for each board of directors or committee meeting they attended.additionally,the proxy statement made detailed disclosures about compensation of symbol executive officers and contained a table summarizing quantitative information about stock options granted to the five most highly paid executives,including the potential realizable value of options granted to each executive.a footnote to the table stated 
the actual value,if any,an executive will realize will depend on the excess of the market price over the exercise price on the date the option is actually exercised.the value actually realized by an executive or any shareholder may not be at or near the values estimated in this table.
at the annual meeting held on may,symbol shareholders elected the nominated directors and approved the plan.
on july,appellant commenced the present action against symbol and its directors,asserting claims under section a of the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder.appellant alleged that the proxy statement was materially misleading because it did not disclose the present value of the options awarded pursuant to the plan under the option pricing model developed by fischer black and myron scholes the model according to the complaint,the model estimates the grantor cost of granting an option,commonly referred to as the value of the option.the calculation is based on six input variables the exercise price of the option,the market price of the underlying stock,the volatility of the underlying stock,the expiration date of the option,the rate of interest,and the dividend rate on the underlying stock.
appellant alleges that the value of the options granted to each director of symbol on february,was.appellant claims that the omission of this calculation from the proxy statement violated the securities and exchange commission the sec or the commission rules on mandatory disclosure of management compensation in a proxy statement and rendered misleading the proxy statement assertions about compensation received by directors.appellant also claims that,in the absence of information about the value of the options granted under the plan,the quoted footnote about actual realizable value of options held by symbol senior executives was misleading because it conveyed the false impression that options granted under the plan had no value until the date of their exercise.
the district court dismissed appellant complaint,concluding that defendants had no duty to disclose the value of the options proposed to be granted under the plan.appellant then filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.strougo bassini,cir.in ruling on a motion to dismiss,a court must construe all factual allegations in the complaint in plaintiff favor and may dismiss the complaint only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.harris city of new york,cir.employing this standard here,we conclude that the complaint was properly dismissed.
appellant asserts claims under section a of the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder.section a makes it unlawful to solicit proxies in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.a.rule,in turn,prohibits proxy solicitation by means of any proxy statement containing any statement which,at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made,is false or misleading with respect to any material fact,or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading.a.in the context of a proxy statement,a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.virginia bankshares,sandberg,d quoting tsc industries,northway,d see also minzer keegan,cir citing tsc industries,at.
thus,omission of information from a proxy statement will violate these provisions if either the sec regulations specifically require disclosure of the omitted information in a proxy statement,or the omission makes other statements in the proxy statement materially false or misleading.here,appellant contends that defendants are liable under both theories of corporate malfeasance.
item of schedule,provides that,when proxies are solicited for an election of directors or for certain actions related to executive and director compensation,the proxy statement must include information specified in item of regulation,which,in turn,sets forth disclosure requirements with respect to various categories of executive and director compensation,including salaries,bonuses,stock option grants,and others.see.appellant argues that,by omitting the value of the options granted under the plan,symbol proxy statement failed to comply with subsection g of item,which describes mandatory disclosures about director compensation as follows
