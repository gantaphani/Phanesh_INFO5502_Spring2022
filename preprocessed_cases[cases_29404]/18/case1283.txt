sections and of the business and professions code prohibit certain business and financial relationships between registered dispensing opticians and licensed optometrists.we granted review in this case to consider whether the health care service plan act of health,et act creates an exemption to these prohibitions when a licensed specialized health care service plan sublets space within the retail stores of a registered dispensing optician and employs optometrists to provide professional optometric services to plan subscribers at those locations.the court of appeal held that although the provisions of the act establish an exemption to the rule against the corporate practice of optometry,they do not affect the statutory prohibitions on the relationships between registered dispensing opticians and licensed optometrists.on the facts of this case,we agree with the court of appeal conclusion.we therefore affirm the court of appeal judgment.
factual and procedural background 
california law authorizes optometrists licensed by the california board of optometry and physicians licensed by the medical board of california medical board to perform eye examinations and write prescriptions for contacts and eyeglasses.see bus.after receiving a prescription,a consumer may get the prescription filled not only by optometrists and physicians who sell eyewear as part of their practice,but also by registered dispensing opticians rdo,dispensing opticians registered with the division of licensing of the medical board.see bus.
california law contains restrictions on the relationships that licensed optometrists and physicians may have with others involved in providing optical services,including rdo.at issue here are the restrictions contained in business and professions code sections and.the former prohibits licensed optometrists from having any membership,proprietary interest,coownership,relationship,or any arrangement in any form,directly or indirectly,with an rdo or with any person who is engaged in the manufacture,sale,or distribution to physicians and surgeons,optometrists,or dispensing opticians of lenses,frames,optical supplies,optometric appliances or devices or kindred products and rdo from having any such arrangement with a licensed optometrist.bus,subds.a,b,c.any violation of this section constitutes a misdemeanor as to the licensed optometrist involved in the violation and as to any and all persons who participate with the optometrist in the violation.bus.business and professions code section,as here relevant,makes it unlawful for rdo to advertise the furnishing of,or to furnish,the services of an optometrist,or to directly or indirectly employ or maintain on or near the premises used for optical dispensing,an optometrist.any person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.bus.courts have described the basic aim of these statutes as being the elimination of the chance of dominion of the professional decisions of the practitioner by commercial interest.drucker state bd.of med.examiners d.
california law also restricts the relationships that optometrists may have with corporations.in general,under california policy against the corporate practice of the learned professions,corporations may not engage in the practice of medicine.people pacific health cal d,pacific health.the ban on the corporate practice of medicine generally precludes than licensed medical providing medical care through either salaried employees or independent contractors.conrad medical bd.of california th,d discussing exceptions.it has been held applicable with respect to optometrists.california of dispensing opticians pearle vision center,d.cado.courts have said that the ban on the corporate practice of medicine is intended to ameliorate the evils of divided loyalty and impaired confidence which are thought to be created when a corporation solicits medical business from the general public and turns it over to a special group of doctors,who are thus under lay control.conrad medical bd.of california,supra,th at,d.
defendant pearle,operates optical stores across the country where,in a single location,consumers may obtain not only frames and contact lenses,but also eye examinations and other treatment from licensed optometrists.in the late and early,pearle vision centers,which was the operating subsidiary of pearle,corporate predecessor,attempted to bring this business model to california,by selling franchises to optometrists licensed in california.the california association of dispensing opticians sued pearle vision centers,arguing that its franchise program violated california law.the superior court issued both a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction prohibiting pearle vision centers,from offering franchises to optometrists in california.cado,supra,d at.in,a court of appeal upheld the superior court order,finding in part that by virtue of the control pearle vision centers,retained under the franchise agreement,it was engaging in the illegal corporate practice of optometry cado,supra,d at.
in,with the case against pearle vision centers,still pending,the pearle entities adopted a new strategy for bringing their operations to california as defendants here explained in the court of appeal,i nstead of franchising its stores to licensed optometrists,the pearle entities divided their operations in california in two,with defendant pearle vision,providing the services of opticians and a separate corporation,defendant pearle visioncare,employing optometrists and providing their services under the act.pearle vision,pearle rdo is an rdo as such,it provides eyeglasses,contacts,and related fitting services using prescriptions written by licensed optometrists and ophthalmologists.bus.pearle visioncare visioncare is a licensed specialized health care service plan under the act,which means that it undertakes to arrange for the provision of health care services in a single specialized area to subscribers or enrollees,or to pay for or to reimburse any part of the cost for those services,in return for a prepaid or periodic charge paid by or on behalf of the subscribers or enrollees,subd.f.operating under a license issued by the director of the department of managed health care dmhc see,visioncare provides,through licensed optometrists it employs or contracts with,eye examinations to individuals who pay a set enrollment fee.visioncare optometrists provide these examinations inside pearle rdo retail stores,in distinct areas set off from the rest of the store,at some locations by separate doors or internal walls.visioncare sublets these areas from pearle rdo.to perform examinations,visioncare optometrists use optometric equipment provided by pearle rdo.thus,as defendants explained in the court of appeal,since,pearle rdo and visioncare have been operating in california in parallel within the same storefronts,the pearle vision stores.
pearle rdo and visioncare are sister corporations they are both wholly owned subsidiaries of pearle.pearle,sole assets are shares of visioncare and pearle rdo.thus,pearle,through its subsidiaries,operates retail outlets where customers can get both eye examinations from are employed by glasses from an rdo.pearle rdo advertises the availability of eye examinations at its retail optical stores some of these advertisements state that eye examinations are performed by independent doctors of optometry,or that doctors in california are employed by visioncare.according to defendants,pearle rdo and visioncare adopted this business model in order to provide consumers with integrated optical services by offering optometrists services in close proximity to affiliated eyewear stores operated by rdo 
in february,the people filed this action against pearle,pearle rdo,visioncare,other related entities,and individuals who allegedly had served as officers directors of these entities.in their first amended complaint,the people alleged in relevant part that pearle rdo had violated business and professions code section by disseminating advertisements that were untrue or misleading in that they implied that pearle rdo can and does provide optometric services including eye examinations and the services of optometrists,when in fact pearle rdo is prohibited by law from providing such services and maintaining an optometrist on or near its premises that pearle rdo had violated business and professions code section,in turn,business and professions code section,which prohibits unfair competition in the form of an unlawful business advertising the furnishing of optometrists and maintaining optometrists for the purpose of examining and treating eyes on or near premises used for optical dispensing and that pearle rdo relationship with visioncare and visioncare optometrists violates business and professions code section and,in turn,business and professions code section.for relief,the people requested that the court impose civil penalties for the alleged violations and permanently enjoin pearle rdo and visioncare from disseminating false or misleading advertising and from violating business and professions code sections and.
in april,the people moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting pearle rdo from violating business and professions code section by advertising the furnishing of optometric services,including eye examinations.in opposition,defendants argued that the challenged advertisements were not untrue,misleading or unlawful,because they specified that all eye examinations are performed,not by pearle rdo,but by optometrists employed by visioncare.in july,the superior court granted the motion and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting pearle rdo from disseminating advertisements in california that have the tendency or capacity to mislead the unwary or trusting consumer that pearle rdo employs optometrists within the state of california.regarding the latter prohibition,the court added the following proviso a ny pearle rdo advertisement which references eye examination s,exam s,examination s,doctor s,optometrist s,or uses the image of a doctor is not enjoined if it prominently and,in close proximity to such word or image,states or displays pearle rdo does not employ doctors of optometry and does not provide eye exams in california.visioncare,a licensed vision health care service plan,provides eye exams in california.
defendants appealed from the order granting the preliminary injunction,arguing in part that the act relieves specialized health care service plans of restrictions on employing doctors,optometrists,and other health care professionals by providing in section,subdivision b section b that plans licensed under the act shall not be deemed to be engaged in the practice of a profession,and may employ,or contract with,any professional to deliver services.the people,arguing that the preliminary injunction did not go far enough and,under business and professions code section,should have prohibited all advertising by pearle rdo that mentions eye examinations,regardless of the inclusion of a disclaimer stating that visioncare,rather than pearle rdo,provides eye examinations.regarding section b,the people argued that this provision merely establishes an exception regarding the corporate practice of optometry and does not change the laws that separate the practice of optometry from dispensing retailers or permit opticians to practice or advertise the practice of optometry.
after the parties completed their briefing,the second district court of appeal,in a published opinion,addressed related questions in consumer cause,national vision,which we ordered depublished march,consumer cause.that case involved an rdo that had set up optician centers in retail stores and,through a subsidiary licensed as a specialized health care service plan,had provided the services of licensed optometrists and ophthalmologists in separate but nearby offices within the retail stores.the court of appeal held that health and safety code section expressly exempted both the licensed specialized health care service plan and its parent company,the rdo,from the restrictions of business and professions code sections and.
the parties in this case,at the court of appeal request,submitted additional briefs addressing the relevance of consumer cause.after receiving those briefs and hearing oral argument,the court of appeal held that the trial court had properly enjoined pearle rdo advertising,but had erred in allowing pearle rdo to advertise eye examinations with a disclaimer.it thus ordered the superior court to expand the injunction to prohibit all advertising by pearle rdo of optometric services.in so holding,the court expressly disagreed with consumer cause and concluded,based on the plain language of the statute,that section b only provide s an exception for corporations from the requirement that optometrists may only be employed by professional corporations.it does not,the court stated,either expressly or impliedly create an exemption from the restrictions on relationships between and retailers provided in business and professions code sections or.
we granted the petition for review filed by pearle rdo and visioncare,limiting the issue to whether the act exempt s approved providers under the act from the limitations that business and professions code sections and otherwise impose on business and financial relationships between dispensing opticians and optometrists or ophthalmologists.we simultaneously ordered that the decision in consumer cause not be published 
discussion 
this case requires us to determine the meaning and interrelationship of several statutes.as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.people murphy cal th,d.the rules for performing this task are well established.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.ibid.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation rather,we look to the entire substance of the statutes in order to determine their scope and purposes.ibid.that is,we construe the words in question in context,keeping in mind the statutes nature and obvious purposes.ibid.we must harmonize the various parts of the enactments by considering them in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.ibid.if the statutory language is unambiguous,then its plain meaning controls.if,however,the language supports more than one reasonable construction,then we may look to extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.in re young cal th,d.
the statutory language supports the people interpretation.
as often happens in cases involving statutory interpretation,both sides in this case argue that the plain meaning of the statutory language supports their position.the statute the parties focus on is section b,which provides plans licensed under this chapter shall not be deemed to be engaged in the practice of a profession,and may employ,or contract with,any professional licensed pursuant to division commencing with section of the business and professions code to deliver professional services.employment by or a contract with a plan as a provider of professional services shall not constitute a ground for disciplinary action against a health professional licensed pursuant to division commencing with section of the business and professions code by a licensing agency regulating a particular health care profession.
defendants assert that the plain language of this provision makes it clear that plans are exempted from the restrictions found in business and professions code sections and they reason as follows as here relevant,business and professions code sections and apply only to relationships of or with licensed professional optometrists.the first clause of section b,by providing that plans are not engaged in the practice of a profession,establishes that plans are not licensed professional optometrists.because,under the first clause,a plan itself is not a professional,it is not subject to statutory restrictions that apply to individual professionals,including business and professions code sections or.the second clause of section b reinforces this conclusion by grant ing plans the authority to employ or contract with any professional licensed pursuant to division of the business and professions code,both optometrists and rdo.this clause unconditional ly authoriz es plans to employ or contract with any health care professional and specifically permit s them to establish various employment and contractual relationships with both optometrists and rdo,notwithstanding business and professions code sections and.finally,the second sentence of section b,in providing that e mployment by or a contract with a plan as a provider of professional services shall not constitute a ground for disciplinary action against a licensed health professional,establishes that professionals may contract with plans and that neither an optometrist nor an rdo who is employed by or contracts with a plan is in violation of business and professions code section or section.
according to defendants,t he net effect of these plainly written provisions is to exempt the relationships challenged in this case from the limitations on business and financial relationships between rdo and optometrists contained in business and professions code sections and.taken together,they specifically negate anything in business and professions code sections and that would make it illegal for an optometrist to be employed by a plan that contracts with an rdo or optical company,or for an rdo to contract with a plan that employs optometrists.as here relevant,they establish that a plan employing an optometrist may lease space from an optical company because the status of plans as,reinforced by the right of plans to contract with professionals to provide professional services,renders business and professions code section inapplicable to a lease of space to a plan and optometrists and rdo who enter into these arrangements with visioncare can not be disciplined under business and professions code sections or for doing so.
defendants also make the broader claim that through section b,the legislature specifically designed the act to make traditional corporate practice restrictions inapplicable to plans.in place of these restrictions,defendants assert,the legislature made plans subject to a comprehensive regulatory scheme designed in substantial part to address precisely the same concern commercial interference with optometrists professional judgment.according to defendants,business and professions code sections and are precisely the type of corporate practice restrictions that the legislature intended to override for health care service plans.
consistent with the court of appeal holding,the people argue that the plain language of section b create s only a narrow employment exemption and not the broad based commercial practice exemption defendants assert.according to the people,the first sentence of this provision is aimed at plans and clarifie s that such plans are not subject to prosecution for the unauthorized practice of the healing arts merely because they employ or contract with professionals for the delivery of services to members.prior to,this arrangement was unlawful.the provision second sentence,the people argue,is aimed at licensed professional providers,and simply establishes a complementary exemption for qualifying professional person s from the historical prohibition against working for.thus,although the people agree that section b both authorizes plans to employ or contract with rdo and optometrists,and establishes that plans are not professionals,they disagree that it relieve s plans or their providers here,visioncare optometrists from any other obligations imposed upon them by the business and professions code.nor do the people agree that section b relieve s pearle rdo,by virtue of its association with visioncare,of the limitations in business and professions code section on financial relationships with optometrists or the prohibition in business and professions code section against advertising the furnishing of optometric examinations.in short,the people argue,visioncare status as a plan does not shield its providers from their obligations under the business and professions code.
in evaluating these conflicting interpretations,it is useful to begin by examining defendants alternative characterizations of business and professions code section and as relationship restrictions,restrictions,restrictions,or corporate practice restrictions.in a report to the legislature,the california department of consumer affairs dca identified four different types of c ommercial practice restrictions relating to optometry p rohibitions against the employment of optometrists by commercial corporations p rohibitions against relationships between optometrists and opticians r estrictions on the number of branch offices an optometrist can operate and r estrictions on the use of trade names.dca,commercial practice restrictions in optometry introduction dca report.in a rulemaking proceeding,the federal trade commission ftc identified these same types of s tate restrictions on commercial practice,although it characterized the first two as different forms of a broader type of restriction on lay affiliations with optometrists.thus,it appears that california ban on the corporate practice of,employment of optometrists by its restrictions in business and professions code section and on the relationships optometrists may have with rdo and manufacturers,are properly characterized as different types of commercial practice restrictions.
with this understanding in mind,we agree with the people reading of the statutes in question.defendants broad claim that the legislature enacted health and safety code section b specifically to make restrictions like business and professions code sections and inapplicable to plans finds little support in the statutory language.as the people observe,the language of section b mentions only employment and contracting relationships between plans and providers,and contains no mention of other,commercial relationship exemptions and no reference to business and professions code sections and.as the people also observe,the language of business and professions code sections and extends well beyond employment and contracting relationships and forbids a variety of acts,such as profit sharing,proprietary interests and stock ownership.thus,as the people argue,adopting defendants broad claim would require us to find that the legislature intend ed to create an unstated exemption by implication to allow plans or their providers to do business outside the parameters of other commercial practice restrictions,including business and professions code section and.had the legislature intended section b to apply to all forms of lay affiliations with optometrists,as defendants contend,it would not have used language limited to employ ing,or contract ing with licensed professionals to deliver professional services.b.
in this regard,section b stands in marked contrast to the immediately preceding subdivision,section,subdivision a,which provides that plans may advertise n otwithstanding article commencing with section of chapter of division of the business and professions code.had the legislature intended to create the broad exemption defendants posit,it no doubt would have included similar language in section b.that the legislature did not include such language suggests it did not intend to establish a broad exemption rendering inapplicable any provision of the business and professions code that could be classified as a corporate practice or relationship restriction.it is unlikely the legislature would have established such a exemption without being more specific about the particular restrictions being overridden,especially given the specificity of the language it used in subdivision a of section.
defendants broad claim is also inconsistent with other provisions of the act.as noted above,among the types of commercial practice restrictions are restrictions on using trade names and having branch offices.in separate provisions of the act,the legislature has specified that california statutory restrictions on using trade names remain applicable to specialized health care service plans like visioncare,subd.b,and that the restrictions in the business and professions code on the number of branch offices remain applicable to licensed professional s who are employed by,or under contract to,a plan,subd.d.in still another provision,the legislature has specified that e xcept as specifically provided in the act,nothing in the act shall be construed to limit the effect of the laws governing professional corporations,as they appear in applicable provisions of the business and professions code,upon specialized health care service plans,subd.f,italics added.these provisions belie defendants claim that the legislature designed the act to render all corporate practice prohibitions inapplicable either to specialized plans like to licensed professionals performing professional services for those plans 
finally,defendants broad claim is inconsistent with the provisions of the business and professions code.the article of that code containing business and professions code section also contains provisions that prohibit specified licensed health care professionals from making referrals for certain services if they have a financial interest with the person or in the entity that receives the referral bus,subd.a billing for clinical laboratory service s not actually rendered by them or under their direct supervision,without identifying the laboratory actually performing the service,subd.a employ ing licensed hearing aid dispensers for the purpose of fitting or selling hearing aids,and billing for certain cytologic services not actually rendered by them or under their direct supervision,subd.a.as to each of these prohibitions,the legislature has enacted an express,but limited,exception that applies under certain circumstances where a plan is involved 
these express exceptions are significant for several reasons.first,as amicus curiae cma notes,they show that where the legislature want s to exempt health plans from commercial restrictions in the business and professions code,it clearly knows how to do so.the absence of similar provisions establishing express exceptions to business and professions code sections and makes defendants broad interpretation less plausible.second,the existence of these express exceptions is inconsistent with defendants view that section b renders,or was intended to render,all commercial practice restrictions in the business and professions code inapplicable where plans are involved were defendants correct,these express exemptions would be superfluous.the rules of statutory construction direct us to avoid,if possible,interpretations that render a part of a statute surplusage.see fontana unified school dist.burman cal d,stafford realty bond service cal d.finally,it is significant that the legislature,in expressly establishing exceptions to commercial practice restrictions appearing in the same article of the code as business and professions code section,made those exceptions limited.these express exceptions apply only to licensed professionals affiliated with a comprehensive group practice plan bus,or only to health care services provided to an enrollee of a plan,subd.i or to a member of a plan on a prepaid basis,subd.e,subd.d.that the legislature carefully limited the exemptions it expressly established casts substantial doubt on defendants broad claim that,through section b,the legislature implicitly established or intended to establish an unlimited exception that renders the commercial relationship restrictions in business and professions code section or business and professions code section wholly inapplicable when plans are involved.
indeed,the express exemptions discussed above highlight a practical problem with defendants position defining the scope of the exemption they assert.as the people rightly ask,under defendants interpretation,what happens to practitioners who provide services for both plan members as well as the general public does the exemption defendants assert apply to services such practitioners provide to those who are not members of the plan,or is it limited to services provided to plan enrollee s bus,subd.i or members,subd.e,subd.d.does it apply to optometrists and rdo affiliated with any plan,or only to those affiliated with a comprehensive group practice plan.may an optometrist and rdo employed by a plan,neither of whom is regulated under the act,enter into a separate and otherwise prohibited agreement just between the two of them as demonstrated by the limitations in the express statutory exemptions discussed above,these are the kinds of questions the legislature would address in establishing a exception to business and professions code sections or.defendants appear to argue that business and professions code sections and are wholly inapplicable to plans and professionals who contract with or are employed by plans.however,given the limitations on the express exceptions the legislature has enacted,we have no basis to accept defendants view that the legislature implicitly established,or intended to establish,an unlimited exception.nor have we any basis for determining which of the possible limitations the legislature would have chosen.
defendants argue that insofar as these express exceptions relate to statutory restrictions that were first enacted after passage of the act see fn,ante they have no bearing on the issue here.under such circumstances,they contend,it is not at all surprising that the statute would specifically address the new statute relationship with the act.by contrast,defendants assert,because business and professions code sections and were enacted before the act,there is no reason to expect they would include language addressing the effect of the act.
defendants argument is suspect in light of several legislative actions in.in,when the act was passed,business and professions code former section renumbered as business and professions code section as of january,declared it to be unprofessional conduct for a licensed optometrist to accept employment to practice optometry from any company or corporation.stats,ch.in,the legislature amended this statute to include a exception,by providing that n otwithstanding the provisions of this section or the provisions of any other law,a licensed optometrist may be employed to practice optometry by a health care service plan pursuant to the act.stats,ch.according to one legislative analysis,the purpose of this amendment was to conform business and professions code former section to language currently existing in the act,and to remove inconsistencies between certain statutory provisions regarding employment of optometrists.assem.subcom.on health personnel,analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended june.
the same year,the legislature also amended both business and professions code sections and,but those amendments did not include language referencing the act.stats,ch,stats,ch.the amendment to business and professions code section significantly strengthened that section prohibitions by deleting an exception for optometrists and rdo who do not refer patients and customers to each other,and adding subsection b to make explicit that the statute not only prohibits optometrists from having proprietary relationships with rdo,it likewise prohibits rdo from having proprietary relationships with optometrists.stats,ch.notably,the legislative history of the amendment contains no mention of the act,and no suggestion that business and professions code section is inapplicable where optometrists and rdo are employed by or contract with plans.on the contrary,several legislative analyses explained that the revised statute would prohibit any and all proprietary relationships between optometrists and rdo.legis.analyst,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june,democratic caucus,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,republican caucus,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,of finance,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.similarly,an opposition letter submitted on behalf of cole national corporation argued that the revised statute would prohibit any form of relationship between rdo and optometrists under any circumstances whatsoever.donald brown,advocation,letter to assemblymember daniel boatwright re assem.bill reg.sess.june.and,in a letter asking the governor to veto the passed bill,stanley pearle,as chairman of searle optical,argued that the revised statute would outlaw any relationship between an optician and optometrist and exclude opticians from making available to their customers shopping for both optometric services and optical goods.stanley pearle,letter to governor jerry brown re assem.bill reg.sess.these events undermine defendants assertion that there is no reason to expect language in business and professions code sections addressing the effect of the act.
defendants also err in asserting that the people interpretation,by making part of section b surplusage,violates our rules for construing statutes.according to defendants,because the second clause of section b first sentence expressly authorizes plans to employ,or contract with,any licensed professional,reading the entire sentence as only an authorization to hire licensed professionals gives no effect to the sentence first clause,which provides that p lans licensed under this chapter shall not be deemed to be engaged in the practice of a profession.b.however,as noted above,the people interpretation gives meaning to the first sentence first clause by acknowledging that it establishes that in providing health care services through licensed professionals,plans are not engaged in the practice of a profession.b.under california law,t he practice of optometry is the performing or the controlling of any of the acts set forth in business and professions code s ection.bus.thus,without the first clause of section b,a plan provision of optometric services through hired optometrists,though expressly authorized,would likely constitute the practice of optometry.under the people interpretation,the provision first clause definitively establishes otherwise thus,the people interpretation gives meaning to that clause,just not the expansive meaning defendants proffer a broad exemption from all the otherwise applicable restrictions in the business and professions code.
like their broad claim regarding section b,defendants discussion of the statute specific application in this case suffers from several problems.defendants are correct,and the people agree,that in light of the first clause of the plans shall not be deemed to be engaged in the practice of a profession ibid.visioncare itself is not a person licensed as an optometrist within the meaning of business and professions code section.however,as here relevant,business and professions code section,subdivisions a and b,prohibit licensed optometrists from having a relationship with rdo either directly or indirectly.although section b would appear to preclude a finding that pearle rdo and visioncare optometrists directly have a prohibited relationship within the meaning of business and professions code section,it does not preclude a finding that they indirectly have such a prohibited relationship 
nothing in section b supports defendants contrary position.as defendants acknowledge,that section authorizes plans to contract with professionals to provide professional services.italics added see b plans may contract with licensed professionals to deliver professional services.similarly,section b provides that a licensed professional may not be disciplined for contracting as a provider of professional services with a plan.pearle rdo rental agreement with visioncare does not constitute a contract to deliver professional services,and pearle rdo,as visioncare landlord,is not acting as a provider of professional services.b.although section b expressly authorizes plans to employ licensed optometrists to provide professional services,it does not provide that optometrists so employed may operate without regard to other professional restrictions.moreover,the act elsewhere provides that plans shall employ and utilize allied health manpower for the furnishing of services to the extent permitted by law,subd.f,italics added.in short,with respect to plans,section b removes only one preexisting restriction on licensed health care professionals the ban on employment by a corporation other than a medical corporation.nothing in its language establishes or suggests that it removes other restrictions on the relationships such professionals may have,such as the prohibition against directly or indirectly having a relationship with an rdo.bus.a licensed professional working for a plan who is disciplined for having such a prohibited relationship is not being disciplined for that employment,but for additionally having a prohibited relationship.
defendants discussion of business and professions code section fares no better.again,defendants are correct that,in light of health and safety code section b,visioncare itself is not an optometrist within the meaning of business and professions code section.however,contrary to defendants claim,this fact does not establish that pearle rdo does not directly or indirectly employ or maintain on or near the premises for optical dispensing an optometrist within the meaning of business and professions code section.
defendants contrary analysis of the statutory language is unpersuasive.defendants argue that the second clause of section b plainly authorizes relationships like visioncare,and that whatever the phrase indirectly employ or maintain on or near the premises means bus,it can not apply to optometric services provided by a plan,pursuant to express statutory language allowing the plan to provide such services and exempting it from restrictions applicable to professionals.defendants are incorrect as explained above,section b authorizes plans to contract with licensed professionals to deliver professional services,not,as defendants contend,to lease space in rdo retail optical stores.as a landlord,pearle rdo simply is not acting as a provider of professional services.b.
finally,we reject defendants assertion that because business and professions code sections and carry misdemeanor penalties,we should apply the rule that directs courts to resolve ambiguities in penal statutes in the defendant favor.that rule applies only if the court can do no more than guess what the legislative body intended.people avery cal th,d.it does not apply unless two reasonable interpretations of the same provision stand in relative equipoise ibid,that the defendant proposed interpretation is at least as plausible as that of the people.citations.people hammer cal th,fn,d.because,for the reasons stated above,defendants interpretation is not equally plausible,the rule is inapplicable 
extrinsic sources do not support defendants interpretation.
although asserting that the plain language of section b is dispositive,defendants also rely heavily on various extrinsic sources.as explained below,defendants discussion of these sources is unpersuasive.
prior administrative construction 
defendants assert that t he agencies charged with administering the act have applied defendants understanding of the act for almost two decades.in support of their argument,defendants rely principally on a petition the attorney general filed,as counsel for the california board of optometry,with ftc in,and on internal memoranda of the medical board division of licensing and the department of corporations doc,which was originally charged with administering the act.
defendants reliance on these documents is unavailing.how much,if any,deference we give the type of administrative interpretation defendants cite depends on a complex of factors material to the substantive legal issue before us,the particular agency offering the interpretation,and the comparative weight the factors ought in reason to command.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.several of the relevant factors indicate that deference is unwarranted here.first,the ftc petition and the internal agency memoranda were not contemporaneous with enactment of the relevant statutes id.at,d,they were all prepared years later.second,none of these documents discusses the relevant statutory language or reflects careful consideration of the precise issue before us.ibid.third,the internal memoranda,which are essentially advice letters prepared by individual staff members,are not entitled to the deference we afford a regulation adopted after public notice and comment.ibid.finally,the issue here is the construction of statutes,and we generally are less inclined to defer to an agency interpretation of a statute than to its interpretation of a regulation.citation.bonnell medical board cal th,d.here,we have no reason to believe the agencies in question have a comparative interpretive advantage over the courts in interpreting the relevant statutes.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.for these reasons,the documents defendants cite do not persuade us to adopt defendants interpretation 
nor are we persuaded by defendants more general assertion that since,california regulators have either expressly approved,or failed to object to,the operation of specialized vision care plans affiliated with optical companies that are rdo.as the people point out,no state agency has ever promulgated a regulation or issued a formal opinion interpreting the act to create an exemption to business and professions code sections or.and,as we stated over years ago in rejecting a similar argument by a dentist who sought to overturn his suspension for aiding the unlawful corporate practice of dentistry,d elayed action on the part of those who are charged with the execution of laws will not be permitted to annul the law.it may be considered by the court as a reason for the mitigation of punishment,but the judicial department is not absolutely bound to regard it.painless parker board of dental examiners cal,painless parker.ultimately,the interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts to decide reno baird cal th,d.
legislative history 
defendants rely in part on the legislative history of the act,which was enacted through passage of assembly bill reg.sess.they cite statements in an assembly third reading analysis that the act opens licensure to organizations which were prohibited under earlier registration procedure,and that regulating performance regardless of the corporate status is seen as a more logical way to control abuses.assem.third reading analysis,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
contrary to defendants assertion,these statements provide little,if any,support for defendants broad interpretation.to the extent they explain that the act permits corporations to deliver health care services,these statements are fully consistent with the people view that section b simply exempts plans from the rule that otherwise prohibits corporations from employing licensed health care professionals to provide health care services.the same is true regarding the comment about the benefits of regulation,viewed in context.the assembly third reading analysis explained that,although existing law prohibited licensing of organizations,such entities were find ing their way into the system via subsidiary management and supply companies to a nonprofit corporate shell.assem.third reading analysis,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended april.consequently,because entities were finding ways to avoid existing prohibitions regulating performance regardless of the corporate status was seen as a more logical way to control abuses than prohibiting entities from providing health care services.ibid.again,this discussion is fully consistent with the people view that section b simply exempts plans from the rule against corporations employing licensed health care professionals.it does not indicate a more expansive intent to eliminate all other restrictions on the relationships that licensed health care professionals may have 
indeed,a complete review of the act voluminous legislative history does not support defendants broad interpretation of section b and generally supports the people more limited reading of that section.the legislative analyses consistently stressed two key aspects of the act a new licensing and expanded regulatory structure governing health care service plans and a transfer of regulatory authority from the attorney general to the department of corporations.assem.com.on health,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.some,but not all,of the analyses also briefly noted,with little or no discussion,that the act would change existing law by allowing corporations to operate as licensed health care services plans.id.at assem.off.of research,third reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,assem.com.on ways means,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,com.on health welfare,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.however,nowhere in the limited discussion of this change is there any mention of an intent to sweep away all other restrictions on commercial relationships in the business and professions code.nor is there any discussion of the pros and cons of maintaining or creating an exemption from any other relationship restriction.instead,consistent with the people interpretation,the relevant discussion indicates no more than an intent to establish an exception to only one such restriction the prohibition against corporations employing licensed health care professionals to provide health care services.had the legislature intended to enact the broad and sweeping exemption defendants assert,the legislative history would,no doubt,contain some mention of that intent.
statutory purpose 
defendants argue that their interpretation is strongly supported by the purposes of the act,specifically,to preserv e the quality of care,to ensur e easy access to care,and to reduc e health care costs through competition.defendants assert that adopting the people view would cause serious harm to consumers,without any offsetting benefit.in making their argument,defendants rely principally on a finding by the ftc,based largely on earlier studies,that because commercial practice restrictions increase prices and thus reduc e the frequency with which consumers obtain vision care,they decrease the overall quality of care without provid ing offsetting benefits.defendants also rely on a finding by the dca,based on ftc data,that california commercial practice restrictions would cost california consumers million in.dca,supra,executive summary,defendants argue that,in light of these findings,their interpretation would promote the act purposes,whereas the people interpretation would defeat those purposes by inflict ing sharply higher costs,reduced services,and care on california consumers.
the premise of defendants commercial practice restrictions increase prices and reduce the overall quality of care by decreasing the frequency of to be open to question.the people,citing several analyses and scholarly criticisms,challenge not only the findings of the ftc and the dca,but also the methodology and objectivity of the earlier studies on which those findings were based.the people also argue that even were these underlying studies correct when done,the almost old data from those studies and the ftc finding based on that data have little relevance to california current vision care market.
this policy debate was before our legislature in when it strengthened business and professions code section see d,ante,and again in and when it rejected proposals to repeal some or all of the prohibitions in that section and in business and professions code section.the relevant legislative history demonstrates that defendants corporate predecessors participated in those proceedings,opposing the legislation and supporting the unsuccessful repeal proposals based on the same arguments and studies defendants offer here thus,defendants are now inviting us to resolve in their favor an old policy debate based on arguments and studies that have,thus far,failed to move the legislature.we decline the invitation.in light of the legislative history and the contrary studies the people of which was published in have no basis for concluding that the legislature agrees with defendants view or that the findings on which defendants rely were accurate when made more than years ago,are accurate now,or are now or ever were applicable to california vision care market instead,we leave this policy debate with the body to which it rightly belongs the legislature,which has the ability to gather empirical evidence,solicit the advice of experts,and hold hearings at which all interested parties may present evidence and express their views.foley interactive data cal d,fn.
defendants also assert that their interpretation is consistent with another purpose of the act to prevent commercial influence on professional judgment through comprehensive regulatory oversight rather than by structural prohibitions on with whom a plan may affiliate.in making this argument,defendants first assert that the corporate practice restrictions barring corporations from the health care field are expressly based on concern that professional judgment may be influenced by the profit motive of the corporation employer,and that the legislature expressly abolished this bar for companies,based on the judgment that in the context it is more logical to control abuses by regulating performance pursuant to a comprehensive regulatory scheme.defendants then assert that because the concerns cited as the basis for business and professions code sections and are almost identical to those which underlie corporate practice prohibitions,we should construe health and safety code section b also to abolish the prohibitions in business and professions code sections and where plans are involved.according to defendants,i n view of the act express focus on protecting professional independence,no purpose other than protecting the business interests of optometrists and reducing the availability of vision care to california consumers would be served by applying business and professions code sections and in the context.
we believe that we should leave to the legislature the decision whether the justification for exempting plans from the prohibition against employing optometrists also warrants an exemption from the prohibitions of business and professions code sections and.to paraphrase one of our prior decisions,t he question before us is,of course,one of statutory construction and we do not decide whether the legislature in should have established this exemption or whether it should do so now.that is a public policy issue properly left to the legislature our holding must be based on the act as it is written,not on a different,perhaps broader,version that could have been,or still may be,enacted.citation.public policy,however,is a relevant,albeit secondary,consideration for our decision in the present case.we are asked in this case to decide whether the legislature intended to abolish a legal doctrine that raises significant public policy considerations.we are not persuaded the legislature would have silently,or at best obscurely,decided so important and controversial a public policy matter and created a significant departure from the existing law.in re christian cal th,d.
for similar reasons,we reject defendants policy arguments for deferring to what they claim has been the accepted administrative practice for nearly two decades.according to defendants,i t is extremely important for plans to be able to develop their products and plans knowing that there is but a single set of state law standards they must satisfy,and with the understanding that actions approved by their designated state permissible and may be undertaken with confidence.defendants assert that by now adopting the people interpretation,we would frustrate this need for thus defeat the purposes of the act by rais ing the specter of later intervention by the attorney general to declare unlawful and seek penalties for activity and structures long approved by the doc and dmhc.defendants also more broadly assert that adopting the people interpretation will deter investment in california,by undermining confidence in the stability of the legal structures under which businesses operate,and contributing to a perception that california legal climate is unfriendly to business and makes this state a risky place to invest or operate.these arguments,which are unrelated to the language of the governing statutes,should be directed to the legislature.as stated earlier,we must take the law as it is written,and d elayed action on the part of those who are charged with its execution will not be permitted to annul it.painless parker,supra,cal.at.thus,we leave it to the legislature to determine whether defendants policy arguments merit modification of the law

for the reasons discussed above,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
all further unlabeled statutory references are to the health and safety code.
defendants claim there is strong evidence that the commonly cited justification for business and professions code sections and is a pretense,and that the statutes were really legislation designed to prevent competition with private optometrists who profit by selling eyewear to their patients.defendants state that this issue was raised below in a counterclaim that was dismissed,and is separately being litigated by other parties in federal court.however,in this court,defendants do not pursue this claim and assume arguendo that the statutes stated justification is true.we express no view on the issue.

like defendants,for convenience,we will use the term plan to refer to a health care service plan licensed under the act.
in a footnote,defendants argue that their interpretation is confirmed by the last paragraph of business and professions code former section,renumbered as business and professions code section as of january,which provides notwithstanding the provisions of this section or the provisions of any other law,a licensed optometrist may be employed to practice optometry by a health care service plan pursuant to the act.it appears,however,that the legislature added this exemption in simply to bring the relevant provision of the business and professions code in line with the authorization in health and safety code section b.in describing this change,one legislative analysis stated business and professions code former s ection is being amended to include language currently existing in the health and safety code,sections through no change in law is taking place.com.on business and professions,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.indeed,notwithstanding their argument,defendants acknowledge that this language was added as part of a general bill to correct antiquated language and bring the optometry chapter of the business and professions code up to date.

that the legislature addressed the various types of commercial practice restrictions in these separate provisions of the act also further undermines defendants view that although section b,on its face,addresses only one type of prohibition against corporations employing or contracting with licensed nevertheless addresses a different type of restriction,t
