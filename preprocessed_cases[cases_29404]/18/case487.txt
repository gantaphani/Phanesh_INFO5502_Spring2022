this suit arises from a ceo lie about finishing college.specifically,bryan mitchell mitchell,the founder and leader of mcg capital corporation mcg or the company misled his company into believing that he was awarded a college degree when,in truth,he never obtained one.as a result,mcg misrepresented mitchell educational background in the documents it publicly filed for investors.once mitchell came clean,mcg corrected its statements.mcg stock price dipped sharply once the truth was revealed,and shortly thereafter it found itself defending this class action lawsuit brought by mcg shareholders in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.the stock owners pursued claims against mcg under a of the securities act of,of the securities exchange act of,and sec rule,and against several individual defendants,including mitchell,under the liability provisions of the respective securities statutes.on september,the district court dismissed the case,finding as a matter of law that mitchell education was immaterial.while we freely acknowledge that mitchell conduct is indefensible,we agree that the actual fact misrepresented was immaterial under the securities laws.therefore,we affirm.
mcg is an arlington,venture capital firm that makes debt and equity investments in small and private businesses in the media,communications,technology,and information services sectors the company has been traded publicly since its initial public offering ipo in late.
following about a decade of experience at two banks,in mitchell helped found mcg and began his tenure as the company ceo and chairman of the board.the appellees admit that mitchell held himself out as having earned a bachelor degree in economics from syracuse university the truth,however,is that mitchell attended syracuse for three years and studied economics,but left before getting his degree.
mcg included mitchell purported educational background in various forms filed with the sec in preparation for its ipo as an example,the biographical information section of the registration statements and prospectus prospectus stated 
bryan mitchell has served as our chief executive officer since and as the chairman of our board of directors since may.mitchell has served as a member of our board of directors since and also served as our president from to may.from to,mitchell was a senior vice president for first union national bank.from to,mitchell was employed by signet bank where he served as a senior vice president.mitchell serves on the board of directors of mcg finance corporation and mcg finance corporation ii.mitchell earned a in economics from syracuse university.
prospectus at emphasis added.the brief biographical statements about mcg managers were,of course,merely one part of mcg filings other extensive information existed.aside from this single sentence,repeated in various forms,however,appellants allege no other misstatements.
after apparent pressure by herb greenberg greenberg,a reporter with the website who questioned mitchell actual history,mitchell told the truth to mcg board on november.later that same day,mcg publicly corrected mitchell misrepresentation through a press release,which read 
mcg capital corporation announced today that its chairman and chief executive officer,bryan mitchell,informed the company board of directors this morning that contrary to prior disclosures,he does not hold a bachelor of arts degree from syracuse university.the board of directors has requested the chairman of the company audit committee,wallace millner,iii,to review the facts relating to these matters and to report to the full board as promptly as possible.
appellants assert that this announcement brought mcg negative attention in the investment world.specifically,they allege that an analyst for wachovia securities downgraded mcg to hold from buy on the day of the announcement,noting a worry that this misrepresentation foreshadowed larger credibility issues and that two reporters on cnn lou dobbs moneyline discussed the stock shortly after the company correction,noting that mitchell was another ceo that lied about his resume.appellants also note that greenberg questioned on whether other corrections were forthcoming.specifically,on november,greenberg wrote that,if the ceo disclosure is correct,you ca help but wonder what else is.he repeated this refrain in a november post ca help but wonder why sic credibility an admitted liar,of a ceo,will have going forward.and ca help but wonder what else at the company has been,shall we say,embellished.finally,on november,greenberg opined in an article about mcg that,w hen a ceo lies about his educational background you have to wonder what else might not be right.
it is plainly plausible that,at least temporarily,investors ingested or shared these financial pundits concerns about the company credibility in the wake of the corrective announcement.the stock dipped to from per share on november.the full price history of the stock,however,complicates the case the next day,the stock regained approximately half of the previous day loss,and the remainder of its losses were recovered within about a month 
while mitchell was an undoubtedly important person for mcg he was by no means above its punishment.on november,the board withheld mitchell and bonuses,made him repay monies loaned to him by mcg,and removed his title as chairman of the board.mitchell remains stripped of his title as chairman he retained and retains his position as ceo.
appellee.b motion to dismiss did not deny that mitchell credentials were misstated,but rather argued that whether mitchell finished his degree at syracuse was immaterial as a matter of law.concluding that the appellants can not use the credibility and integrity problems that result from a false statement to bootstrap an otherwise immaterial false statement into creating a basis for a securities fraud action,the district court dismissed the case.
a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim under.b is reviewed de novo.goldstein moatz,cir.in general,the motion should not be granted unless it appears certain that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would support its claim and would entitle it to relief.mylan,matkari,cir.
in order to prevail on a claim for securities fraud under either rule rule or section a of the securities act of,section a,the plaintiff must prove,inter alia,materiality.specifically,rule makes it unlawful to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading and carries with it a private right of action for the rule enforcement.likewise,section a creates a right of action for purchasers when a registration statement contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact 
here,an investment in close textual reading pays dividends.the plain language of rule and section a requires any successful suit to allege a fact that is both untrue and material.sometimes the term material misrepresentation is used in the context.as this case illustrates,however,this statement can be imprecise.material modifies fact it does not modify misrepresentation.this is deceptively simple.assuming other requirements for liability are satisfied,these laws prohibit any misrepresentation of a fact deemed material.but they decidedly do not prohibit any matter how willful,objectionable,or flatly im material facts,even if it induces reactions from investors that,in hindsight or otherwise,might make the misrepresentation appear material it follows that no matter the attendant outcry or opprobrium about a lie,if the specific fact misrepresented is immaterial,a suit can not succeed.
the seminal supreme court treatment of materiality in the context,found in basic,levinson,d,confirms this reading.in basic,the court expressly adopted the materiality rule of tsc,northway,d,and noted that,a plaintiff must show that the statements were misleading as to a material fact.it is not enough that a statement is false or incomplete,if the misrepresented fact is otherwise insignificant.basic,at emphasis in original.under basic and its progeny,a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at.see also phillips lci int l,cir noting even lies are not actionable unless the lie is something that alters the total mix of information available to a reasonable investor gasner bd.of supervisors,cir explaining that the question of materiality is an objective one.it is important to note that a reasonable investor is neither an ostrich,hiding her head in the sand from relevant information,nor a child,unable to understand the facts and risks of investing.see hillson partners adage,cir courts need not ascribe childlike simplicity to reasonable investor,but should ask whether investors would have considered information significant citing basic at.the total mix of information available varies on a and basis.however,in determining the total mix of information,a court ruling on a b motion may look to documents or articles cited in the complaint,sec filings,press releases,stock price tables,and other material on which the plaintiff allegations necessarily rely.morris wachovia,d,citing in re the first union.sec,d.
finally,cases note that determining materiality is a mixed question of law and fact.see tsc,at.when courts decide they wish for a jury to hear a claim,they generally take pains to emphasize the of materiality.see,id.at.the determination requires delicate assessments that are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.see also,thomas lee hazen,the law of securities regulation,ed collecting cases.appellants seize on to this fact and argue that,given the facts in the complaint,only a jury could make the assessment necessary and that the district court erred by dismissing the claim at an early stage of litigation.no shortage of cases,however,make clear that materiality may be resolved by a court as a matter of law.see,longman food lion,cir alleged omissions of federal labor law and unsanitary food practices were immaterial as a matter of law klein general nutrition,cir various alleged omissions from registration statement and prospectus were not material and could be decided as a matter of law hillson partners,at,noting that materiality was inquiry but dismissing suit as immaterial raab general physics,cir.the only requirement is that no reasonable jury could find it substantially likely that a reasonable investor would find the fact at issue material in the total mix of information.see,tsc,at.materiality is appropriately resolved as a matter of law when reasonable minds can not differ on the question.
thus,our task on an appeal of an order granting a motion to dismiss for want of materiality is as straightforward as it is awkwardly stated we must,resolving doubt in favor of appellants,decide whether a reasonable jury could find it substantially likely that a reasonable investor would believe that the disclosure of the untrue fact s and nothing but the disclosure of the untrue fact s would alter the total mix of information available to the reasonable investor.
appellants make a number of arguments,the best of which can be summarized roughly into three main points a as a key manager,mitchell education is a material fact b management integrity is always material and c the district court erred by confusing causation with materiality and by taking into account the price of the stock after november,the day of disclosure.we address,and dismiss,each contention in turn.
the misrepresentation of an executive educational credentials has seldom been addressed in published cases.even the closest case analogies seem somewhat difficult to apply here because,as noted above,materiality is a determination.those few cases notably,none from circuit courts discussing misrepresentation of an educational degree even obliquely,however,do not support appellants argument that misstatements about managers academic backgrounds are material.
indeed,no binding precedent exists,and the only case of which we are aware that deals explicitly with such a fraud by an executive dismisses that allegation as immaterial and takes pains to distinguish it from truly material facts.see new equity sec.holders comm.for golden gulf,phillips,distinguishing misrepresentation of a business degree,as immaterial,from the omission of recent felony conviction of director,prior and pending litigation against the company,and sec investigation of the company,as all material.
appellants,however,cite two district court cases in support of their claim that an individual education is material sec physicians guardian unit inv.trust,d and sec suter,c,wl.these cases are distinguishable.physicians guardian denies,in a notably conclusory fashion,a motion to dismiss an,action by the sec requesting emergency relief and alleging a multitude of outlandishly fraudulent activity.one of these many fraudulent activities by repeat offenders included that a manager falsely claimed to have a law degree and years of experience as a lawyer.d at.suter grants injunctive relief in a securities fraud action that contained,hiding among many other that are clearly more important,a claim that an investment adviser falsely claimed to have an mba wl at.
appellants contend that the failure of the courts in these two cases to tease out as immaterial the educational credential from the other frauds,as did the new equity court,is evidence that the courts found such misrepresentations material.this may be facially reasonable,but quickly becomes unpersuasive once one examines the opinions.in both cases the sec sought and obtained emergency injunctive relief from a long litany of ongoing fraudulent activity by repeat players in the fraud game.in each case,the courts appear overwhelmed with the fraudulent behavior alleged of the defendants.in short,neither court addresses in any specific fashion the materiality of the individual claim within the entire,action,but rather rules against the defendants en masse.here,in contrast,we are presented with the unusual circumstance that only one misrepresentation is alleged among uncountable other pieces of information in the prospectus,other filings,and elsewhere,making up the total mix of information.
while we do not hold as a matter of law that a key manager education could never be material,we do find that mitchell education is immaterial here.even limiting our view,as we must,to those materials relied upon by the appellants in formulating their complaint and those materials publicly available to reasonable investors,and viewing them in the light most favorable to the appellants,mitchell educational background could not be said to alter the total mix of this information.for example,a reasonable investor would likely value information found in mcg publicly filed statements and elsewhere including mitchell years of management in financial institutions the other board members and key managers similar track record the years of mcg earnings statements as a private company the firm ratio the general costs of capital and macroeconomic trends the strength of mcg potential competitors.in comparison,appellants have advanced no credible theory as to why a reasonable investor would consider what mitchell did or,as the case may be,did not do during what would have been his fourth year at syracuse to constitute something so important that it would alter this large body of information in short,the unavoidable conclusion one reaches is that,in an age of heightened sensitivity to corporate scandal some investors found,for a very short period of time,mcg stock to be damaged goods because the company credibility was suddenly suspect,and investors were concerned that revelations of other,more important fabrications were soon forthcoming 
happily,this realization affords us the opportunity to address appellants next argument.appellants cite a number of ultimately unavailing cases in their attempt to argue that mcg disclosure about mitchell implicated management integrity.the idea that mitchell integrity was brought into question
