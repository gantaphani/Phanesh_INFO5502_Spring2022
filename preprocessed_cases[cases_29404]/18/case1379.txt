two men enter into a real estate investment partnership,each acting in his capacity of trustee of a family trust.the question is who are the partners,the men,or the trusts the answer is the men.a trust of the type formed by both men in this case is simply a fiduciary relationship,governed by the probate code,by which one person or entity owns and controls property for the benefit of another.such a trust is not an entity separate from its trustee,and can not independently do anything it can not sue or be sued it can not enter into agreements and it can not fulfill the fiduciary duties of a partner.consequently,we agree with the conclusion of the trial court in this case,that the provision of the partnership agreement which required that upon the death of a partner,the partnership shall purchase his interest in the partnership,was triggered by the death of one of the two men.we affirm its judgment 
robert tepper and ronald presta invested in real estate together.they entered into three different partnership contracts,in,and,each one governing their investment in a separate described property.tepper and presta each entered into the contract in their individual capacities.however,they agreed to enter into both the and contracts in their capacities as trustees of their respective trusts all three of the agreements had identical provisions requiring that upon the death of a partner,the partnership shall purchase the entire partnership interest of the deceased partner in the partnership 
after tepper died,his widow,appellant renee tepper,agreed to sell his interest in the partnership in accordance with the death of a partner provision,but refused,in her capacity as successor trustee of the two trusts on whose behalf tepper had entered into the and partnership agreements,to sell the interests in those partnerships.renee took the position that it was the trusts,rather than the individuals,who were the partners in those latter agreements and since there had been no death of a trust partner,she could not be compelled to sell either of the trusts interests in its respective partnership.
presta disagreed with renee interpretation and sued for declaratory relief.the trial court,after considering the language of the partnership agreements which it considered to be ambiguous as well as extrinsic evidence offered by the parties,concluded that the death of a partner provision referred to the death of either of the two individual men,and entered a judgment declaring that renee was obligated to sell the trusts interests in the two partnerships to presta.
discussion 
each of the two partnership agreements at issue herein begins with the following language this partnership agreement is made and entered into as of date,by and among ronald presta as trustee for the ron presta revocable trust october,presta and robert tepper tepper as trustee for his trust the parties are sometimes hereinafter individually referred to as partner and collectively referred to as partners.
it is undisputed that tepper and presta devised this language by taking their first partnership agreement,which they had entered into as individuals in,and altering it so that each entered into the agreement in their capacities as trustees of their respective trusts.renee contends that this alteration demonstrates unequivocally that tepper and presta intended that their respective trusts,as opposed to they as individuals,would be the partners in both the and agreements.thus,her core assertion is that i n this case,the parties to the contract at issue were two trusts,which were the fictional entities created by the two men who had previously been partners in real estate development.italics added.
we can not say what tepper and presta subjective intentions may have been,but we have no trouble concluding,as a matter of law,that it was they,and not their respective trusts,who were the partners in the two agreements at issue herein.
the fundamental flaw in renee argument is that it assumes a trust is an entity,like a corporation,which is capable of entering into a business relationship such as a partnership.it is not.it has long been established under california law that an express trust of the type created by presta and tepper is merely a relationship by which one person or entity holds property for the benefit of some other person or entity a trust is any arrangement which exists whereby property is transferred with an intention that it be held and administered by the transferee trustee for the benefit of another eggert pacific states sav.loan d,citing estate of shaw cal.
this concept was more recently reiterated in california nevada annual conference of the united methodist church luke united methodist church th,d a trust is a fiduciary relationship with respect to property,subjecting the person by whom the title to the property is held to equitable duties to deal with the property for the benefit of another person,which arises as a result of a manifestation of an intention to create it.rest d trusts.a trust is created by a manifestation of intention of the settlor to create a trust,trust property,a lawful trust purpose,and an identifiable beneficiary.chang redding bank of commerce th,d.
the probate code governs the type of ordinary express trusts utilized by both presta and tepper in this case.probate code section provides several different methods of creating such a trust,including a a declaration by the owner of property that the owner holds the property as trustee.b a transfer of property by the owner during the owner lifetime to another person as trustee.c a transfer of property by the owner,by will or by other instrument taking effect upon the death of the owner,to another person as trustee.

renee nonetheless contends,in supplemental briefing filed after this court held oral argument,that california partnership law expressly allows a trust,as distinguished from its trustee,to fulfill the role of a partner.she points to corporations code,part of the uniform partnership act,which specifies that a partnership is an association of two or more persons and that such persons can include an individual,corporation,business trust,estate,trust,partnership,limited partnership,limited liability partnership,limited liability company,association,joint venture,government,governmental subdivision,agency,or instrumentality,or any other legal or commercial entity.corporations code section,subdivisions a
