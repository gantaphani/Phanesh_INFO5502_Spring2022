this is a tax case regarding availability of a loss deduction to a company whose left a controlled group.
the facts are undisputed,because the parties stipulated to them before the tax court,but the details are complex.here is a simplified summary.the appellant,unionbancal,is the of an american bank that once belonged to a group of affiliated british and american companies,considered a controlled group under federal tax law.while a part of this controlled group,the predecessor sold a loan portfolio at a loss to a british company in the group,standard chartered bank.a statute barred the predecessor from deducting its loss at that time,because standard was a member of the controlled group when the predecessor left the group,the statute still would let it deduct the loss because standard still owned the loans and was still in the group instead,the loss was deferred.standard later sold the loans to a party outside of the group,and at that time,the statute provided that the deferred loss could be restored.but the statute would let the predecessor take the loss as a deduction,because it had left the controlled group before the loans were sold outside of the group.the commissioner would have let standard take the loss as a basis in the portfolio,but that did do standard,a british firm,any good,because british tax authorities would recognize the basis.thus unionbancal predecessor incurred a loss,of sorts,when it was part of the controlled group and sold the loan portfolio to standard,that has never been reflected in any firm taxes,but has reduced the basis and thereby increased the taxable gain for standard.the predecessor million tax deficiency,for which unionbancal is responsible,is at issue.
the facts are hard to understand without the legal background.under a,no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any loss from the sale or exchange of property,directly or indirectly,between persons in certain relationships these relationships include,among others,those between family members individuals and the corporations they control the grantors or beneficiaries of a trust and its fiduciaries and t wo corporations which are members of the same controlled group,such as corporations in a chain 
the statute works like this.suppose you want to generate a tax loss without a real loss,so you sell to your wife for stock you bought for a share.it wo work.section a of the statute wo let you take the per share loss,because of your relationship but fortunately,when your wife sells the stock on the open market after it risen to,she gets to use your basis,not her basis,to calculate her taxable gain.she gets your basis because,although the statute prevents you from taking the sham loss you generated by selling the stock to her,it also says in section d that her gain shall be recognized only to the extent that it exceeds so much of such loss as is properly allocable to the property sold or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer.this limitation on deductions for transfers between related parties protects the fisc against sham transactions and manipulations without economic substance.not infrequently,though,there are honest and important reasons for sales between related parties,so it important to fairness to preserve the basis where loss on the sale itself is recognized for tax purposes.otherwise,the statute would be a,proposition for the irs the seller ca take his loss,but the irs calculates the buyer gain on resale using the lower basis.
a variant of this scheme applies to controlled groups,that is,corporations with interlocking ownership as specified by the statute instead of being disallowed under section a,the loss is deferred under section f until one of two conditions pertains either 
until the property is transferred outside such controlled group and there would be recognition of loss under consolidated return principles or 
until such other time as may be prescribed in regulations.
instead of the buyer getting the benefit of the loss as a basis,as in the example,the seller takes the loss as a deduction,but not until the buyer sells the property outside of the controlled group or until the regulations otherwise provide.unionbancal was a seller in such a controlled group when it sold its loan portfolio to standard at a loss,and unionbancal complains that the irs improperly denied the predecessor deduction for that loss.
unionbancal predecessor could take the loss because the predecessor left its controlled group before its buyer within the group sold the property to an outsider.in,the year the predecessor made the sale,the commissioner of internal revenue issued a temporary regulation under section f governing sales between controlled group members the temporary regulation provided that i f a selling member of property for which loss has been deferred ceases to be a member when the property is still owned by another member,then that loss shall never be restored to the selling member.
the temporary regulation never limitation still does create a,situation for the irs.when,under its provisions,a selling member may never take a loss,the regulation falls back on a rule analogous to that in the example the buyer within the controlled group gets to use the seller higher basis when the buyer resells the property outside of the group.the temporary regulation states on the date the selling member ceases to be a member,the owning member basis in the property shall be increased by the amount of the selling member unrestored deferred loss at the time it ceased to be a member thus,if unionbancal had bought the property for and sold it to standard for,and then left the controlled group while standard was still a member,the temporary regulation would let the predecessor take the loss,but it would let standard use unionbancal basis,rather than its basis,when it sold the property to an outsider.
in this case,however,because of the international character of the controlled group and the transaction,the temporary regulation really did create a,situation.unionbancal did get to take the loss as a deduction because of the temporary regulation never provision.but standard did get to use unionbancal basis,as american law allowed,because british law,which controlled standard tax liability,did allow it.unionbancal argues that this result demonstrates that the temporary regulation is contrary to both the legislative scheme and the british american tax treaty and that it should be allowed to take its predecessor loss as a deduction.
in,after unionbancal predecessor left the controlled group and after standard sold the loan portfolio outside of the controlled group,the commissioner changed the treasury department position in a way that would have let unionbancal benefit from its predecessor loss,had the change been retroactive.the commissioner replaced the temporary regulation with a final under which,had it been in effect,unionbancal could have taken its loss from its sale to standard when it left the controlled group,even though standard had yet sold the loans outside of the controlled group.the final regulation states that a seller loss or deduction from an intercompany sale is taken into account under the timing principles of,treating the intercompany sale as an intercompany transaction.under f,
the deferred loss attributable to property shall be taken into account by the selling member i mmediately preceding the time when either the selling member or the member which owns the property ceases to be a member of the group 
this provision appears to mean that the seller in a controlled group transaction may claim its deferred loss when it leaves the controlled group,even if the buyer has not yet sold the property to an unrelated precisely what the former,temporary regulation prohibited.but this regulation,the benefit of which unionbancal seeks,does apply to transactions that took place before july,which means it does apply to unionbancal predecessor transaction.
here,in more detail,are the events giving rise to this litigation 
union bank,appellant unionbancal,was the indirect american subsidiary of a british company,standard chartered bank.both were members of a controlled group.union bank sold a portfolio of loans to foreign countries with a face value of million to standard for million and claimed an million loss on its federal tax return.
union bank left the controlled group along with its american parent and indirect parent,and through a series of mergers and acquisitions became unionbancal,the appellant 
standard sold the loan portfolio to an outsider.
the irs audited union bank return.unionbancal claimed that the loan portfolio was actually worth only about million,so its loss was about million face value less economic value at the time of the sale within the controlled group.the irs took the position that union bank was entitled to recognize any loss at all.
subsequently the irs and unionbancal reached partial settlement.the settlement allowed unionbancal to take a million loss on its predecessor tax return and deferred the rest of the loss.the irs audited union bank federal tax return and,citing the never provision of the temporary regulation,rejected unionbancal claim that the deferred loss should be applied to the return.
unionbancal requested under the united kingdom tax convention that british and american competent authorities determine the loan portfolio fair market value and the tax treatment for union bank loss.
the competent authorities determined that the loan portfolio fair market value at the time union bank sold it to standard in was million,which was million less than face value,and agreed that million was union bank loss on the sale.
standard paid union bank only million less than face value for the portfolio,not million.so one might think union bank loss was only million,because standard did pay fair market value,but million above market value,and union bank never gave that million back.but standard overpayment has been treated as a capital contribution,rather than as payment for the loan portfolio,so union bank loss on the loan portfolio is million.
but the competent authorities did not agree on the tax treatment for the loss.the american authority would allow union bank to take the loss because of the temporary regulation the british authority would allow standard an increased basis in the loan portfolio because of british tax law.the result was that both standard and union bank were required to pay taxes as though they had lost million except for the million loss allowed under unionbancal settlement agreement with the irs.
the irs issued unionbancal a statutory notice of an approximately million deficiency relating to union bank return.
unionbancal petitioned the tax court for relief,which tried the case on stipulated facts and denied the petition.unionbancal appeals the tax court decision to us.
we have jurisdiction to review the tax court decision the facts are stipulated.we review the tax court interpretation of tax code provisions,regulations,and treaties de novo 
unionbancal challenges the commissioner decision on the same grounds rejected by the tax court the temporary regulation is invalid because it is inconsistent with section f the temporary regulation is invalid because it violates the united states united kingdom tax convention and the commissioner decision to preclude retroactive application of the final regulation was not permissible.
validity of the temporary regulation.
unionbancal argues that the statute requires two things that the temporary regulation denies that the loss on a sale between controlled group members must be deferred,not denied and that seller loss in an transaction must remain for the use of the seller.we can not disagree with the first point section a says that loss deductions for sales between the related persons specified in section b are disallowed,but section f says that loss deductions for sales between members of controlled groups shall be deferred.congress plainly meant to draw a distinction between members of controlled groups and other related parties and to provide for deferral rather than disallowance of losses arising from sales of property within controlled groups.
but unionbancal second point is not persuasive.section f says such loss that is,the loss from the sale of property between members of the controlled group shall be deferred.the statutory language does not compel the conclusion that once the deferred loss is recognized,the seller must be the one who gets the tax benefit.members of a controlled group do not deal with one another at arms length,so the financial and tax consequences of transactions are entirely controllable and manipulable by the group.when members of a controlled group accomplish an intragroup sale,the price between them is arbitrary and any loss is without economic substance for the group as a whole.so deciding who actually bore the loss in such a transaction is inherently arbitrary.
since standard controlled union bank and,through intermediaries,owned it,it could buy the depressed loans from union for face value,for million below fair market value,for million below face value,or for whatever price it believed would best serve the group financial and regulatory objectives.so the existence and magnitude of any loss union bank suffered was entirely a matter of standard choice and without any practical financial consequences.the words of section f,especially when read in light of the practicalities of controlled group transactions,do not support the inference that the tax benefit of a loss must remain with the purported seller.
the phrase such loss shall be deferred in section f does imply that the purported seller gets the tax advantage of the loss,but that the loss wo be recognized for tax purposes at the time of the sale.this inference is compelled by the phrases that follow such loss shall be deferred until the property is transferred outside the controlled group or until such other time as may be prescribed in regulations.when read together,these phrases show that congress is not assuring the paper seller that,come hell or high water,it gets to use the loss sometime.rather,congress is assuring the fisc that,so long as the property remains within the controlled group,the loss wo be recognized.after all,so long as the property and both parties to its sale remain within the controlled group,the loss is like the loss to your left pocket when you move money to your right pocket,somewhat like a sham transaction,so the general principle that transactions without economic substance will not be recognized for tax purposes supports nonrecognition in these circumstances as well 
section f provides alternative dates for when the deferred loss on an sale may be recognized.the first date is whenever the property is transferred outside such controlled group and there would be recognition of loss under consolidated return principles.the second date is such other time as may be prescribed by regulations.this gives the commissioner authority to prescribe the time for recognition,which is what the commissioner used to issue the temporary regulation as regulations commonly do,this temporary regulation dealt with a complexity not fully covered by the statute what happens if one member leaves the controlled group before the other member sells the property to an outsider the temporary regulation provides the answer if the seller leaves the group before the buyer sells the property to an outsider,the seller deferred loss never gets restored to it unionbancal cries foul over the word never,and claims it contradicts the statutory command that the loss must be deferred.but we ca see any inconsistency between this regulation and the statute the loss still gets deferred,not disallowed it just gets recognized by the buyer as a basis,instead of by the seller as a deduction.unionbancal complaint is that the loss does get restored to the seller,but as we discussed,the statute does require that result.as the tax court below put it,under the literal language of the statute,what is deferred under section f b is not the seller recognition of the seller loss,but rather the loss itself.
under the temporary regulation,the deferred loss stays with the property until the property leaves the controlled group.this is consistent with the general scheme of section.under section d,which provides for the recognition of losses disallowed under section a,recognition of the loss follows the property under section a and d,when a husband sells stock to his wife,as in the hypothetical case we set out earlier,he does get the loss when the wife calls a stockbroker and sells the gets the gain or loss on her sale,but gets to use his basis.the recognition of the loss follows the property,and gets triggered when the property goes to an unrelated party.likewise,the temporary regulation makes recognition of the deferred loss follow the property and stick with it until the property is sold to an outsider the loss is preserved within the group because no member of a group should under section f be able to recognize a loss while the group continues to hold property it purchased from itself.true,congress defers recognition of losses for controlled groups instead of disallowing them as with the husband and wife example but the distinction between disallowance and deferral is not so sharp because in both cases who gets the tax benefit does matter because of their identity of interest it when the loss gets recognized that matters.there no reason why congress should care about who gets the loss when the parties are so closely related or controlled,but congress has a great concern with whether there is a real loss.
the primary rationale for deferring loss on transfers between members of the same group is to prevent the premature recognition of loss merely because the property is transferred to a related person a n ancillary rationale for deferring loss is to prevent artificially increasing the amount of a loss taken by a member on the sale or exchange of property at less than fair market value to another member 
unionbancal argues that the legislative history shows that congress intended something contrary to what the temporary regulation says.unionbancal cites a passage in the house conference committee report saying that congress wanted losses on sales within controlled groups subject to deferral rather than denial.this legislative history adds nothing whatsoever to what the statute plainly says.true,a senate finance committee report says that the bill was intended to defer recognition until the property was sold to an outsider or the parties are no longer related.that would imply recognition as soon as unionbancal predecessor left the controlled group,contrary to the temporary regulation.but the bill that was passed by both houses of congress and signed by the does say or the parties are no longer related.it says or until such time as may be prescribed by regulations.
unionbancal argues that the temporary regulation is arbitrary and capricious because it allows recognition to the wrong party at the wrong time.we reject this argument because,so long as the controlled group maintains its existence,it is within the group control which party within it bears the paper loss.as for when the loss is recognized,one could reasonably choose either alternative,when the property is sold to an outsider,as the temporary regulation provides or when the seller leaves the controlled group,as the final regulation provides while they are together in the controlled group,and when they agree on terms for ending membership in the group,the parties can avoid unfairness to themselves from the way the taxes fall by adjusting their affairs in accord with tax regulations.
unionbancal argues that we ought not to defer to the regulation because,as a temporary regulation,it was adopted without notice and comment we need not decide generally whether absence of notice and comment would affect the degree of deference to a temporary regulation adopted by the commissioner of internal revenue which may differ from other temporary regulations issued by agencies dealing with other subject matters.in this case,congress by law provided that the time for recognition,if the commissioner adopted a regulation,would be such other time as may be prescribed in regulations.and congress empowered the commissioner to issue regulations without notice and comment,such as the temporary regulation the commissioner issued here this is an express delegation of authority,and the temporary regulation is neither arbitrary nor capricious so it stands 
the regulation arguably would be arbitrary if it not only denied the loss to the seller within the controlled group if it ceased to be a member while the property was still owned by another member,as it does,but denied the loss to anyone.that is,if the loss were altogether disallowed,that might be inconsistent with the congressional directive that it be deferred rather than disallowed.but the temporary regulation does do that.it gives the benefit of the loss to the member of the controlled group that bought the property,by increasing its basis by the amount of the seller deferred loss.thus when the property does eventually get sold to an outsider,the loss is recognized.in this case,no one got the benefit.but that was because of the temporary regulation.it was because british tax authorities would give standard the increased basis.standard,which owned union bank,and which owned the loan portfolio when union bank left the controlled group,was a british corporation.under american,but not british,tax law,when standard sold the loan portfolio,it would be entitled to have its basis increased by the amount of union bank deferred loss.that is not a failure of the temporary regulation to conform to the statute.rather,it is a difference between british and american taxation.
b.the treaty.
unionbancal argues that the temporary regulation is invalid because it violates the united kingdom tax convention article of the treaty,nondiscrimination,generally prohibits either state from subjecting nationals of one residing in the other to more burdensome taxation than their own resident nationals.the subsection dealing with corporate subsidiaries likewise provides that enterprises of one state owned or controlled by residents of the other shall not be subjected to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the state are or may be subjected.thus an american subsidiary of a british corporation ca be taxed more heavily than an american subsidiary of an american corporation.
unionbanccal argument is that,because standard was british and it was american,they wound up worse off than if they had both been american.that does violate the treaty.unionbanccal does show that the united states imposed more burdensome taxation or requirements on subsidiaries than subsidiaries,which is what the treaty addresses.it was merely fortuitous that,because the british and american tax authorities could not agree on how to recognize the deferred loss,and standard were worse off than if they had been entirely of one country or the other.
true,unionbancal never got tax recognition of its loss on its sale of the loan portfolio to standard because of the american statute and temporary regulation.but it has shown that it would have been treated any differently had standard been american.it would have been treated the same.and discrimination against subsidiaries is all that the nondiscrimination clause at issue protected it against.
retroactivity.
the final regulation provides that the temporary regulation still applies to transactions occurring before july,union argues that the commissioner was obligated to make the final regulation retroactive to its tax return.
under b,as in effect during the relevant time,the commissioner may prescribe the extent,if any,to which any ruling or regulation,relating to internal revenue laws,shall be applied without retroactive effect.the commissioner plainly did just that in the provision specifying of the final regulation to transactions before july.
that this was within the commissioner authority is unarguable.the authority is the may prescribe statute.that was within the commissioner discretion,and not arbitrary,is also unarguable.prospective application was reasonable to avoid disturbing transactions and tax retur
