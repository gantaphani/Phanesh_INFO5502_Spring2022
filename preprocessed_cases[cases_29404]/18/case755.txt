debra keach and patricia sage,participants in the foster gallagher.employee stock ownership plan esop,filed this action against trust company,and others for alleged violations of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,in connection with the esop december,purchase of shares of foster gallagher,f g stock from the defendant f g officers and directors.the district court conducted a bench trial and then entered judgment in favor of trust.keach and sage now appeal from that decision.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
the facts of this case are,for the most part,undisputed f g was a direct mail marketing company engaged in the marketing of gifts,housewares and novelty items.over time,f g acquired several companies,many of which marketed horticultural products through the mail.the f g esop began in,when it purchased about thirty percent of f g stock from the company founders.in,after thomas foster,ceo and chairman of the f g board of directors,became terminally ill,a leveraged purchase of a large number of f g shares by the esop was proposed.at that time,f g had been enjoying record profitability for several years and was forecasted to continue this trend into the future.on december,the esop,with trust acting as its trustee,purchased shares of f g stock from several f g officers and directors at a price of per share the esop ii transaction.for the next two years,f g did enjoy record business however,in,its profits began to decline steadily until f g declared bankruptcy in.keach and sage filed this action in april after the value of f g shares had reached less than fifty percent of their original purchase price.
michigan bulb company 
in,f g largest subsidiary was michigan bulb company mbc,a direct mail marketer of horticultural products.mbc conducted direct mail sweepstakes promotions to its customers primarily in three different formats an everybody wins sweepstakes,in which every person who returned an entry form won a special prize,regardless of whether or not they placed an order a base sweepstakes that awarded a total of annually and had a grand prize of and a giveaway,in which the winners were determined before the mailing.
in,mbc retained an attorney,john awerdick,a specialist in advertising law and sweepstakes issues,to review its mailings for compliance with the law.initially,awerdick advised mbc that the laws of nine states could be read to prohibit the everybody wins type of promotions,and he advised that states increasingly were using prize and gift laws to regulate sweepstakes.in the attorney view,the level of risk to mbc was difficult to assess because the laws were not enforced strictly.by the spring of,mbc had established a practice of having awerdick review each new proposed promotion if he advised mbc not to send out a particular mailing,the mailing was not sent.
on february,and february,awerdick provided letters to f g outside auditor,price waterhouse,in which he discussed trends in the regulation of sweepstakes.the letter noted 
increasingly,states are using consumer protection laws to regulate sweepstakes further.in particular,a number of states are regulating some promotions in which every recipient of a mailing is advised that he or she is a prize winner.many of the company mailings include such a statement.generally,either through statutory language or as a matter of prosecutorial discretion,these gift and prize laws are being applied against businesses using telephone numbers,offering time shares,vacation homes and camp sites,or requiring attendance at a sales presentation to receive a prize.i know of no current attempts to enforce these laws against traditional conventional direct mail sweepstakes operators.however,the company would be required to make fundamental changes in many of its mailings if a prize and gift statute were applied to the everybody wins element of its promotions.michigan bulb management has been advised of the risks of these state statutes.
ex.the letter contained substantially similar language to that quoted directly above,except that it deleted the sentence,i know of no current attempts to enforce these laws against traditional conventional direct mail sweepstakes operators,because mbc had received an inquiry about its sweepstakes from the attorney general of north carolina.although awerdick informed mbc of these risks,he never advised mbc to stop using everybody wins promotions.nor did he ever advise mbc that any changes required to bring its sweepstakes into compliance with the state laws would have a significantly adverse impact on mbc financial situation.
mbc received thousands of inquiries each year from state attorneys general state inquiries,better business bureaus,action lines and others about its promotions.in and before december,mbc had responded to inquiries from the attorneys general of eight states.dale fujimoto,mbc senior vice president of marketing,testified that such inquires were viewed as part of the routine of the direct mail order business and were not considered a source of concern.none of the state inquiries resulted in an enforcement action against mbc or otherwise had material adverse consequences on mbc.at trial,trust expert stephen durchslag,an attorney with years experience in the field of promotions and advertising law,including sweepstakes,testified that the legal environment surrounding sweepstakes in was favorable and that he and other sweepstakes experts would have considered these type of inquiries to be normal and not an indication that mbc was at risk of significant regulatory or enforcement problems.
esop ii transaction 
f g retained valuemetrics,valuemetrics as its financial advisor to help structure the proposed esop ii transaction.on september,valuemetrics issued its first transaction memorandum to the f g board of directors describing a proposed offer to sell shares to the esop at per share.
trust served as an independent trustee for the esop to consider the merits of the proposed transaction.trust,in turn,engaged houlihan,lokey,howard zukin houlihan to assist it in valuing the transaction and to render a written opinion to trust as to whether the transaction was fair to the esop from a financial perspective.on october,norman goldberg and michael shea of trust and martin sarafa and todd strassman of houlihan met with f g executives to perform corporate due diligence for the stock transaction.at that meeting,goldberg of trust also spoke with robert ostertag,president of mbc at the time,about mbc and its sweepstakes promotions.at the october meeting ostertag did not identify government regulation of sweepstakes as a risk no f g representative identified either the primary role of sweepstakes to mbc business or possible government regulation of sweepstakes as a risk and there was no discussion of mbc dependency on sweepstakes being a negative,of the pending state inquiries or of state laws that regulated mbc sweepstakes marketing.shea also toured the mbc facilities and spoke with additional members of mbc management.testimony from f g officers,found to be credible by the district court,indicated that state regulation and sweepstakes issues were not considered to be material factors in the esop ii transaction at any time.
around this same time,securities,a subsidiary of the bank of america corporation,conducted its own due diligence of f g and issued a private placement memorandum for potential lenders into the prospective esop ii transaction.the memorandum did not identify sweepstakes as an inherently risky promotional tool or identify any legal or regulatory risk.by november,four institutional lenders,in combination,were willing to loan f g the requested million on favorable terms for the esop ii transaction.
after its inquiries into f g and mbc,houlihan prepared an analysis for trust of f g financials with respect to the offer price of per share.based on houlihan analysis,trust determined that valuemetrics analysis was too optimistic in some respects.houlihan prepared a new analysis reflecting a lower valuation range for the price of the f g shares.on november,trust suggested a share price of f g officers rejected the offer and negotiations broke off.negotiations later resumed,and,on november,trust announced that it was willing to recommend that the esop purchase a controlling block of f g shares at per share,subject to further due diligence by trust.
on december,houlihan presented a report to trust concluding that the midpoint value of the f g stock was per share at the time.in preparing this fairness opinion,houlihan did not know what percentage of mbc sales were generated by sweepstakes,did not know what mbc primary sweepstakes approaches were and did not know of any regulatory inquiries or risks associated with mbc sweepstakes.
to perform due diligence for the proposed esop ii transaction,trust retained the law firm of sonnenschein,nath rosenthal sonnenschein.at trust request,sonnenschein did not begin significant due diligence until early december.on december,sonnenschein faxed to f g outside corporate counsel a list of the documents to be gathered for due diligence review.among the documents requested were copies of any significant correspondence with any regulatory agencies.an attorney with sonnenschein traveled to f g and discussed each item on the due diligence request list with f g corporate controller.the attorney made general inquiries into pending legal matters,but he did not ask for any specific document,such as the letters of inquiry from the states attorneys general or mbc response to those inquiries.the attorney did not speak to awerdick and did not see awerdick audit response letters to price waterhouse.
on december,the attorney met with the sonnenschein partner responsible for the legal due diligence.the attorney did not prepare a written report of his due diligence investigation.he testified that he had reported finding nothing significant in his review,but that he did not recall discussing mbc sweepstakes marketing with the partner.the partner no longer is with sonnenschein and could not be located to testify in this case.no record exists documenting that the partner analyzed mbc sweepstakes business or the state inquiries but decided that those issues were not material.the record likewise is devoid of evidence of the substance of any communications between trust and the sonnenschein due diligence counsel.
there appears to be no dispute that sonnenschein did not provide trust with copies of the documents that the attorney had received,including awerdick february audit response letter advising that mbc would have to make fundamental changes in its mailings if state prize and gift laws were enforced,and an october,memorandum contained in the f g board book for that month noting that mbc had received inquiries from three states in two weeks in october.goldberg of trust testified that,if he had seen those two documents,he would have asked for a further explanation from the company.when the esop ii transaction closed on or before december,goldberg had only a general understanding of mbc sweepstakes marketing program and had not focused specifically on everybody wins type promotions.he also did not know that between eighty to percent of mbc sales were generated through sweepstakes marketing.
occurrences 
for two years after the esop ii transaction on december,f g continued to enjoy record profits.in july,the attorney general of connecticut filed lawsuits challenging the sweepstakes practices of fifteen companies including mbc.in february,the attorney general of vermont opened an investigation into mbc sweepstakes promotions.mbc resolved both matters in the summer of by entering into assurances of discontinuance,in which mbc paid a total of in costs and agreed to certain injunctive relief.in october,mbc entered into an assurance of discontinuance with the attorney general of michigan.by october,mbc decided that only non everybody wins versions of its promotions would be sent to consumers in states that had strict laws concerning such promotions.mbc projected a six and percent decrease in sales for the spring of.by,mbc had stopped using everybody wins promotions in eleven states and was proceeding to modify its business in order to comply with the laws in all states.
the stock purchase agreements through which the participants in the executive investment plan eip reinvested the proceeds from the esop ii transaction included an annual provision allowing eip participants to sell back all or some of their shares to f g.in,f g board of directors offered the esop the opportunity to purchase the vested shares available under the eip agreements.a number of f g officers chose not to participate in the transaction because they believed that the stock value would continue to increase.also in,f g became a subchapter s corporation.this arrangement allowed it to avoid paying taxes on a substantial portion of any profits,but did not allow the company to take a tax deduction for business losses.also during,a purchase by the esop of the remaining f g shares at per share was proposed.two major shareholders,the foster estate and melvyn regal,refused to sell their shares because they believed the price to be low.
in february,several news stories appeared focusing on the sweepstakes practices of american family publishing and publisher clearinghouse.although mbc did not use many of the practices at issue in the news reports,the negative publicity about sweepstakes in general caused an immediate and dramatic decline in mbc consumer response rates.the negative publicity spurred class actions and enforcement actions against other direct mail marketers,which further fed the sentiment.according to trust expert,durchslag,the striking change in the regulatory enforcement climate that followed the public backlash was not expected by sweepstakes professionals.a number of former mbc and f g officials testified uniformly that they believed the principal cause of mbc economic reversal was this negative media coverage.in,f g and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy.
district court proceedings 
keach and sage alleged that trust breached a fiduciary duty owed under erisa when,in determining the purchase price for the f g stock,it failed to assess fully the risks associated with mbc use of sweepstakes promotions.this lack of a complete and good faith inquiry,keach and sage contended,meant that the esop ii transaction was not for adequate consideration and,consequently,did not come within a statutory exemption from the prohibited transaction restrictions of erisa.see a a,e.however,the district court concluded that the esop ii transaction met the definition of adequate consideration and,therefore,was not prohibited by erisa.in the alternative,the district court held that,even if trust had breached a fiduciary duty,no remedy was appropriate because any such breach had not caused the losses to the esop.
in deciding that trust was entitled to the adequate consideration exemption of erisa section,the district court recognized that trust had the burden to prove two elements that the esop paid the fair market value for the asset,as determined in good faith by the trustee.the district court found that the esop had paid fair market value for the f g stock based on three expert evaluations that reported that the per share price in was well more than.the district court found these evaluations to be more credible than a report valuing the shares at less than per share.
the district court next determined that trust had conducted a sufficient investigation into the merits of the esop ii transaction.specifically,the court found that neither mbc dependency on sweepstakes nor the increase in governmental regulation of the sweepstakes industry posed a material risk to f g in or a foreseeable material risk in the future 
t he weight of the evidence indicated that f g officers and directors did not consider these issues to be material at the time,as evidenced by the following an otherwise inexplicable conversion to a subchapter s corporation in which would only have had positive tax consequences for a company expecting continued profitability the undersubscription of another stock purchase transaction by the esop in because many officers and directors believed that the stock was worth much more and would continue to increase in value the immediate refusal of foster and regal to sell their remaining shares to the company at per share in and an unsecured million loan from regal and the foster estate to f g in in order to assist the recovery of the company.nor were such issues deemed material by the four lenders that performed their own due diligence investigation prior to loaning f g million to finance the stock purchase transaction at favorable interest rates and without requiring collateral.some of these same lenders agreed to loan an additional million on the same terms in.uncontroverted and credible testimony at trial from an industry expert durchslag also established that such issues were not material at the time of the stock purchase transaction and did not present a reasonably foreseeable material risk of future harm to f 
in addition,the district court discussed two specific components of trust investigation into the merits of the transaction the valuation of the purchase price and the legal due diligence.the court ruled that trust reasonably relied on houlihan opinion as to fairness of the purchase price for the f g shares.the court noted that trust and houlihan had analyzed exhaustively f g financials,had conducted independent valuation analyses and had challenged the financial forecasts made by f g management as too optimistic.however,the district court determined that trust had not appropriately relied upon the legal due diligence review performed by sonnenschein.specifically,the court found troubling the absence in the record of any meaningful communications regarding legal due diligence between sonnenschein and trust.the court believed that this lack of a record did not allow it to find that trust counsel was aware of mbc extensive use of sweepstakes marketing and of the state inquiries.nevertheless,the court concluded that these were not important issues.the district court therefore concluded that the inadequate legal due diligence did not mean that the esop ii transaction was not for adequate consideration 
had there been further investigation into the sweepstakes inquiries,the uncontroverted evidence of record indicates that trust would have discovered that none of the state attorney general inquires received by mbc prior to december,had resulted in any enforcement action or negative consequences to the company and that the inquiries pending at that time were expected to be resolved in the normal course of business without any material consequences.while sweepstakes marketing was beginning to receive a higher degree of scrutiny from governmental regulatory agencies,and therefore posed the possibility of a greater likelihood of enforcement through consumer protection laws,the evidence presented at trial indicated that was a quiet period in the industry from a regulatory perspective.
defendants expert durchslag testified that experts in sweepstakes law would not have considered the few state inquiries received by mbc in to be material or a sign of significant impending regulatory problems.accordingly,there is no basis for the assertion that consideration of sweepstakes risk by a prudent investor would have reduced the value of f g stock or caused a prudent investor not to engage in the esop ii transaction at all.the fact that trust and its legal advisor did not identify a risk that the court finds was not material can not be considered evidence of an imprudent or bad faith investigation for purposes of precluding an otherwise applicable exemption under e.
in the alternative,the district court determined that,even if trust had breached a fiduciary duty,it was not liable for damages because the losses to the esop were not caused by any such breach.the court took the view that 
t he portion of the corporate legal due diligence that was either overlooked or undocumented,namely the regulatory inquiries made by state attorneys general into mbc sweepstakes marketing practices and the risk of sweepstakes dependency,was not a material consideration with respect to the propriety of the esop ii transaction and posed no actual or reasonably foreseeable material risk to f g at the time of the transaction.there is no credible evidence of record establishing that any different actions by trust would have had any impact on the outcome of the esop ii transaction.
id.at.furthermore,the district court determined that the record demonstrated that the actual cause of the loss to the esop was the collapse in customer response rates that started in after the wave of negative press surrounding the american family publishers company scandal.the loss to the esop,accordingly,was not due to any meaningful risk to the profits of f g from mbc dependency on sweepstakes promotions or from governmental regulation of sweepstakes.

erisa and the esop ii transaction 
section of erisa prohibits a fiduciary of an erisa plan from causing the plan to enter into certain transactions with a party in interest.section supplements an erisa fiduciary general duties of loyalty and prudence to the plan beneficiaries,as set forth in section,by categorically barring certain transactions deemed likely to injure the pension plan.harris trust sav.bank salomon smith barney,d quoting comm r keystone consol,d.a plan need not suffer an injury in order for a court to find a transaction prohibited by section.etter pease constr,cir.
it is undisputed in this case that the esop ii transaction,a purchase of f g stock by the esop from f g officers and directors,was prohibited under erisa section a a as a sale or exchange of any property between the plan and a party in interest.a a.however,section e of erisa provides that the prohibitions in sections and of the statute shall not apply to the acquisition or sale of qualifying employer securities by an employee stock ownership plan if,among other conditions,the acquisition or sale is for adequate consideration.id.e for securities with no recognized market,as in this case,erisa defines adequate consideration to be the fair market value of the asset as determined in good faith by the trustee or named fiduciary pursuant to the terms of the plan and in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary of labor.id.b.in order to rely on the adequate consideration exemption,a trustee or fiduciary has the burden to establish that the esop paid no more than fair market value for the asset,and that the fair market value was determined in good faith by the fiduciary see eyler,at.
in establishing that there has been compliance with the statutory mandate,t he degree to which a fiduciary makes an independent inquiry is critical.id.at.although securing an independent assessment from a financial advisor or legal counsel is evidence of a thorough investigation,it is not a complete defense against a charge of imprudence.howard shay,cir.a fiduciary must investigate the expert qualifications,provide the expert with complete and accurate information and make certain that reliance on the expert advice is reasonably justified under the circumstances.id.citing donovan mazzola,cir,and donovan cunningham,cir.
keach and sage submit that trust failed to make the requisite good faith determination.they submit that,contrary to the district court view,a prudent investor making a million investment decision would have wanted to know whether state regulation of mbc sweepstakes promotions could have a material effect on the finances of mbc and f therefore,keach and sage maintain that trust and its advisors should have taken a careful look at the sweepstakes issues in order to make a fully informed determination of the associated risks.keach and sage also charge that trust was not justified in relying on the fairness opinion of houlihan or on the legal due diligence of sonnenschein because neither considered the risks associated with mbc sweepstakes promotions.
with respect to houlihan valuation analysis,the district court ably addressed keach and sage concern 
while sarafa and strassman of houlihan knew that mbc used sweepstakes marketing extensively and that mbc was a main revenue center for f g,houlihan did not consider the risk of governmental regulation of the sweepstakes industry or any threat posed by mbc dependency on sweepstakes in assessing the value of f g stock.considering the record in its entirety,it is clear that the reason why houlihan did not factor these circumstances into its valuation analysis is that no one at the time of the transaction,including experts in the area of sweepstakes marketing,either knew or reasonably should have known that these matters posed any material risk to f g or could be expected to pose any material risk to f g in the foreseeable future.
like the district court,we are troubled by the absence in the record of any substantive communication between sonnenschein and trust concerning mbc sweepstakes issues.however,the fact that the due diligence review did not identify or did not document mbc sweepstakes marketing does not negate,on this record,the reasonableness of trust overall analysis of the merits of the esop ii transaction in the circumstances prevailing in.rather,it is important to place trust reliance on sonnenschein legal due diligence within the context of the totality of the circumstances of trust valuation process.for instance,the district court found that trust went to considerable lengths to understand f g business and to assess independently the merits of the transaction,including interviewing members of management,visiting f g facilities,reviewing business plans and examining financial documents.the district court also found that,rather than blindly accept the forecasts of f g officers as to f g financial future,trust and houlihan probed and challenged a number of assumptions in valuemetrics evaluation before developing their own independent evaluation that formed the basis for a price per share at closing that was almost less than the selling shareholders offering price.id.at.
although,as keach and sage point out,goldberg of trust testified that he would have asked for further information if he had known of the state inquiries and of awerdick audit response letters,he also stated that,based on his understanding of the industry,the information that would have been disclosed upon further inquiry would not have changed the outcome of the esop ii transaction.when the record establishes that the overlooked matter was one that no one perceived to be a material concern at the time or to be outcome determinative,it can not be said that the overall investigation was imprudent or in bad faith.erisa fiduciary duty of care requires prudence,not prescience.debruyne equitable life assurance soc y of the united states,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.
furthermore,trust inquiry into the esop ii transaction does not exhibit the same level of imprudence as those cases in which courts have held that the plan fiduciary was not entitled to the adequate consideration exemption.for instance,in eyler,we held that the plan fiduciaries failed to demonstrate a good faith determination when 
t he record d id not show that even one director,let alone a majority,sought independent information on the fair market value of the stock.rather,on the same day the project was presented,the board voted to guarantee a million loan,the proceeds of which would be used to buy the majority shareholder stock.a prudent person would not have relied upon the dated estimated price range for the esop stock purchase in light of the failed initial public offering and changed financial conditions at the corporation.moreover,there is no evidence that the board was knowledgeable about the effects of these changing conditions on the fair market value of the employer stock.
id.at.in eyler,we specifically noted that several of the factors that the board failed to consider had a significant impact on the financial condition of the stock.id.at.by contrast,the absence of evidence that mbc sweepstakes was a meaningful risk to mbc and f g financial future at the time of the transaction was certainly an important factor in the district court determination that trust had not failed to conduct a good faith inquiry into the merits of the esop ii transaction.
other cases confirm that the case before us today can not be characterized as lacking the requisite good faith on the part of the fiduciaries.similar to this court holding in eyler,the fifth circuit in cunningham,held that the plan fiduciaries investigation was insufficient because they had relied on an appraisal prepared thirteen to thirty months before the transactions and had failed to consider significant changes in the company business condition that had occurred in the interim.id.at.the court noted that a cursory study of the appraisal report would have revealed that the underlying facts and assumptions no longer were valid at the time of the stock transactions.id.at.
the sixth circuit decision in chao hall holding,cir,similarly supports the view that the decision of the district court was correct.in chao,the sixth circuit concluded that the plan trustees had failed to prove that they had made a good faith inquiry into fair market value when the trustees relied on a valuation by an individual who had valued the wrong company and who testified that,if he had been told that his valuation would be used for an employee stock ownership plan transaction,he would have done a different valuation the trustees generally were unaware of what was going on the trustees were not consulted on major decisions,such as the price to pay for the stock the trustees did not engage in any negotiation as to the price of the stock the trustees were more concerned with the return on the investment for the trust that had financed the stock purchase than for the plan and the trustees caused the plan to be charged several thousands of dollars simply to enable the trustees to communicate using round numbers.id.at.
finally,in katsaros cody,cir,the second circuit upheld a finding that the trustees breached the duty of prudence,under erisa section,because they passively received a rosy superficial picture of the company in which they caused the plan to invest and its holding company from persons with an interest in obtaining their approval.no effort was made to obtain independent professional assistance or analysis of the financial data presented to them.id.at.in katsaros,a reasonable investigation would have revealed that the transaction was totally unsound.id.at.
the situation in these cases simply does not resemble that before us.mbc and f g management consistently testified that the factors that trust purportedly overlooked,namely mbc reliance on sweepstakes and possible government regulation of mbc sweepstakes and the sweepstakes industry in general,were not considered a significant concern to mbc and f g financial outlook.in addition,nothing in this record suggests that trust valuation process passively relied on the financial information provided by f g officers it hired a qualified financial advisor,conducted its own interviews and review of industry information and negotiated a price for the f g shares that was twenty percent lower than the original offer price.we conclude that the district court properly ruled that the fact that trust failed to identify a risk that would not have been considered material does not render trust evaluation of the esop ii transaction imprudent or in bad faith for purposes of section e.
as we have noted previously,our conclusion that trust carried its burden to show adequate consideration is based on the district court finding that the regulatory inquiries made by states attorneys general into mbc sweepstakes marketing practices and the risk of sweepstakes dependency,was not a material consideration with respect to the propriety of the esop ii transaction and posed no actual or reasonably foreseeable material risk to f g
