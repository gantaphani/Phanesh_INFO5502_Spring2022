in a complicated litigation matter involving several parties,the trial court refused to consider an attorney fee motion,finding that the motion was untimely filed.the court erroneously determined that the entry of an order granting summary judgment triggered the running of the time limit for the filing of the attorney fee motion,under california rules of court,rule b,even though no summary judgment had ever been entered.however,an order granting summary judgment is not an appealable order and the entry of the order did not trigger the attorney fee motion filing deadline under rule b.the trial court error is understandable considering the number of appellate court opinions that are confusing with respect to the appealability of an order granting summary judgment.we hope to provide some clarity on the point.
we reverse the order denying the attorney fee motion and remand the matter to the trial court for a hearing on that motion.the court ruling on the motion for relief under code of civil procedure section is moot.we deny the request to file a late opposition to the motion for factual determinations and also deny the motion for factual determinations.no exceptional circumstances require this court to make factual determinations on appeal.
on july,saben,earlix associates saben filed a complaint for breach of fiduciary duty and declaratory relief against robert fillet fillet the saben litigation.the allegations arose out of dealings connected with the silver sage partners,partnership silver sage,of which saben purportedly was a general partner and fillet purportedly was a former general partner.saben stated that a judgment had been entered on behalf of silver sage in certain litigation with the city of desert hot springs the silver sage litigation.saben asserted,among other things,that fillet partnership interest had been extinguished and he had no rights as a general partner.presumably,saben intended to imply that fillet had no right to collect a share of the judgment.

in their complaint in intervention,davis and the company asserted what they characterized as joint claims,in which they joined with fillet in defending against saben claims in the saben litigation.these joint claims were predicated upon the assertion that davis and the company had received a right to collect a substantial portion of the judgment proceeds from the silver sage litigation through an assignment from fillet.they explained their concern that saben attempt to extinguish fillet partnership interest put at risk the share of the judgment that he had assigned to them.davis and the company also asserted independent claims for promissory estoppel,unjust enrichment,quantum meruit,and declaratory relief.
in the request for declaratory relief,davis and the company stated that the saben litigation created a controversy as to their right to receive the partnership income that fillet had assigned to them more than a decade earlier.they sought a court order declaring that they were entitled to receive of the partnership income,in addition to their contingency fee,for having obtained a judgment in the silver sage litigation,and that their rights were unaffected by the success or failure of saben lawsuit against robert fillet.

discussiona.introduction 
davis and the company contend that the court erred in denying their motion for attorney fees as untimely filed and in denying their motion for relief under code of civil procedure section.they also assert that the court erred in failing to consider their fee request under the federal and state fair housing laws.as we shall show,we only need to address the first contention.
filing requirements 
california rules of court,rule b requires that a motion for attorney fees incurred in the trial court be filed within the time permitted for the filing of a notice of appeal california rules of court,rule a,in turn,provides unless a statute or rule provides otherwise,a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of days after the superior court clerk mails the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled notice of entry of judgment or a copy of the judgment,showing the date either was mailed days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled notice of entry of judgment or a copy of the judgment,accompanied by proof of service or days after entry of judgment.
saben argues that the court was right in determining that the motion was filed late,because it was not filed within the time required by california rules of court,rule a.according to saben,the time for filing ran from the date davis and the company served a notice of entry of the order granting summary judgment,october.it concludes that the attorney fee motion therefore had to have been filed within days thereafter,no later than december.saben further argues that if,for some reason,the service of notice of entry of the order did not trigger the filing deadline,then the deadline would be days after the date of entry of the october,order granting summary judgment.because the attorney fee motion was not filed until july,saben insists it was not timely filed.
davis and the company disagree.they contend that an order granting summary judgment is not an appealable order that would trigger the running of the filing deadline.they are right.
