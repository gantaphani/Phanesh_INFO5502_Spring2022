opinion of the court 
the bankruptcy proceeding that is the subject of this appeal is one of three matters pending in three jurisdictions.we are advised by the parties that the amount ultimately at issue is between or billion dollars.the specific issue before us is the interpretation of the police power exception to the automatic stay contained in b.the bankruptcy court,affirmed by the district court,held that the automatic stay applies to appellants who have interposed various arguments in their effort to overturn that holding.those efforts are unsuccessful and we will affirm.
the trustee of nortel networks pension plan trustee and the board of the pension protection fund ppf collectively appellants appeal from the district court order affirming the decision of the bankruptcy court to enforce the automatic stay against appellants with respect to their participation in pension proceedings.appellants argue that the pension proceedings,which were initiated by the pensions regulator tpr or the regulator fall within the police power exception to the automatic stay,b,which allows a governmental unit to bring or continue actions against a debtor to prevent or stop violations of law affecting matters of public health,safety,or welfare.the debtors,including nortel networks,nni and nn caribbean and latin american nn cala,together with the committee of unsecured creditors of nni committee collectively appellees argue that the police power exception does not apply because the trustee and ppf are private parties and not governmental units as defined in the bankruptcy code,and the purpose of the proceedings is to address private pecuniary interests rather than a matter of public concern.this appeal requires us to decide whether the police power exception under b applies to appellants participation in the proceedings.
background 
the nortel group nortel group or nortel,founded in as bell telephone company of canada,was a global supplier of telecommunications and computer networking solutions.nortel global revenue for the calendar year was approximately billion,of which was generated by the europe,middle east and africa emea region.as of,the nortel group employed approximately people worldwide.however,due to changes in the industry,nortel rising pension obligations,and the general downturn in the global economy,nortel faced a deterioration of cash and liquidity and concluded that a comprehensive financial and business restructuring could be most effectively and quickly achieved within the framework of creditor protection proceedings in multiple jurisdictions.at.
in early,the debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states district court for the district of delaware and the committee of unsecured creditors was then formed.concurrently,nortel networks corporation nnc nortel group ultimate holding company listed on the toronto stock exchange and other canadian affiliates entered insolvency proceedings in canada.in addition,the high court of justice in england placed nortel networks limited nnuk and other european nortel entities into administration the bankruptcy court recognized the canadian and proceedings as foreign main proceedings under chapter of the bankruptcy code,which triggered the automatic stay of a,b,a.
later,in june,nortel entities from the united states,canada and the emea region entered into the interim funding and settlement agreement ifsa,which was approved by the bankruptcy court.the ifsa provides for the parties cooperation in the global sales of nortel business units and agreement that the proceeds of any sale will be held in escrow until the parties either reach a consensual allocation or obtain a binding procedure for the allocation pursuant to an agreed upon protocol.
in an opinion entered february,the canadian trial court noted that nortel has sold substantially all of its operating businesses in the course of insolvency proceedings in canada,england and the united states,and t he proceeds are being held in escrow pending determination of how they are to be allocated among the various nortel companies.in re nortel networks,carswellont.wl.at oral argument before us,the parties explained that the proceeds,which total upwards of billion,are being held in escrow in new york subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in canada and the united states.
in september,the trustee and ppf timely filed joint claims against the nortel entities in the bankruptcy court.those claims allege that the nnuk pension plan is underfunded by an estimated billion or billion,and that tpr may seek to require certain of the debtors,including nni and nn cala,to provide financial support for the nnuk plan under the pensions act.appellants claims in the bankruptcy proceedings were filed as contingent and unliquidated because they are predicated on the outcome of the proceedings.as counsel for the debtors stated,appellants claims are among the largest,if not the largest,claims filed in the bankruptcy proceedings.j.at.
the regulatory proceedings are to determine the extent of the liability of nnuk affiliates for the deficit because nnuk pension plan is a defined benefit pension scheme established under and governed by law.as explained by the debtor expert richard hitchcock,in defined benefit plans,it is not until a member comes to retire that the true extent of his or her pension entitlement based in this case on final salary can be known.thus,funding on an ongoing basis is always a matter of estimation.at.in february,nnuk plan had over members including those not yet in retirement.
with respect to appellants roles in the proceedings under u.law,the ppf is a but privately funded entity that provides payments to members of defined benefit pension plans whose employers can not fully fund their pension obligations.in other words,the ppf acts as a safety net.at.
appellants expert richard favier stated that after receiving notice that nnuk was placed into administration,ppf entered an assessment period during which ppf assess es whether it is required under the relevant statutory provisions to take responsibility to pay members benefits,and tr ies to ensure that the scheme recovers all debts due to it.at.the u.debtor expert hitchcock explained that the trustee is a private party responsible for administering the plan and ensuring that members receive their benefits.it retain s responsibility for paying benefits,during the assessment period.at.however,its rights and powers in relation to any debt due to it by the employer are exercisable by the board of the ppf to the exclusion of the trustees or managers.pensions act.ppf is still in an assessment period with respect to nnuk plan and has not yet stepped in to pay benefits to nnuk plan members.
tpr was established under the pensions act as the governmental agency charged with regulating occupational pension schemes in the,such as nnuk plan.the objectives of tpr as originally stated under the act are a to protect the benefits under occupational pension schemes of,or in respect of,members of such schemes,b to protect the benefits under personal pension schemes of,or in respect of,members of such schemes,c to reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the pension protection fund,and d to promote,and to improve understanding of,the good administration of pension schemes.pensions act.tpr is not a party to the instant lawsuit and has not sought to intervene 
the uk pensions act provides that to meet its objectives,tpr may determine whether or not to take regulatory action,which includes,inter alia,determining whether the applicable pension is underfunded,quantifying the deficit and holding the employer or a related party responsible for such deficit.in re nortel networks,carswellont.wl citing pensions act.the determinations panel dp is an internal group of tpr that determines whether the regulatory functions should be exercised.id.in this case,tpr concluded that nnuk was insufficiently resourced on june,thus,grounds existed for tpr to institute administrative proceedings under the pensions act to recover the underfunding from nnuk and its affiliates.
thereafter,in august and september,tpr advised nnuk and other nortel entities that it was considering issuing a warning notice,which is a mandatory step towards issuing a financial support direction fsd.a warning notice sets out the grounds for the potential issuance of an fsd,which is a direction requiring the target entity to put financial support in place for an underfunded pension scheme.see pensions act.any company that is an associate of or is otherwise connected with a pension fund employer may be issued an fsd.see pensions act.
in january,tpr issued a warning notice to nnc,nni,nn cala,and other companies in the nortel group.the notice informed the target companies that they had until march,to make submissions to tpr under the pensions act.under the pensions act,the decision to issue an fsd must occur within two years after the relevant time commences.in this case,tpr has determined that the time commenced when it determined that the fund was insufficiently resourced on june,such that the decision to issue an fsd had to be made by june.
on february,the debtors filed a motion for entry of an order enforcing the automatic stay against certain claimants with respect to the pension proceedings pursuant to a and a.essentially,the debtors asked the bankruptcy court to enforce the automatic stay to prevent appellants from participating in the proceedings with respect to debtors liability for nnuk plan deficit.
on february,the bankruptcy court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion,at which the parties presented testimony from expert witnesses and made arguments.the debtors submitted the expert testimony of richard hitchcock,an english pension lawyer describing the relevant statutory regime,the powers of tpr,and who benefits from tpr exercise of its power,as well as john ray,the principal officer to debtors appointed by the bankruptcy court,opining that enforcement of the stay is needed because the allocation issue to be determined in the proceedings overlaps with the issue before the bankruptcy court.appellants submitted expert testimony of david wyndham davies,chairman of the board of nnuk pension trust,opining that the determinations panel is the best forum for resolving regulatory procedure,richard favier,senior insolvency advisor to ppf,describing the role of ppf and importance of appellants participation in the proceedings,and robert wallace ham,an english pension lawyer,explaining the law and practice related to fsds.
after the hearing,the bankruptcy court issued an order enforcing the automatic stay against certain claimants with respect to the pensions proceedings prohibiting appellants from participating in the proceedings as to debtors nni and nn cala.the automatic stay order provides the automatic stay imposed by section is hereby enforced as to the trustee and the ppf and is fully applicable to the pension proceedings with respect to the debtors and with respect to the debtors such proceedings are deemed void and of no force or effect to the extent that either the trustee or the ppf participate in the pension proceedings as to any debtors,such participation will be in violation of the automatic stay and subject to sanctions under section.at.
on march,the bankruptcy court issued a written memorandum opinion setting forth its reasoning for the stay order.see in re nortel networks.the court concluded that the police power exception to the automatic stay does not apply because neither the trustee nor ppf is a governmental unit as defined in and narrowly construing the police power exception,the proceedings do not pass the public policy or pecuniary purpose tests because the focus of the proceedings is to procure a pecuniary benefit for a private party he trustee u nder the pensions act if necessary,the tpr will attempt to impose and liquidate an enforceable debt,to be enforced by or on behalf of the trustee,for an amount to be paid to the trustee.j.at.having decided the issue before it,the court then opined on prejudice the question of whether and to what extent affiliates of nnuk should be responsible for nnuk obligations is part and parcel of the entire benefit and contribution issue and the allocation process t hese issues should not be decided,even in part,by an administrative body referring to tpr in a single jurisdiction with a single constituency.at.
similar to the debtors,the monitor for the canadian debtors filed a motion in canada seeking a stay of the proceedings.on the same day the bankruptcy court issued its stay order in the instant case,the ontario superior court of justice granted the monitor motion and held that for the purposes of the canadian insolvency proceedings,the actions taken by the pensions regulator,are null and void in canada and are to be given no force or effect.at see also in re nortel networks,carswellont,d.wl.tpr appeared in the canadian proceedings and pursued relief from the stay,but it has not participated in the proceedings.
the court of appeal for ontario dismissed tpr appeal of the stay order on the merits and held that the service of the warning notice by tpr breached the stay provisions in the superior court initial order.the service of the notice is,therefore,a nullity for purposes of the canadian insolvency proceedings.in re nortel networks,carswellont.per curiam wl.the supreme court of canada summarily denied appeal.see pensions regulator nortel networks et,carswellont per curiam wl.appellants,who are also parties to the litigation in canada,subsequently moved to lift the stay in canada to permit them to participate in the proceedings with respect to the canadian debtors.at oral argument before this court,the parties stated that justice winkler the ontario chief justice will oversee mediation proceedings beginning in november,which will focus on the allocation of nortel assets.we consider that statement and forthcoming proceeding of extreme significance.
while the appeal of the bankruptcy court stay order was pending before the district court,the determinations panel held a hearing in the to decide whether to issue an fsd.nni and nn cala forfeited their statutory rights to participate and instead complied with the stay order.according to tpr,the trustee participated in the proceedings by providing witness statements,expert reports and documentary evidence,but only with respect to tpr request for an fsd against nortel entities that are not subject to the stay order.see reasons of the determinations panel of the pensions regulator,case ref,available at hereinafter cited as reasons of the determinations panel.
on june,tpr issued a determination notice directing that fsds be issued against nortel entities after periods for appeal lapsed.see determinations panel,determination notice,case ref,available at.in its separately filed statement of reasons,the dp stated that even though the canadian and american nortel entities did not participate,much of the evidence and representations which have been submitted to tpr are based on the group own documentation in submissions to the regulatory or tax authorities or on documentation submitted by representatives for the individual companies to the uk or north american courts in insolvency proceedings.reasons of the determinations panel at.the determinations panel concluded that it was reasonable to issue fsds against nnuk affiliates because the nortel group operated as a single global entity,and the entities benefited indirectly as a result of the failure adequately to repair the scheme deficit.id.at.
after briefing in the district court,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r,recommending that the automatic stay order be affirmed in all respects because the police power exception is to be narrowly construed the.proceedings do not pass the pecuniary purpose or public policy test which would exempt them from the stay and the bankruptcy court did not impermissibly base its decision on the issue of prejudice.at.appellants filed objections,arguing that the magistrate judge erroneously applied an abuse of discretion standard of review,read the statute too narrowly,incorrectly determined the exception did not apply,and incorrectly concluded that the bankruptcy court did not err by discussing prejudice.
on march,the district court issued an order adopting the r r and affirming the bankruptcy court automatic stay order.the court stated reviewing the r r,de novo,with respect to the objections lodged,the court concludes that the magistrate judge did not err in her conclusions with respect to the bankruptcy court findings of fact and its legal determinations.at.
the trustee and ppf timely appealed.appellants filed a motion to expedite their appeal,and this court granted the motion in a summary order.
on april,the dp issued fsds against several nortel entities including nni and nn cala.thus,under law,the nortel entities had six months until october,to secure financial support for nnuk plan.that time has passed and,inasmuch as it appears the nortel entities failed to appear and to secure financial support for nnuk plan,the dp has the authority to issue a contribution notice cn against them.a cn state es that the entity is under a liability to pay to the trustees the sum specified in the notice,which can be either all or some of the plan deficit.at.under law,t he sum specified in the contribution notice is to be treated as a debt due from the entity to the trustees or managers of the scheme.pensions act.that law provides that the dp should issue such a notice only if it is reasonable to do so and upon consideration of several criteria set forth in the pensions act,which are similar to those considered in connection with issuance of an fsd.despite this similarity,the appellees emphasize that a cn can not be issued until the tpr determines the financial situation of the relevant entities.see pensions act.
appellants nevertheless insist that they are not attempting to enforce collection of debt outside of the bankruptcy proceedings.instead,they assert that the fsd process will help quantify the liability of nnuk affiliates under the pensions act for the benefit of the bankruptcy court.indeed,after receiving word of the debtors motion to enforce the automatic stay,tpr wrote a letter to the debtors counsel stating it is crucial to note that an fsd is not a claim against assets of a party,and the is not engaged in a process of enforcement or of seeking priority for claims lodged in the chapter proceedings.an fsd may result in the agreement of a party to offer financial support,or the issue by the dp of a contribution notice which is treated as a debt due at.the letter continued it is not a process that targets assets but will allow the debt due to the trustees of the nnuk pension scheme from parties such as the debtors to be ascertained and quantified.at emphasis in original.
appellees counter that they believe appellants will use the fsd and cn to their advantage and seize assets,which will put appellants in a better position than other creditors.as the bankruptcy court stated,w hat we have here are creditors who have filed claims in this court and who are seeking to litigate those claims clear of the court jurisdiction and the automatic stay.their effort to do so is inimical to the debtors effort and those of debtors in a highly complex liquidation to assemble the assets,reduce them to money,allocate those assets among numerous entities in many countries and then distribute the assets.at.appellees also point out that the bankruptcy court is capable of quantifying the liability under law,as required,within the context of the allocation proceedings.as such,appellees object not only to the collection of assets in the outside of the allocation process but also the assessment and quantification of the liability in the even if only used as a guide for the bankruptcy court 
standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction under d.we exercise plenary review of an order from a district court sitting as an appellate court in review of a bankruptcy court and we will review both courts legal conclusions de novo we review a bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error.we engage in a mixed standard of review for mixed questions of law and fact,and apply a clearly erroneous standard to integral facts,but exercise plenary review of the court interpretation and application of those facts to legal precepts.in re exide,cir.
this issue requires us to interpret and apply the legal precepts underlying section.accordingly,the standard of review is plenary.united jersey bank,cir citation omitted.to the extent that we consider the decisions of the bankruptcy court and district court regarding comity,we review for abuse of discretion.remington rand.bus,cir.
when a debtor files for bankruptcy,section a of the bankruptcy code imposes a broad automatic stay.that stay prohibits all entities from,inter alia,the commencement or continuation of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title,or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title.a.the automatic stay provides one of the fundamental protections for debtors found in the bankruptcy code.see,midlantic bank dep t of envtl,d.
congress,however,has created certain statutory exceptions that prevent the operation of the automatic stay.the police power exception at issue in this case allows for the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit or any organization exercising authority to enforce such governmental unit or organization police and regulatory power,including the enforcement of a judgment other than a money judgment,obtained in an action or proceeding by the governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit or organization police or regulatory power.b.this exception discourages debtors from submitting bankruptcy petitions either primarily or solely for the purpose of evading impending governmental efforts to invoke the governmental police powers to enjoin or deter ongoing debtor conduct which would seriously threaten the public safety and welfare,environmental consumer protection regulations.in re mcmullen,cir citing in re first alliance mortg,cir noting that fundamental policy of b is to prevent the bankruptcy court from becoming a haven for wrongdoers internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also united states nicolet,cir to combat the risk that the bankruptcy court would become a sanctuary for environmental wrongdoers,among others,congress enacted the police and regulatory power exception to the automatic stay.
the parties do not challenge the extraterritorial application of the automatic stay to the proceedings see david stromes,note,the extraterritorial reach of the bankruptcy code automatic stay theory practice,brook i nt,since,united states courts have uniformly upheld the extraterritorial application of the automatic stay.in the absence of an exception,the plain language of the automatic stay covers appellants participation in the proceedings because the proceedings are an attempt to assess a claim against the debtors that arose 
the exception on which appellants rely for their contention that the automatic stay does not preclude their participation in the proceedings is the police power exception as set forth in b.application of that exception requires us to determine in the first instance whether the proceeding is a proceeding by a governmental unit and,necessarily,which entity,if any,is the relevant governmental unit.b.
governmental unit 
the police power exception to the automatic stay applies to the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding taken by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit police and regulatory power.b.we must first determine which entity is the relevant governmental unit in the proceedings.
as we set forth at the outset,the two appellants are the trustee and ppf.the bankruptcy court held that neither appellant is a governmental unit as defined under the code.under the bankruptcy code,t he term governmental unit means united states state commonwealth district territory municipality foreign state department,agency,or instrumentality of the united states but not a united states trustee while serving as a trustee in a case under this title,a state,a commonwealth,a district,a territory,a municipality,or a foreign state or other foreign or domestic government.the legislative history of instructs that d epartment,agency,or instrumentality does not include entities that owe their existence to state action such as the granting of a charter or a license but that have no other connection with a state or local government or the federal government.the relationship must be an active one in which the department,agency,or instrumentality is actually carrying out some governmental function.in re wade,cir quoting.
we see no basis to disagree with the bankruptcy court conclusion that neither the trustee nor ppf is a governmental unit within the scope of the police power exception.under law,the trustee is a private party responsible for administering the plan and ensuring that members receive their benefits the ppf is a but privately funded entity that acts as a safety net by providing payments to members of defined benefit pension plans whose employers can not fully fund their pension obligations.at.even though ppf owe s its existence to the pensions act,the relationship is not active during the assessment period because ppf is standing in the shoes of a private party.accordingly,neither the trustee nor ppf is a governmental unit during the assessment period for the purposes of the police power exception.
the bankruptcy court proceeded to analyze the applicability of the police power exception using tpr as the relevant governmental unit.in the only case cited by the parties that addressed whether the regulatory procedure initiated by tpr violates the automatic stay,a bankruptcy court in delaware also concluded that tpr was the relevant governmental unit.see in re sea containers,wl,at,approving a settlement agreement.
it is tpr that has been fulfilling its statutory objectives to protect the benefits of members of occupational pension schemes and to reduce the risk of situations arising whereby compensation would become payable by the ppf by initiating the proceedings,which only tpr had the authority to do.see reasons of the determinations panel,supra at.therefore,it appears that tpr is a governmental unit for the purposes of determining the applicability of the police power exception to the proceedings.however,tpr is not a party to the pending bankruptcy proceedings.unlike the trustee and ppf,it did not file a claim and therefore can not assert the police power exception 
pecuniary purpose and public policy tests 
there is yet another obstacle to the appellants argument that the proceedings at issue fall within the police power exception to the automatic stay.to make this determination,courts have applied two related,and somewhat overlapping tests the pecuniary purpose test and the public policy test lockyer mirant,cir.the pecuniary purpose test asks whether the government primarily seeks to protect a pecuniary governmental interest in the debtor property,as opposed to protecting the public safety and health.the public policy test asks whether the government is effectuating public policy rather than adjudicating private rights.if the purpose of the law is to promote public safety and welfare or to effectuate public policy,then the exception to the automatic stay applies.if,on the other hand,the purpose of the law is to protect the government pecuniary interest in the debtor property or primarily to adjudicate private rights,then the exception is inapplicable.see,chao,at.the complementary tests are designed to sort out cases in which the government is bringing suit in furtherance of either its own or certain private parties interest in obtaining a pecuniary advantage over other creditors.id.at.
the issue is not new to this court.we have held that regulatory proceedings related to environmental hazards,health and safety violations,and employment discrimination all fall within the police power exception to the automatic stay.see,in re mystic tank lines,cir recognizing that state action to recover the costs of cleanup of contaminated site fall within police power exception brock morysville body works,cir petition by secretary of labor to enforce occupational safety and health administration citation for violations of safety and health standards hall motor transit,cir employment discrimination action brought by equal employment opportunity commission.additionally,this court has concluded that under circumstances involving a question of preemption arising in a case involving environmental hazards,the exception to the automatic stay provision contained in subsections b should itself be construed broadly,and no unnatural efforts be made to limit its scope.penn terra dep t of envtl,cir.
the proceedings in this case do not relate to public health or safety,and the issue of federal state preemption is not present here.therefore,the reasons for our earlier statement in penn terra that the police power exception to the automatic stay should be construed broadly are not applicable here 
instead of making a broad generally applicable pronouncement as to how the police power exception should be interpreted,we must look to the purpose of the proceeding at issue.in penn terra,the environmental purpose behind the proceedings at issue fell squarely within pennsylvania police and regulatory powers.id.at no more obvious exercise of the state power to protect the health,safety,and welfare of the public can be imagined.moreover,in that case we were focused on the unique concerns involving preemption we supported our decision by noting the bankruptcy court ability to enjoin state proceedings under should it be necessary to effectuate federal bankruptcy policy.a bankruptcy court can not easily enjoin foreign proceedings under.therefore,the reasoning from penn terra cautions against a broad reading of the exception under the circumstances of this case.
like the environmental purpose in penn terra,the purposes behind the proceedings in morysville body works and hall motor transit also fit squarely within the goals intended to be covered by the police power exception.according to the legislative history,b excepts commencement or continuation of actions and proceedings by governmental units to enforce police or regulatory powers.thus,where a governmental unit is suing a debtor to prevent or stop violation of fraud,environmental protection,consumer protection,safety,or similar police or regulatory laws,or attempting to fix damages for violation of such a law,the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic stay.at,reprinted in.
by contrast,the proceedings in this case do not fit within this expressed purpose because they are not predicated upon any allegation of wrongdoing on the part of nortel although a close question,we therefore agree with the bankruptcy court conclusion that the proceedings fail both the pecuniary purpose test and the public policy test.through these proceedings,tpr is primarily seeking to determine the liability for a financial shortfall in a private pension plan.this purpose does not protect the public safety and health as those terms have been applied in the context of the police power exception appellants argue that the proceedings advance a public policy because they encourage the proper funding and administration of pension schemes and also serve to deter the moral hazard created when employers and their affiliates evade pension obligations and pass off the burden of pension liabilities to the ppf.appellants br.at.the passage of the pensions act and the system established by the act clearly reflect public policy decisions.it does not follow,however,that the purpose of the particular proceedings at issue here is to protect the public.rather,these particular proceedings are focused on the pecuniary interests of the ppf and the members of nnuk pension scheme.
this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that tpr is primarily adjudicating private rights through these proceedings.indeed,the pensions act expressly states that the main objectives of tpr in exercising its regulatory functions include
