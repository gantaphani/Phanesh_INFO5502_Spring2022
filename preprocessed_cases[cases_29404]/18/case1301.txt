petitioner manuel tabarrejo was employed as a caregiver by real party in interest princess retirement homes,prh.after tabarrejo left his employment,he filed a claim with the labor commissioner for unpaid wages and other claims.the labor commissioner awarded tabarrejo.
prh appealed the labor commissioner order to the superior court and posted the undertaking required by labor code section tabarrejo moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that prh was a suspended corporation that lacked the capacity to sue.the trial court granted tabarrejo motion to dismiss.prh then failed to pay the amount due under the labor commissioner order within days,so tabarrejo asked the court to release the undertaking to him.but prh disputed tabarrejo entitlement to the undertaking on a number of grounds,primarily arguing that since prh corporate powers were suspended,the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter ab initio and should never have accepted the undertaking.the trial court concluded that prh did not have standing to file the appeal and ordered the release of the undertaking to prh owners,james and judith morales.
we hold that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it released the undertaking to the moraleses based on its conclusion that prh did not have standing to file the appeal.the question presented is one of legal capacity,not standing.although the appeal was invalid when filed because prh lacked the capacity to sue since its corporate powers had been suspended,prh could have retroactively validated the appeal by reviving its corporate powers.that prh elected not to revive its corporate powers did not retroactively deprive the court of jurisdiction to accept the appeal and the undertaking for filing or to dismiss the appeal based on prh incapacity to sue.we shall therefore grant tabarrejo request for writ relief and direct the trial court to vacate its order releasing the undertaking to the moraleses and to enter a new order releasing the undertaking to tabarrejo.
prh,an assisted living facility,employed manuel tabarrejo as a caregiver from june,through september.pursuant to an oral agreement,prh initially paid tabarrejo per hour.on april,prh raised tabarrejo rate of pay to per hour.
tabarrejo lived at the assisted living facility during his employment with prh.he worked an average of hours per day,performing caretaking duties for facility patients.tabarrejo quit his job on september.
california secretary of state records reveal that prh incorporated in was suspended by the secretary of state in april for failing to file a statement of information and was suspended by the franchise tax board in march for failing to meet franchise tax requirements failure to file a return,pay taxes.as of november,prh powers,rights,and privileges remained suspended.the same records list james morales as the ceo of prh and judith morales as its agent for service of process.james and judith morales are the owners and shareholders of prh they did not work at the facility.
procedural history 
tabarrejo complaint before the labor commissioner 
on november,tabarrejo filed a complaint with the labor commissioner seeking compensation for unpaid regular,overtime,and minimum wages and for failure to provide meal and rest periods waiting time penalties and interest.tabarrejo named prh and james and judith morales as defendants,asserting they were joint employers.
proceedings before the labor commissioner 
on november,the labor commissioner conducted a hearing.tabarrejo appeared and was represented by counsel.james and judith morales appeared in their individual capacity and on behalf of prh.all defendants were represented by the same attorney.florence deloso a caregiver,mary matias the business manager,and the moraleses testified on behalf of prh.
at the beginning of the hearing,the hearing officer asked when prh was incorporated.defense counsel responded,it not current.defense counsel then asked judith morales whether prh had paid its dues and registration fee,to which she responded,yes under oath.after the hearing officer stated that the secretary of state records showed a franchise tax board suspension in,defense counsel stated,right.and after that,they paid their registration,but they indicate it still not listed as current.the hearing officer stated suspended or not,a corporation is still subject to the reynolds bement cal th decision,which requires that the common law elements of alter ego liability be shown for the individuals,and i f the plaintiff can not show the common law elements of alter ego liability,i just going to dismiss the individuals.the hearing officer concluded that prh status as a suspended corporation did not eliminate the corporate entity for the purpose of being the employer,and dismissed the individual defendants.
tabarrejo testified that from july through september,he worked days at a base rate of an hour and days at a base rate of an hour.during that time,he worked overtime hours and double time hours at a base rate of per hour,and overtime hours and double time hours at a base rate of per hour.tabarrejo claimed he was not relieved of all duties for at least half an hour on any of those days,did not receive rest breaks,and would watch patients while he ate.
prh did not have time records and did not offer any evidence to contradict tabarrejo testimony.according to the hearing officer,prh offered schedules and testimony about what might have happened or what could have happened,but did not offer evidence about what actually did happen to tabarrejo,in terms of hours worked,on any particular day.one of prh witnesses testified that she was told to take a meal period each day and could get coverage so she did not have to watch a patient while she ate.however,that same witness also acknowledged that sometimes she would have to watch a patient while she ate.there was evidence that tabarrejo would leave the facility on personal errands and that there was coverage if a staff member had to leave or take a break.
nine days after the hearing,the labor commissioner issued an order,decision,or award order in favor of tabarrejo,awarding him.the award included unpaid wages,liquidated damages under section,accrued interest,and waiting time penalties under section.the hearing officer dismissed james and judith morales as defendants pursuant to reynolds bement,supra,cal th,because tabarrejo had not established the common law elements of alter ego liability against them.thus,prh became the sole defendant subject to the labor commissioner order.
proceedings in the trial court 
prh filed an appeal of the order in the superior court on december,the moraleses did not appeal the order.as required by section,subdivision b,that same day,the moraleses deposited an undertaking of with the court on behalf of prh so it could appeal the order.the moraleses claim they posted the undertaking because prh had no assets.since the moraleses who had been dismissed as individual defendants did not appeal the order,it is final as to them.
in april,tabarrejo filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that prh was a suspended corporation and lacked the capacity to sue.in his motion,tabarrejo requested that the undertaking be forfeited to him.he also requested attorney fees.prh did not file an opposition to the motion.on may,the court granted the motion to dismiss,ordered entry of judgment for tabarrejo,and ordered that the undertaking be forfeited to tabarrejo if the judgment was not paid within days,subd.b.
on may,prh filed an ex parte application to set aside the judgment of dismissal on the ground that it had never received a copy of the motion to dismiss.the court denied prh ex parte application without prejudice to seek the same relief in a noticed motion.prh then filed a noticed motion to set aside the dismissal.tabarrejo did not file an opposition to the motion or appear at the hearing.the court granted the motion on june.after tabarrejo asserted that he had not been served with the noticed motion to set aside the dismissal,the court set the matter for rehearing on september.
in august,prh obtained new counsel.in its reply papers in support of the motion to set aside the dismissal,prh argued that the appeal should not be dismissed because of a procedural irregularity before the labor commissioner that was known and accepted by both parties and that dismissal under the circumstances of this case would defeat the letter and the spirit of labor code and work an extreme injustice.prh advised the court that it was seeking administrative relief from the labor commissioner discussed below,asked the court to consider the arguments it made to the labor commissioner,and urged the court not to dismiss the appeal before the labor commissioner ruled on its requests.
post hearing application for administrative relief from the labor commissioner 
prh and the moraleses filed a posthearing application for administrative relief with the labor commissioner,which asked that the order be amended to delete the order dismissing the moraleses as defendants and substitute the moraleses as the employer in place of prh.the application asserted that the moraleses had been dismissed by the labor commissioner due to the mistake and inadvertence of their former counsel.the moraleses agreed,if the order was amended,to waive the protection under reynolds bement and to stipulate,for the purposes of the application,to liability as an alter ego of prh.they said all they wanted was to have their day in court.according to the application,the moraleses posted the undertaking because prh has no assets.they argued that their former counsel had erroneously filed the notice of appeal from the labor commissioner decision and facilitated the posting of the undertaking.they asserted that defense counsel mistakes should be rectified through their administrative application before the damage to the morales es becomes permanent and legally unfixable.the moraleses asked the labor commissioner to stay execution of the judgment in the superior court and to file an amended order so they could file a new notice of appeal in the superior court.
the labor commissioner denied prh and the moraleses requests in a letter dated september.the labor commissioner explained that the moraleses were not entitled to relief under section,subdivision f because such relief is only available when a defendant fails to attend a hearing,and the moraleses attended the hearing both in their individual capacity and on behalf of prh and were represented by counsel.the labor commissioner also denied the moraleses request to amend the order to modify the legal name of the business,subd.h since the hearing officer had found that prh was the correct defendant and had dismissed the moraleses because alter ego liability was unfounded.finally,he labor commissioner refused to set aside the order or grant another hearing.
further proceedings in the trial court 
on september,while the application for administrative relief was pending,the trial court conducted a hearing on prh request to set aside the dismissal.the court denied the motion to set aside the dismissal and ordered counsel to appear on october,to be heard regarding forfeiture of the undertaking.the court also found that the time for prh to appeal the order had expired and that judgment may be entered in favor of tabarrejo for.prh did not seek appellate review of the order denying its motion to set aside the dismissal.
on october,prh counsel sent a letter to the trial court recounting prh failed application for relief from the labor commissioner and arguing that the proper action to restore the parties to the status quo ante was to return the undertaking to the moraleses.this time,prh argued that the owners of the cash deposit,judith and james morales,are not the employer and that they were not parties to the appeal.prh argued that the court never had jurisdiction and should not have accepted the cash deposit ab initio and that the undertaking should therefore be returned to the moraleses.
tabarrejo filed an opposition to prh request to return the undertaking to the moraleses.tabarrejo argued,among other things,that under section,subdivision b,forfeiture of the undertaking to tabarrejo was mandatory since the case had been dismissed and prh had failed to pay the award within days of the dismissal.tabarrejo also told the court that prh had not paid the in attorney fees the court had previously ordered,and he requested in additional attorney fees under section,subdivision c and section.
in reply,prh argued that if the court is not disposed to provide prh with a de novo hearing and a trial on the merits,then it would be fundamentally unfair and a violation of due process to retain their sic cash deposit for an appeal that was disallowed in the first place,and then disburse that money to tabarrejo without a trial on the merits prh also objected to the amount tabarrejo requested in attorneys fees,calling it excessive for a run of the mill wage claim.
on november,the court ruled in favor of prh on the forfeiture issue and ordered the clerk to release the undertaking to the moraleses.the court found that prh was a suspended corporation with no standing to file the appeal,that the appeal was void from the outset,and that an order releasing the bond to tabarrejo would be inconsistent with that finding.further,it would be an inequitable result for the person who posted the bond if the money was released to the employee.the court nonetheless granted tabarrejo request for attorney fees and awarded the full amount claimed.
tabarrejo filed this petition for writ of mandate,prohibition,or other relief on november,asking this court to direct the trial court to vacate its order.
discussion 
tabarrejo argues that the trial court abused its discretion,acted in excess of its jurisdiction,and erred as a matter of law when it released the undertaking to the moraleses.he contends the trial court should have disbursed the undertaking to him under section,subdivision b because prh appeal was dismissed in september and prh has failed to pay the amount awarded by the labor commissioner.he argues that the trial court had jurisdiction to accept prh appeal and the undertaking,and that prh incapacity to sue or to defend itself based on its status as a suspended corporation was not a jurisdictional defect.he also requests costs and attorney fees for litigating prh appeal.
prh responds that its appeal was effectively void moot on the day it was filed,and that the trial court should not have accepted the undertaking and was not authorized to release it to tabarrejo.prh argues that since the trial court had no jurisdiction from the start,the undertaking must be returned to the moraleses.prh also argues that if it was not entitled to file an appeal and have a new trial,then it stands to reason that the trial court can not in fairness retain and then disburse what would be the appellant money.to do so would be an unconstitutional taking and a violation of due process.prh argues,alternatively,that if the court had jurisdiction,then it had the inherent power to permit the moraleses to prosecute the appeal.finally,prh argues that it would be unfair to award tabarrejo attorney fees because tabarrejo counsel contributed to the procedural disaster in this case.
before addressing the parties contentions,we examine the moraleses role in these writ proceedings.
the moraleses are not parties to these writ proceedings 
the captions on the preliminary opposition and the return filed with this court state that they were filed by princess retirement homes,et,real parties in interest.the plural references et and parties suggest that there is more than one real party in interest.in addition,the preliminary opposition asserts that the moraleses are the true real parties in interest and the return alleges they are also real parties in interest.but,as we shall explain,the moraleses are not parties to the writ proceedings in this court.
only prh appealed the labor commissioner order to the superior court.if they had wanted to,the moraleses could have appealed the labor commissioner finding that they were not employers,but they elected not to appeal that ruling.moreover,the day jurisdictional time limit for the moraleses to request a trial de novo of the order expired long ago.pressler donald bren cal d,pressler the time for filing a notice of appeal from a decision of the labor commissioner is mandatory and jurisdictional.
in writ proceedings,real party in interest has been generally defined as any person or entity whose interest will be directly affected by the proceedings citation.while the real party in interest is usually the other party to the lawsuit or proceeding being challenged citation,it may be anyone having a direct interest in the result citation,or the real adverse party in whose favor the act complained has been done.connerly state personnel bd.cal th,connerly.although the moraleses may have a direct interest in the result of these writ proceedings because they allegedly provided the funds for the undertaking,as we shall explain,they are not real parties in interest because they were not designated as parties in tabarrejo writ petition.since a writ proceeding in the court of appeal is an original proceeding,and not an appeal,the petition serves as the complaint,and must name all of the parties.tracy press,superior court th,citing cal.rules of court,rule b.tabarrejo writ petition names prh as the real party in interest,but does not name the moraleses.since the petition does not allege that the moraleses are real parties in interest,they are not parties to these proceedings.id.at.
overview of berman hearing process 
the supreme court has reviewed the statutory scheme that governs employee wage claims on several occasions,most recently in sonic calabasas a,moreno cal th,sonic.the sonic court explained that if an employer fails to pay wages in the amount,time or manner required by contract or by statute,the employee has two principal options.the employee may seek judicial relief by filing an ordinary civil action against the employer for breach of contract for the wages prescribed by statute.or the employee may seek administrative relief by filing a wage claim with the labor commissioner pursuant to a special statutory scheme codified in sections to.the latter option was added by legislation enacted in and is commonly known as the berman hearing procedure after the name of its sponsor.sonic,at italics added.
after an employee files a complaint with the labor commissioner for nonpayment of wages,section,subdivision a provides for three alternatives.the labor commissioner may accept the matter and conduct an administrative hearing prosecute a civil action for the collection of wages and other money payable to employees or take no further action on the complaint.sonic,supra,cal th at,citing murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,murphy.the berman hearing procedure is designed to provide a speedy,informal,and affordable method of resolving wage claims t he purpose of the berman hearing procedure is to avoid recourse to costly and judicial proceedings in all but the most complex of wage claims.murphy,at.

within days after notice of the decision any party may appeal to the appropriate court,where the claim will be heard de novo if no appeal is taken,the commissioner decision will be deemed a judgment,final immediately,and enforceable as a judgment in a civil action.if an employer appeals the labor commissioner award,a s a condition to filing an appeal pursuant to this section,an employer shall first post an undertaking with the reviewing court in the amount of the order,decision,or award.the undertaking shall consist of an appeal bond issued by a licensed surety or a cash deposit with the court in the amount of the order,decision,or award,subd.b.sonic,supra,cal th at.

the sonic court summarized relevant aspects of the berman statutes as follows in sum,the berman statutes provide important benefits to employees by reducing the costs and risks of pursuing a wage claim in several ways.first,the berman hearing itself provides an accessible,informal,and affordable mechanism for laypersons to seek resolution of such claims.citation.second,section,subdivision c discourages unmeritorious appeals of berman hearing awards by providing that a party who unsuccessfully appeals an award must pay the other party costs and attorney fees.citation.fifth,the berman statutes ensure that an employee will actually collect a judgment or award by mandating that the labor commissioner use her or his best efforts to collect a berman hearing award and by requiring the employer to post an undertaking for the amount of the award if it takes an appeal.citation.sonic,supra,cal th at italics added.
with this statutory framework in mind,we turn to the principles governing corporate capacity to sue or defend an action.
corporate capacity to sue or defend 
under california law,a corporation ordinarily has the capacity to sue.see,corporation generally has all of the powers of a natural person in carrying out its business activities color vue,abrams th,color vue.but a corporation that has had its powers suspended lacks legal capacity to prosecute or defend a civil action during its suspension.sade shoe oschin snyder d,sade.on the other hand,a suspended corporation may be sued and a default judgment may be entered upon its failure to respond.grell laci le beau th.
the corporate powers,rights and privileges of any domestic corporate taxpayer may be suspended for failure to pay certain taxes and penalties.this means the suspended corporation can not sell,transfer or exchange real property in california,and contracts entered into during the time of suspension are voidable through legal action.citation.nor,during the period of suspension,may the corporation prosecute or defend an action,seek a writ of mandate,appeal from an adverse judgment,or renew a judgment obtained before suspension.citation.center for self improvement community development lennar corporation th,center.the purpose of revenue and taxation code section is to prohibit the delinquent corporation from enjoying the ordinary privileges of a going concern,in order to pressure it into paying its taxes.peacock hill peacock lagoon constr.cal d,peacock hill that purpose,in turn,is satisfied by a rule which views a corporation tax delinquencies,after correction,as mere irregularities.center,at.
in cases of franchise tax board suspensions,such as prh suspension in,a suspended corporation can regain its corporate powers by filing all required tax returns,paying the necessary taxes,penalties or fees due,and applying to the franchise tax board for a certificate of revivor.this reinstatement or revivor generally is without prejudice to any action,defense or right which has accrued by reason of the original suspension or forfeiture.center,supra,th at.thus,the revival of corporate powers retroactively validates any procedural steps taken on behalf of the corporation in the prosecution or defense of a lawsuit while the corporation was under suspension.benton county of napa d,benton.
most litigation activity has been characterized as procedural for purposes of corporate revival.for example,a judgment obtained during suspension is validated by subsequent revivor.citations.a motion to dismiss an appeal because of a party suspension may be denied if the party obtains a certificate of revivor.citations.the corporate defense of an action undertaken during suspension may be validated by later revival of corporate powers.citations.benton,supra,d at,citing traub coffee break service,cal d,traub and other cases.in sum,the revival of corporate powers enables the previously suspended party to proceed with the prosecution or defense of the action and validates a judgment obtained during suspension.citations.center,supra,th at.
a corporation powers,rights,and privileges may also be suspended if a corporation fails to file annual statements of information pursuant to corporations code section,as prh failed to do.see.a corporation suspended under the corporations code,like a corporation suspended under the revenue and taxation code,is also disabled from participating in litigation activities.palm valley homeowners,design mtc th.the corporation may revive its powers by complying with the requirements of corporations code section,subdivision d.id.at.
the trial court had jurisdiction to accept prh appeal 
prh corporate incapacity to sue and to defend itself did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to accept the appeal.corporate incapacity is nothing more than a legal disability,depriving the party of the right to come into court and represent its own interests.as such,lack of capacity is not a jurisdictional defect and is waived if not properly raised.citation.thus,the suspended status of corporate powers at the time of filing suit does not impede the trial court jurisdiction to proceed,nor does a suspension after suit commences but before rendition of judgment deprive the court of jurisdiction or render the judgment void.center,supra,th at,citing traub,supra,cal d at.
courts have distinguished between procedural steps taken on behalf of the suspended corporation while under suspension,which can be resuscitated by revival,and substantive defenses that accrue during the time of suspension,which can not.center,supra,th at,citing benton,supra,d at.the statute of limitations is regarded as a substantive defense.if an action is commenced while the corporation is suspended,the corporation subsequent revival does not prevent the running of the statute of limitations if the statute runs prior to revival,the corporation action will be,even if the complaint would otherwise have been timely.center,at sade,supra,d at.
it appears the trial court relied on this rule,in part,when it ruled on prh motion to set aside the dismissal and the parties competing claims to the undertaking.in its october,order on the motion to set aside the dismissal,the court stated,the time for prh to appeal from the labor commissioner order has expired and therefore judgment may be entered in accordance with section d in favor of tabarrejo.and in its november,order regarding release of the undertaking,the court found that the appeal was void from the outset.as we shall explain,the trial court erred to the extent that its rulings were based on the conclusion that the appeal was not timely filed because of prh incapacity to sue or to defend itself.
we begin with the rule that timely filing of the notice of appeal and the undertaking is both mandatory and jurisdictional.pressler,supra,cal d,palagin,supra,th.if the appeal and the undertaking are not filed within the time set forth in section,the trial court is without jurisdiction to hear the case.pressler,at palagin,at.but the appeal and the undertaking in this case were filed within the time set forth in the statute.section,subdivision a provides that an appeal of a labor commissioner order must be filed w ithin days after service of notice of the order and that f or the purposes of computing the day period after service,section of the code of civil procedure applies.since the order was served by regular mail,under code of civil procedure section,prh was entitled to five additional days,or a total of days,to file its appeal.the order was served on november,and prh appeal and the undertaking were filed on december,days later.prh appeal was therefore timely.but the trial court concluded that the time to appeal had expired,presumably because prh was suspended at the time the notice of appeal was filed.although the trial court did not explain its reasoning behind its timeliness ruling,it appears the court treated the section deadline for filing a notice of appeal as a statute of limitations and held that even though the appeal was timely under section,the action was barred because prh was suspended when it filed its appeal.
in bourhis lord cal th bourhis,the california supreme court reviewed the question of a court jurisdiction when a notice of appeal is timely filed by a suspended corporation.a plaintiff corporation and others filed a civil action against multiple defendants.id.at.before trial,the defendants learned that the plaintiff corporation had been suspended and filed a motion to preclude it from offering any evidence at trial.the trial court denied the motion,contingent on the corporation reviving its corporate powers.the defendants prevailed at trial and the plaintiffs,including the suspended corporation,filed timely notices of appeal of both the judgment and a postjudgment order awarding costs and attorney fees.ibid.the defendants filed motions in the court of appeal to dismiss the corporation appeals on the ground that its corporate powers were still suspended.the corporation opposed the motions with evidence that its corporate powers had been revived seven days after the motions were filed.the court of appeal denied the motions and the supreme court granted review of the question whether the revival of the corporation powers validated its earlier notice of appeal.id.at.
the bourhis court stated if revival of corporate powers occurs while a valid appeal can still be taken,the question appears easy the revival would validate a prior notice of appeal and permit the appeal to proceed.the appeal would be timely,and little purpose would be served by requiring the corporation to file another,essentially identical,notice of appeal.but appeals are subject to jurisdictional time limits.a notice of appeal must be filed within days after service of the notice of entry of judgment.cal.rules of court,rule a.the time to file notice of appeal,both in civil and criminal cases,has always been held jurisdictional in california.citation.as to both appeals at issue here,this time had expired before the plaintiff corporation corporate powers were revived.should the later revival validate the earlier invalid notice of appeal in this circumstance bourhis,supra,cal th at.the court held that it did.the supreme court reviewed two prior cases in which it had held that the revival of corporate powers after an appeal had been filed did not prevent the appellant from proceeding with the appeal,and it declined to overrule those cases.id.at.
the bourhis court observed that a number of court of appeal cases have held that the running of a statute of limitations is a substantive defense that may not be prejudiced by the corporation later revival of its corporate powers.bourhis,supra,cal th at.the supreme court acknowledged the tension between the rule articulated in the statute of limitations cases no retroactive revival and the rule for notices of appeal retroactive revival,and concluded that the two approaches can be reconciled.id.at.the court explained that revenue and taxation code section provides that revival shall be without prejudi
