this appeal concerns appellants claims against appellees sunset financial services,sunset and kansas city life insurance company kcl for damages arising out of a ponzi scheme perpetrated by bryan behrens,a registered representative of sunset and general agent of kcl.appellants brought claims against sunset and kcl based on theories of federal and state liability and common law theories of secondary liability.the district court granted sunset and kcl motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and denied appellants motions for leave to file amended complaints.appellants challenge each of these rulings.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
kcl is licensed with the nebraska department of insurance to deal in sickness and accident insurance,life insurance,variable life insurance,and variable annuities.kcl also offers various investment options through sunset,its subsidiary.sunset is a registered with the securities and exchange commission sec.kcl describes sunset as an giving agencies and producers the flexibility to offer quality life insurance as well as securities products through a single relationship.appellants allege that sunset markets itself as a trusted financial advisory firm with agents and representatives who can be trusted to give advice on insurance and financial matters.
behrens was president and ceo of century financial group,which appellants allege he operated as a branch office of sunset.he was also a registered representative of sunset and a general agent of kcl.appellants allege that kcl promoted behrens and gave him a number of awards that expressly and implicitly suggested that behrens was trustworthy and acting with the authority,consent,and approval of kcl and its affiliates and subsidiaries,giving behrens an aura of authority.
appellants allege they invested money with behrens through national investments,an entity that behrens controlled.in connection with these investments,behrens sold promissory notes to appellants,listing national investments as the borrower.appellants allege that behrens took their money with the promise that he would invest it and provide them with a steady stream of income.rather than invest the money,behrens misappropriated the funds for his personal use,spent the money in other ways,or simply transferred money among appellants and other investors to prevent them from discovering the fraud.
appellants lustgraaf,jean and dee poole collectively poole,and vacanti filed their initial complaints in july,seeking relief from sunset on theories of federal and state liability and common law theories of secondary liability.they did not name kcl as a defendant in the original complaint.in response,sunset filed a motion to dismiss appellants claims under rule b for failure to join a necessary party under rule rule b for failure to state a claim and rule b and the private securities litigation reform act pslra,b,for failure to plead with particularity.appellants lustgraaf,poole,and vacanti amended their complaints in january while sunset motion to dismiss was pending before the district court.the amended complaints added kcl as a defendant,but did not make any other changes.appellants william and joann green collectively green then filed an initial complaint alleging the same violations against sunset and kcl.sunset subsequently filed a motion to dismiss green complaint,and kcl filed a motion to dismiss as to all parties.
in march,the district court granted sunset motion to dismiss as to lustgraaf,poole,and vacanti.in july,the district court granted sunset motion to dismiss as to green and kcl motion to dismiss as to all parties.at that time,the district court also denied appellants various motions for leave to file second amended complaints the sole ground for the district court denial was that the proposed second amended complaints failed to correct the deficiencies in the operative complaints and were therefore futile.
on appeal,appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing the operative complaints,and,alternatively,that the district court erred in denying their various motions for leave to file second amended complaints.appellants also argue that the district court improperly took judicial notice of the fact that william green was a director on national investments board.sunset and kcl argue that the district court correctly granted their motions to dismiss and that we may affirm on alternative grounds.we consider these arguments in turn.
ii.discussion 
the operative complaints allege that sunset and kcl are liable for behrens conduct based on theories of a federal liability b state liability c apparent authority and d respondeat superior.we review the district court dismissal of these complaints de novo.braden stores,cir.in so doing,we take as true the factual allegations and grant all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.id.we owe no deference,however,to legal conclusions or formulaic recitation s of the elements of a cause of action.bell atlantic twombly.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting twombly,at.the plausibility of a complaint turns on whether the facts alleged allow us to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.
the pslra imposes a heightened pleading standard in cases alleging securities fraud.claims governed by the pslra must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading the falsity requirement,b,and state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind the scienter requirement,id.b see also tellabs,makor issues rights.
finally,where relevant,we address the district court denial of appellants motions for leave to file second amended complaints.because the district court dismissed appellants motions based on futility,and not as an exercise of its discretion,our review is de novo.see pierson dormire,cir,vacated in part on other grounds,app x cir.
federal liability 
counts ii and iii of the operative complaints allege claims against sunset and kcl for liability under a of the securities exchange act of,a.the purpose of the federal statute is to prevent people and entities from using straw parties,subsidiaries,or other agents acting on their behalf to accomplish ends that would be forbidden directly by the securities laws.laperriere vesta ins.group,cir per curiam.to that end,the statute provides for liability of those who,subject to certain defenses,directly or indirectly control a primary violator of the federal securities laws.a.in providing for liability of controlling persons,however,congress did not define the meaning of control.see,at it was thought undesirable to attempt to define control.it would be difficult if not impossible to enumerate or to anticipate the many ways in which actual control may be exerted.rather,it left that task to the courts.our court has held that the statute is remedial and is to be construed liberally.it has been interpreted as requiring only some indirect means of discipline or influence short of actual direction to hold a controlling person liable.farley henson,cir quoting myzel fields,cir.to meet this standard,a plaintiff must prove that a primary violator violated the federal securities laws that the alleged control person actually exercised control over the general operations of the primary violator and that the alleged control person did not necessarily power to determine the specific acts or omissions upon which the underlying violation is predicated.farley,at.culpable participation by the alleged control person in the primary violation is not part of a plaintiff prima facie case.metge baehler,cir.if a plaintiff satisfies the prima facie burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that it acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.a see also metge,at.
before addressing the issues particular to sunset and kcl,we address their argument that we should affirm on the ground that appellants failed to allege a primary violation with the specificity the pslra requires.the plain language of the statute dictates that,absent a primary violation,a claim for liability must fail.see a in re hutchinson.sec,cir.because the primary violation in this case is behrens alleged violation of b of the securities exchange act,b,and rule,appellants must satisfy the pslra heightened pleading requirements.see hutchinson,at.we are satisfied that they met their burden on both the falsity and scienter requirements 
it is not enough,under the pslra falsity requirement,to allege that fraud has occurred.in re cerner.sec,cir.to meet the falsity requirement,a complaint must not only indicate that false statements were made,but must indicate why the alleged misstatements were false when made.id.we have previously found allegations insufficient where they point to a statement that a defendant made and then show in hindsight that the statement is false.see,elam neidorff,cir quoting in re navarre.sec,cir.here,however,the problem of hindsight bias is not present and the allegations are not otherwise lacking in specificity.the complaints specify behrens alleged false statements that he would invest appellants funds and provide them with a steady stream of returns.it also alleges facts sufficient to support an inference that those statements were false at the time they were made rather than investing the funds,behrens misappropriated them for other uses,including the continuation of his fraudulent scheme.further,the complaints allege the method by which behrens carried out the fraud.finally,the complaints allege the dates on which appellants made their investments with behrens and the amounts of those investments.thus,the operative complaints articulate the who,what,when,where,and how of the alleged misleading statements.in re int l.sec.litig,cir quotation omitted.appellants have met their burden of alleging falsity under the pslra.
when determining whether a complaint gives rise to a strong inference of the wrongdoing was reckless or supreme court has instructed us to consider,not only inferences urged by the plaintiff but also those competing inferences rationally drawn from the facts alleged.tellabs,at.to find a strong inference,the inference must be more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.elam,at internal citations omitted.the complaints in this case allege that behrens knowingly made false statements that allowed him to divert appellants money for his personal use and for the use of perpetuating his fraudulent scheme.we have stated that such allegations raise a strong inference of scienter.see kushner beverly,cir strong inference of scienter arises where defendant benefitted in a concrete and personal way from the purported fraud cornelia crowell gst trust possis,cir scienter can be established from allegations of motive and opportunity.neither sunset nor kcl offer any rational competing inferences as to behrens mental state,nor can we draw any from the complaints.accordingly,we hold that appellants complaints raise a strong inference of scienter.
having found that the complaints allege with sufficient particularity the presence of a primary violation,we address the remaining prongs of federal liability as they apply to sunset and kcl.
unlike the first prong of our test,where fraud is at issue,the second and third prongs involve questions of control and are therefore analyzed under our ordinary standard.see stephenson deutsche bank ag,d,in re initial pub.offering sec,d,that the pslra was not intended to apply to section a claims is further bolstered by the legislative history of the pslra,which specifies that its heightened pleading standards only apply to securities fraud claims.the district court found that appellants could not establish liability against sunset because they failed to allege facts supporting their allegations that sunset exercised control over behrens generally or had the ability to control behrens with respect to the fraudulent transactions.appellants theory on appeal is that,as a matter of law,a plaintiff states a claim for liability against a such as sunset when the complaint alleges a primary violation by the registered representative.our decision in martin shearson lehman hutton,cir,governs the inquiry.
in martin,a registered representative of the defendant advised the plaintiff to purchase stock that the representative described as a safe investment.id.at.because the defendant had instructed its representatives not to recommend sale of the stock at issue,the representative advised the plaintiff to purchase the stock through a different brokerage house,at which the representative was soon taking employment.id.at.the defendant had no relationship with this other brokerage house.id.at.when the plaintiff discovered fraud in connection with the stock purchase,she sued the defendant as a control person.id.after a jury verdict for the plaintiff,the appealed,arguing that its connection with the sale was insufficient as a matter of law to support a verdict of liability because the sale was not consummated through its brokerage house and because the solicitation was directly contrary to its instructions to brokers.id.at.relying on our decisions in myzel,at,and metge,at,as well as the ninth circuit decision in hollinger titan capital,cir en banc,we held that the fact that the solicitation took place while the representative was employed by the was sufficient to make out a prima facie case of controlling person liability,regardless of the fact that the sale took place through a separate and unrelated.martin,at.
as was the case in martin and hollinger,appellants allege that behrens fraudulent transactions took place while he was sunset registered representative.sunset argues that it can not be a control person because the fraudulent transactions took place through national investments,a firm having no affiliation with sunset.our decision in martin and the ninth circuit decision in hollinger,however,stand for the proposition that the involvement of a separate brokerage firm does not render inadequate an otherwise properly pleaded prima facie case for federal liability.exercise considerable control over their representatives,both in the sense that their association allows representatives legal access to securities markets,a and in the sense that the securities laws require to establish oversight systems to monitor representatives activities,id.b e i thus,although behrens fraud did not take place through sunset,it is sunset that effectively provided behrens access to the markets,and sunset that had the duty to monitor his activities.behrens could not have perpetrated his fraudulent scheme absent appellants belief that he had access to these markets.sunset had the responsibility to oversee behrens activity with respect to his actions as a registered representative.
the cases sunset cites in support of its argument do not persuade us to the contrary.in hauser farell,cir,overruled on other grounds by central bank first interstate bank,the case on which sunset principally relies,the court upheld a district court grant of summary judgment on a claim.there,two representatives sold the plaintiffs an interest in a partnership that the representatives themselves private venture unrelated to the securities markets to which the representatives had access by virtue of their relationship with the.id.at.further,there was no evidence that the knew of the transaction.id.at.because of these facts,the court held that the representatives actions were outside of their relationship with the and therefore could not provide a basis for liability.id.at.
hauser is inapplicable here.hauser was not a case and its analysis involved facts that are not part of a plaintiff prima facie burden.see martin,at.questions of good faith and lack of knowledge,while potentially viable arguments for the defense at summary judgment,are irrelevant to our decision here at the pleadings stage.further,we can not say,taking the present allegations in the light most favorable to the appellants,that the complaints demonstrate on their face that behrens actions were so unrelated to his relationship with sunset that we could find as a matter of law that appellants have failed to state a claim.the remaining cases cited by sunset are similarly unavailing,as they involve questions appropriately asked at the summary judgment stage rather than the pleadings stage.see asplund selected invs.in fin.equities,analyzing a summary judgment claim based on the considerations found in hauser see also fraioli lemcke,d,same barnes sws fin,same.thus,sunset proffered cases provide no more than a which we a is not strictly liable for the actions of its representatives.they are not persuasive at this stage of the litigation.
finally,we reject sunset and kcl invitation to join other circuits in requiring culpable participation by a defendant in an action for liability.this issue has created a circuit split.compare sec first jersey,cir requiring culpable participation carpenter harris,upham,cir same rochez,rhoades,cir same with metge,at culpable participation not required howard everex,cir same maher durango metals,cir same harrison dean witter reynolds,cir same abbott equity group,cir same.our court,as noted,has expressly stated that culpable participation by an alleged control person in the primary violation is not an element of the claim.metge,at.sunset and kcl argue that the passage of the pslra requires us to revisit the issue.we disagree.congress designed the pslra,in part,to curb frivolous securities litigation by way of heightened pleading standards in fraud cases.see elam,at.because federal liability is dependent on control,not fraud,the heightened pleading standards instituted by the pslra do not provide reason to revisit our metge decision.
we reverse the district court dismissal of appellants claims against sunset.appellants appeal concerning the proposed second amended complaints on this issue is therefore moot.
the district court found that because it dismissed appellants claims as to sunset,the claims against sunset parent company,kcl,must also be dismissed.appellants argument on appeal as to kcl is similar to their argument as to sunset it is an argument based on the relationship of the entities.they argue that because sunset controls behrens,and kcl is sunset parent company,kcl is a controlling person as to behrens.without further allegations as to kcl actual exercise of control over behrens general operations,a and our case law interpreting that provision do not permit extension of liability to kcl.
although we engage in certain presumptions with respect to,see martin,at,we generally require that a plaintiff allege facts demonstrating that the alleged control person actually exercised control over the primary violator general operations in order to state a claim for liability.metge,at see also aldridge cross,st cir to meet the control elements,the alleged controlling person must not only have the general power to control the company,but must also actually exercise control over the company.harrison,at same.our rule is therefore distinct from courts that only require the ability to control,regardless of whether that control was exercised.see,brown enstar group,cir.here,the operative complaints allege that kcl wholly owned sunset and thereby indirectly controlled behrens.these allegations show,at most,kcl ability to control behrens.they fail,however,to show that kcl actually exercised control over behrens general operations.unless there are facts that indicate that the controlling shareholders were actively participating in the decisionmaking process of the primary violator,no controlling liability can be imposed.aldridge,at.
in re mutual funds investment litigation,cir,cert.granted,janus capital group,first derivative traders,wl june,the case on which appellants rely,is not to the contrary.appellants cite mutual funds for the proposition that a parent may control its subsidiary and,indirectly,the subsidiary employees,simply by virtue of its status as a parent company.not only does this argument directly conflict with our precedent,it misstates the fourth circuit holding.to be sure,the fourth circuit quotes from an article taking the position that appellants now assert.see id.at quoting loftus carson,ii,the liability of controlling persons under the federal securities acts,notre dame.but the holding of the case is more nuanced and thus distinguishable from the present case.mutual funds did not hold that a relationship by itself is enough to overcome a motion to dismiss on a claim.rather,the fourth circuit relied on allegations that the parent company had directors who also took an active role in managing the subsidiary.id.at.specifically,the complaint alleged that the parent had implemented policies to put an end to the subsidiary actions that led to the lawsuit.id.these are precisely the type of allegations that demonstrate an exercise of control rather than a mere ability to control.because any such allegations are absent from the operative complaints in this case,mutual funds does not support appellants position.
appellants proposed second amended complaints fail to cure this deficiency.the second amended complaints contain the additional allegations that sunset and kcl operated from the same location many of sunset registered representatives were also agents of kcl and sunset and kcl had shared directors and employees.these arguments fall short.first,the mere fact that the two entities shared the same office space is not an allegation of control.nor,without explanation,is the allegation that there is some crossover in agents and representatives.the second amended complaints do not allege that overlapping agents exercised or even had the authority to control behrens.third,although the existence of shared directors is a factor to be considered in determining control,it is not determinative.see mutual funds,at.the complaints do not,as did the complaint in mutual funds,allege the additional facts necessary to demonstrate that kcl actually exercised control over behrens general operations rather than merely possessed the ability to do so.because this is a required element of appellants claim,see metge,at,we affirm the district court denial of leave to amend.
state liability 
each of the four appellants asserted a claim under the securities act of nebraska,for state liability.additionally,appellants lustgraaf and poole asserted alternative claims under the laws of iowa,iowa code,and arizona,respectively.the district court held that nebraska law requires a plaintiff to allege that a provided material aid to the primary violator in order to state a claim for liability.according to the district court,because the complaints against sunset and kcl failed to allege material aid,appellants claims under nebraska law failed.in addition,the district court determined that the relevant sections of the iowa and arizona laws are nearly identical to nebraska law and therefore dismissed those claims without performing a analysis.
we review the district court statutory interpretation de novo.united states kirchoff,cir.when addressing a state statute,we are bound by the decisions of the state highest court.supply raymond,cir quotation omitted.when a state highest court has not decided an issue,it is up to this court to predict how the state highest court would resolve that issue.id.quotation omitted.we believe that the supreme courts of the respective states would hold that their statutes do not require a plaintiff to allege material aid in order to state a claim against a.we proceed by discussing the statutes at issue.
the relevant section of the securities act of nebraska states 
every person who directly or indirectly controls a primary violator,including every partner,limited liability company member,officer,director,or person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions of a partner,limited liability company member,officer,or director,or employee of such person who materially aids in the conduct giving rise to liability,and every,agent,investment adviser,or investment adviser representative who materially aids in such conduct shall be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such person,unless able to sustain the burden of proof that he or she did not know,and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known,of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.
the nebraska courts have not directly addressed whether a must provide material aid to a primary violator in order to be liable as a control person we believe,however,that in light of the statute plain language,see nebraska hense,statutory language is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning,and the nebraska supreme court recent decision in hooper freedom fin.group,no,wl.june,the statute permits liability,subject to a defense,against a by proof of either direct or indirect control over the primary violator or by proof that the provided material aid to the primary violator.
the plain language of provides two ways in which a defendant could be held liable as a control person.the statute begins by articulating a broad category of every person that can be held liable by way of direct or indirect control over the primary violator.included in this broad group is a nonexclusive list of specific persons partners,limited liability company members,officers,and directors,or persons performing similar roles and functions.the plain language in this first part of the statute indicates that if a plaintiff proves direct or indirect control,the plaintiff is not required to prove that the alleged control person provided material aid.the nebraska supreme court recently confirmed this plain reading.see hooper,wl,at holding that,barring their ability to prove a statutory defense,officers and directors,persons having direct or indirect control under the statute,are strictly liable for the actions of primary violators.if a plaintiff can not prove direct or indirect control,provides an alternative means of liability as to certain persons proof that the alleged control person provided material aid to the primary violator.a plaintiff can apply this alternative theory to employees of a person who directly or indirectly controls the primary violator and to,agents,investment advisers,or investment advisor representatives.
applying the plain language of the statute to the present case,we believe that the statute permits liability against without reference to material aid.by articulating a broad group every person the first part of the statute permits liability against all persons who directly or indirectly control a primary violator,regardless of whether they provided material aid.given the right facts,a such as sunset could fall within this first part of the statute.contrary to sunset and kcl argument,the part of the statute permitting liability against by way of material aid does not alter this conclusion.although specific provisions may sometimes govern over general provisions,nebraska ex rel.strom marsh,this rule of construction is only applicable when there is a conflict between the two provisions that creates ambiguity,see also cox.telecom,llc qwest,to the extent that there is a conflict between two statutes on the same subject,the specific statute controls over the general statute.emphasis added.here,there is no such conflict and the language is clear.the material aid part of the statute provides one way in which to establish liability against it does not limit a plaintiff ability to take the alternative avenue of proving direct or indirect control.
our analysis of the iowa statute is similar.the iowa statute articulates a broad category of who,without reference to material aid,can be liable,barring statutory defenses,for the conduct of a primary violator by directly or indirectly controlling the primary violator.see iowa code a a person that directly or indirectly controls a primary violator is jointly and severally liable with the primary violator,unless able to prove a statutory defense.like the nebraska statute,this inclusive language is plain on its face and we need not engage in other methods of statutory interpretation.see renda iowa civil rights comm n,iowa if the language is clear and plain,we will not utilize construction.by declining to limit the persons subject to liability under a,we believe that a,given the right facts,could be liable without reference to material aid.
the specific reference in d to material aid as a way in which a can be found liable does not persuade us to the contrary.as with the nebraska statute,this is not a case of the specific governing over the general because there is no conflict between the two subsections of the statute.see mcelroy iowa,iowa typically,when a general and specific statute cover the same matter,the specific statue governs over any conflict with the general statute.section d is simply an alternative to a for asserting liability against a.
finally,neither sunset nor kcl argue that arizona statute.b,requires material aid in this situation.the arizona statute states,in relevant part,that every who,directly or indirectly,controls any primary violator is liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the controlled person unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act underlying the action.id.b.nowhere in the language of the statute is there an indication of a requirement,and at least one arizona court has reached this conclusion.see eastern vanguard forex.comm n,the plain language of the statute does not support a requirement that a controlling person must have actually participated in the specific action upon which the securities violation is based.
we conclude that,contrary to the district court order,all three of the relevant state statutes permit liability against a based on proof of direct or indirect control of the primary violator a plaintiff need not always prove material aid.going forward,the district court must apply the law of the appropriate state after conducting a analysis.at this point,however,given our above analysis of the relevant statutes,we can say that,regardless of what state law applies,appellants have put forth sufficient allegations to overcome sunset motion to dismiss.although a more developed record might reveal that sunset has a valid statutory defense,at this early stage of the litigation,appellants have sufficiently alleged that sunset was a control person with respect to behrens.with respect to kcl,however,the relevant complaints are devoid of any allegations sufficient to show control.without further allegations,kcl is simply too far removed from the relevant transactions to have directly or indirectly controlled behrens with respect to the underlying fraud in this case.
common law claims 
in addition to their statutory claims,appellants alleged claims on the basis of apparent authority and respondeat superior.the district court dismissed each of these claims and denied appellants motions for leave to amend.regardless of which state law applies,the elements of these claims are materially the same.for this reason,we address the merits as to both sunset and kcl.
apparent authority 
to state a claim based on apparent authority,a plaintiff must allege facts showing that the alleged principal affirmatively,intentionally,or by lack of ordinary care cause d third persons to act upon the apparent agency.draemel rufenacht,bromagen hertz,see also curran indus.comm of,iowa sellers,iowa.although the fact that an alleged agent actions were fraudulent or even specifically against the direction of the principal does not preclude liability,those actions must be within the scope of the apparent authority conferred by the principal.see,draemel,at.
the operative complaints allege that sunset association with behrens created an aura of authority and trustworthiness,an aura of credibility.this aura of authority,appellants allege,was important in permitting behrens to defraud the plaintiffs.at most,these allegations can be read to mean that sunset made it more likely that appellants would deal with behrens.they can not,however,be r
