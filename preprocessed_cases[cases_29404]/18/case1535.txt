petitioner caressa camille,caressa petitioned for judicial review of an order of the alcoholic beverage control appeals board the board affirming a decision of the department of alcoholic beverage control the department revoking caressa liquor license for a bar it owns known as joey.the department revoked the license following an administrative hearing at which caressa,a corporation,was represented by its president,who stipulated to facts establishing that one of caressa employees sold beer to two decoys under the age of years,and the department had disciplined caressa on two previous occasions for furnishing alcohol to minor decoys.
caressa seeks annulment of the order and decision on two grounds the department lacked jurisdiction to proceed against caressa license because caressa was not represented by counsel during the hearing,and the department abused its discretion by revoking the license.
as a matter of first impression in the state of california,we hold that the general common law rule in this state requiring corporations to be represented by counsel in proceedings before courts of record other than small claims courts does not extend to proceedings before administrative agencies and tribunals.we conclude the board decision to affirm the department revocation of caressa liquor license is not void for lack of jurisdiction,it is supported by substantial evidence,and it does not constitute an abuse of the department legal discretion.accordingly,we affirm the order and decision.
factual and procedural background 
caressa is the owner and operator of joey,a bar located in chula vista.the department issued an general public premises liquor license to caressa in january,authorizing the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages.prior to the incident from which the instant writ proceeding arose,caressa had been disciplined by the department on two previous occasions for permitting minors to enter and remain on the premises and for furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage decoys.the first offense occurred in september and resulted in a suspension of caressa liquor license.the second offense occurred two months later in november and resulted in a suspension of the liquor license.
on january,chuan imbimbo,while working as a caressa employee,sold beer on caressa premises to joshua ortiz and melinda,who were acting as minor decoys for the chula vista police department.
accusation 
in march,the department filed an administrative accusation charging caressa with two counts of violating business and professions code section subdivision a hereafter section a,seeking to revoke caressa liquor license.evelyn jones,caressa president,requested an administrative hearing.the department scheduled the hearing and notified caressa that it had the right to retain counsel or represent itself 
you may be present at the hearing.you have the right to be represented by an attorney at your own expense.you are not entitled to the appointment of an attorney to represent you at public expense.you are entitled to represent yourself without legal counsel italics added.
administrative hearing 
the hearing was held in may before administrative law judge rodolfo echeverria the alj.jones appeared at the hearing on behalf of caressa.
jones and the department stipulated to the facts alleged in counts and of the accusation.jones informed the alj that she wanted to present evidence regarding mitigation of the revocation penalty recommended by the department.
the department decision 
in june,the alj issued his proposed decision,finding that the facts alleged in the accusation were true.he found that the evidence established that the two subject january violations of section a justified revocation of the liquor license under section,subdivision b hereafter section b,because they constituted the third such incident within a month period the following month,the department adopted the alj proposed decision as its decision in the case.
the board order affirming the department decision 
caressa,represented by counsel,appealed the department decision to the board.although caressa,through jones,had stipulated to the truth of the allegation in the accusation that imbimbo was its agent,employee or servant,caressa sought to reverse the department decision on the ground the department had not established that imbimbo was its employee.caressa did not challenge the jurisdiction of either the department or the board on the ground that caressa,a corporation,had appeared through its president at the initial hearing.caressa also did not claim that the department had abused its discretion by imposing the penalty of revocation.
on november,the board issued an order affirming the department decision to revoke caressa liquor license.
petition for writ of review 
on december,caressa filed its timely petition for writ of review under section that is the subject of the instant writ proceeding.this court thereafter issued a writ of review ordering the board to certify and return to this court any materials that were before the board in making its decision in the instant matter,but were not contained in the petition.
standard of review 
article xx,section of the california constitution vests the department with broad discretion to revoke or suspend liquor licenses for good cause if continuing the license would be contrary to public welfare or morals.citation.in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion,the courts will uphold the department decision to suspend a license for violation of the liquor laws.citation.provigo alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal th,d.
the administration of the alcoholic beverage control act,within the scope of the purposes of that act,is initially vested in the department.its decisions,however,are subject to administrative review by the board and a final order of the board is,in turn,subject to judicial review.walsh kirby cal d,walsh.
section added by stats,ch,provides in part that the scope of judicial review shall not extend further than to determine,based on the whole record of the department as certified by the board,whether a the department has proceeded without or in excess of its jurisdiction.b the department has proceeded in the manner required by law.c the decision of the department is supported by the findings.d the findings in the department decision are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.e there is relevant evidence which,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,could not have been produced or which was improperly excluded at the hearing before the department.see also walsh,supra,cal d at.
here,caressa seeks a determination that the department proceeded without or in excess of its jurisdiction by permitting evelyn jones,caressa nonattorney president,to represent caressa at the administrative hearing on the accusation.caressa also seeks review of the propriety of the penalty of revocation imposed by the department and upheld by the board.
discussion 
lay representation of corporations in administrative hearings 
caressa contends the decision by the department,upheld by the board,to revoke its liquor license must be reversed and annulled because caressa was represented by its nonattorney president evelyn jones,rather than by an attorney at the evidentiary administrative hearing before the alj,and the decision is thus void on the ground the department lacked jurisdiction to proceed against caressa.we reject this contention.
background 
the record shows that after jones requested an administrative hearing on caressa behalf,the department served caressa with a notice of hearing on accusation,based on sample language set forth in government code section notifying caressa that it had the right to either retain counsel or represent itself at the hearing without legal counsel 
you may be present at the hearing.you have the right to be represented by an attorney at your expense.you are not entitled to appointment of an attorney to represent you at public expense.you are entitled to represent yourself without legal counsel 
jones appeared at the adjudicatory hearing and stated y es in response to the alj question,are you representing yo
