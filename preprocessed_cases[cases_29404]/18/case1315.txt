a medical marijuana collective,holistic health,and its president,garrison williams,collectively,holistic health appeal from the trial court entry of judgment in favor of the city of dana point the city following the city summary judgment motion on nuisance abatement and illegal business practices causes of action.holistic health contends summary judgment was improper because triable issues of fact existed on a critical disputed issue whether holistic health,incorporated as a nonprofit,actually operated in that manner in compliance with state medical marijuana law embodied in the compassionate use act of the cua health,all further statutory references are to this code unless noted,the medical marijuana program act the mmpa et and attorney general guidelines the guidelines concerning medical marijuana dispensaries.holistic health also challenges as excessive the trial court imposition of civil penalties,and argues the court failed to consider relevant evidence,improperly imposed the fines on williams personally,and committed other legal errors.
as we explain,the record shows it remained a disputed issue of triable fact whether holistic health made a profit from distributing medical marijuana or instead was organized and operated as a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation.accordingly,we need not reach holistic health second contention concerning civil penalties because we conclude disputed issues of material fact prevented the trial court from properly granting summary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the city based its complaint on the general proposition that the possession,sale,cultivation,or transportation of marijuana is a crime original boldface and italics and that the absence of any tenable defense rendered holistic health marijuana activities unlawful.as the litigation proceeded,the city focused its discovery efforts on establishing whether the collective violated state law by selling marijuana for profit,subd.a nothing in this section shall authorize any individual or group to cultivate or distribute marijuana for profit see guidelines at recognizing non profit cooperatives and collectives as lawful mutual benefit member associations for group cultivation and distribution of marijuana as of,original boldface.
in particular,california law requires that all agricultural or consumer cooperative corporations must organize food,subd.b and operate as nonprofit entities food.nevertheless,they may make patronage distributions in amounts corresponding to each member patronage of the corporation through the purchase of its good or services,repay or refund member contributions,and even pay dividends thereon,as a form of interest on capital,without jeopardizing their nonprofit status.food,eight percent dividend permissible on excess of association income over association expenses see generally james roberts iii,understanding agricultural cooperatives cal.lawyer,vol,these dividends are deemed to be in the nature of interest,and therefore do not adversely affect the character of cooperatives organized under the code see also,annual distributions on contributed capital limited to percent david gurnick,consumer cooperatives what they are and how they work lawyer,vol,gurnick.valid nonprofit expenditures expressly include executive compensation an association may provide a fair remuneration for time actually spent in its service food.
the city explained in its summary judgment motion that t he point of discovery was to seek evidence as to whether defendants were operating within the parameters of the cua,the mmpa,and the guidelines as asserted in their oft repeated mantra,or if instead they are nothing more than an illegal,for profit business enterprise engaged in illegally selling marijuana for profit.the city discovery efforts did not go smoothly holistic health apparently sought a discovery stay and the city may have obtained an order to compel williams to appear at his deposition,but these matters are not in the record.
when williams appeared for his deposition,his counsel and the city attorney discussed williams intention to invoke the fifth amendment and trade secret and medical privacy privileges on all questions pertaining to medical marijuana.the city broached the idea of an agreement between the parties that any information williams or holistic health provided will not be shared outside our office except for with respect to our expert witnesses in this case.it will be used only as part of this case.any information that you designate is privileged we will treat as privileged,and make all efforts to keep confidential.
the city attorney added,however i can tell you,just so you know,that one of my expert witnesses in this case will be adam powell of the orange county sheriff department who is in charge of the task force that dealing with the illegal medical marijuana operations in orange county.he will see this.i can tell you that jeff shunk of the orange county district attorney office is aware of this deposition and is likely to ask the court through a subpoena or a search warrant,or whatever else the uses,for a copy of it.i do want to kid you and make you think that this wo end up in the hands of federal authorities because it likely will,as well as s tate authorities.williams and holistic health declined the city confidentiality agreement on these terms,and williams asserted the fifth amendment at his deposition on all questions about marijuana.
for example,as the city recounted in its eventual summary judgment motion,williams asserted his right against to all of the following questions whether holistic health sells marijuana products,the types or strains of marijuana products sold,whether holistic health receives monetary compensation in exchange for marijuana,whether holistic health acquires all of its marijuana from its members,the cash value of the marijuana sold by holistic health,the price it pays for marijuana,the cost to grow the marijuana it sells,how the price is determined for marijuana that it sells,and the efforts if any made to determine that members and suppliers are not profiting when they provide marijuana to holistic health 
when williams invoked the fifth amendment to these and similar questions at his deposition,the attorney for the city responded that he intended to bring a motion to compel and i am going to seek not only monetary sanctions,but i going to seek issue sanctions in this case.it is my intention to seek a motion for summary judgment and permanent injunction to prevent holistic health from operating on the basis that it has failed to provide any evidence that its sales of marijuana are currently in a manner that complies with the compassionate use act,the medical marijuana program act,and the attorney general guidelines.
the city also noticed the deposition of holistic health custodian of records,but the parties stipulated the custodian would invoke the fifth amendment just as williams had.the city did not bring a motion to compel discovery or to impose monetary or issue sanctions based on the privileges williams and the custodian of records asserted.instead,the city sought summary judgment,or in the alternative,summary adjudication.
the city asserted in its motion it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because there was no dispute holistic health distributed marijuana and holistic health fail ed to produce any evidence in support of the only possible affirmative defense,compliance with governing medical marijuana law.specifically,the city staked its claim for summary judgment on its assertion holistic health was nothing more than an illegal,for profit business enterprise engaged in illegally selling marijuana for profit.the city alleged holistic health failed to meet its affirmative burden of demonstrating compliance with the cua,mmpa and guidelines and refus ed to allow the city to conduct discovery into this issue and the city asserted williams testified at his deposition that holistic health operates as a business and that its vendors are making a profit by selling holistic health the marijuana products it purchases from them,an unequivocal admission that holistic health is operating in violation of the express provisions of the cua,mmpa,and the guidelines.original italics and boldface.
the city asserted in a footnote in its summary judgment motion that it was entitled to civil penalties on its fourth cause of action for illegal business practices,citing business and professions code section.the city expressly limited its claim to a maximum of in civil penalties,calculated on a penalty assessment for days.the city asserted holistic health operated illegally for more than days,but stipulate d for purposes of summary judgment to the day figure.
holistic health opposed summary judgment on grounds it neither made a profit,nor was organized to do so.holistic health argued the city misinterpreted williams deposition testimony pertaining to profit earned by wholesale vendors who provided nonmarijuana items for sale at holistic health store,and holistic health also relied both on the undisputed fact it had incorporated as a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation and on a corresponding state tax return williams furnished at his deposition showing negative net income.as we discuss below,holistic health also relied on williams declaration and other exhibits holistic health filed in opposition to the city summary judgment motion.the trial court,however,sustained the city objection under evidence code section to these new exhibits on grounds that defendants may not now provide e vidence of their choosing to show that they are in compliance with state medical marijuana law.
consequently,the trial court granted the city summary judgment motion and subsequently entered judgment in the city favor,permanently enjoining holistic health and williams from selling,serving,storing,keeping,or giving away marijuana within the municipal boundaries of the city.the court also imposed substantial penalties on holistic health and on williams personally for unfair trade practices p ursuant to business and professions code and in drug house civil penalties p ursuant to health and safety code sections a,b,and c.the court required williams and holistic health each to pay these sums separately,and both now appeal.
discussiona.standard of review and burdens of production and proof 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.oldcastle precast,lumbermens mutual casualty th,d oldcastle.
a plaintiff may seek summary judgment or adjudication if he or she contends there is no defense to the entire action or to a particular claim.code civ,subds.a f.a plaintiff seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden to prove each element of his or her causes of action,subd.p aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.once a plaintiff moving for summary judgment meets that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant or to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the defendant or may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p,italics added.
here,the city based its nuisance and unfair business practices claims on proving the illegality of holistic health conduct.cultivation,possession,and sale or distribution of marijuana is generally unlawful indeed,these activities and the use of property for these activities constitute criminal offenses,absent an exception.
as a plaintiff seeking summary judgment,the city bore the burden to present evidence establishing every element necessary to show holistic health conduct was unlawful as a matter of law.code civ,subd.p aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.holistic health burden as a defendant opposing summary judgment was to present evidence creating a triable issue of fact on a single element regarding the unlawfulness of its conduct,or a fact concerning a defense to the city claim its conduct was unlawful.code civ,subd.p.unlike the city,holistic health did not bear the burden to present evidence requiring judgment in its favor as a matter of law.aguilar,at,d.the difference in the burdens the parties shouldered is crucial because the city staked its summary judgment motion to establish holistic health unlawful operation on a key,underlying material fact whether holistic health operated for profit,thereby violating applicable medical marijuana law.
b.we assume a burden to prove compliance with state medical marijuana law as an affirmative defense rested on holistic health 
the city,relying on people mower cal th,d,mower,asserts that once it established as an indisputable fact that holistic health distributed marijuana,the burden shifted to holistic health to prove an affirmative defense that it complied with state medical marijuana law.in mower,the high court determined under t he rule of convenience and necessity that a criminal defendant must shoulder the burden to produce and prove facts supporting a defense under the cua to charges of cultivating and possessing marijuana.id.at,d.it remains,however,the prosecutor ultimate burden to prove the defendant is guilty of unlawful conduct.id.at,d.consequently,the defendant is not required to persuade the trier of fact of his innocence mower,at,d,which would contradict the due process presumption of innocence in criminal matters taylor kentucky,d rather,as to the facts underlying the defense provided by the cua,the criminal defendant is required merely to raise a reasonable doubt.mower,at,d.
the city emphasizes the limited reach of the fifth amendment in civil cases.see,blackburn superior court th,d whereas the fifth amendment privilege may be invoked by a civil litigant,it does not provide for protection against civil penalties alvarez sanchez d.in a civil case a witness or party may be required either to waive the privilege or accept the civil consequences of silence if he or she does exercise it see also keating office of thrift supervision cir,a defendant has no absolute right not to be forced to choose between testifying in a civil matter and asserting his fifth amendment privilege.the city insistence,however,that civil discovery measures require a party disclosure,on pain of sanctions including issue preclusion or other penalties,may suggest there is less reason than in the criminal context to shift the burden of production to a civil defendant haled into court.
on the other hand,the supreme court rationale in mower may support imposing a burden on the defendant to show compliance with applicable medical marijuana law in both the criminal and civil contexts.the supreme court explained that under the rule of convenience and necessity,unless it is unduly harsh or unfair,the burden of proving an exonerating fact may be imposed on a defendant if its existence is peculiarly within his personal knowledge and proof of its nonexistence by the prosecution would be relatively difficult or inconvenient.mower,supra,cal th at,d.the rule often has been invoked when the exonerating fact arises from an exception to a criminal statute.ibid.
in mower,the supreme court concluded it would not be unduly harsh or unfair to allocate to the defendant the burden of proving the facts underlying a compassionate use defense to criminal charges.the court reasoned that the facts relevant to the defense,including that the person qualified as a patient or primary caregiver and cultivated or possessed marijuana for the personal medical purposes of a patient upon a physician recommendation,all lay peculiarly with a defendant personal knowledge,and proof of their nonexistence by the prosecution would be relatively difficult or inconvenient.mower,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court also found the cua constituted an exception to statutes criminalizing the cultivation and possession of marijuana,supporting application of the rule of convenience and necessity.ibid.
we assume without deciding that this rule applies here,and holistic health therefore had the burden to produce evidence supporting an affirmative defense based on compliance with state medical marijuana law.in other words,holistic health burden was to establish the existence of a triable issue of fact concerning its defense.as the party opposing summary judgment,however,it was not holistic health duty to negate the possibility that its activities were unlawful.rather,it needed only to produce prima facie evidence creating a triable issue of fact on this question.see aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.more precisely,its burden consisted of making a prima facie showing on which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude it did not operate for profit.see id.at,d,a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.
c.the existence of a triable issue of fact on whether holistic health operated for profit precluded summary judgment 
as noted,the city staked its summary judgment claim that holistic health actions were unlawful on whether the dispensary operated for profit.but holistic health presented ample evidence in opposition to summary judgment that its business was neither profitable,nor set up to make a profit.for example,the collective provided its california exempt organization annual information return form,used by charities and nonprofits for tax filings with the franchise tax board,which showed a loss for the year.holistic health also included in its opposition its december financial statement confirming negative net income,and a similar december statement showing an even greater loss.other evidence included williams deposition testimony in which he denied he received loans or other compensation from the collective,and testified to the contrary he had lent holistic health of his own money,which had not been repaid.emphasizing,i want it noted how much money we lost last year,he explained his dire financial predicament reflected that holistic health was not profitable my house has been foreclosed on.my boat was repossessed.my motorcycles have been repossessed,and he expressed frustration at the notion that i getting rich when all my stuff is being taken and my credit has been ruined over this whole thing.
holistic health opposition to summary judgment also included evidence it was not organized to make a profit.its articles of incorporation filed with the secretary of state identified it as a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation original boldface,and stated t he specific purpose of this corporation is to facilitate,upon a licensed physician recommendation,herbal or natural remedies for chronically ill patron members who are california residents,which echoed the cua express purpose.see,subd.b a to ensure that seriously ill californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician.
williams explained in his declaration opposing summary judgment that a s a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation,holistic health does not operate for the profit of its shareholders.rather,holistic health operates as a service to its members and it receives compensation for the cost of doing business.see,providing for consumer corporations not organized to make a profit for themselves,but which conduct business primarily for the mutual benefit of its members as patrons of the corporation see also gurnick,supra,lawyer,vol,at member contributions in the form of service can be required,or members may participate by patronizing the cooperative entity.
as one commentator observed long before the question of medical marijuana collectives arose,the fact that a mutual benefit association has income or pays taxes does not establish it is a enterprise.e arnings may result from operations in excess of expenses.in these circumstances the entity realizes net income for the taxable year.cooperative corporations like other corporations are subject to income taxation under the internal revenue code,but that does not mean they are established to yield a profit for themselves.gurnick,at.rather,c ooperatives are normally established to provide services to members.id.at as the persons who do business with the entity,or who take advantage of its services,the cooperative patrons really receive the benefit of the entity.the entity may be able to deduct from taxable income the amount of patronage dividends paid and allocations made to patrons,but the mere excess of income over expenses does not destroy the entity nonprofit character.id.at.in any event,holistic health evidence showed no positive ledger here.
in addition to its tax and financial records,and williams deposition testimony,his declaration,and the articles of incorporation stating its nonprofit purpose,holistic health also provided in opposition to summary judgment its written member terms and conditions,which showed member contributions were aimed at sustaining the collective,not to earn a profit.the conditions for membership included the following i understand my contributions for medicine i may acquire from this collective are used to ensure its continued operation and that this transaction in no way constitutes commercial promotion,and the monies i pay are to help the collective to continue to operate,to maintain employees and a location and to pay the associated costs and expenses of providing its members with medicinal marijuana for their medical needs.taken together,the evidence holistic health presented in opposition to summary judgment constituted a prima facie case on which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude holistic health was neither organized to make a profit,nor in fact made one.this was sufficient to defeat the city motion for summary judgment simply put,whether the city could rebut holistic health prima facie showing presented a triable issue of fact.in sum,the city did nothing to meet its burden to establish a reasonable trier of fact would be required to conclude holistic health operated as a enterprise.
the city succeeded,however,in having the trial court exclude holistic health evidence opposing summary judgment.the city objected to williams declaration and holistic health exhibits opposing summary judgment on grounds that the evidence was more prejudicial than probative under evidence code section.that section provides the court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will a necessitate undue consumption of time or b create substantial danger of undue prejudice,of confusing the issues,or of misleading the jury.
evidence code section,however,has no application here.that section primary purpose is to pare away dross that uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against a party as an individual,while having only slight probative value with regard to the issues.people robinson cal th,d.the trial court therefore may exclude evidence that is unduly prejudicial because of the substantial likelihood the jury will use it for an illegitimate purpose.vorse sarasy th,d.shielding the factfinder from inflammatory material or misleading considerations,however,is not the issue at summary judgment,which consists of spotting material factual disputes,not resolving them.ehp glendale,llc county of los angeles th,d the purpose of summary judgment is not to resolve issues of fact,but rather to determine whether there are issues of fact that must be resolved through a trial.
to illustrate the point none of the considerations enumerated in evidence code section apply here.holistic health evidence opposing summary judgment was tailored precisely to the dispositive issue of profit.accordingly,the time necessary for the court to consider the evidence can in no way be characterized as undue,nor can it be said that evidence on the profit question the city itself framed as dispositive for summary judgment confus ed the issues or risked misleading the jury,as evidence code section requires for exclusi
