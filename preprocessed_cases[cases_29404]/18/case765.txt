baxter international,a manufacturer of medical products,released its financial results for on july of that year.sales and profits did not match analysts expectations.shares swiftly fell from to.this litigation followed plaintiffs contend that the price was the result of materially misleading projections on november,projections that baxter reiterated until the bad news came out on july.plaintiffs want to represent a class of all investors who purchased during that time either in the open market or by exchanging their shares of fusion medical technologies.baxter acquired fusion in a transaction plaintiffs think that baxter juiced up the market price so that it could secure fusion in exchange for fewer of its own shares.bypassing the question whether the suit could proceed as a class action,but see.c a,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.wl,dist.lexis.july.the court did not doubt that the allegations ordinarily would defeat a motion under.b.still,it held,baxter forecasts come within the safe harbor created by the private securities litigation reform act of,c,c.the pslra creates rules that judges must enforce at the outset of the litigation plaintiffs do not question the statute application before discovery but do dispute the district court substantive decision.
baxter projection,repeated many times sometimes in documents filed with the sec,sometimes in press releases,sometimes in executives oral statements,was that during the business would yield revenue growth in the low teens compared with the prior year,growth in the mid teens,and operational cash flow of at least million.baxter often referred to these forecasts as our commitments,which is a strange locution.no firm can make commitments about the ca compel its customers to buy more of its it plans to engage in accounting shenanigans to make the numbers come out right no matter what happens to the business.but nothing turns on the word the district court took these commitments as statements,see a,a,and plaintiffs do not quarrel with that understanding.what they do say is that the projections were too rosy,and that baxter knew it.that charges the defendants with stupidity as much as with knavery,for the truth was bound to come out quickly,but the securities laws forbid foolish frauds along with clever ones.
according to the complaint,baxter projections were materially false because its renal division had not met its internal budgets in years economic instability in latin america adversely affected baxter sales in that part of the world baxter closed plants in ronneby,sweden,and miami lakes,florida,that had been its principal source of dialysis products the market for albumin products was,resulting in lower prices and revenue for the biosciences division sales of that division igiv immunoglobin products had fallen short of internal predictions and in march the bioscience division had experienced a sterility failure in the manufacture of a major product,resulting in the destruction of multiple lots and a loss exceeding million.the district court assumed,as shall we,that failure to disclose these facts would create problems but for the statutory safe items and at least are general business matters rather than baxter secrets,and the securities laws do not require issuers to disclose the state of the world,as opposed to facts about the firm.see wielgos commonwealth edison,cir.item also was public knowledge baxter issued a press release announcing the closings and a substantial charge against earnings though the cost of products that had been made at these plants may have been secret.whether all add up to a material whether baxter had some information about those matters that seem to be general topics we need not tackle.
section,which deals with statements covered by the securities act of here,those in the registration statement and prospectus for the stock that baxter exchanged for fusion shares and,which deals with statements covered by the securities exchange act of here,the statements in baxter press releases,press conferences,and periodic filings are identical in all significant respects,so from now on we mention only the former statute.the statutory safe harbor forecloses liability if a statement is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement c a i.the fundamental problem is that the statutory requirement of meaningful cautionary statements is not itself meaningful.what must the firm say unless it is possible to give a concrete and reliable answer,the harbor is not safe yet a word such as meaningful resists a concrete rendition and thus makes administration of the safe harbor difficult if not impossible.it rules out a caution such as this is a statement caveat emptor.but it does not rule in any particular caution,which always may be challenged as not sufficiently meaningful or not pinning down the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially for if it had identified all of those factors,it would not be possible to describe the statement itself as materially misleading.a safe harbor matters only when the firm disclosures including the accompanying cautionary statements are false or misleadingly incomplete yet whenever that condition is satisfied,one can complain that the cautionary statement must have been inadequate.the safe harbor loses its function.yet it would be unsound to read the statute so that the safe harbor never works then one might as well treat and as defunct.
baxter provided a number of cautionary statements throughout the class period.this one,from its form document to which many of the firm press releases and other statements the best illustration 
statements throughout this report that are not historical facts are statements.these statements are based on the company current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties.some of these risks and uncertainties are factors that affect all international businesses,while some are specific to the company and the health care arenas in which it operates.
many factors could affect the company actual results,causing results to differ materially,from those expressed in any such statements.these factors include,but are not limited to,interest rates technological advances in the medical field economic conditions demand and market acceptance risks for new and existing products,technologies and health care services the impact of competitive products and pricing manufacturing capacity new plant global regulatory,trade and tax policies regulatory,legal or other developments relating to the company series a,af,and ax dialyzers continued price competition product development risks,including technological difficulties ability to enforce patents actions of regulatory bodies and other government authorities reimbursement policies of government agencies commercialization factors results of product testing and other factors described elsewhere in this report or in the company other filings with the securities and exchange commission.additionally,as discussed in item legal proceedings,upon the resolution of certain legal matters,the company may incur charges in excess of presently established reserves.any such change could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded.
currency fluctuations are also a significant variable for global companies,especially fluctuations in local currencies where hedging opportunities are unreasonably expensive or unavailable.if the united states dollar strengthens significantly against mist foreign currencies,the company ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings outside the united states could be negatively impacted.
the company believes that its expectations with respect to statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business operations,but there can be no assurance that the actual results or performance of the company will conform to any future results or performance expressed or implied by such statements.
the district court concluded that these are meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement.they deal with baxter business specifically,mentioning risks and product lines.plaintiffs offer two responses.first they contend that the cautionary statements did not cover any of the six matters that in plaintiffs view baxter had withheld.that ca be dispositive otherwise the statute would demand prescience.as long as the firm reveals the principal risks,the fact that some other event caused problems can not be dispositive.indeed,an unexpected turn of events can not demonstrate a securities problem at all,as there can not be fraud by hindsight.denny barber,cir friendly.see also murray abt associates,cir dileo ernst young,cir.the other response is that the cautionary statement did not follow the firm fortunes plants closed but the cautionary statement remained the same sterilization failures occurred but the cautionary statement remained the same and bad news that plaintiffs contend baxter well knew in november did not cast even a shadow in the cautionary statement.
before considering whether plaintiffs objections defeat the safe harbor,we ask whether the cautionary statements have any bearing on baxter potential liability for statements in its press releases,and those its managers made orally.the press releases referred to,but did not repeat verbatim,the cautionary statements in the form and other documents filed with the securities and exchange commission.the oral statements did not do even that much.plaintiffs say that this is fatal,because c a i provides a safe harbor only if a written statement is accompanied by the meaningful caution a statement published elsewhere differs from one that accompanies the press release.as for the oral statements c a ii,a special rule for oral statements,provides a safe harbor only if the statement includes that the actual results could differ materially from those projected in the statement and in addition 
i the oral statement is accompanied by an oral statement that additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement is contained in a readily available written document,or portion thereof 
ii the accompanying oral statement referred to in clause i identifies the document,or portion thereof,that contains the additional information about those factors relating to the statement and 
iii the information contained in that written document is a cautionary statement that satisfies the standard established in paragraph a.
c b.when speaking with analysts baxter executives did not provide them with all of this information,such as directions to look in the report for the full cautionary statement.it follows,plaintiffs maintain,that this suit must proceed with respect to the press releases and oral statements even if the cautionary language filed with the sec in registration statements and other documents meets the statutory standard.
if this were a traditional securities,in other words,an investor claimed to have read or heard the statement and,not having access to the truth,relied to his detriment on the plaintiffs argument would be correct.but this is not a traditional securities claim.it is a claim.none of the plaintiffs asserts that he read any of baxter press releases or listened to an executive oral statement.instead the theory is that other people professional traders,mutual fund managers,securities analysts did the reading,and that they made trades or recommendations that influenced the price.in an efficient capital market,all information known to the public affects the price and thus affects every investor.basic levinson,d,holds that reliance on the accuracy of the price can substitute for reliance on the accuracy of particular written or oral statements,when the statements affect the they do for large and firms such as baxter,for which there is a liquid public market.this works only to the extent that markets efficiently reflect and thus convey to investors the economic equivalent of all public information.see daniel fischel,efficient capital markets,the crash,and the fraud on the market theory,cornell,jonathan macey geoffrey miller,good finance,bad economics an analysis of the theory,stan.
when markets are informationally efficient,it is impossible to segment information as plaintiffs propose.they ask us to say that they received through the price the false oral statements but not the cautionary disclosures.that ca be only if the market is inefficient is partial transmission likely,and if the market for baxter stock is inefficient then this suit collapses because a claim wo fly.an investor who invokes the theory must acknowledge that all public information is reflected in the price,just as the supreme court said in basic.see at.see flamm eberstadt,cir in re apple computer securities litigation,cir grossman novell,cir.thus if the truth or the nature of a business risk is widely known,an incorrect statement can have no deleterious effect,and if a cautionary statement has been widely disseminated,that news too affects the price just as if that statement had been handed to each investor.if the executives oral statements came to plaintiffs through professional traders or analysts and hence the price,then the cautions reached plaintiffs via the same route market professionals are savvy enough to discount projections appropriately.then c b has been satisfied for the oral statements and so too c a i for the press releases.and if the cautions did not affect the price,then the market must be inefficient and the suit fails for that reason.so we take the claim as the pleadings framed it the market for baxter stock is efficient,which means that baxter cautionary language must be treated as if attached to every one of its oral and written statements.that leaves the question whether these statements satisfy the statutory requirement that they adequately identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement.
the parties agree on two propositions,each with support in decisions of other circuits.first,boilerplate warnings wo do cautions must be tailored to the risks that accompany the particular projections.second,the cautions need not identify what actually goes wrong and causes the projections to be inaccurate prevision is not required.see halperin ebanker,cir helwig vencor,cir en banc ehlert singer,cir discussing a judicially developed defense,the doctrine,that applies to statements such as those made in tender offers to which the statutory safe harbor does not apply semerenko cendant,cir same harris ivax,cir same.unfortunately,these principles do decide any concrete that matter,the statutory language itself does not decide any concrete case.it is the result of a compromise between legislators who did not want any safe harbor or,indeed any new legislation,and those who wanted a safe harbor along the lines of the old rule discussed in our wielgos decision that did not require any cautionary statements but just required the projection to have a reasonable basis.rule was limited to statements in certain documents filed with the sec proponents of the pslra wanted to extend this to all statements,including oral declarations and press releases.as is often the situation,a compromise enabled the bill to pass but lacks much content it does not encode a principle on which political forces agreed as much as it signifies conflict about both the scope and the wisdom of the safe harbor.compromises of this kind lack spirit.still,the language was enacted,and we must make something of it.
plaintiffs say that baxter cautions were boilerplate,but they are.statements along the lines of all businesses are risky or the future lies ahead come to nothing other than caveat emptor which is enough these statements,by contrast,at least included information and highlighted some parts of the business that might cause problems.for its part,baxter says that mentioning these business
