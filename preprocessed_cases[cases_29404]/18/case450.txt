opinion of the court 
this is a dispute between two brothers over ownership and control of a pharmaceutical company.the complaint alleges,inter alia,breach of trust,breach of fiduciary duty to the corporation,and violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.we will reverse and remand.
are trustees of a trust established for the benefit of david berwind,who himself is one of the trustees.the david berwind trust was established in by david father,charles berwind.at the same time,trusts were created for each of david three siblings.the principal asset of each trust was stock in the berwind corporation,a successful diversified corporation controlled by charles berwind.each of the trusts was assigned three trustees the beneficiary,an attorney,and graham berwind,one of the four children.in addition to being trustee of each trust,graham berwind was most directly involved in the operation of the family business.his trust received a somewhat larger share of the berwind corporation stock shares to for each of his siblings trusts.
following the death of charles berwind in,graham berwind began to consolidate ownership of the berwind corporation by arranging for the company to purchase all of the shares held by the two other siblings trusts.a few years later,the david berwind trust sold half of its shares to the corporation.because graham berwind was a trustee of each trust,he obtained approval for the transactions from the orphans court of montgomery county,pennsylvania.
in,berwind corporation acquired colorcon,a producer of pharmaceutical coatings.colorcon was absorbed into the newly created berwind pharmaceutical services,bpsi.berwind group partners,a trust partnership established for the benefit of graham berwind and his family,held of the shares in bpsi.the david berwind trust received the remaining.in,the david berwind trust sold its remaining shares in berwind corporation to berwind group partners.but the david berwind trust still owned of bpsi,its last holding in any of the berwind companies.these shares are at the center of the current dispute.
in,graham berwind made the first of several attempts to buy his brother trust stock in bpsi,offering million.four years later,he offered million.on both occasions,david berwind refused because graham berwind had allegedly provided insufficient financial information to assess the value of the stock.shortly thereafter,graham berwind took actions to resign as trustee of the david berwind trust.according to the complaint,however,he did not comply with all of the requirements for resigning.consequently,plaintiffs allege graham berwind remained a trustee,and continues in this capacity.
in august,according to plaintiffs,graham berwind attempt to obtain full control of bpsi intensified.berwind corporation president,edward kosnik,sent david berwind a letter threatening that in the event david berwind continued to reject his brother offers,we are prepared to start a process that will result in our ownership of of bpsi at a price to be determined by us and our financial advisor.this will be a costly,and legalistic process that we would prefer to avoid,but one that we are prepared to undertake,if necessary.
in response,david berwind retained attorneys and advisors to negotiate the sale of his shares of bpsi.but their attempts to obtain the information necessary to proceed with the sale were allegedly rebuffed.plaintiffs brought this suit on november.defendants were served with the complaint on december.
six days later,bpsi board of directors approved a merger.the result of this maneuver was that bpsi emerged as a corporation wholly owned by berwind group partners.having lost its status as shareholder,the david berwind trust was offered a note worth.the trust also obtained the right to seek judicial appraisal of the fair value of its shares,should it view the note as inadequate.an appraisal hearing was initiated in philadelphia common pleas court and is proceeding during the pendency of this appeal.
plaintiffs allege that,prior to the bpsi merger,graham berwind engaged in several transactions that caused the unlawful transfer of value from bpsi to berwind group partners and other berwind entities.the result was to deplete the value of the david berwind trust holdings while increasing benefits to graham berwind.
five of the thirteen counts in the amended complaint are brought on behalf of bpsi.the other eight are brought on behalf of the david berwind trust.plaintiffs primarily allege that graham berwind breached his duty of loyalty to the david berwind trust that defendants violated rico with schemes to defraud the trust that the bpsi directors breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty to the corporation and that the directors diverted corporate opportunities.
on april,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.in doing so,the court only provided the following explanation 
the court approves and adopts defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff sic amended complaint docket,defendants reply memorandum in support of motion to dismiss docket,and defendant sic supplemental reply memorandum in support of defendants motion to dismiss docket which collectively set forth the legal authority which is dispositive of plaintiffs cause of action.
warden mclelland,at.
plaintiffs appealed.we vacated the district court judgment and remanded to the district court for it to provide this court with an opinion setting forth the legal reasoning as to its decision to grant the motion to dismiss.warden mclelland,at cir,judgment.we did so because we could not perform our appellate review responsibly without the district court first performing its function in its entirety.warden mclelland,at cir,slip op.
on remand,the district court issued an opinion that was a minimally modified version of one of defendants legal memoranda the district court had previously listed as setting forth the legal authority for its prior order.rather than seeking further clarification,we turn to the merits of the appeal 
because this is an appeal from a dismissal under rule b,we accept the factual allegations in the complaint.we may affirm only if it is certain no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proven.rossman fleet bank,cir.this standard is especially important here because the district court adopted defendants version of the facts.
breach of trust.
plaintiffs allege graham berwind and his associate bruce mckenney,who was also named as a trustee of the david berwind trust,breached their duties to the trust owed by virtue of their positions as trustees.
defendants contend these claims fail for two reasons.first,they maintain they were not trustees at the relevant times,as they had resigned.as noted,plaintiffs allege these defendants had not effectively resigned as trustees.at this stage,we must accept the complaint allegations as true,so this proposed basis for dismissal fails.second,defendants point to a provision of the deed of trust that provides 
the fact that any trustee may be interested in berwind corporation or any of its subsidiaries as director,stockholder,manager,agent or employee shall not constitute an adverse or conflicting interest,and the acts of such trustee shall be judged as if he had no interest in the corporation.
this provision,however,can not fairly be read to permit trustees to engage in or otherwise to act fraudulently or in bad faith with respect to a beneficiary of the trust.we need not determine the precise extent of the protections afforded by this provision to conclude that it is consistent with plaintiffs allegations that the trustees acted outside the provision and may have breached a duty owed to the trust and its beneficiaries.therefore,we will reverse with respect to plaintiffs breach of trust claims and leave the precise effect of the exculpatory provision for the district court to consider on remand.
derivative claims.
five of plaintiffs thirteen counts are brought derivatively on behalf of bpsi.two are rico claims the other three arise under pennsylvania corporate law and include diversion of corporate opportunity and breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty to the corporation.defendants contend plaintiffs have not complied with the procedural requirements for bringing lawsuits.
under pennsylvania law a shareholder can not ordinarily bring an action on behalf of the corporation without first making demand on the board of directors to pursue the action.cuker mikalauskas.in cuker,the pennsylvania supreme court expressly adopted several sections of the american law institute principles of corporate governance,including the section setting forth the demand requirement.section b provides,demand on the board should be excused only if the plaintiff makes a specific showing that irreparable injury to the corporation would otherwise result,and in such instances demand should be made promptly after commencement of the action.id.at.prior to cuker,s ufficient averments of fraud excused a demand based upon its futility.drain covenant life ins.but cuker,which established that a demand is excused only if irreparable harm to the corporation is shown,changed the law on demand requirements in derivative actions.id.
it is undisputed that plaintiffs did not make demand on the board of directors of bpsi either before filing suit or thereafter.but they contend they should be excused from the demand requirement because of the they allegedly faced.
to have standing to bring a derivative action,one must be a shareholder,both at the time of the alleged wrongdoing and continuing to judgment.cuker,at adopting of the ali principles.this requirement may be excused,however,where the failure to do so is the result of corporate action in which the holder did not acquiesce,and the derivative action was commenced prior to the corporate action terminating the holder status id.
plaintiffs brought suit on november.making a prior demand,they contend,would have foreclosed their opportunity to bring this action.defendants would have responded,plaintiffs maintain,by immediately squeezing out the david berwind trust,depriving it of standing to bring derivative claims.as noted,bpsi board of directors effected the merger only one week after being served with the complaint.
although plaintiffs may have properly pled futility in making a prior demand,pennsylvania law no longer recognizes a futility exception.but pennsylvania law permits a plaintiff to bring derivative claims if irreparable harm to the corporation would result.plaintiffs contend they fall within this exception.
in their complaint,plaintiffs allege,demand on the board of directors of bpsi to bring the derivative claims asserted herein is excused because the david berwind trust and bpsi would suffer irreparable injury if demand were required to be made upon the board of directors.although the complaint lacks specificity,we think it sufficiently supports an inference of irreparable harm to the corporation.any harm to the corporation suffered as a result of the merger would be effectively irreparable for these purposes.because only those responsible for the corporation alleged losses remained as shareholders following the elimination of the david berwind trust as shareholder,the squeeze out would have effectively defeated the action,depriving the corporation of any possibility of recovering the losses.the immediate elimination of the david berwind trust interest in bpsi,in other words,may have irreparably damaged bpsi just as it would have irreparably harmed the trust.for purposes of a rule b motion,these allegations are sufficient.
even where demand is excused for threat of irreparable harm to the corporation,the ali principles state demand should be made promptly after commencement of the action.b adopted by cuker,at.as noted,bpsi board of directors squeezed out the david berwind trust within weeks of filing the lawsuit.no longer a shareholder,the david berwind trust was no longer in a position to make demand on the no fault of its own.although there appeared to have been a brief window of time in which plaintiffs could have made a demand which would have been the preferable course,their failure to do so,demand having been made impossible by action of the board,is not fatal to their derivative claims.
plaintiffs also contend they should not have been required to make demand by virtue of an exception contained in section d of the ali principles.section was not among those adopted by the pennsylvania supreme court in cuker.in that case,however,the supreme court invited pennsylvania courts to adopt other provisions of the ali principles 
our adoption of these sections is not a rejection of other sections not cited.we have identified and studied the sections which apply to this case and have adopted those which appear most relevant.
the entire publication,all seven parts,is a comprehensive,cohesive work more than a decade in preparation.additional sections of the publication,particularly procedural ones due to their interlocking character,may be adopted in the future.issues in future cases or,perhaps,further proceedings in this case might implicate additional sections of the ali principles.courts of the commonwealth are free to consider other parts of the work and utilize them if they are helpful and appear to be consistent with pennsylvania law.
plaintiffs contend the pennsylvania supreme court would adopt section because it interlocks with the adopted sections,it is helpful,and it is consistent with pennsylvania law.section d provides 
in the case of a closely held corporation,the court in its discretion may treat an action raising derivative claims as a direct action,exempt it from those restrictions and defenses applicable only to derivative actions,and order an individual recovery,if it finds that to do so will not i unfairly expose the corporation or the defendants to a multiplicity of actions,ii materially prejudice the interests of creditors of the corporation,or iii interfere with a fair distribution of the recovery among all interested persons.
bpsi is a closely held corporation were pennsylvania to adopt section d,the district court here would have discretion to treat this case as an individual action,exempt from the procedural requirements for derivative actions.because the david berwind trust was the only minority shareholder,there is no apparent reason that doing so would invite multiple actions,materially prejudice the interests of creditors or the corporation,or interfere with a just recovery.therefore,this case would seem to be a good candidate for such treatment,were section d to apply.
there are only three pennsylvania cases addressing section d,each from trial courts.all have adopted the provision liss liss,wl,baron pritzker,excusing demand by treating corporate waste claim as individual one levin schiffman,adopting section d and exercis ing its discretion and treat ing all of plaintiff derivative claims as direct claims for which demand is not required.accord audio visual xperts,walker,wl,at,predicting pennsylvania supreme court would adopt section d.
there are good reasons to believe the pennsylvania supreme court would concur and adopt section d.as noted,it invited lower courts to adopt other sections,especially those,like section d,that interlock ed with the sections adopted in cuker,all of which govern the prosecution of derivative claims.section addresses the classification of a case as a derivative or individual action.the adoption of section made the demand requirement substantially stricter by narrowing the available exceptions.but the ali adopted that provision in light of section,which allows certain cases to avoid that requirement.thus,the close corporation exception closely interlocks with section.consequently,the pennsylvania supreme court invitation to adopt other sections seems particularly appropriate here.
defendants argue d contravenes pennsylvania law.in particular,they cite section of the pennsylvania business corporations law,entitled limitation on standing.it provides,in part 
the duty of the board of directors,committees of the board and individual directors under section relating to standard of care and justifiable reliance is so
