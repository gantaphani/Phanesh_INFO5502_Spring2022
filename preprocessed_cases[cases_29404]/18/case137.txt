appellant southex exhibitions,southex challenges a district court bench ruling that no partnership existed between southex and the rhode island builder association,riba,even though southex predecessors in interest had produced home shows for riba in rhode island ever since.we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
in,with the construction of the new providence civic center civic center and the expansion in riba home shows,riba executive director,ross dagata,decided to enter into an agreement with sherman exposition management,sem,a professional show owner and producer,for future productions of the riba home shows at the civic center the agreement.the preamble in the agreement announced that riba wishes to participate in such s hows as sponsors and partners emphasis added.the term of the agreement was fixed at five years,renewable by mutual agreement.
riba further agreed i to sponsor and endorse only shows produced by sem,ii to persuade riba members to exhibit at those shows,and iii to permit sem to use riba name for promotional purposes.in turn,sem undertook,inter alia,to i obtain all necessary leases,licenses,permits and insurance,ii indemnify riba for losses of whatever sort,iii accord riba the right to accept or reject any exhibitor,iv audit show income,and v advance all the capital required to finance the shows.net show profits were to be shared to sem to riba.
the agreement further provided that all show dates and admission prices,as well as the rhode island banking institution at which business would be transacted,were to be mutually determined by the parties.in the event the civic center were to become unavailable for reasons beyond sem control,sem was to be excused from its production duties,provided that sem promoted no other home show in rhode island during the interim and riba retained the right to conduct a home show at another venue,upon appropriate notification to sem.
in contemporaneous conversations relating to the meaning of the term partners,manual sherman,sem president,informed riba ross dagata that he wanted no ownership of the show,because he was uncertain about the financial prospects for home shows in the rhode island market.manual sherman advised dagata a fter the first year,if i not happy,we ca produce the show properly or make any money,we give you back the show.although sem owned other home shows which it produced outside rhode island,manual sherman consistently described himself simply as the producer of the riba shows.
in,following a series of assignments and contract renewals agreed to by riba,southex acquired sem interest under the agreement by,southex determined that in order to maintain its financial stake in the riba home shows,the agreement either needed to be renegotiated or allowed to expire according to its terms in.riba in turn expressed dissatisfaction with southex performance,and eventually entered into a management contract with another producer,yoffee exposition services.
southex commenced suit against riba in federal district court,to enjoin the riba home show,alleging that the agreement established a partnership between riba and southex,sem,that by its silence riba had enabled the formation of a,and that riba breached its fiduciary duties to its,southex,by its wrongful dissolution of their partnership and its subsequent appointment of another producer.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the preliminary injunction requested by southex,finding no likelihood of ultimate success on the merits.we affirmed in an unpublished opinion.see southex exhibitions,builders ass n,slip op.at,wl cir,per curiam.
at the bench trial following our remand,the district court entertained further evidence,then entered judgment for riba on the ground that the agreement established no partnership under rhode island law,and that southex had adduced insufficient evidence to support its claim.in due course,southex brought the instant appeal.
discussion 
under rhode island law,a partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as a business for profit laws.emphasis added.the same statute further provides,inter alia,that 
i n determining whether a partnership exists,these rules apply 
joint tenancy,tenancy in common,tenancy by the entireties,joint property,common property,or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership,whether the do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property.
the receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he or she is a partner in the business,but no such inference is drawn if profits were received in payment 
i as a debt by installments or otherwise 
ii as wages of an employee or rent to a landlord 
iii as an annuity to a widow or representative of a deceased partner 
iv as interest on a loan,though the amount of payment vary with the profits of the business 
v as the consideration for the sale of a good will of a business or other property by installments or otherwise.
while pure legal issues,such as statutory interpretations,are reviewed de novo,see narragansett indian tribe,cir,the determination as to whether a partnership was formed turned primarily on factual findings which we review only for clear error a finding of fact constitutes clear error only if,after reviewing the entire trial record,we are firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.see tokyo marine fire ins.perez cia,de puerto rico,cir emphasis added.as the party asserting that a partnership was formed,the ultimate burden of persuasion rested upon southex 
southex insists that the agreement contains ample indicia that a partnership was formed,including a sharing of profits mutual control over designated business operations,such as show dates,admission prices,choice of exhibitors,and partnership bank accounts and the respective contributions of valuable property to the partnership by the partners.given the highly deferential standard of appellate review,however,southex must do more than point to supportive record evidence.since it bears the burden of proof,it must demonstrate that the district court ruling,viewed in the light most favorable to riba,is not rationally supported by the record evidence.see damon sun,cir.in our view,the record evidence indicating a nonpartner relationship can not be dismissed as insubstantial.
first,the agreement is simply entitled agreement,rather than partnership agreement.second,rather than an agreement for an indefinite duration,it prescribed a fixed albeit renewable term.third,rather than undertake to share operating costs with riba,sem not only agreed to advance all monies required to produce the shows,but to indemnify riba for all losses as well.state law normally presumes that partners share equally or at least proportionately in partnership losses.see laws a.although partners may agree to override such statutory default provisions,there is no evidence that sem and riba meant to do so notwithstanding an intent to form a partnership.see alan bromberg larry ribstein,bromberg and ribstein on property d identifying loss sharing as very important partnership attribute.
similarly,although riba involved itself in some management decisions,sem was responsible for the lion share.laws noting default rule that partners normally share equal rights in management.furthermore,southex not only entered into contracts but conducted business with third parties,in its own name,rather than in the name of the putative partnership.as a matter of fact,their mutual association was never given a name.it is noteworthy as well that southex stipulated at trial that it never filed either a federal or state partnership tax return.see cochran bd.of supervisors of del norte county,d.failure to file partnership tax return probative of nonpartner relationship wilder hobson,filing a partnership tax return is significant evidence of a partnership.widdoss donahue.
similarly,the evidence as to whether either sem or riba contributed any corporate property,with the intent that it become partnership property is highly speculative,particularly since their mutual endeavor simply involved a periodic event,an annual home show,which neither generated,nor necessitated,ownership interests in significant tangible properties,aside from cash receipts.unlike tangible real and personal property,whose ownership is more readily established,by documentary evidence and public records,see,harrell oil of airy case,finding overwhelming evidence of ownership in building,the property,the inventory,and the equipment,the intangible intellectual property involved here,such as clientele lists,goodwill,and business expertise,did not so readily lend itself to evidentiary establishment.as a consequence,in the present circumstances the requisite mutual intent to convert intangible intellectual properties into partnership assets may well depend much more importantly upon a clear contractual expression of mutual intention to form a partnership.
finally,even assuming that the agreement,as a whole,is ambiguous,i manuel sherman testified that he regarded sem as simply the producer of the annual riba shows and ii dagata testified that sem specifically disclaimed any ownership interest in the home shows in.see boeckmann mitchell,where testimony relates to partnership formation,appellate court must defer to trial court as primary arbiter of witness credibility.
next,southex asserts that the district court committed reversible error by not crediting undisputed evidence that riba,in,expressly agreed to share business profits with sem.southex reasons that since the rhode island partnership statute makes such profit sharing prima facie evidence of partnership formation,and riba failed to rebut that evidentiary presumption by establishing any of the five exceptions specified in subsection,the district court was required to find,as a matter of law,that a partnership was formed.its reasoning is flawed.
partnership is a notoriously imprecise term,whose definition is especially elusive in practice.see boeckmann,at t he term partnership is not easily elucidated and t he business association that is known in the law as partnership is not one that can be defined with precision.to the contrary,a partnership is a contractual relationship that may vary,in form and substance,in an almost infinite variety of ways.citation omitted.since a partnership can be created absent any written formalities whatsoever,its existence vel non normally must be assessed under a test 
furthermore,the courts frequently consider indicia of partnership formation not prescribed in the upa,such as the extent to which the putative partners respectively exercised control over the entity business operations,see,mcaleer smith,aff,cir,or whether the entity filed partnership tax returns,see,wilder,at.yet,though these considerations constitute necessary guidepoints of inquiry,none is conclusive.beckman farmer,see holmes lerner,th,d t he presence or absence of any of the various elements set forth in the upa is not necessarily dispositive.
similarly,even though the upa explicitly identifies profit sharing as a particularly probative indicium of partnership formation,and some courts have even held that the absence of profit sharing compels a finding that no partnership existed,see,harrell oil,at c and sharing of any actual profits are indispensable requisites for a partnership.citation omitted,it does not necessarily follow that evidence of profit sharing compels a finding of partnership formation.see,boeckmann,at s haring of profits alone does not make one a partner.holmes,th at,d p rofit sharing is evidence of a partnership,rather than a required element of the definition of a partnership,and the upa simply establishes an evidentiary presumption.wilder,at s haring profits does not of itself establish a partnership.
furthermore,even though the upa specifies five instances in which profit sharing does not create a presumption of partnership formation,see laws i v,supra,southex cites and we have found no authority for the proposition that the evidentiary presumption created by profit sharing can be overcome only by establishing these five exceptions,rather than by competent evidence of other pertinent factors indicating the absence of an intent to form a partnership,lack of mutual control over business operations,failure to file partnership tax returns,failure to prescribe.thus,the undisputed evidence of profit sharing did not compel a determination that southex and riba formed a partnership.instead,the validity of the ruling below depends upon whether the district court correctly assessed the totality of the circumstances.see supra note.
southex next urges that the agreement necessitated a finding of partnership formation,in that it unambiguously describes the contracting parties as partners.consequently,southex insists,the district court erred by considering extrinsic evidence regarding the meaning of the term partners,by crediting testimony that riba and southex predecessor did not intend,in,to employ the term partners in its strict legal sense,but merely in its colloquial sense,as a cooperative joint effort.further,southex asserts that because riba concededly reviewed the agreement with counsel,we must presume that the term partners was employed in its strict legal sense.once again we must disagree.
first,the term partner frequently is defined with a view to its context.see commonwealth campbell,t he word partner has also been known to describe other kinds of relationships,as diverse as husband and wife or two people who dance together.yet,the present record contains no conclusive evidence as to whether the agreement was drafted by a layman or by an attorney.
more importantly,the labels the parties assign to their intended legal relationship,while probative of partnership formation,are not necessarily dispositive as a matter of law,particularly in the presence of countervailing,the provision in the agreement indemnifying riba for all would tend to refute the partnership characterization.see beckman,at a lthough the manner in which the parties themselves characterize the relationship is probative,the question ultimately is objective intent.grimmett higginbotham,there is significant authority that representations by the parties in documents or to third parties that a partnership relationship exists constitutes a legal conclusion and is not determinative of the relationship.
although the courts should refrain from resorting to extrinsic evidence where a contract is utterly unambiguous,see fashion house,k mart,cir,the lone reference to partners in the agreement prefatory clause is so inconclusive as to carry minimal interpretive weight,especially since it arguably conflicted with other contract provisions had the parties intended otherwise,it would seem entirely reasonable to expect the agreement to have been entitled partnership agreement,rather than simply agreement.
southex next contends that the district court erred by relying upon dagata testimony,that he may have intended to form a partnership in the production of the home shows,but not in relation to the parties joint use and ownership of the physical property involved in conducting the business.as southex sees it,this finding constituted legal error because i the law recognizes no such or partnership and ii the undisputed evidence demonstrates that each contracting party contributed property,clientele,goodwill or expertise to the partnership.these contentions are immaterial.
first,it is unnecessary to determine whether rhode island law would recognize a or partnership,because it is clear that the absence of any ownership is an entirely legitimate criterion for determining that no cognizable partnership was ever formed.see mcaleer.at harrell oil,at c is an indispensable requisite for a partnership.citation omitted.consequently,the reference to a or partnership is immaterial,since dagata is not competent to opine on rhode island partnership law.instead,the question is whether the district court the absence of any of property weighed against a finding of partnership clear error.it did not.
southex further contends that the district court finding that dagata,a layman with no legal training,drafted the agreement,constituted reversible error because i there is no evidence as to the identi
