defendants electronic payments technologies,llc ept,michael murphy and ty bishop appeal a default judgment of entered in favor of plaintiffs electronic funds solutions,llc efs and michael barry following the trial court order striking defendants answer as a discovery sanction.defendants contend the court should have limited compensatory damages to,the amount requested in plaintiffs complaint the complaint failed to state causes of action supporting the damages awarded no substantial evidence supported the damages awarded plaintiffs were not entitled to either treble or punitive damages the legal theories and facts asserted in the default materially differed from those alleged in the complaint and therefore opened the default and the sanction striking defendants answer violated their due process rights.
we conclude the trial court did not err by issuing a terminating sanction,but we reverse the judgment because the trial court awarded damages based on ept value,instead of efs lost profits.we also conclude that plaintiffs complaint for damages in an amount in excess of,failed to provide defendants notice of their maximum potential liability.consequently,on remand the compensatory damages award may not exceed.alternatively,plaintiffs may elect to amend their complaint to specify greater compensatory damages,which will open defendants default.because we vacate the compensatory damage award,we must also vacate the punitive damage award.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the complaint 
according to plaintiffs complaint,around march,barry,murphy,and bishop orally agreed to form efs,a company designed to assist merchants in electronically recovering funds from customers bank accounts when their checks are dishonored.the parties agreed barry would be the company chief executive officer and president.murphy and bishop were named with responsibility for running efs orange county office and maintaining the company books and records.although efs officers,murphy and bishop had no management authority and could not make substantive decisions on behalf of efs without barry knowledge and approval.
the business had no ready clients at its inception,but the marketing efforts of all three principals soon attracted numerous clients.efs also entered into licensing agreements with suppliers who provided processing services necessary to operate the business.by december,efs had contracts with at least merchant customers.
in december,murphy and bishop refused to sign a written operating agreement for efs,declared they no longer wished to do business with barry,and announced their withdrawal from the company.instead of leaving efs orange county office,however,murphy and bishop changed the locks and converted company assets,such as computers and software,to their use.they removed barry password access to efs website,appropriated efs incoming mail,and stopped forwarding efs telephone calls to barry.though they claimed to have left the company,murphy and bishop converted monies held for,and owed to,efs and entered into contracts in efs name without barry knowledge or consent.murphy and bishop adopted a new company name,ept,but misled efs customers into believing ept was merely a new name for efs.
plaintiffs february complaint alleged the following breach of fiduciary duty conversion intentional interference with economic relations intentional interference with prospective economic relations negligent interference with economic relations negligent interference with prospective economic relations misappropriation of trade secrets unfair competition and untrue and misleading advertising trespass as to real and personal property accounting declaratory relief and money had and received.the complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief,along with damages in an amount in excess of and according to proof.in response to defendants subsequent demand for a bill of particulars,plaintiffs provided damage calculations in excess of.
first inspection demand 
plaintiffs propounded several discovery requests,including specially prepared interrogatories and document inspection demands.the first set of inspection demands sought to examine the business records of efs and ept.after defendants objected,the parties settled the discovery dispute when defendants stipulated to produce all responsive documents not covered by the and work product privileges.defendants also agreed to liberally construe the document request,resolving any alleged doubts in favor of production.the defendants agreed to affirm in a supplemental statement they had not withheld any documents except those protected by the and work product privileges.the stipulation expressly required the production of all electronic data,including messages.the trial court entered the stipulation as a court order.
defendants served the supplemental statement affirming they had produced all documents in their possession responsive to the first set of requests,with the exception of product documents created while defending the litigation.the statement asserted,however,a computer virus destroyed responsive on murphy computer several months after plaintiffs served the document demand.
concluding the supplemental statement did not comply with the stipulated order,and that defendants continued to withhold responsive documents,plaintiffs sought terminating sanctions in a contempt proceeding.at the hearing,the court ordered defendants to serve within seven days a revised supplemental statement and to produce all responsive documents per the stipulated order.the court also imposed in sanctions against each defendant.
defendants provided a revised supplemental statement and additional documents at murphy first deposition session,and produced more documents at the second session of murphy deposition,which occurred after the court deadline for compliance.defendants failed to produce any electronic data.during murphy deposition,plaintiffs discovered that documents requested in the first document demand had not been produced.defendants later turned over more documents responsive to the first demand,but plaintiffs claimed defendants violated the stipulated order because other responsive documents had not been produced.
second inspection demand 
on april,plaintiffs moved for sanctions and to compel production on their second set of document inspection demands.these demands essentially sought to inspect eft computers,including the one that stored the destroyed by the computer virus.although defendants lodged several objections to the demands,they failed to raise any objections in their opposition to plaintiffs motion.indeed,despite filing an opposition,defendants represented they were not opposing the motion to compel,and agreed to turn over one computer they believed belonged to efs efs computer,and permit plaintiffs to copy the hard drives of ept four other computers ept computers.
the trial court granted plaintiffs motion without qualification,ordered defendants to produce the items within fifteen days,and imposed sanctions.the court order included the following warning defendants are also put on notice that failure to timely comply with said discovery orders could result in the issuance of an order to show cause re contempt the imposition of sanctions,including more severe sanctions,including but not limited to the striking of any defendant answer or,or the striking of defendants answers and entry of default judgment against them.
defendants gave the efs computer to plaintiffs in the courthouse parking lot immediately after the hearing,and produced the four ept computers at ept offices for hard drive imaging.plaintiffs computer forensic consultant,george hiscox,examined the computers hard drives to determine if any data had been removed or destroyed.in his report,hiscox concluded the four ept computers had their hard drives wiped by data eraser software between the time the court ordered their production and hiscox inspection.the wiping program writes over each hard drive sector to ensure all traces of data formerly stored on the machine can not be retrieved.hiscox surmised that data had been copied from the hard drives,the drives wiped,and selected data reinstalled.one ept computer,however,had extractable data due to incorrect use of the wiping program.using forensic techniques,hiscox recovered an outlook calendar,contacts,and attachments.
the efs computer hard drive had also been wiped by the data eraser software,but the program had been aborted before completion.the data eraser program was run on april,at approximately given the hearing on the motion to compel on april began at,and defendants had promised to hand the computer over at the hearing,it appears the defendants aborted the data eraser program because defendants ran out of time to complete the wiping process.although interrupted before it could complete its work,the data eraser program did destroy the hard drive master boot record,partition table,file allocation table,and a number of other sectors.the destruction of these portions of the hard drive made the computer impossible to start up,and prevented the hard drive from being read even as a secondary drive to a running computer.the data recovered from this computer was obtained through forensic techniques.
despite the intentional destruction of data on the hard drives,defendants served supplemental responses asserting under oath they had fully complied with the demands,making no mention of any data removed from the computers.
d.other discovery matters 
in addition to the second inspection demands,the april motions to compel included plaintiffs third inspection demand,and first and second set of specially prepared interrogatories.except as to plaintiffs first set of specially prepared interrogatories to ept the trial court granted all of the motions to compel,with monetary sanctions imposed against defendants for each.the court also stayed further discovery until plaintiffs informed the court that defendants had fully complied with the outstanding discovery orders.despite the court order staying discovery,defendants served a subpoena on hiscox.
plaintiffs also propounded a supplemental inspection demand,seeking any newly acquired documents responsive to the first document inspection demand.defendants never responded to this request,despite their attorney agreement to do so.
plaintiffs also served a subpoena upon eft network,one of ept service providers.eft network had agreed to comply with the subpoena,but defendants attorney,without seeking to quash the subpoena or request a protective order,contacted eft network and threatened to terminate all business with the company if it complied with the subpoena.
motion for terminating sanctions 
based on defendants alleged destruction of evidence,continued failure to comply with the court discovery orders and other discovery abuses,plaintiffs filed an ex parte application to clarify the trial court discovery stay order and to delay the trial days.plaintiffs explained they needed the additional time to complete their review of defendants discovery responses and to file a motion for terminating sanctions.the trial court appointed a discovery referee and ordered the parties to submit all further discovery matters to him.
the referee denied plaintiffs ex parte application,in part because of plaintiffs purported failure to file a supporting declaration.although plaintiffs did not request permission to file a motion for terminating sanctions,the referee interpreted the ex parte application as doing so.accordingly,the referee recommendation included the following t he request for leave to file a motion for terminating sanctions is rendered moot by the introduction of defendant fedchex into this action,and the resulting continuance of trial and relevant critical dates.the trial court adopted the referee recommendations.
plaintiffs later filed a motion for terminating sanctions before the referee.around this time,plaintiffs also served upon defendants documents entitled plaintiffs statement of damages and plaintiffs notice of amount of punitive damages sought.in the statement of damages,plaintiffs claimed losses,excluding interest,of.in the notice of punitive damages,plaintiffs sought exemplary damages of.
the referee recommended the trial court strike the motion as inconsistent with the court previous order.but the trial court sustained plaintiffs objection to the recommendation and set a hearing on whether to impose terminating sanctions.plaintiffs argued at the hearing that defendants had not complied with any of the court discovery orders regarding plaintiffs inspection demands,and first and second sets of specially prepared interrogatories.plaintiffs emphasized evidence that defendants tampered with the hard drives of the ept and efs computers.in addition,plaintiffs relied on defendants violation of the discovery stay,interference with the subpoena served on eft network,and failure to respond to the supplemental inspection demand.
the trial court granted the motion,and struck the of murphy and bishop,struck defendants answer to the complaint,and ordered defendants default entered.the court later denied defendants motion under code of civil procedure section to overturn the order,claiming their attorneys were responsible for the discovery abuses.plaintiffs then filed an application for a default judgment,with supporting evidence 
before the court could rule on the request for default judgment,bishop filed for bankruptcy.granting plaintiffs motion to sever,the trial court entered judgment against murphy and ept.the trial court later entered judgment against bishop when the bankruptcy court lifted the stay.the judgments assessed against defendants compensatory damages of,and punitive damages of,the amounts reflected in the statement of damages and notice of punitive damages,and provided plaintiffs with prejudgment interest and attorney fees.defendants filed timely notices of appeal and a motion to augment the record 
discussiona.compensatory damages on default can not exceed the amount prayed for in the.the phrase in excess of does not provide notice of unlimited damages 
in the complaint,plaintiffs sought damages in an amount in excess of.defendants contend the complaint thus limited recoverable compensatory damages to.we agree.
former section subdivision b a,authorized a court to strike an answer as a sanction for misuse of the discovery process.once the answer is stricken,the case proceeds as if the defendant had never responded to the complaint.greenup rodman cal d,greenup.section,subdivision a,limits the amount of damages a court may award whenever an answer has not been filed,or has been stricken the relief granted to the plaintiff,if there is no answer,can not exceed that which he or she shall have demanded in his or her complaint,in the statement required by section,or in the statement provided for by section.
section,subdivision b,provides that w hen a complaint is filed in an action,to recover damages for personal injury or wrongful death,the defendant may at any time request a statement setting forth the nature and amount of damages being sought.section provides that a plaintiff may serve a statement notifying defendant of the amount of punitive damages sought in the action 
the legislature enacted sections,and related statutes to ensure that a defendant who declines to contest an action does not suffer liability.greenup,supra,cal d at.the statutes recognize a defendant entitlement to one last clear chance to respond to the complaint and avoid the consequences of a substantial judgment.schwab rondel homes,cal d.
the purpose of section is to require the plaintiff to provide notice of the maximum amount of the defendant potential liability.the complaint in the present case,however,seeks damages in an amount in excess of.thus,rather than giving defendants notice of their maximum liability,the complaint instead purports to provide notice of their minimum liability.other than stating that damages will be at least,the complaint provides notice no better than pleadings which seek damages according to proof.see becker construction cal d.indeed,nothing in the complaint would give anyone reason to suspect a default judgment could be entered specifying compensatory damages in excess of million,an amount times greater than the expressly requested.
the present situation is distinguishable from that in our recent decision in people ex rel.lockyer brar th,d brar.in brar,the attorney general filed suit against an attorney who repetitively filed shakedown lawsuits against small businesses.although the attorney general complaint sought damages in an amount of not less than,we nonetheless affirmed a default judgment.because the attorney general complaint stated it was seeking a statutory penalty of per violation of the unfair competition law bus,et,and that approximately nail salons had been named as doe defendants in each of at least three separate lawsuits,the defendant could have calculated potential damages from the face of the complaint of at least million,times.in the present situation,nothing in the complaint provided defendants with information sufficient to calculate compensatory damages of million.
because the complaint here is wholly ineffective under section to support a default judgment in excess of,compensatory damages must be limited to that amount.see becker,supra,cal d at,award reduced from to where complaint sought damages in excess of or according to proof.
section applies to default judgments rendered as discovery sanctions 
during oral argument,plaintiffs argued section is inapplicable when a default judgment is entered due to discovery abuses.plaintiffs concede the california supreme court in greenup,supra,held section applicable to a default judgment rendered as a discovery sanction,but argued at oral argument that greenup adopted the default judgment procedures of section only because there was no other statute on the books that would permit a judge to enter a default judgment through any means other than.in making this argument,plaintiffs rely on the following quotation from greenup it is true that sections,and,which together govern default judgments,do not explicitly list answers stricken pursuant to section as proceedings in which default judgment is rendered as if the defendant had failed to answer.yet unless and until the legislature specifically provides a separate procedure for defaults after discovery sanctions,these sections remain the sole statutory procedures for default judgments.greenup,supra,cal d at.
plaintiffs assert the legislature responded by enacting section shortly after greenup was decided section provided that t he court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders an order rendering a judgment by default against that party,subd.b d.plaintiffs argue this provision constituted a separate procedure for default judgments in the discovery sanction context as envisioned by the supreme court in greenup.we disagree.
plaintiffs fail to recognize the discovery statute applicable in greenup,former section also provided express authority for a court to enter a default judgment as a discovery sanction.specifically,former section,subdivision b,provided t he court may make any orders in regard to the refusal to obey a discovery order which are just,including,but not limited to,any of the following an order rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party,subd.b c.we perceive no functional difference between section and former section as it pertains to the issue at hand.accordingly,we reject plaintiffs contention the legislature effectively overruled greenup by enacting section,and conclude that section continues to govern the amount of damages available on a default judgment entered as a discovery sanction.
service of a statement of damages can not substitute for an amended complaint in a death case 
defendants also argue the statement of damages served under section did not provide effective notice that plaintiffs sought compensatory damages in excess of that pleaded in the complaint because section applies only to personal injury or wrongful death actions.we agree with defendants on this point.
section requires all complaints to state the amount of damages sought,except in personal injury or wrongful death cases.the exception for personal injury and wrongful death was added in to protect the defendants from adverse publicity resulting from inflated demands,particularly in medical malpractice cases.debbie ray th,d.to protect the due process rights of defendants,the legislature simultaneously added section,which provides formal notice of the damages sought in an action for personal injury or wrongful death.given there is no dispute the present action is not one for personal injury or wrongful death,section is inapplicable.as noted above,section,subdivision a,provides the relief granted to the plaintiff,if there is no answer,can not exceed that which he or she shall have demanded in his or her complaint,in the statement required by section,or in the statement provided for by section.italics added.because section is inapplicable,the statement of damages was not required by section and accordingly did not satisfy section notice requirement.
section operates as a limitation on the court jurisdiction.greenup,supra,cal d at.in this regard,our state highest court observed t he court jurisdiction to render default judgments can be exercised only in the way authorized by statute.citation.c ertainly no statutory method of procedure or limitation on power could be more clearly expressed than that set forth in section of the code of civil procedure citation.in re marriage of lippel cal d.accordingly,default judgments rendered in violation of section are void.greenup,supra,cal d at.in this vein,courts have held that due process requires not only actual notice of the damages being sought,but formal notice.ibid.as one court observed section constitutes a statutory expression of the mandates of due process,which require formal notice of potential liability.citations.parish peters th,d.thus,courts have subjected section to a strict construction.greenup,supra,cal d at.strictly construed,serving a statement of damages can not satisfy section in an action not involving personal injury or wrongful death.
we recently addressed this issue in sole energy hodges th,d sole energy.in sole energy,we reversed a million default judgment because the moving party failed to specify it sought a terminating sanction in the notice of motion for sanctions.we also reversed the judgment because the complaint failed to specify the amount of damages sought.although plaintiffs served a statement of damages under section,we concluded this failed to meet the demands of section,observing statements of damages are used only in personal injury and wrongful death cases,in which the plaintiff may not state the damages sought in the complaint.citation.in all other cases,when recovering damages in a default judgment,the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint.sole energy,supra,th at,fn,d.
because the complaint in the present case did not seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death,plaintiffs statement of damages fails to provide the formal notice required before plaintiffs may obtain compensatory damages exceeding the amount requested in the complaint.consequently,we must reverse the judgment.ordinarily,we would reduce the award to,the amount specifically requested in the complaint.see ostling loring th,d,italics omitted ostling ordinarily when a judgment is vacated on the ground the damages awarded exceeded those pled,the appropriate action is to modify the judgment to the maximum amount warranted by the complaint.but here we must vacate the award in its entirety because the trial court applied an incorrect measure of damages.see our discussion,post.our reversal of the default judgment,however,does not vacate the default itself.see ostling,supra,th at,d.
we recognize plaintiffs obtained the default judgment before publication of sole energy,the first reported decision addressing the issue here.in the interest of fairness,plaintiffs should have the option of either proceeding with a new default with the damage limitation,or amending the complaint to state the full amount of damages they seek.see greenup,supra,cal d at.if plaintiffs select the latter option,the default will be vacated,entitling defendants to either attack the pleadings,or answer the amended complaint.see falahati kondo th,d.
plaintiffs satisfied notice requirements for punitive damages 
although plaintiffs statement of damages failed to provide formal notice of the amount of compensatory damages they sought,the notice of punitive damages fully met the requirements of formal notice.specifically,the rule that punitive damages can not be included in the complaint applies to all cases requesting punitive damages.see,subd.e.section,subdivision f,provides that a party may serve a notice of punitive damages at any time before default is entered.plaintiffs served their notice of punitive damages concurrently with their motion for terminating sanctions.because service occurred before the entry of default,the notice of punitive damages was timely.
defendants complain that service in this manner violated their due process rights because the first formal notice of the amount of punitive damages occurred after they had made the decision to redact the computer hard drives in other words,defendants argue they would not have misused the discovery process had they known their liability could reach million.the argument implicitly suggests that had they received proper notice and chosen not to participate in the lawsuit,they also had the option to destroy the evidence requested in discovery.we reject this contention.
there is a significant difference between choosing not to defend a lawsuit at all,and defending a lawsuit by willfully disobeying lawful discovery orders.defendants willing to accept known liability may properly elect to watch from the sidelines.but if a defendant chooses to participate,he or she must play by the rules.here,defendants destruction of evidence violated the court discovery order and deliberately thwarted plaintiffs legitimate efforts to obtain information about damages.defendants obligation to obey court orders to produce documents exists whether or not they have received notice of the amount of damages plaintiffs seek therefore,defendants do not have the option to ignore the court order.we can not endorse a litigant conscious decision to deliberately destroy on the perception damages are limited to a particular amount.
accordingly,we conclude the notice of punitive damages was fully effective to apprise defendants of the amount of the punitive damages being sought.nonetheless,because we vacate the trial court award of compensatory damages,we must also vacate the punitive damage award.of course,the trial court must reconsider the amount of punitive damages if plaintiffs elect to proceed on the compensatory damage limitation.
b.the facts pleaded in the complaint fail to support causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of fiduciary duty 
c.the trial court erred in awarding as compensatory damages the value of ept 
the trial court awarded in compensatory damages.plaintiffs based their compensatory damage claim on the conclusions of their expert witness,who used two different methods of calculating ept value.the first method compared six similar publicly traded companies to ept.using publicly available information,the expert calculated a ratio for each company,which yielded a mean ratio of.the expert then applied this ratio to an estimate of ept annual revenue,which yielded a result of.the expert then multiplied this figure by percent,as a discount for ept status as a privately held company,for a value of.
alternatively,the expert performed a discounted analysis using as a basis two months of ept bank statements.applying capital expenditure assumptions and a variety of discount factors yielded a value of.the expert then averaged both final values to determine a final valuation of.the trial court reduced this number to,the amount set forth in the statement of damages.
defendants contend the trial court erred in awarding as damages the estimated market value of ept,instead of awarding efs its lost profits.we agree.
it is imperative in a default case that the trial court take the time to analyze the complaint at issue and ensure that the judgment sought is not in excess of or inconsistent with it.it is not in plaintiffs interest to be conservative in their demands,and without any opposing party to point out the excesses,it is the duty of the court to act as gatekeeper,ensuring that only the appropriate claims get through.heidary yadollahi th,d heidary.in the present case,the judgments not only included a cash award representing the value of ept,but also provided injunctive relief preventing ept from doing any further business with former and prospective efs clients,with whom ept did not already have a legally binding contract.the court appointed a receiver to ensure ept complied with this and other provisions in the judgment.
plaintiffs premise their damages on the theory that because ept took all of efs clients,equipment,and trade secrets,the value of ept should approximate what efs has lost.this presumes virtually all of ept current clients are either former clients or prospective clients of efs,and the scope of ept current business is no broader than that of efs.the lack of such evidence in the record aside,plaintiffs have cited no legal authority to support a damage award equaling the current value of defendants business,and we are aware of none in their default papers,plaintiffs cited brandon tibbs george kevorkian accountancy d.brandon tibbs as setting forth the appropriate legal standard for loss of an entire business.brandon tibbs,however,held the plaintiff may recover only the profits lost,not the value of the lost business id.at.see also elsbach mulligan d,the measure of damages for the diminution of the value of business due to a wrongful act is reflected by loss of profits,expenses incurred or similar concrete evidences of injury.
damage awards in injury to business cases are based on net profits.see,kuffel seaside oil d.it is fundamental that in awarding damages for the loss of profits,net profits,not gross profits,are the proper measure of recovery.net profits are the gains made from sales after deducting the value of the labor,materials,rents,and all expenses,together with the interest of the capital employed.citation.citations.kids universe,supra,th at,d.lost anticipated profits can not be recovered if it is uncertain whether any profit would have been derived at all from the proposed undertaking.but lost prospective net profits may be recovered if the evidence shows,with reasonable certainty,both their occurrence and extent.citation.it is enough to demonstrate a reasonable probability that profits would have been earned except for the defendant conduct.citations.moreover,a plaintiff is not required to establish the amount of its damages with absolute precision citation.citations.kids universe,supra,th at,d.
defendants contend efs was never profitable,and therefore can not demonstrate any lost profit damages.classifying efs as a new and unestablished business,defendants assert that any lost profits would be uncertain,contingent,and speculative.we disagree that plaintiffs are necessarily foreclosed from obtaining an award of lost profits.
lost profits for an unestablished business are recoverable if based on reasonably reliable evidence.w here the operation of an established business is prevented or interrupted,as by a tort or breach of contract or warranty,damages for the loss of prospective profits that otherwise might have been made from its operation are generally recoverable for the reason that their occurrence and extent may be ascertained with reasonable certainty from the past volume of business and other provable data relevant to the probable future sales.citations.on the other hand,where the operation of an unestablished business is prevented or interrupted,damages for prospective profits that might otherwise have been made from its operation are not recoverable for the reason that their occurrence is uncertain,contingent and speculative.citations.but although generally objectionable for the reason that their estimation is conjectural and speculative,anticipated profits dependent upon future events are allowed where their nature and occur
