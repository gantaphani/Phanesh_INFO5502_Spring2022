plaintiff robert strougo appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,judge granting the defendants.b motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state an actionable claim.the complaint includes,inter alia,class action claims on behalf of shareholders of an investment fund against the fund management.the district court dismissed these claims on the ground that redress for the injuries alleged could only be sought through derivative,and not direct,claims because we conclude that the plaintiff alleged injuries that support direct claims,we vacate the judgment of the district court in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the plaintiff is a shareholder of the brazilian equity fund,the fund,a,publicly traded,investment company incorporated under the laws of maryland and registered under the investment company act of,as amended,et the ica.as its name implies,the fund invests primarily in the securities of brazilian companies.the term indicates that the fund has a fixed number of outstanding shares,so that investors who wish to acquire shares in the fund ordinarily must purchase them from a shareholder rather than,as in funds,directly from the fund itself.shares in funds are thus traded in the same manner as are other shares of corporate stock.indeed,shares in the fund are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange.the number of outstanding shares in the fund is described as fixed because it does not change on a daily basis as it would were the fund,in which case the number of outstanding shares would change each time an investor invested new money in the fund,causing issuance of new shares,and each time a shareholder divested and thereby redeemed shares.
although funds do not sell their shares to the public in the ordinary course of business,there are methods available to them to raise new capital after their initial public offering.one such device is a rights offering,by which a fund offers shareholders the opportunity to purchase newly issued shares.rights so offered may be transferable,allowing the current shareholder to sell them in the open market,or,requiring the current shareholder to use them him or herself or lose their value when the rights expire.it was the fund employment of a rights offering that generated the claims at issue on this appeal.
on june,the fund announced that it would issue one right per outstanding share to every shareholder,and that every three rights would enable the shareholder to purchase one new share in the fund.the subscription price per share was set at ninety percent of the lesser of the average of the last reported sales price of a share of the fund common stock on the new york stock exchange on august,the date on which the rights expired,and the four business days preceding,and the net asset value at the close of business on august.
the plaintiff asserts that this sort of rights offering is coercive because it penalizes shareholders who do not participate.under the fund pricing formula for its rights offering,the subscription price could not have been higher than ninety percent of the fund net asset value.thus,the introduction of new shares at a discount diluted the value of old shares.because the rights could not be sold on the open market,a shareholder could avoid a consequent reduction in the value of his or her net equity position in the fund only by purchasing new shares at the discounted price.this put pressure on every shareholder to pony up and purchase more shares,enabling the fund to raise new capital and thereby increase its asset holdings.such purchases would,in turn,have tended to increase the management fee paid to defendant bea associates,the fund investment advisor,because that fee is based on the fund total assets.
at the close of business on august,the last day of the rights offering,the closing market price for the fund shares was,and the fund net asset value was.the fund shareholders purchased percent of the new shares available at a subscription price set at per share,ninety percent of the average closing price for the fund on that and the preceding four days.through the rights offering,the fund raised million in new capital,net of underwriting fees and other transaction costs.
on may,the plaintiff brought this action against the fund directors,senior officers,and investment advisor.the plaintiff complaint includes three direct claims on behalf of all shareholders it alleges that the defendants,by approving the rights offering,breached their duties of loyalty and care at common law and in violation of a and b of the investment company act,a,b.compl.the complaint further alleges that certain defendants violated of the ica because of their positions of authority and control at the fund.id.it asserts that these breaches of duty resulted in four kinds of injury to shareholders loss of share value resulting from the underwriting and other transaction costs associated with the rights offering downward pressure on share prices resulting from the supply of new shares downward pressure on share prices resulting from the offering of shares at a discount and injury resulting from coercion,in that shareholders were forced to either invest additional monies in the fund or suffer a substantial dilution.id.
on april,the district court dismissed the direct claims on the ground that the injuries alleged applied to the shareholders as a whole.strougo bassini,d,bassini.although the impact of the rights offering on any given shareholder depended on whether and to what extent that shareholder purchased new shares pursuant to the rights offering,the district court held that so long as the defendants action toward all shareholders was the same,and any disproportionate effect was the result of the various shareholders responses to the action,the shareholders have no direct action.id.at quoting strougo scudder,stevens clark,internal punctuation omitted scudder

ii.choice of law 
we meet at the threshold the question of which law,state or federal,should be the source of the rules we apply to decide the issue of shareholder standing whether the plaintiff may bring direct claims against the by this appeal the parties do not dispute that maryland law governs the plaintiff common law claims maryland is the fund state of incorporation.but the defendants encourage us also to apply maryland law to decide the issue raised by the plaintiff claims under the ica.the plaintiff asks us instead to fashion a uniform federal law applicable to these claims.
because the plaintiff claims under the ica involve federal causes of action,a legal rule that impact s significantly upon the effectuation of the plaintiff suit must be treated as raising federal questions.burks lasker,d.hence,our points of departure in the selection of rules of shareholder standing under the ica are the statute and the federal policy which it has adopted.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the ica itself is silent on issues of shareholder standing.however,the supreme court has held that,as a general matter,courts should look to state law to fill the interstices of federal remedial schemes unless the scheme in question evidences a distinct need for nationwide legal standards express provisions in analogous federal statutory schemes embody congressional policy choices readily applicable to the matter at hand or application of the particular state law in question would frustrate specific objectives of the federal programs.kamen kemper fin,d internal punctuation and citations omitted.the presumption that rules apply is particularly strong in disputes involving the law of corporations,an area where private parties have entered into legal relationships with the expectation that their rights and obligations would be governed by standards.id.
the specific question in kamen was whether a court should look to state law to determine whether a plaintiff who has brought a derivative suit under the ica can avail him or herself of the demand futility exception to the general rule that a shareholder can not proceed with a derivative suit unless the shareholder has first made a demand on the board of directors to cause the corporation to sue directly.the supreme court held that the law of the state of incorporation provides the rule of decision.
w here a gap in the federal securities laws must be bridged by a rule that bears on the allocation of governing powers within the corporation,federal courts should incorporate state law into federal common law unless the particular state law in question is inconsistent with the policies underlying the federal statute.
id.at.emphasis deleted.
every other court of which we are aware that has considered the question of shareholder standing under the ica has concluded that the rule in kamen controls and that state law applies.see lapidus hecht,cir we rely upon state law to determine whether the plaintiffs claims are direct or derivative.boland engle,cir stating that federal courts should apply state corporation law in determining whether a claim under the ica is direct or derivative marquit dobson,civ.jsm,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,holding that kamen compels the conclusion that u nder the investment company act,the law of the state in which the corporation is incorporated governs whether a claim is derivative or direct,aff sub nom.marquit williams,cir table green nuveen advisory,citing kamen for the proposition that,for claims under the ica,courts should generally look to the corporation law of the state where an investment company is incorporated scudder.at to determine whether a claim brought under the ica is direct or derivative,a court must look to the law of the state in which the fund was incorporated.citing kamen,at.
to be sure,a question is not properly characterized as bearing on the allocation of governing powers within the corporation,as was the issue in kamen,at.the question is not who controls the shareholder effectively controls the suit regardless of whether it is direct or derivative.but we read kamen to hold more broadly that the ica lacks sufficient indicia of congressional intent for courts to fashion nationwide legal standards to overcome the presumption that rules on questions of corporation law will be applied.see id.at.and the plaintiff has not directed us to,nor have we ourselves found,express provisions in analogous federal statutory schemes that reflect congressional policy choices and that are readily applicable to the matter at hand.id.at.
our conclusion here follows from kamen we must fill a gap in the ica with rules borrowed from state law unless,under the third kamen exception,application of those rules would frustrate the specific federal policy objectives underlying the ica.but we can not determine whether borrowing state law would frustrate the objectives of the ica until we have determined what the applicable state law of shareholder standing is.we will therefore return to this final piece of the puzzle after determining the rules of shareholder standing under maryland corporation law and applying them to the facts as alleged in the plaintiff complaint.
iii.shareholder standing under maryland law 
pursuit of direct claims for undifferentiated harm to all shareholders 
waller waller,remains the leading maryland case on shareholder standing.there,a shareholder brought a direct action against,inter alios,a corporation sales manager alleging that he and others had caused injury to the shareholder through the improvident discharge of employees,diversion of customers to competitors,choice of detrimental pricing policies,embezzlement of corporate funds,and disruption of corporate governance activities.id.at,at.in ruling that the plaintiff claims could not be brought in a direct shareholder suit,the maryland court of appeals observed 
it is a general rule that an action at law to recover damages for an injury to a corporation can be brought only in the name of the corporation itself acting through its directors,and not by an individual stockholder,though the injury may incidentally result in diminishing or destroying the value of the stock.the reason for this rule is that the cause of action for injury to the property of a corporation or for impairment or destruction of its business is in the corporation,and such injury,although it may diminish the value of the capital stock,is not primarily or necessarily a damage to the stockholder,and hence the stockholder derivative right can be asserted only through the corporation.
at.the court of appeals further explained 
the rule is advantageous not only because it avoids a multiplicity of suits by the various stockholders,but also because any damages so recovered will be available for the payment of debts of the corporation,and,if any surplus remains,for distribution to the stockholders in proportion to the number of shares held by each.
id.at,at.thus,waller noted that a direct action for injuries shared by the corporation may inequitably displace the claims of creditors and thereby subvert the creditors priority.the court then determined that the injuries alleged by the plaintiff derived from injuries to the corporation itself,and thus the plaintiff lacked standing to bring direct claims.id.at,at.
waller,in holding that a corporation and not its shareholders may recover for injury to its property or impairment or destruction of its business,does not elaborate on the meaning of property or business for these purposes.it does hold,however,that these terms include not only the corporation funds and inventory,but also its relationships with employees and customers and its internal processes for.id.at,at.more recently,the maryland court of appeals held that injury to the corporation business or property also occurs when officers and directors waste funds on perquisites,salaries,and bonuses,or make imprudent investments.sardegna.the maryland court of special appeals has further ruled that corporate business or property injury occurs if officers and directors mismanage or misappropriate funds.tafflin levitt.and in danielewicz arnold,the same court held that the corporation alone has standing when it issues an excessive number of shares in exchange for shares of another company,even if the issuance of those shares rendered the plaintiff,formerly a majority shareholder,a minority shareholder.the court found waller to be indistinguishable.danielewicz.at,at.these maryland cases indicate,inter alia,that investments by a corporation,even if paid for with the corporation shares,may constitute an impairment or destruction of the corporation business.
in deciding whether a shareholder may bring a direct suit,the question the maryland courts ask is not whether the shareholder suffered injury if a corporation is injured those who own the corporation are injured too.the inquiry,instead,is whether the shareholders injury is distinct from that suffered by the corporation.tafflin.at,at.
tafflin deals not with a shareholders suit,but with the analogous situation of depositors in an insolvent savings and loan association seeking to recover for losses against the association directors,officers,accountants,lawyers,and others.it is nonetheless illuminating because it explains,in comparable circumstances,the distinct injury requirement by reference to the concern expressed in waller for making damages recovered for injury to the corporation available to pay the debts of the corporation.
appellants alleged injuries are not distinct from the injury sustained by the bank and all its depositors as a result of appellees mismanagement and wrongdoing p ermitting depositors to bring individual actions for mismanagement of funds would invariably impair the rights of other general creditors and claimants with superior interests t hat fraud may have induced all of the depositors to make their original deposits does not justify bypassing this equitable and system for recovery.
tafflin.at,at internal citation omitted.
both waller and tafflin acknowledge that harm to shareholders may flow from injuries to a corporation business or property,including those that decrease the value of firm assets or otherwise impair the corporation ability to generate profits.maryland law nonetheless provides that in such circumstances,despite the harm to shareholders,the corporation alone has a cause of action to recover for the injury asserted.although shareholders suffer collateral injury,they may have that injury redressed only through the collateral effect of the results of the corporation might,for instance,result in a recovery of damages by the corporation and thus a corresponding increase in share value allowing shareholders to recover directly,on the other hand,besides threatening the multiplicity of suits cited by waller,at,at,makes possible recoveries that are inequitably distributed among those other than shareholders with an interest in the corporation.specifically,if the corporation were in default on its debt,direct shareholder suits for corporate injury could defeat the prior claim of corporate creditors to corporate assets because the rule of limited liability would prevent the creditors from reaching damages recovered by the shareholders personally.where shareholders suffer an injury that does not stem from an injury to the corporation business or property,by contrast,the corporation lacks standing to sue,and maryland distinct injury rule allows shareholders access to the courts to seek compensation directly.
thus,under maryland law,when the shareholders of a corporation suffer an injury that is distinct from that of the corporation,the shareholders may bring direct suit for redress of that injury there is shareholder standing.when the corporation is injured and the injury to its shareholders derives from that injury,however,only the corporation may bring suit there is no shareholder standing.the shareholder may,at most,sue derivatively,seeking in effect to require the corporation to pursue a lawsuit to compensate for the injury to the corporation,and thereby ultimately redress the injury to the shareholders.
we thus reject the undifferentiated effect on shareholders standard,which the district court articulated in scudder and relied upon in its decision in this case.see bassini,d at s o long as the defendants action toward all shareholders was the same,and any disproportionate effect was the result of the various shareholders responses to the action,the shareholders have no direct action.citing scudder.at.to sue directly under maryland law,a shareholder must allege an injury distinct from an injury to the corporation,not from that of other shareholders 
in scudder,the district court ruled that shareholders can not bring direct claims where the alleged injury involves undifferentiated harm that falls equally on all shareholders.at.scudder in turn drew its undifferentiated harm rule from olesh dreyfus,no.cps,wl,dist.lexis,a case that applied maryland law to shareholder claims arising from a merger.but the language from olesh,complaints have been converted into derivative actions where the injury involved obviously fell alike on all shareholders,id.at,dist.lexis at,is descriptive rather than prescriptive.the olesh court accurately observed that many cases where injury falls alike on all shareholders are properly brought as or become derivative actions.it is not true,however,and olesh does not stand for the proposition,that if injury falls alike on all shareholders,legal action seeking redress for that injury may only be brought derivatively.neither of the cases cited by olesh as the source of its observation,moreover,relies upon maryland law.and both involve alleged shareholder injuries deriving from diminution of corporate assets,an injury quintessentially remediable by shareholders only through a derivative action.see vincel white motor,cir nordberg lord,day lord.
an inquiry that asks only whether shareholders have suffered undifferentiated harm,rather than whether the shareholders have suffered injury distinct from any potential injury to the corporation,could lead to situations in which shareholders are improperly left with an injury without legal recourse.there may be acts that injure shareholders equally but do not injure the corporation at all indeed they might be seen as benefitting the corporation in the sense that they might increase its assets.the shareholders,despite their undifferentiated harm,could not bring a derivative could the corporation recover for no such suit could succeed without a showing of injury to the corporation.in such circumstances,only a direct suit by shareholders can redress the harm to them,even though the harm was suffered by the shareholders equally.see james hanks,maryland corporations law b,suppl.if the wrong alleged was committed against the stockholder rather than the corporation,then the stockholder must bring the action as a direct individually or as representative of a not as a derivative action.for this reason,the rule under maryland law is that where shareholders suffer a distinct injury,an injury that does not derive from corporate injury,they may bring direct suit,even if their injury is undifferentiated among them.
pursuit of direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty 
we also do not see a basis in maryland law for the defendants argument,premised on scudder,that claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by directors and officers only support derivative actions and may not be pursued directly.see scudder.at.it is not clear that this was essential to the decision in scudder,inasmuch as it appears to have been stated as an observation rather than as a rule of law.id.at c laims of breach of duty by directors and other fiduciaries of a corporation generally are regarded as derivative rather than direct.but in any event,the defendants have asserted that under maryland law,directors and officers can not be sued directly by shareholders for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.we disagree.
maryland case law appears to be silent on the narrow question whether shareholders may bring fiduciary duty claims directly against officers and directors.although neither the district court nor the defendants cite a case from a maryland court that holds that such lawsuits are prohibited,the plaintiffs similarly fail to cite a case in which such a suit was allowed.
but maryland courts have clearly established the proposition that directors and officers owe fiduciary duties to both the corporation and the shareholders.see toner baltimore envelope,collecting cases waller,at,at this means that by asserting that shareholders may not bring direct claims against directors and officers based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duties,the defendants in effect argue that these fiduciary duties,though extant,are.the availability of a derivative action does not suggest otherwise.as we have seen,a derivative suit may only be brought if the plaintiff alleges injury to the corporation,and can not be brought by a plaintiff who alleges only a distinct injury to him or herself as the result of the breach of a fiduciary duty or otherwise.thus,the availability of derivative actions does not give shareholders a remedy that they would not have if the officers and directors owed their fiduciary duties to the corporation alone.
we note that there is no dispute that the fiduciary duties owed by directors and officers to the corporation are actionable,as the existence of derivative actions under maryland law indicates.maryland law also makes clear that the fiduciary duties owed minority shareholders by majority shareholders are actionable,and may be enforced through direct claims.see,baker standard lime stone,coop.milk serv.hepner,dismissing claims on
