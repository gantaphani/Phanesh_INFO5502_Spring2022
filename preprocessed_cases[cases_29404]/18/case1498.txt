this appeal is the latest episode in a long story of litigation commencing in.at different stages it was heard by five judicial officers,culminating in a record of nearly pages.the action involves the purchase,operation and eventual sale of a hotel,the carson hilton,by three joint venturers,pba,llc hereafter pba,krad associates,llc hereafter krad,and kpod hereafter kpod.
after a brief relationship between the companies and their principals characterized primarily by disputes over management,allegations of mismanagement,and general discord,the hotel was partitioned by sale,its liabilities paid,and the remaining proceeds apportioned.various between the companies and their principals were disposed of by dismissal or trial.
pba appeal focuses primarily on rulings made by judge gale,contending he acted as a de facto court of appeal,overturning sound and decisions made by prior judges and,sometimes by courts of appeal pba argues judge gale abused his discretion and exceeded his jurisdiction by making rulings contrary to his predecessors,principally judge morgan,in violation of code of civil procedure section.among other things,pba challenges judge gale order vacating an order by judge morgan declaring defendant and sailor kennedy a vexatious litigant and requiring kennedy to obtain court permission before filing any new litigation in this state.
kpod,which agrees for the most part with judge gale rulings,primarily appeals from judge morgan grant of summary judgment to pba on the complaint for partition of the property and certain findings by the referee on the accompanying accounting.kpod joins sailor kennedy in contending kennedy successfully moved to disqualify judge morgan at an early point during the litigation,thereby voiding some of the principal rulings in this case.
sailor kennedy,a principal in kpod,appeals the trial court decision striking the first causes of action of his against pba and others and the court ruling denying his motion to strike the orders of judge morgan on the ground morgan had been disqualified.
timothy,a real estate agent,appeals from the trial court decision striking the first eight causes of actions in his against the patels,principals in pba.
in the published portions of this opinion we hold judge morgan had jurisdiction to strike kennedy declaration of prejudice notwithstanding the fact the judge had previously filed a response to the declaration and judge gale erred in vacating judge morgan vexatious litigant and orders because kennedy failed to show a change in facts establishing the orders were no longer justified.the facts relevant to these subjects are discussed in our resolution of the issues below.
facts and proceedings below 
discussion 
kennedy motion to set aside all orders entered by judge morgan was properly denied because a review of a disqualification motion is limited to a petition for a writ of mandate and b all of the declarations of bias and prejudice were either properly ordered stricken or found meritless.
pursuant to code of civil procedure section kennedy and filed a declaration alleging bias and prejudice against judge morgan on january.on the same day,judge morgan filed and served a verified answer to the allegations.still later on the same day,judge morgan determined the declaration was untimely and failed to meet the requirements of the statute.therefore,under the authority of section subdivision b,judge morgan ordered the declaration stricken from the record.
four days later,kennedy filed another declaration of bias and prejudice,which judge morgan immediately ordered stricken.
kennedy and filed two additional declarations of bias against judge morgan on may,and june.these declarations were denied by judges fujisaki and gale respectively.undeterred,on june,kennedy filed his fifth declaration of bias and prejudice against judge morgan.
judge morgan recused himself on june,pursuant to section subdivision a,in furtherance of the interests of justice.soon after,the case was transferred to judge gale.kennedy then brought a motion to set aside all orders made by judge morgan from the time he was assigned to the case,contending judge morgan had been effectively disqualified as of january.judge gale denied the motion.
section subdivision d limits review of a judge disqualification to a writ of mandate sought within days of notice of the determination.
section subdivision d specifies the determination of the question of disqualification of a judge is not an appealable order and may be reviewed only by a writ of mandate sought within days of notice to the parties of the decision as this court has held,all litigants who seek to challenge denial of a statutory judicial disqualification motion are relegated to writ review as described in section d.likewise,section subdivision d forecloses appeal of a claim that a statutory motion for disqualification authorized by section was erroneously denied,and this preclusion applies even when the statutory basis appears to codify due process grounds for challenging the impartiality of a judge.thus,as our supreme court has affirmed,the exclusive means for review of a determination on the disqualification of a judge is by a petition for writ of mandate in accordance with section subdivision d 
the purpose of this rule is twofold.it seeks to eliminate the waste of time and money which would flow from continuing the proceeding subject to its being voided by an appellate ruling that the disqualification decision was erroneous.it also promotes fundamental fairness by denying the party seeking disqualification a second bite at the apple if he loses on the merits but succeeds on appeal from the disqualification order.
kennedy and did not seek a writ of mandate after the striking or denial of any of the statements of bias and prejudice they brought against judge morgan.the proceedings then stretched out for over a year and a half,adding more volumes to an already voluminous record.thus,given the unfairness of reconsidering the disqualification issue at this stage,the failure of kennedy and to seek writ review as provided by section constituted a waiver of their statutory claims based on section.
we conclude,therefore,that kennedy and are precluded from seeking review of their declarations of bias and prejudice whether stricken or determined meritless,by a motion in the trial court or by appeal following the final judgment.
furthermore,even assuming the issue is properly before us,we find,for the reasons explained below,that judge morgan was not disqualified prior to recusing himself in june,and therefore the trial court properly denied the motion to set aside his orders.
judge morgan filing an answer pursuant to section did not preclude him from striking the statement of bias and prejudice under section.
once a statement of disqualification has been filed by a party,the judge has four options.the judge may request any other judge agreed upon by the parties to sit and act within days,file a consent to disqualification within days file a written verified answer admitting or denying any or all of the allegations or strike the declaration failure to respond within the time allowed is deemed a consent to disqualification 
kennedy contends judge morgan filing an answer to the january declaration pursuant to section subdivision c precluded him from thereafter striking the declaration of bias pursuant to section,subdivision b.thus,he argues the various procedural options of section and are mutually exclusive.we disagree.
notwithstanding the options specified in section listed above,if the statement is untimely filed or facially discloses no legal grounds for disqualification,the judge against whom it is filed may strike it this authority to strike the statement of disqualification derives from section,subdivisions d and b.section,subdivision d provides a judge against whom such a statement has been filed,has no power to act except as provided in this section.italics added.section,subdivision b states notwithstanding paragraph of subdivision c of section,if a statement of disqualification is untimely filed or if on its face it discloses no legal grounds for disqualification,the trial judge against who it was filed may order it stricken.thus,the authority to strike a declaration exists notwithstanding section subdivision c which precludes judges from ruling on their own disqualifications.
we recently held a challenged judge has the power to order a statement of disqualification stricken as legally insufficient as long as such discretion is exercised within the day time limit imposed by section,subdivision c this time limit is the only restraint on the power retained by a judge to strike a statement of disqualification pursuant to the guidelines of section,subdivision b.
kpod,kennedy,and cite hollingsworth superior for the proposition the judge options to consent to disqualification,answer,or strike the declaration,are mutually exclusive.they argue once a trial judge files an answer to the declaration,the judge loses power to take any further action.hollingsworth,however,simply determined a judge can not consent or answer after striking the statement of disqualification therefore,in such circumstances a party need not wait days before seeking relief via writ of mandate this makes sense because upon striking the declaration,it no longer exists to be consented to or answered.however,nothing prevents the challenged judge from striking the declaration after first answering it.we find no authority or logical reason to prevent a judge from striking such a statement subsequent to filing an answer so long as it is done within the days prescribed by the statute.
thus,we conclude judge morgan filing of an answer pursuant to section subdivision c did not preclude him from striking the statement of bias and prejudice within days of its filing.because kennedy and january,statement of bias was properly stricken according to the statutory procedure,judge morgan subsequent orders were valid.
kennedy january statement of bias and prejudice was ordered stricken from the record by judge morgan on the day it was filed.
kpod and kennedy further claim judge morgan did not respond at all to the january declaration of bias and prejudice filed by kennedy.therefore,they argue,by not responding within days of the filing of this declaration,judge morgan effectively consented to his disqualification.
if judge morgan had not responded,according to section subdivision c,he would have been deemed to have consented to disqualification.this section of the code is not relevant to the circumstances at hand,however,because the contention judge morgan did not respond is factually incorrect.he read,considered and ordered kennedy january declaration of bias stricken from the record on the same day it was filed.this determination is clearly set forth in a minute order dated january.as discussed above,under section,within days after the declaration is filed,the trial court retains the power to strike it as being untimely or for facially failing to meet the statutory requirements.therefore,because judge morgan did respond to kennedy january challenge for cause under section by striking his declaration,the judge did not consent to disqualification and thus retained jurisdiction to enter subsequent orders.
in sum,because kennedy and declarations pursuant to section were stricken and not challenged via writ of mandate,the validity of judge morgan orders could not be challenged on the ground the judge had been disqualified.accordingly,judge gale properly denied the motion brought by kennedy and to set aside all orders entered by judge morgan.
ix.judge gale abused his discretion in vacating judge morgan vexatious litigant and prefiling orders because kennedy failed to show a change in material facts to establish the original determination was no longer justified.
the vexatious litigant statutes were designed to curb misuse of the court system by those acting in propria persona who repeatedly relitigate the same issues,especially those persistent and obsessive litigants who often file groundless actions against judges and other court officers who made adverse decisions against them.
soon after kennedy first two attempts to disqualify judge morgan with a declaration of bias and prejudice,pba filed a motion for an order declaring kennedy a vexatious litigant pursuant to section.section,subdivision b,defines a vexatious litigant as a person who in any litigation while acting in propria persona,repeatedly files unmeritorious motions,pleadings,or other papers,conducts unnecessary discovery,or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause delay.pba additionally sought a prefiling order against kennedy pursuant to section.a prefiling order under section prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge of the court.
in support of its motion,pba alleged kennedy had a accused no less than eight judges or retired judges of being biased,bigoted,or incompetent b sued no less than two judges in groundless proceedings c referred or threatened to refer virtually every judge who had ruled against him to the jurisdictional body overseeing the judge performance,and d accused no less than attorneys of unethical conduct,perjury,altering documents,and incompetence.pba also documented a pattern of kennedy lack of respect for judicial officers.kennedy failed to challenge or rebut any of these allegations.
based on pba motion,supporting documents,and his own observations of kennedy substantial misconduct,judge morgan declared kennedy a vexatious litigant pursuant to section and entered a prefiling order pursuant to section.the prefiling order prevented kennedy from filing any new litigation,including any complaints or in propria persona,in the courts of this state without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge of the court where the litigation is pending or proposed to be filed.
after the case was transferred to judge gale,kennedy brought a motion to vacate the orders declaring him a vexatious litigant and imposing prefiling restrictions.judge gale granted kennedy motion and vacated the prefiling order and vexatious litigant finding.pba appeals this reversal on the ground it was improper based on the record before judge gale.
despite the apparent unfairness of permanently branding a person as a vexatious litigant,it is unclear how the vexatious litigant determination can be erased in appropriate cases.the statutory scheme of sections through does not itself provide a procedural mechanism for dissolving an order declaring a person a vexatious litigant.indeed,in most cases,vacating the vexatious litigant determination appears to be precluded by section beyond days of notice of entry of the finding 
the court in wolfgram wells fargo bank,by analogizing to a licensing system,implied a prefiling order entered pursuant to section may be a permanent form of relief the court reasoned to the extent section keeps vexatious litigants from clogging courts,it is closer to licensing or permit systems which are administered pursuant to narrowly drawn,reasonable and definite standards which represent governments only practical means of managing competing uses of public facilities.citation.when a vexatious litigant knocks on the courthouse door with a colorable claim,he may enter while there is much to recommend this reasoning,the conclusion section is to be a permanent,irrevocable restriction is troubling.although section does not absolutely exclude the pro per litigant from the courts,we believe fundamental fairness requires the vexatious litigant brand be erasable in appropriate circumstances.
in the present case,we need not reach the issue of whether or not the brand of vexatious litigant can be erased once applied.at a minimum,to cast off the vexatious litigant label the court would have to find a change in facts or circumstances relating to the original determination.kennedy failed to establish such new facts.thus,even if it is theoretically possible to remove the brand of vexatious litigant,judge gale abused his discretion in doing so here because kennedy failed to show a change in facts indicating a mending of his ways or conduct to support a rev
