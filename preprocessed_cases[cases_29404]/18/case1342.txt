it is the duty of a county tax assessor to value property at its fair market value.to arrive at the fair market value of a television cable franchise,the assessor must determine its reasonably anticipated term.rule,subdivision d,title of the california code of regulations,provides for situations,as here,where the reasonably anticipated term of possession is longer than the stated term of possession 
appellant charter communications properties,llc charter contends that the assessor violated rule when it valued its unexpired cable franchises charter challenges the use of a reasonably anticipated term of possession longer than the remaining years of the stated term of each franchise agreement.charter further challenges the use of rule,subdivision d factors to value the unexpired franchises.in this case,the assessment appeals board aab,in compliance with rule,found clear and convincing evidence of a mutual understanding between the county and the owner of franchises that the reasonably anticipated terms of possession of the franchises were longer than their stated terms of possession.accordingly we affirm the judgment of the trial court which so found.
background 
the subject property consists of charter eight unexpired television franchise possessory interests in the county.the county and several cities atascadero,paso robles,grover beach,san luis obispo,pismo beach,arroyo grande,and morro bay entered into franchise agreements with charter.at the time of the challenged assessments,between four and ten years remained of the unexpired franchise agreements stated terms.charter filed applications seeking of property tax refunds for through.the applications challenged two factors applied by the assessor in valuing the franchise possessory interests the term of possession and the economic rent.this appeal does not concern the economic rent factor.
aab proceedings 
on april,the assessor and charter appeared at the aab hearing concerning its through property tax refund applications.during that session,the aab decided to seek an advisory opinion from the legal staff of the state board of equalization sbe,and continued the proceeding.the sbe issued an advisory opinion letter on july.meanwhile,charter had filed comparable refund applications for and.on april,the aab consolidated charter refund applications for through and resumed hearing charter applications.
the assessor and charter agreed that the market value of the subject property should be determined by the capitalization of income approach,using the following factors growth rate percent expense ratio economic rent percentage term of possession number of years used for valuation purposes and capitalization rate percent.they also agreed as to the formula to be used to calculate the market value using those factors and they agreed that the correct assessed value for each parcel would be the lesser of market value computed according to the agreed upon manner or the adjusted base year value of record.
both parties presented evidence and arguments relating to the appropriate term of possession.most of their arguments concerned subdivision d of rule,which provides as follows the term of possession for valuation purposes shall be the reasonably anticipated term of possession.the stated term of possession shall be deemed the reasonably anticipated term of possession unless it is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the public owner and the private possessor have reached a mutual understanding or agreement,whether or not in writing,such that the reasonably anticipated term of possession is shorter or longer than the stated term of possession.if so demonstrated,the term of possession shall be the stated term of possession as modified by the terms of the mutual understanding or agreement.
charron sparks,a supervising assessor,presented the assessor staff report.sparks explained that t he federal communications act of specifically provides that the continuation of service is in the public best interest and makes it essentially impossible for a franchise not to be renewed.the assessor is not aware of any franchise agreement throughout the state that has not been renewed.
sparks gathered information from each of the franchising agencies in the county.she found that the renewal process was not contentious and that franchise agreements are renewed indefinitely.sparks testified about the perception of local franchise agencies from whom she collected data.those agencies were not at all concerned about their franchise agreements.as an example,she explained that the county franchise was in limbo for three years and nobody really wanted to deal with it because it a as far as they are concerned.it is just going to be what it is because they ca tell them not to be t here.they can not renew it.there is no option to not renew it.charter is the only game in town.they are the only people with cable on the ground.
the assessor staff report includes an excerpt from the form k that charter filed with the securities and exchange commission for the year ended december.relevant portions of that excerpt follow franchise rights acquired through the purchase of cable systems represent management estimate of fair value at the date of acquisition and generally are reviewed to determine if the franchise has a definite life or an indefinite life as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas which eliminates the amortization of indefinite lived intangible assets b eginning january,all franchises that qualify for indefinite life treatment under sfas are no longer amortized against earnings the company believes that facts and circumstances have changed to enable it to conclude that substantially all of its franchises will be renewed indefinitely,with those franchises where technological or operational factors limit their lives continuing to be amortized.the company has sufficiently upgraded the technological state of its cable systems and now has sufficient experience with the local franchise authorities where it acquired franchises to conclude substantially all franchises will be renewed indefinitely.italics added.sparks also testified that charter had expended almost million in making technological upgrades to the subject property.
based on the factors,the assessor concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that charter and the franchise authorities mutually understood that the unexpired franchise terms were longer than the agreements stated terms,and it was not required to use the remaining years of the original stated term as the term of possession.since the parties mutually understood that the terms were indefinite,it was necessary to determine a reasonably anticipated term of possession,as in the case of an expired agreement 
sparks then addressed the basis for the year term that the assessor determined to be the reasonably anticipated term of possession of the indefinite,unexpired franchises.she referred to the following statements that charter made in its form k prior to the adoption of sfas,costs incurred in obtaining and renewing cable franchises were deferred and amortized using the method over a period of years.franchise rights acquired through the purchase of cable systems were generally amortized using the method over a period of years.the period of years was management best estimate of the useful lives of the franchises and assumed that substantially all of those franchises that expired during the period would be renewed but not indefinitely.sparks further noted that most franchise agreements had year terms.
charter representatives presented its case.citing rule,subdivision d,and other authority,charter argued that because the franchise agreements for the subject property were unexpired as of the valuation date,the term of possession was the number of years remaining under the stated term of each agreement.
in disputing that there was any mutual understanding that the unexpired franchises had indefinite terms,charter presented the testimony of ed merrill,its northern california representative.merrill testified about two instances in which franchises briefly expired and the parties mutually agreed to short extension periods for further negotiations.he noted one situation where a city santa cruz initially refused to transfer a franchise from charter to another company.merrill also testified that charter had identified several franchises that it did not intend to renew.during,merrill conceded that he could not cite any franchise agreements in california that eventually have not been renewed where service actually ceased and then a new cable provider came in 
charter also presented documentary evidence,including appraisals,calculations,and the sbe july,advisory opinion letter sbe letter.one charter exhibit showed that the remaining years of the unexpired franchise were as follows arroyo grande,eight years atascadero,ten years grover beach,seven years morrow bay,seven years paso robles,four years pismo beach,seven years,city of san luis obispo,four years san luis obispo county,ten years.
charter asserted that the sbe letter supported its position.relevant portions of that letter follow rule d separates taxable possessory interests into two types those with or those without a stated term of possession when a taxable possessory interest has a stated term of possession,rule provides that the stated term of possession shall be the reasonably anticipated term of possession,unless the assessor can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the public owner and the private possessor have reached a mutual understanding or agreement such that the reasonably anticipated term of possession differs from the stated term of possession.if so demonstrated,the rule also provides that the term of possession for valuation purposes shall be the stated term of possession as modified by the mutual understanding or agreement for a taxable possessory interest without a stated term of possession,the assessor may determine the reasonably anticipated term of possession based upon the intent of the public owner and the private possessor,or by the intent of similarly situated parties,using criteria such as that listed in rule d.rule d states that a taxable possessory interest that runs from month to month,an interest without a fixed term,or an interest of otherwise unspecified duration shall be deemed to be a taxable possessory interest with no stated term of possession.if a cable system franchise is operating under a current document,the presumption is that the stated term of possession,remaining thereunder on the valuation date,constitutes the reasonably anticipated term of possession.if the document or instrument has expired,the reasonably anticipated term of possession is to be determined using the criteria listed in rule d until a new document or instrument is executed.italics added.
in essence,charter argued that the remaining years of the stated term constitute the reasonably anticipated term unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed or mutually understood that another finite stated term would apply to the franchise.the assessor maintained that where the parties mutually understood that an unexpired agreement had an indefinite term,a reasonable construction of rule authorized the use of factors relevant to valuation of agreements with no stated term.see rule,subd.d.
aab findings of fact 
on september,the aab issued findings of fact.its findings include an example of the method for calculating the value of possessory interests under the capitalization of income approach.their example is based on the following assumptions 
franchise payment in 
franchise rate 
economic rent percentage 
growth rate 
expense ratio 
term years 
capitalization rate 
that example illustrates the significance of the term of possession in assessing value 
step prior annual system revenue economic rent for prior year x 
step future gross rent amounts 
through the end of the term showing results of and 
step reduce net income by deducting expenses.
step reduce the future net annual rent amounts to present value using the capitalization rate.
step the sum of the present values for each year equals the taxable value.the value of the possessory interest in aab example findings was.
relevant portions of the aab findings regarding the term of possession for unexpired franchises state as to the unexpired franchises,the board found that the parties agreed to the applicability of property tax rule d but differed primarily on whether or not the assessor presented clear and convincing evidence to rebut the use of the stated remaining term as the reasonably anticipated term.t he assessor did present clear and convincing evidence that the applicant franchises were of an indefinite duration.ii rule d refers to a mutual understanding or agreement,whether or not in writing.the use of or in this phrase suggests strongly that an understanding is something other than an express agreement.a n understanding contrary to the stated remaining term was clearly and convincingly shown by the strong statement in charter form k and given the serious nature of the statements appearing in a form k,and the potential civil and criminal consequences of erroneous or misleading statements in a form k,a responsible corporation would not make such statements unless there was an understanding by both charter and the public owners of the existing franchises.iii.having found that the assessor rebutted the stated remaining term by clear and convincing evidence,the remaining question was what term was shown by clear and convincing evidence.iv t he originally negotiated length of the franchise was the reasonably anticipated term.for example,if any unexpired franchise had an original term of years,and the express terms of the franchise provided for expiration in years,the year remaining term was rebutted by the clear and convincing evidence the assessor introduced to show that the franchise was of an indefinite duration and that the reasonably anticipated term was the term originally stated in franchise.
trial court action 
on january,charter filed its complaint for refund of property tax in the trial court.its complaint sought of property tax refunds for through,and challenged two of the five factors used to assess the value of its unexpired franchise agreements the term of possession and the economic rent.
for the most part,charter and the county relied upon the record before the aab.charter also asked the trial court to take judicial notice of documents relating to the california assessor association caa request to the sbe to amend rule,in.the court granted its request.the parties disputed whether the evidence supported the aab finding that clear and convincing evidence established that charter and the local franchise authorities had any mutual understanding that the term of the unexpired franchises would be longer or shorter than the stated terms of the underlying agreements.both parties submitted trial briefs with arguments much like those they presented to the aab.
charter stressed the following statements that chief deputy county counsel wyatt cash made at the aab hearing if i understand the assessor position on term of possession,i not sure that it complies with the sbe letter and rule.i think more importantly it in violation of d,because to be able to jump to years if let say the stated term in the existing contract is five years left to be able to jump to,the assessor got to show by clear and convincing evidence that there is a mutual understanding between the franchising agency and the cable company that that term is different,is going to be.and that got to be shown by clear and convincing evidence.i think the assessor can get to years where there is an existing and in place contract.but they have to show by clear and convincing evidence that the parties have a mutual understanding that it will go to years.
charter stressed also that the sbe had denied the caa requests to modify rule.it claimed that such denials supported charter position that the stated term of possession must be used to value its unexpired franchises.
after reviewing the trial briefs and hearing oral argument,the trial court commented on several issues.some of its comments concerning the term of possession follows the court the problem i having charter is going in to have these revolving franchises.let say you in the year of a year franchise is it really an expectation of the parties that that lease is not going to be renewed for a full year period and charter is saying yes to the county assessor.but then in its it saying,hey,it likely that these are going to go on indefinitely.charter point is,well,it not a mutual understanding my point is,well it better than a mutual understanding.it an admission from a party opponent essentially that whatever they telling the county,they have a different view of the thing and they,themselves,think it going to go on indefinitely.
on june,the trial court issued its amended ruling following court trial it upheld the aab findings and decision concerning the term of possession that applied in valuing charter unexpired franchise possessory interests.it ruled that substantial evidence did not support the aab finding that the economic rent rate was percent,and remanded that issue to aab for further consideration.
discussion 
charter contends that the county improperly valued its possessory interests in the unexpired franchises by using a term of possession that exceeded the remaining years of the stated term of each franchise agreement.we disagree.
legal background 
under california constitution,article,section,subdivision a,property is generally to be assessed as a percentage of its fair market value.revenue and taxation code section provides that every assessor shall assess all property subject to general property taxation at its full value.revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a,provides in relevant part that full cash value or fair market value means the amount of cash or its equivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market private uses of public property may be taxed if those uses constitute possessory interests.cal,see also silveira county of alameda th.
revenue and taxation code section,which governs the assessment of cable television possessory interests,provides as follows in relevant part a when valuing possessory interests in real property created by the right to place wires,conduits,and appurtenances along or across public streets,or public easements contained in a cable franchise a cable possessory interest the assessor shall value these possessory interests consistent with the requirements of section at full market value.the methods of valuation shall include,but not be limited to,the comparable sales method,the income method including,but not limited to,capitalizing rent,or the cost method.b the preferred method of valuation of a cable television possessory interest or video service possessory interest by the assessor is capitalizing the annual rent,using an appropriate capitalization rate.for purposes of this section,the annual rent shall be that portion of that franchise fee received that is determined to be payment for the cable possessory interest for the actual remaining term or the reasonably anticipated term of the franchise or the appropriate economic rent 
the term of possession is a significant variable in possessory interest valuation,and the assessor reviews it on each lien,or valuation,date.sbe issue paper r,as of,sbe issue r.as the trial court observed,t he greater the number of years in a term of possession,the greater the present value fewer years result in a lower present value.
acting pursuant to government code section,the sbe has adopted and amended comprehensive rules relating to the valuation of possessory interests.in,it revised those rules and incorporated them into rule.subdivision d of rule provides that t he stated term of possession shall be deemed the reasonably anticipated term of possession unless it is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the public owner and the private possessor have reached a mutual understanding or agreement,whether or not in writing,such that the reasonably anticipated term of possession is shorter or longer than the stated term of possession.if so demonstrated,the term of possession shall be the stated term of possession as modified by the terms of the mutual understanding or agreement.
before the sbe adopted rule,its staff presented a report regarding the language it recommended,including that now found in rule,subdivision d.staff explained that the subdivision d language was predicated upon american airlines,county of los angeles d,which held that in order to depart from the stated term of possession,the assessor must show an understanding or expectation between the possessor and the public owner based on statute,contract,or evidence of real substance that the reasonably anticipated term of possession differs from the stated term of possession.sbe issue r,supra,the sbe staff further explained that the use of the clear and convincing standard for departing from the stated term of possession in the rule was consistent with california civil code standards for demonstrating that a written agreement has been modified.ibid.staff also clarified that the civil code set a higher standard than staff language and that the proposed rule encompasses merely an understanding,as well as an actual agreement such as that contemplated by civil code section.ibid.the sbe adopted the language its staff recommended in rule.
standard of review 
the parties dispute whether this court should employ a de novo or a substantial evidence standard of review in this case.charter views this as a case for de novo review,characterizing the issue as a question of law involving the meaning of rule,and one involving the valuation method used by the county and the aab.the county argues that the issues involve factual determinations that we review under the substantial evidence standard.
where a taxpayer challenges the validity of the valuation method used by an assessor,the trial court must determine as a matter of law whether the challenged method of valuation is arbitrary,in excess of discretion,or in violation of the standards prescribed by law.citation.our review of such a question is de novo.citation.by contrast,where the taxpayer challenges the application of a valid valuation method,the trial court must review the record presented to the board to determine whether the board findings are supported by substantial evidence but may not independently weigh the evidence.citations.this court,too,reviews a challenge to application of a valuation method under the substantial evidence rule.citation.the determination whether a challenge is to method or application is not always easy.freeport mcmoran resource partners county of lake th,freeport mcmoran the trial court applied the substantial evidence standard in reviewing the term of possession issue after concluding that the parties agreed upon the method for determining the reasonably anticipated term of possession pursuant to rule,subdivision d whether clear and convincing evidence supports the decision to use a term of possession that is different from the stated term s of possession in the franchise agreements and that their dispute involved the assessor application of the evidence to that methodology.we conclude that charter challenge to the trial court ruling upholding the aab findings involves mixed questions of law and fact.
substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion that the aab correctly found there was clear and convincing evidence that charter and the local franchising authorities mutually understood that the franchises had indefinite terms 
charter and the county concurred that rule,subdivision d required that the reasonably anticipated term of possession be deemed to be the stated term,unless there was clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed that the term would be shorter or longer than the stated term.we thus apply the substantial evidence standard to review charter claim that there was not such evidence.freeport mcmoran resource partners county of lake,supra,th at.
