louis caiola brought federal securities fraud and state law claims against citibank,new york arising from extensive physical and synthetic investments.the district court denise cote,judge granted citibank motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,finding that caiola lacked standing under rule to allege a violation of section b of the securities exchange act of the act because he was not a purchaser or seller of securities,his synthetic transactions were not securities as defined by the act,and he failed to plead material misrepresentations.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over caiola state law claims.caiola citibank,d.caiola appealed.we find that caiola sufficiently alleged both purchases and sales of securities and material misrepresentations for purposes of rule and therefore reverse and remand.
background 
because the complaint was dismissed under rule b,we accept its factual allegations for purposes of this appeal.see kalnit eichler,cir.the allegations in the complaint are as follows.caiola,an entrepreneur and sophisticated investor,was a major client of citibank private bank,a division of citibank,from the to september.compl.during this relationship,citibank assisted caiola with a wide range of business and personal financial services.id.as a result of these transactions,which involved hundreds of millions of dollars,caiola became one of citibank largest customers.id.
beginning in the,caiola undertook high volume equity trading,entrusting funds to citibank who in turn engaged various outside brokerage firms.id.caiola specialized in the stock of philip morris companies,philip morris and regularly traded hundreds of thousands of shares valued at many millions of dollars.id.to hedge the risks associated with these trades,caiola established option positions corresponding to his stock positions.id.
as caiola trades increased in size,he and citibank grew increasingly concerned about the efficacy of his trading and hedging strategies.caiola positions required margin postings of tens of millions of dollars and were sufficiently large that the risks to him were unacceptable unless hedged.id.but the volume of options necessary to hedge effectively could impact prices and disclose his known as footprints on the market.id.in early,citibank proposed synthetic trading.id.a synthetic transaction is typically a contractual agreement between two counterparties,usually an investor and a bank,that seeks to economically replicate the ownership and physical trading of shares and options.id.the counterparties establish synthetic positions in shares or options,the values of which are pegged to the market prices of the related physical shares or options.id.the aggregate market values of the shares or options that underlie the synthetic trades are referred to as notional values and are treated as loans to the investor.id.as citibank explained to caiola,synthetic trading offers significant advantages to investors who heavily concentrate on large positions of a single stock by reducing the risks associated with trading.id.synthetic trading alleviates the necessity of posting large amounts of margin capital and ensures that positions can be established and unwound quickly.id,f.synthetic trading also offers a solution to the footprint problem by permitting the purchase of large volumes of options in stocks without affecting their price.id.b.
taking citibank advice,caiola began to engage in two types of synthetic transactions focusing on philip morris stock and options equity swaps and options.id.in a typical equity swap,one party caiola makes periodic interest payments on the notional value of a stock position and also payments equal to any decrease in value of the shares upon which the notional value is based.see note,entities,notional principle contracts,and the unrelated business income tax.the other party citibank pays any increase in the value of the shares and any dividends,also based on the same notional value.see id.
for example,if caiola synthetically purchased shares of philip morris at per share,the notional value of that transaction would be.because this notional value would resemble a loan from citibank,caiola would pay interest at a predetermined rate on the.if philip morris stock price fell,caiola would pay citibank.if the stock price rose,citibank would pay caiola.citibank also would pay caiola the value of any dividends that caiola would have received had he actually owned physical shares.
caiola also acquired synthetic options,which were options.compl.because these options were not listed and traded on physical exchanges,their existence and size did not impact market prices.id.a,b.caiola and citibank agreed to terms regarding the various attributes of the option in a particular transaction such as the strike price,expiration date,option type,and premium.they agreed to settle these option transactions in cash when the option was exercised or expired,based on the market price of the underlying security.id.g,a.
caiola and citibank documented their equity swaps and synthetic options through an international swap dealers association master agreement isda agreement dated march.the isda agreement established specific terms for the synthetic trading.id.after entering into the isda agreement,caiola,on citibank advice,began to enter into coupled synthetic transactions with citibank.id.specifically,caiola option positions were established in connection with a paired equity swap,ensuring that his synthetic options would always hedge his equity swaps.this strategy limited the amount he could lose and ensured that his risks would be both controllable and quantifiable.id.
citibank promised caiola that as his counterparty it would control its own risks through a strategy known as delta hedging.id.at.delta hedging makes a derivative position,such as an option position,immune to small changes in the price of an underlying asset,such as a stock,over a short period of time.see john hull,options futures,and other derivatives ed.the delta measures the sensitivity of the price of the derivative to the change in the price of the underlying asset.id.at.specifically,delta is the ratio of the change in the price of the derivative to that of the underlying asset.id.thus,if an option has a delta of,a change in the stock price would result in a change in the option price.caiola synthetic positions contained a number of components,such as a stock position plus one or more option positions.for each of these coupled or integrated transactions a net delta was calculated which helped citibank determine the amount of securities necessary to establish its delta core position.compl.by maintaining a delta core position in the physical market,citibank could achieve delta neutrality,a hedge position that would offset citibank obligations to caiola.id.
effective delta hedging is a sophisticated trading activity that involves the continuous realignment of the hedge portfolio.because the delta changes with movements in the price of the underlying asset,the size of the delta core position also constantly changes.id.although a certain delta core position might sufficiently hedge citibank obligations at one point,a different delta core position may become necessary a short time later.see hull,supra,at.thus,as markets fluctuate,the net delta must be readjusted continuously to ensure an optimal exposure to risk.adam waldman,comment,otc derivatives systemic risk innovative finance or the dance into the abyss.citibank told caiola that as his counterparty it would continuously adjust its delta core positions to maintain delta neutrality.compl.also,caiola routinely altered his transactions to account for their effect on citibank delta core positions.id.this arrangement was satisfactory so long as citibank adhered to its delta hedging strategy,which involved comparably small purchases in the physical market.however,if citibank fully replicated caiola stock and option positions in the physical market instead of delta hedging,the benefits of synthetic trading would disappear and he would be exposed to risks that this strategy was designed to avoid.id.
each synthetic transaction was governed by an individualized confirmation containing a number of disclaimers.id.a confirmation for caiola purchase of options dated december,confirmation,for instance,provides that each party represents to the other that it is not relying on any advice,statements or recommendations whether written or oral of the other party,that each is entering the transaction as principal and not as an agent for the other party,and that caiola acknowledges and agrees that citibank is not acting as a fiduciary or advisor to him in connection with this transaction.confirmation a.further,the isda agreement and accompanying schedule,which governed the overall synthetic relationship,provides 
this agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.isda agreement a.
caiola has such knowledge and experience in financial,business and tax matters that render him capable of evaluating the merits and risks of this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder caiola is able to bear the economic risks of this agreement and the transaction contemplated hereunder and,after appropriate independent investigations,caiola has determined that this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder are suitable for him isda agreement,schedule to the master agreement,part,a ii.
in october,citicorp,citibank parent company,merged with travelers group,travelers.compl.caiola feared that salomon smith barney ssb,a travelers affiliate,might become involved in his account.id.at a november,meeting,citibank informed caiola that ssb would become involved in caiola synthetic equities trading.id.at this meeting,caiola stated that he did not wish to become a client of ssb and that,unless his relationship with citibank were to continue as it had previously existed,he would terminate it.id.citibank assured caiola then and subsequently that their relationship would continue unchanged and,specifically,that his synthetic trading relationship with citibank would remain unaltered by ssb involvement.id.
relying on these assurances,caiola maintained his account at citibank and continued to establish sizeable positions with the understanding that they would be managed synthetically,with citibank continuing to serve as the delta hedging counterparty.id.from january through march,caiola bought and sold more than million options,established a swap position involving two million shares of philip morris stock with a notional value of eighty million dollars,and paid citibank millions of dollars in commissions and interest.id.
however,after november,and contrary to its representations and unknown to caiola,citibank had secretly stopped delta hedging and transformed caiola synthetic portfolio into a physical one by executing massive trades in the physical markets that mirrored caiola synthetic transactions.id.in other words,when caiola sought to open an integrated synthetic position in shares of synthetic stock and synthetic options,citibank,instead of delta hedging,simply executed physical trades on stock and options these transactions,caiola alleges,exposed him to the risks footprints and a lack of synthetic trading was intended to avoid.id.
on march,citibank told caiola that it intended to early exercise certain options in his portfolio for physical settlement,a demand inconsistent with a synthetic relationship.id.one week later citibank for the first time refused to establish a synthetic option position caiola requested.id.growing concerned,on march,caiola inquired and was told that ssb was unwilling to assume the risks associated with synthetic trading.id.during this time period,although caiola had taken a large position in philip morris stock that was declining in value,he wrote options expecting to recoup his losses and to profit from an anticipated rise in the value of the shares.id.the strategy,caiola claims,failed because citibank had secretly and unilaterally terminated synthetic trading.id.this termination cost caiola tens of millions of dollars because the price of philip morris rebounded as he had expected.id.
at this point,caiola investigated and discovered that citibank had ceased treating his investments synthetically as early as november.id.two citibank officers informed caiola that many of his trades had been executed on the physical market,although they had been submitted and accepted by citibank as synthetic transactions.id.the only explanation caiola received was that t his is how ssb wanted it done.id.
caiola unearthed additional evidence that citibank had transformed his portfolio when he attempted to unwind his account in september.id.when caiola placed unwind transactions,citibank refused to execute the trades without a further indication to caiola that what he thought were synthetic positions were being handled by citibank as physical transactions.id.in addition,as citibank executed certain option transactions during this unwind period,citibank sent caiola confirmations reflecting that the transactions were for physical,instead of cash,settlement.id.caiola also was told by a citibank official that it was holding hundreds of thousands of physical shares of philip morris stock in his account and that citibank had executed certain unwind transactions by going to the physical market to sell millions of options and shares.id.finally,when citibank failed to completely unwind a certain swap position,it told caiola that hundreds of thousands of physical which he had no hedge protection and was financially being sold on his behalf.id.
in july,caiola sued citibank alleging violations of section b and rule.he also asserted state law claims for fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract.generally,the complaint alleged that citibank violated section b and rule when it misrepresented that it would continue its synthetic trading relationship but secretly abandoned its role as delta hedging counterparty and,instead,bought and sold stock and options on caiola behalf id.caiola further claims that citibank misrepresentations were material,he relied on them,and,as a result,he experienced massive losses.
citibank moved to dismiss under rule b on the grounds that caiola was neither a purchaser nor a seller of securities,that the synthetic transactions were not securities,and that the confirmations established that neither party was entitled to rely on the representations of the other.see.b.the district court granted citibank motion.caiola citibank,d.
applying agency principles,the district court reasoned that,while caiola did not allege that he purchased securities,he asserts that citibank,acting improperly as his and without his knowledge or consent,replicated his synthetic swaps on the physical market for caiola account.id.at emphasis in original.but,according to the district court,
caiola has not alleged that he consented to have citibank act as his agent in purchasing or selling securities,nor does caiola assert that citibank could reasonably have inferred that it had such authority.rather,caiola asserts that citibank actions had the effect of unilaterally establishing itself as caiola agent.these assertions are insufficient to create an agency relationship.
id.accordingly,the district court concluded that,because citibank was not caiola agent,its own purchases and sales of securities did not make caiola a purchaser or seller of securities.id.at.
the district court next held that caiola was not a purchaser or seller of securities because his synthetic transactions did not constitute securities as defined by section a of the act.see a.relying on procter gamble bankers trust,the court concluded that caiola synthetic transactions were not options on securities since they did not give either counterparty the right to exercise an option or to take possession of any security.caiola,d at quoting procter gamble.at.
the district court also concluded that caiola failed to sufficiently plead material misrepresentations.id.at.apparently resting its analysis on parol evidence principles,the district court determined that the oral misrepresentations alleged by caiola were not actionable because they conflicted with written representations in the isda agreement and the confirmation.
in his complaint,caiola attributes several misrepresentations to citibank that contradict unambiguous language in the isda agreement and the confirmation.caiola asserts that citibank misrepresented in november,that its synthetic trading relationship would not change when,in fact,it intended to begin replicating caiola positions through transactions in physical securities on the physical market.in the confirmation,however,citibank and caiola agreed that they were not relying on any advice,statements or recommendations whether written or oral of the other party regarding the transaction.according to the terms of the isda agreement and the confirmation,citibank was under no obligation to advise caiola about its investment strategy or hedge caiola investments in a particular way.because the oral misrepresentations allegedly made by citibank directly conflict with unambiguous language in the confirmation,the language in the confirmation controls and the misrepresentations alleged in the complaint can be disregarded.
finally,the district court concluded that citibank decision to exercise an option early and its refusal to engage in additional synthetic transactions were not actionable because citibank had the contractual right to take these actions,and the reasoning behind citibank decision to take these actions would not reasonably affect an investor decisionmaking.id.at.accordingly,the district court dismissed the federal securities fraud claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.id.at.caiola appealed.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of the complaint.see grandon merrill lynch,cir.dismissal is proper only if,after accepting all the allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in caiola favor,the complaint fails to allege any set of facts that would entitle him to relief.see chambers time warner,cir.in other words,dismissal under rule b is not warranted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.woodford cmty.action agency of greene county,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
standing under rule 
caiola alleges that citibank committed securities fraud in violation of section b and rule the elements of such a claim are.a plaintiff must allege that in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,the defendant,acting with scienter,made a false material representation or omitted to disclose material information and that plaintiff reliance on defendant conduct caused plaintiff injury.in re time warner.sec,cir alteration in original quoting bloor carro,spanbock,londin,rodman fass,cir accord suez equity investors,bank,cir.citibank argues that the complaint fails to allege two of these elements a purchase or sale of securities and reliance.the district court found the complaint allegations of materiality insufficient,but citibank does not defend this conclusion on appeal.
a.the purchase or sale of securities 
under the first committed in connection with the purchase or sale of any security standing is limited to actual purchasers or sellers of securities.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d gurary winehouse,cir.the district court concluded that caiola was not a purchaser or seller of securities because citibank did not act as his agent in purchasing or selling physical securities and because the synthetic transactions were not securities.caiola,d at.
caiola argues that the complaint alleges that he is a purchaser and seller of securities in two different ways.first,he argues that the district court overlooked the complaint allegations that citibank bought and sold physical stock and options on his behalf.second,he argues that,apart from citibank physical transactions,for which citibank ostensibly held him responsible and which confer standing,both options and equity swaps are covered by the act.
citibank purchases and sales of physical securities 
caiola alleges that beginning in november citibank purchased and sold physical stock and options in his account and on his behalf.according to citibank,it made these purchases and sales on its own behalf in order to hedge its risks on caiola synthetic transactions.the distinction is significant because if the transactions were for caiola account,he has standing.see gurary,at.
the complaint is replete with allegations that citibank purchased and sold securities for caiola in his account 
citibank told caiola that he,not citibank,bore the risk associated with citibank inability to unwind his swap position and therefore caiola held hundreds of thousands of physical shares of philip morris stock compl.d emphasis added.
citibank conduct in executing these transactions unequivocally confirmed that citibank had,from november through march,completely transformed caiola portfolio from a synthetic,into a physical portfolio,acting as his agent and not as a principal,entirely without caiola authorization.id.emphasis added.
citibank expressly told caiola that it held hundreds of thousands of physical shares of philip morris stock in his account.id.emphasis added.
w hen citibank did not completely unwind the entire swap position,it told caiola that the hundreds of thousands of physical shares that it was selling naked were his problem,and these shares were physical shares held on his behalf that he was responsible for without any hedge protection.id.emphasis added.
e ven though caiola synthetic investment strategy was designed so that caiola did not need to account for such risks,these are precisely the risks that citibank imposed on him on september,when caiola was told that hundreds of thousands of philip morris stock sic were being sold on his behalf without any hedge protection whatsoever.id.emphasis added.
admittedly,other allegations in the complaint suggest that citibank bought and sold the physical stock and options as part of its own hedging strategy.for example,caiola alleges that citibank its agents began to buy and sell on the physical exchanges millions of options that were the same options in which caiola had synthetic positions.id.elsewhere,caiola alleges that after ssb became involved in handling caiola transactions after the merger,citibank acted to replicate caiola integrated synthetic positions with real physical stock and options.id.
these ambiguous allegations could mean either that citibank used caiola funds to trade physically,instead of synthetically,or that citibank hedged caiola trades by engaging in physical transactions replicating caiola synthetic ones.the former interpretation incontrovertibly would give rise to standing under rule.see sec.investor prot.vigman,cir holding that when a broker makes an unauthorized purchase or sale of securities with his customer assets,that purchase or sale may be attributed to the customer for purposes of satisfying standing under rule.the latter interpretation is less certain.in any event,rule b obligates us at this point to draw all reasonable inferences in caiola favor.see chambers,at.under this standard,caiola complaint sufficiently alleges that he was a purchaser and seller of securities.we thus need not and do not decide whether rule standing would be satisfied under the second theory.
the district court nonetheless dismissed caiola claims because it concluded that caiola did not allege that citibank had acted as his agent in purchasing and selling physical securities.caiola,d at.specifically,it held that the requisite agency relationship was lacking because caiola has not alleged that he consented to have citibank act as his agent in purchasing or selling securities,nor does caiola assert that citibank could reasonably have inferred that it had such authority.id.at.this conclusion is incorrect,as the complaint adequately alleges that citibank,acting as caiola,bought physical stock on caiola behalf and for his account,albeit without his authorization.compl.
the fact that caiola did not authorize citibank to engage in the physical transactions does not deprive caiola of standing.indeed,it is that claims under rule arise when brokers purchase or sell securities on their clients behalf without specific authorization.for example,a claim for unauthorized trading,which occurs when a broker intentionally places trades without obtaining the customer approval,historically has been under rule,sec.investor prot,at holding that plaintiff adequately pleaded unauthorized trading where broker defendants allegedly made unauthorized transactions in customers accounts as part of a stock market manipulation scheme cruse equitable sec.of,holding that plaintiff sufficiently pleaded,for rule b purposes,unauthorized trading arising from broker purchases and sales for plaintiff account,but dismissing claims under federal rule of civil procedure b for insufficient particularity jaksich thomson mckinnon,finding section b and rule violations where defendant broker purchased and sold stock without plaintiff customer authorization.by definition,a broker who is liable for making unauthorized trades makes them without the customer authorization.churning claims,which depend on a broker liability for excessive trading,also have been recognized under rule.see saxe hutton,cir churning occurs when an account has been excessively traded to generate commissions in contravention to the investor expressed investment goals.see also armstrong mcalpin,cir nilsen.
as with unauthorized trading or churning claims,the key fact is that caiola has alleged that the purchases were made on his behalf,not that they were specifically authorized.because we may reasonably infer from the complaint that citibank purchased physical shares and options with caiola funds and on his behalf,caiola has sufficiently alleged the purchase or sale of securities.
synthetic transactions as securities 
the district court also distinguishing between options and caiola failed to allege the purchase or sale of a security because his synthetic transactions were not securities.the district court analyzed caiola options in light of the conventional understanding that a n option contract entitles a purchaser to buy or sell a commodity by some specific date at a fixed price known as the strike price caiola,d at quoting united states bein,cir.the district court believed that no court previously had considered whether the types of transactions at issue in this case constitute securities,although in procter gamble,the court held that certain interest rate swap contracts were not securities.id.at.the court concluded that for many of the same reasons offered in procter and gamble,the transactions at issue were not securities.id.in particular,the district court held that caiola synthetic transactions did not fit the definition of securities in section a of the act because they were not investment contracts,notes,or evidence of indebtedness.id.at.the court also held that the synthetic transactions were not options on securities as defined by that section because,drawing on procter gamble,they did not give either counterparty the right to exercise an option or to take possession of any security.id.at quoting procter gamble.at.
caiola synthetic transactions,however,involved two distinct instruments options and equity swaps.the two must be analyzed separately.we conclude that caiola synthetic options are securities subject to section b.caiola does not argue on appeal that his equity swaps met the definition of a security under section a at the time of his trades,but instead urges us to apply retroactively the commodities futures modernization act of cfma,stat.because caiola did not adequately raise this issue before the district court,we decline to consider it on appeal.
the provisions of the federal securities laws cover options on securities.section a of the act defines security to include any put,call,straddle,option,or privilege on any security,certificate of deposit,or group or index of securities including any interest therein or based on the value thereof a.citibank contends that this definition of security does not include all options without limitation.citibank argues that only an option on a security would be covered,not an option based on the value of a security.in other words,according to citibank,an option that involves the right to take possession of a security fits the statutory definition but a synthetic option that merely obligates the counterparty to make cash payments based on the value of a security does not.the district court agreed with this analysis.caiola,d at.caiola,on the other hand,alleges that his synthetic options were simply options on philip morris stock and therefore are securities.we agree that these instruments are securities under section a for a number of reasons.
the confirmation,on which citibank relies for its argument that caiola options are not securities,indicates that the transactions are commonly used options.the confirmation expressly states that the particular transaction to which this confirmation relates is an option and the type of transaction is an equity option on the common stock of philip morris options have been covered under section b since the act was amended in.securities exchange act of amendments of,stat.the parties dispute whether options on the value of a security are covered by section b.we hold that they are.
the supreme court has cautioned that i n searching for the meaning and scope of the word security the emphasis should be on economic reality.united hous.found.forman,d quoting tcherepnin knight,d.the definition of security is construed in a flexible manner,so as to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.sec howey.in this way,the economic reality approach permit s the sec and the courts sufficient flexibility to ensure that those who market investments are not able to escape the coverage of the securities acts by creating new instruments that would not be covered by a more determinate definition.reves ernst young,d.
under section a security includes i an option on any security,ii an option on any certificate of deposit,and iii an option on any group or index of securities.therefore,option under section a is not limited to conventional options.it applies to both as well as options and does not distinguish between and options nor does the definition distinguish between options documented as swaps as opposed to options documented in some other fashion.
we find further support for our conclusion in section a definition of security to include an option on any group or index of securities.an option on a security can be physically settled by delivery of physical stock.an index of securities,however,is simply a benchmark against which financial performance is measured.an option on an index of securities is settled by cash since physical delivery is not possible.see louis loss joel seligman,securities regulation ed.consequently,the right to take possession does not define an option under section a,which covers options that can be physically delivered as well as those that can not.
both the district court and citibank rely heavily on procter gamble for their conclusion that options are not securities.procter gamble,however,held that a very different type of linked to the price of treasury not securities.the plaintiff in procter gamble argued that even though the instrument in question was technically an interest rate swap,it had features and thus could be characterized as an option on a security under section a.procter gamble.at.the court,however,rejected this argument because the swap did not give either counterparty the right to exercise an option or to take possession of any security.id.at.the district court imported this language from procter gamble,finding it dispositive.caiola,d at quoting procter gamble.at.unlike the plaintiff argument in procter gamble that an interest rate swap with features could be characterized as an option on a security,caiola transactions involve the much more straightforward question of whether a option on philip morris to options commonly traded on the an option on a security.procter gamble does not address this issue 
further,procter gamble concluded that a critical feature of an option was the right to exercise and to take possession of the security because the parenthetical based on the value thereof in section a applied only to the immediately preceding phrase,group or index of securities and not to any security.procter gamble.at.we believe this conclusion is incorrect,and we decline to follow its lead.we hold that the parenthetical applies to any security.the text of the statute itself includes options by defining option to include an option on a group or index of securities.this provision is sufficiently clear that a resort to legislative history is not necessary see lee bankers trust,cir.a contrary reading would mean that the statute illogically both includes and excludes options in the same sentence.in other words,there is no basis for reading into the term option as used in the phrase option on any security a limitation requiring a particular method of limitation that clearly does not apply to option as used in the phrase option on any index of securities.the procter gamble court application of the parenthetical also produced the odd consequence that rule would cover options based on the value of two securities but not options based on the value of single security.we do not agree with this interpretation and,accordingly,we hold that there is no textual basis for reading section a to define option as including only transactions that give the holder the right to receive the underlying securities.
thus,section a broad definition of security to include an option on any security as well as an option on any group or index of securities permits no distinction between options and those that are settled by physical delivery.accordingly,caiola options are securities under section a.
equity swaps 
caiola does not argue that,at the time of his trades,his equity swaps were covered by section b,but urges us to apply retroactively the cfma amendments to section b.in december,congress enacted the cfma to,among other things,clarify the status of swap agreements under the securities laws.cfma,stat.at.sections and of the cmfa define swap agreements and then expressly exclude them from the definition of securities,but amend section b to reach swap agreements.id,stat.at.had caiola entered into his synthetic stock transactions after the enactment of the cfma,they clearly would now be covered under rule.to prevail on a retroactivity argument,caiola faces a substantial burden.elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.landgraf usi film,d see hughes aircraft united states,d w e apply this presumption against retroactive legislation unless congress has clearly manifested its intent to the contrary.
we find it unnecessary to resolve whether caiola has overcome this hurdle because he failed to raise the issue properly in the district court and we generally do not consider arguments not raised below.first city,rafidain bank,cir pulvers first unum life ins,cir readco,marine midland bank,cir stating that the general rule of not considering matters not raised before the district court may be disregarded in two circumstances where consideration of the issue is necessary to avoid manifest injustice or where the issue is purely legal and there is no need for additional.
the district court ordered the parties to brief the impact of the cfma on whether the transactions at issue in this case constitute securities under federal law.the order provided caiola with the opportunity to argue retroactivity,but his response was insufficient to preserve the issue for appellate review.although,in a footnote,caiola mentions settled expectations and cites cases applying statutes to conduct,he never discusses retroactivity consequently,we conclude that the issue was not properly raised below and,because there is no manifest injustice in our declining to hear this argument in the first instance here,we choose not to consider it.united states restrepo,cir refusing to consider argument raised only in an appellate brief footnote because w e do not consider an argument mentioned only in a footnote to be adequately raised or preserved for appellate review.
material misrepresentations 
as an alternative ground for dismissal,the district court concluded that caiola failed to allege material misrepresentations,a conclusion citibank does not defend on appeal.to reach this holding,the district court focused on the terms of the isda agreement and language from the confirmation providing that neither party was relying on any advice,statements or recommendations whether written or oral of the other party regarding such transaction,other than the written representations expressly made by that other party in the isda agreement and in this confirmation in respect of such transaction.confirmation a i.
the district court concluded that these terms meant that citibank was under no obligation to disclose its investment or hedging strategy to caiola and b ecause the oral misrepresentations allegedly made by citibank directly conflict with unambiguous language in the confirmation,the language in the confirmation controls and the misrepresentations alleged in the complaint can be disregarded.caiola,d at.the district court conclusion that the confirmation disclaimers precluded a finding of materiality was incorrect because materiality is an objective standard.the disclaimers are relevant to the analytically distinct element of reliance under rule,discussed below.
the district court also rejected caiola allegation that citibank misrepresented the reasoning behind its decision to early exercise certain options and to refuse to engage in additional synthetic transactions,because it believed citibank had the contractual right to take these actions and the reasoning behind citibank decision to take these actions would not reasonably affect an investor decisionmaking.id.at.the applicable materiality standard under section b and rule is set forth in basic levinson,d.t o fulfill the materiality requirement there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at.quoting tsc,northway,d.at the pleading stage,a plaintiff satisfies the materiality requirement of rule by alleging a statement or omission that a reasonable investor would have considered significant in making investment decisions.ganino citizens utils,cir.
caiola complaint,we conclude,easily satisfies basic test for materiality.caiola alleges that citibank falsely told him that their trading relationship would not change subsequent to the travelers merger,and that had he known that the relationship would change,he would have closed his account.compl.indeed,caiola alleges that citibank knew this information was material,since a citibank representative informed him that he understood that citibank conduct was totally inconsistent with caiola hedging investment strategy and that he understood that if caiola had known the truth he would have run like a rabbit from citibank.id.moreover,the complaint alleges 
citibank thereby exposed caiola to precisely the risks that citibank advised he could and should avoid through the use of synthetic trading,including risks associated with the footprint such large transactions have in the physical market and the risk that such large positions could not be closed or unwound by caiola on demand without exposing caiola to potentially catastrophic risk.id.
caiola continued willingness to enter into such transactions was,start to finish,dependent on his reasonable expectation,based on express representations from citibank,that he would be able to continue his hedging investment strategy on an ongoing basis with citibank and would therefore be able to manage the positions he held in order to keep risks at acceptable level
