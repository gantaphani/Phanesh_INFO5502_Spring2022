this diversity case requires us to apply texas law to three issues arising from claims that an employee secretly owned a company that competed and contracted with his employer the existence and scope of a fiduciary duty between an agent and a principal,the propriety of the equitable remedy of forfeiture for breach of a fiduciary duty,and the operation of the statute of frauds with respect to employment contract extensions.
since the employee in this case owed a fiduciary duty to disclose his interest in a company doing business with his employer,the district court erred in dismissing the employer claim for breach of a fiduciary duty.we remand for determination of damages on the claim.we also remand the forfeiture issue for further consideration in light of our holding on the fiduciary duty claim.we affirm the district court evaluation of the statute of frauds.
factual background 
intermediate,and industrial companies,collectively,jvic are companies which build,refurbish,expand and manage assets for industrial process plants worldwide.jvic hired clayton rash to start and manage a tulsa,oklahoma division of its industrial plant maintenance business,inspecting,repairing,and maintaining oil refineries and power plants.the parties signed an employment agreement providing rash a base salary of,a bonus of of net profits,and a termination bonus of of the division equity.the contract stipulated the use of texas law and required that rash devote his full work time and efforts to jvic.the agreement was to last for two years,from to.rash continued to serve as manager of the tulsa branch until,without any written contract extension.
starting in,jvic claims that rash actively participated in and owned at least four other businesses,none of which were ever disclosed to jvic.one of those businesses was total industrial plant services,tips,a scaffolding business.tips bid on projects for,and,with rash as its manager,often selected tips as a subcontractor.at some point during rash tenure,jvic started its own scaffolding business between to,jvic paid over million to tips.the tulsa division never used jvic scaffolding services.
rash resigned from jvic in july.
ii.procedural history 
rash subsequently sued jvic for breach of contract and fraud.he claimed the company purposely understated the net profits and equity of the tulsa branch and therefore did not properly pay him the net profit and equity bonuses.as affirmative defenses and counterclaims,jvic claimed that rash materially breached his employment agreement,breached his duty of loyalty,and breached his fiduciary duty.
prior to trial,jvic filed a summary judgment motion seeking a finding that the statute of frauds barred enforcement of the employment contract.jvic contends that rash could not recover unpaid bonuses earned after the expiration of the initial term because the employment contract was not renewed in writing.the district court found for rash,holding the statute of frauds did not apply.
at trial,the district court submitted various instructions to the jury relating to rash contract claims.in addition,the court granted rash rule motion for a judgment as a matter of law on jvic counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty.see.the jury was therefore only instructed on one of jvic breach of the duty of loyalty.rash requested a damages award of for his breach of contract claim and the jury granted him.jvic sought in damages for its breach of the duty of loyalty claim and received from the jury.
after the jury verdict,jvic filed a motion for a new trial,fed civ.a,renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on the fiduciary duty claim,id.b,motion for the equitable relief of fee forfeiture due to rash duty of loyalty violation,motion to alter or amend the judgment,id.e,and motion to vacate the verdict,id.b.the district court denied all jvic motions.
jvic timely filed a notice of appeal.

fiduciary duty 
jvic argues that the district court erred in granting rash rule motion seeking judgment as a matter of law on jvic breach of fiduciary duty counterclaim at the close of evidence.we agree.not only do we find that rash agency relationship with jvic created a fiduciary obligation,but that the undisputed evidence also showed that rash breached his fiduciary duty.
is there a fiduciary relationship 
to recover for breach of fiduciary duty,the evidence must prove the existence of a fiduciary duty,breach of the duty,causation,and damages.abetter trucking arizpe.fiduciary duties are imposed by courts on some business relationships because of the special trust between the parties.johnson brewer pritchard.yet,texas courts have deemed it impossible to give a definition of the term that is comprehensive enough to cover all cases.id.at.g enerally speaking,it applies to any person who occupies a position of peculiar confidence towards another.id.this broad definition includes relationships of integrity and fidelity and contemplates fair dealing and good faith rather than legal obligation,as the basis of the transaction.id.nevertheless,texas courts also warn that it is well settled that not every relationship involving a high degree of trust and confidence rises to the stature of a fiduciary relationship.schlumberger tech.swanson.
under texas law,fiduciary relationships can arise from both formal and informal relationships.an informal fiduciary relationship may flow from a moral,social,domestic or purely personal relationship of trust and confidence.associated indem.cat contracting.i n order to give full force to contracts,texas courts do not create such a informal fiduciary relationship lightly.schlumberger tech,at.to impose an informal fiduciary duty in a business transaction,the special relationship of trust and confidence must exist prior to,and apart from,the agreement made the basis of the suit.associated indem,at.
texas courts also recognize that certain relationships constitute formal fiduciary relationships as a matter of law.examples of these fiduciary relationships are trustee to beneficiary,executor to beneficiary of estates,attorney to client,and partner to partner.johnson,at.under texas common law,the agent to principal relationship also gives rise to a fiduciary duty.id.
with respect to the agent to principal relationship,the texas supreme court has adopted relevant provisions of the restatement second of agency.see id.in particular,provides u nless otherwise agreed,an agent is subject to a duty to his principal to act solely for the benefit of the principal in all matters connected with his agency.restatement second of agency.the agreement to act on behalf of the principal,moreover,causes the agent to be a fiduciary,that is,a person having a duty,created by his undertaking,to act primarily for the benefit of another in matters connected with his undertaking.id,cmt.
accordingly,under texas law a fiduciary relationship may exist between rash and jvic in two circumstances,if the evidence established that rash was an agent of jvic,or a prior special relationship of trust and confidence exists between the two.
the district court determined as a matter of law that no fiduciary duty existed between rash and jvic,relying heavily on meyer cathey.in meyer,the texas supreme court found no fiduciary duty based on a mere business arrangement with no preexisting special relationship of trust and confidence.id.at.meyer hired cathey to work on various real estate development projects.a lower court found a fiduciary relationship existed between the two where the two worked on past projects together for three years,cathey had a minor ownership interest in one of meyer past projects,meyer was in charge of all aspects of his projects and made all final decisions including controlling the financing and books,while cathey trusted him to treat him fairly and keep accurate financial records,and they were friends.id.at.
the texas supreme court reversed the decision,holding that reliance on the two prior projects was misplaced because they were transactions entered into for the parties mutual benefit,cathey subjective trust in meyer does not establish a fiduciary relationship,and the fact of their friendship was irrelevant.id.at.based on meyer,the district court held that no special relationship of trust and confidence existed between rash and jvic and dismissed the breach of fiduciary duty claim.
the district court erred in concluding that meyer was controlling over this case.meyer is limited in scope to analysis of informal fiduciary relationships based on a moral,social,domestic or purely personal relationship of trust and confidence.id.at.meyer contemplated a situation involving an arm length relationship between real estate business associates,id.at,and not between employee to employer or principal to agent.
meyer,in short,does not apply to fiduciary duties based on formal relationship such as agency.thus,meyer is not on point where a party,as is the case here,alleges a fiduciary duty arises from a principal to agent relationship.
first,several texas cases provide strong support for jvic claim that rash was its agent.in daniel falcon interest realty,a texas appellate court found an agency relationship and thus a fiduciary duty under a similar set of facts.in daniel,the employee was hired to serve as a project manager and superintendent for the project and was responsible for soliciting bids,setting the scope of work for each subcontractor,reviewing the bids,letting the contracts,and overseeing people working on the project.in addition,the texas supreme court has found fiduciary relationships in the employment context in two other cases,johnson,at law firm employee kinzbach tool,oil company employee.
rash duties to jvic follow the facts of these cases.rash was hired to build the tulsa division of jvic from scratch and had sole management responsibilities for operations at the branch.in rash own words,i did the sales,the operations,and everything out of the tulsa division.aplts.app.vol.iv at.he was charged with finding facilities to operate the business,hiring and training employees,gathering tools and equipment for the branch,and promoting the new venture.rash solicited and received bids for subcontracts and directly received the invoices for those bids.he set the rates charged to jvic customers for work performed by the tulsa division and kept track of all the costs of the division.in general,rash conceded that he ran the shop and was responsible for generating business for the tulsa upstart.id.at 
second,rash contractually agreed to perform the duties of an agent.under texas law,an agent is defined as a person having a duty,created by his undertaking,to act primarily for the benefit of another in matters connected with his undertaking.daniel,at.in his contract,rash consented to devote his full work time and efforts to the business and affairs of joint venture piping.
third,rash does not deny that he was an agent of jvic.instead,he only claims that the scope of his agency did not include ventures.
under these facts,an agency relationship exists between rash and jvic.rash was hired to introduce the jvic brand in a new market with little direct oversight.for all purposes,he represented jvic in the oklahoma region.as the senior manager in the area,he agreed to and was expected to act primarily for the benefit of jvic.
accordingly,we conclude under the uncontroverted evidence that rash was an agent of jvic and thus owed jvic a fiduciary duty as a matter of law.see meyer,at where the underlying facts are undisputed,determination of the existence,and breach,of fiduciary duties are questions of law,exclusively within the province of the court.
did rash breach his fiduciary duty 
whether rash breached his fiduciary duty to jvic turns on the scope of that duty.in johnson,the texas supreme court cautioned courts to be careful in defining the scope of the fiduciary obligations an employee owes when acting as the employer agent in the pursuit of business opportunities.at.courts instead inquire whether a fiduciary duty exists with respect to the particular occurrence or transaction at issue.id.at.after careful consideration of the question,we are confident that texas courts would agree on this record that rash violated his fiduciary duty in failing to disclose his interest in tips to jvic.
texas law recognizes several basic duties a fiduciary owes the principal 
among the agent fiduciary duties to the principal is the duty to account for profits arising out of the employment,the duty not to act as,or on account of,an adverse party without the principal consent,the duty not to compete with the principal on his own account or for another in matters relating to the subject matter of the agency,and the duty to deal fairly with the principal in all transactions between them.
id.at citing restatement second of agency,cmt.a additionally and most importantly for this appeal,the employee has a duty to deal openly with the employer and to fully disclose to the employer information about matters affecting the company business.abetter trucking,at.although an employee does not owe an absolute duty of loyalty to his or her employer,johnson,at acknowledging the right of employees to make preparations for a future competing business venture while still employed,at the very least,an employee independent enterprise can not compete or contract with the employer without the employer full knowledge.
here,rash presents two defenses as a manager of jvic general industrial plant maintenance work,he owed no specific duty to jvic relatively minor scaffolding business,and jvic president,joe vardell,told him that he had no problem with rash forming a business which might contract with jvic.yet,these defenses,even if true,misapprehend the nature of his fiduciary duty as discussed above,rash had a duty to deal fairly with the principal in all transactions between them,id.at emphasis added,and to fully disclose to the employer information about matters affecting the company business,abetter trucking,at emphasis added.
in other words,rash had a general duty of full disclosure respecting matters affecting the principal interests and a general prohibition against the fiduciary using the relationship to benefit his personal interest,except with the full knowledge and consent of the principal.united teachers ass ins.mackeen bailey,cir.even assuming that rash had no responsibilities to jvic regarding the scaffolding division or that vardell gave him hypothetical permission to engage in other businesses,by failing to inform jvic specifically of his ownership stake in tips,he violated his fiduciary duty.
the duty of an agent is to disclose to the principal what the principal should rightly know.the facts are uncontroverted that rash possessed a significant ownership stake in tips,tips bid for subcontracts with,rash played an instrumental role in selecting subcontractors,tips was selected as a subcontractor on several occasions,and rash never disclosed to jvic or its president,vardell,his relationship with tips.in fact,vardell testified that he only learned about rash ownership of tips through this litigation.in our estimation,this amounts to a breach of his fiduciary duty as a matter of law.kinzbach tool,at holding that a salesman violated his fiduciary duty as a matter of law when he withheld the fact that he received a secret commission from a in negotiating a deal for his employer.
this would be a different case altogether if rash simply notified vardell or jvic about his relationship with tips.since he did not,jvic was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its breach of fiduciary claim against rash.
is the error harmless 
rash asserts that the district court failure to submit the breach of fiduciary duty claim to the jury is harmless error.his theory is that since the jury awarded jvic damages on the analytically similar breach of the duty of loyalty claim,it would not have acted differently on the fiduciary duty claim.we disagree.since the jury awarded jvic only of the it sought in damages under the duty of loyalty claim,we can not say if it might have awarded a higher damage amount under a breach of fiduciary duty theory.
with regards to the duty of loyalty claim,the jury was instructed that an employee has a duty not to compete with his employer,without the consent of the employer,prior to leaving his employment.jury instruction,aplts.app.vol.iv,at.this duty is in addition to the duties the parties undertook in the employment contract.id.jvic had the burden of establishing the breach of the duty of loyalty.id.the instruction was based on the common law duty not to compete with one employer as found in baty protech ins.agency.
yet,the fiduciary relationship establishes a distinct and separate obligation than the duty of loyalty to an employer described above.the fiduciary duty exists because of the peculiar trust between the and his.see johnson,at.thus,the bonds created by a fiduciary relationship are stronger and the obligations are correspondingly more rigorous than those ascribed to the duty of loyalty.for instance,under texas law,jvic would have been entitled to the following instruction 
as jvic agent,clayton rash owed jvic a fiduciary duty.to prove he complied with his duty,clayton rash must show 
the transaction s in question fair and equitable to jvic 
clayton rash made reasonable use of the confidence that jvic placed in him 
clayton rash acted in the utmost good faith and exercised the most scrupulous honesty toward jvic 
clayton rash placed the interests of jvic before his own,did not use the advantage of his position to gain any benefit for himself at the expense of jvic,and did not place himself in any position where his might conflict with his obligations as a fiduciary and 
clayton rash fully and fairly disclosed all important information to jvic concerning the transaction s.
state bar of texas,texas pattern jury,consumer,insurance employment pjc ed.
a jury could draw several conclusions from this instruction.first,rash fiduciary duty to jvic may be considered more than his duty not to compete.accordingly,a jury could have believed that rash actions were a more egregious violation under a fiduciary theory than under a loyalty theory.second,the jury charge shifts the burden of proof from jvic to rash.a jury could have thought that jvic proof of rash violation of his fiduciary duty was much stronger than rash showing that he complied with that duty.
since we can not say for certain that a breach of fiduciary duty would not lead to a greater damage award,we can not hold the error was harmless.accordingly,we remand this question to the district court to determine the amount of damages rash owes jvic for the breach of his fiduciary duty.
we close with one final note.at trial,jvic argued that the breach of fiduciary duty claim was an alternative,and not a supplement,to the duty of loyalty claim and that there is only one damage award.because of jvic position,a jury determination on the damages for breach of fiduciary duty must be offset by the award for the breach of the duty of loyalty.aplts.app.vol.v at.jvic is only entitled to collect up to.
fee forfeiture 
jvic also argues that the breach of a fiduciary duty is a defense to rash breach of contract claim and,under texas law,requires that rash forfeit any compensation he is entitled to receive from jvic.
jvic claims at trial that it was entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of the breach of fiduciary duty,and the district court should have applied the equitable remedy of forfeiture to rash breach of contract claim.since we hold that rash was a fiduciary,jvic was entitled to a fee forfeiture analysis.
the nature of fee forfeiture 
fee forfeiture is a proper equitable remedy in response to a breach of contract claim.in burrow arce,the texas supreme court describes forfeiture as a defense of an agent claim for compensation.forfeiture is based on the concept that a n agent is entitled to no compensation for a service which constitutes a violation of his duties of obedience.id.citing restatement second of agency.i f such conduct constitutes a wilful and deliberate breach of his contract of service,he is not entitled to compensation even for properly performed services for which no compensation is apportioned.id.at.
forfeiture is based on two propositions the principal is considered not to have received what he bargained for if the agent breaches his fiduciary duties while representing the principal,id.at,and fee forfeiture is designed to discourage agents from being disloyal to their principal or to protect relationships of trust by discouraging agents disloyalty,id.at.the remedy of forfeiture applies generally in agency relationships.id.at see also lee lee,arce applies to any breach of fiduciary duty case where the plaintiff pleads the equitable remedy of fee forfeiture.
forfeiture only applies to clear and serious violations of fiduciary duty.burrow,at.the burrow court surveyed the factors for determining when forfeiture is appropriate across several fields.id.at.in summary,relevant considerations include the gravity and timing of the violation,its wilfulness,its effect on the value of the agent work for the client,any other threatened or actual harm to the client,and the adequacy of other remedies.id.at.the burrow court also makes clear that this remedy is to be determined by the court,not the jury.id.at the ultimate decision on the amount of any fee forfeiture must be made by the court.
application of fee forfeiture 
the district court here did not engage in any of the foregoing analysis as it concluded that rash was not a fiduciary of jvic under texas law.see dist.order,june,at since defendants did not establish the existence of a fiduciary relationship,they are not entitled to the equitable relief of forfeiture which may flow from a breach of that relationship.
rash nonetheless makes several arguments on appeal that fee forfeiture is unwarranted here.first,he argues any error that the district court made in finding no fiduciary relationship was harmless because the jury found rash breached the duty of loyalty.this is unpersuasive.as we discussed above,rash abused his agency relationship with jvic,and it is entitled under texas law to consideration of its forfeiture theory 
second,rash claims that jvic failed to properly plead forfeiture,thereby precluding it as a remedy.this argument was presented to the district court,which found it properly pleaded and made a substantive ruling.see lee,at holding that raising forfeiture in the trial court suffices to properly plead forfeiture.
finally,rash contends that forfeiture is not an available remedy since jvic sought actual damages and was adequately compensated.burrow specifically forecloses this line of reasoning.the factor does not preclude forfeiture when a client can be fully compensated by damages.even though the main purpose of the remedy is not to compensate the client,if other remedies do not afford the client full compensation for his damages,forfeiture may be considered for that purpose.burrow,at.the court also suggests that forfeiture may take on a punitive nature.id.at forfeiture may have a punitive effect,but that is not the focus of the remedy.nevertheless,we do agree that the adequacy of jvic other remedies is a significant equitable factor in the fee forfeiture analysis.
jvic urges this court to administer complete forfeiture without remand b
