this is an appeal from a final judgment entered by the court of chancery.the,george orloff,filed a complaint pursuant to section of title of the delaware code section seeking inspection of the books and records of weinstein enterprises,weinstein and the production of certain documents in the possession of mays,a publicly held new york corporation mays of which weinstein is a stockholder.
the court of chancery found that mays is a subsidiary of weinstein for purposes of section a.weinstein was ordered to attempt to produce a broad range of documents in the possession of mays.weinstein advised mays of that order.a special committee of the mays board determined that production of the requested documents was not in mays interest.the court of chancery then issued an order compelling the production of the mays documents by weinstein.
in this appeal,weinstein contends that the court of chancery misconstrued the amendment to ann.tit,relating to the rights of a stockholder of a delaware corporation to inspect the books and records of a subsidiary of that delaware corporation.we have concluded that weinstein position is correct.accordingly,the judgment of the court of chancery must be reversed.
the court of chancery correctly held that mays was a subsidiary of weinstein for purposes of section a,because the record reflects that weinstein was the controlling stockholder of mays.therefore,orloff was entitled to inspect mays documents that were in weinstein actual possession pursuant to section b but,because weinstein could not exercise the actual control over mays that section b b requires for weinstein to produce the documents in the subsidiary possession and control,orloff was not entitled to inspect that latter category of documents.
weinstein is a delaware corporation engaged in the business of acquiring and holding rental properties for value.weinstein owns properties,most of which are located in and around new york city.outside new york city,weinstein also owns an industrial property in west virginia,a office building in kansas city and a golf course property on long island.
in addition to its real property and its portfolio of other securities and cash,weinstein owns of the outstanding shares of mays,mays,a publicly held new york corporation.proprietary information relating to real property owned by the focus of this appeal.
weinstein was founded in by joe weinstein,who also founded and operated mays,and who contributed various parcels of real property to weinstein enterprises.upon joe weinstein death in,joe weinstein,max shulman,became ceo of both mays and weinstein.in the early,max shulman son,lloyd shulman,took over the leadership of both companies.
ownership of weinstein 
until recently,weinstein had continuously been a business.for many years,approximately of the shares of weinstein have been owned by lloyd shulman and his immediate family,and for over seven years,lloyd shulman has been president and ceo of weinstein.
at the time this action was filed,slightly less than of weinstein outstanding shares were held by plaintiff george orloff and his immediate family.the orloffs are cousins of the shulmans.the remaining approximately of the outstanding shares are held in various trusts.while this section proceeding was pending,however,orloff and his family sold just over of their weinstein shares to jw acquisition,llc jwa a competitor of mays and retaining less than.
relationship 
lloyd shulman is the grandson of joe weinstein,the founder of both weinstein and mays.george orloff is joe weinstein and shulman cousin.the conflict between the orloffs and the shulmans dates to,when george orloff grandmother unsuccessfully contested joe weinstein will.the shares of weinstein currently owned by the shulmans and the orloffs devolved upon them through bequests rather than by acquisition.
mays business 
mays is a new york public corporation.it does no business in delaware.founded in and incorporated in,mays was originally in the business of owning and operating a chain of department stores with headquarters in brooklyn,new york.by the early,mays,like many similar department store chains,was no longer competitive.in,mays was reorganized pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.it emerged from bankruptcy as a real estate company,leasing the ground floors of many of the former mays stores for retail operations and,in some cases,renting the upper floors for office space or other commercial use.mays is now engaged in the business of owning and managing those real estate properties.
mays and weinstein relationship 
mays is a public corporation whose financial statements are not consolidated with weinstein.weinstein owns of mays shares,and the shulman family members and a foundation controlled by the shulman family own an additional.approximately of the stock of mays is traded in the nasdaq small cap market.weinstein has historically maintained and increased its interest in mays.
two of mays directors are officers of weinstein,but mays has independent directors as well.the court of chancery made no finding that mays outside directors are either dominated or controlled by weinstein or the shulmans.lloyd shulman is ceo,president and chief operating officer of mays and is also ceo of weinstein.shulman mother,sylvia,is a director of both weinstein and mays.ward lyke,is mays vice information systems and is also a bookkeeper for weinstein.salvatore cappuzzo is weinstein secretary and treasurer,and also serves without compensation as mays secretary.mays and weinstein retain the same outside accounting firm.two of mays seven directors are also weinstein directors.lance myers,a mays director,serves as an attorney for both mays and weinstein.another mays director,dean ryder,is president of a bank located near weinstein headquarters and in which weinstein is a significant depositor 
mays document production 
while this action was pending in the court of chancery,the parties agreed to the production of documents in the possession of both weinstein and weinstein operating subsidiaries.there was only one issue before the court of chancery was orloff entitled to mays documents that were in the possession and control of mays orloff represented to the court of chancery that his purpose for seeking inspection of those mays documents was to value his shares in weinstein and to be able to provide due diligence material to a prospective purchaser of those shares.orloff also represented that he and members of his immediate family had now entered into an agreement to sell approximately of their shares to a third party,jw acquisition,llc jwa,subject to due diligence and that orloff needed the mays documents to help jwa understand the value of mays real estate assets in connection with its due diligence regarding its purchase of orloff shares in weinstein.
in response,weinstein took the position that absent consent of the mays board,it has no ability to cause the production of documents by mays.according to weinstein,mays is a public company with an independent board of directors and it was for the mays board to determine whether mays documents may be inspected by orloff.in short,weinstein argued,it does not exercise control of the affairs of mays in any practical or realistic sense,and consequently,mays can not be a subsidiary of weinstein under section a.
the court of chancery ruled that orloff was entitled to inspect mays detailed records for the purpose of valuing his weinstein shares for sale to a third party.the court of chancery ordered weinstein to cause mays to produce the documents that orloff had requested 
so,the necessary finding is that weinstein enterprises exercises control over the affairs of mays directly or indirectly 
i ssuing an order under this section directed to weinstein enterprises requiring it to produce documents from mays could present some awkward issues for weinstein enterprises,but i satisfied that either the powers of this court of chancery to issue process for the purpose of influencing its judgments,or,if necessary,rights that weinstein enterprises possesses under new york law to seek books and records from mays is sufficient would be sufficient to secure compliance with an order under this section.
in denying weinstein motion for reargument,the court of chancery stated 
if anything,further examination of the statute on further reflection leads me to believe that while the act is not perfectly drafted,it quite plainly contemplated situations in which a subsidiary at issue would be a less than a wholly owned subsidiary and also a subsidiary that would be regarded in the law as merely an alter ego of the parent.
while i fully understand that it raises all kinds of complications and introduces into actions issues that perhaps we are not used to addressing,i believe that was the intention of the general assembly when it amended the statute.that may prove to be unworkable.
i am quite clear that the statute was intended to confer on this court the power to enter an order that requires the production of mays documents.now,i say that recognizing that as a practical matter weinstein may not be able to cause mays to produce the documents without taking extraordinary steps.although weinstein may not be able to,i think the court has the power to do so by issuing another process.
weinstein notified mays of the court of chancery ruling.
mays board responds 
mays,which was not a party to the section action,was advised of the court of chancery ruling.in response to that advice,the mays board of directors formed a special committee consisting of four outside directors of mays and delegated to that committee the responsibility for determining what action,if any,mays should take.the special committee,advised by outside counsel,determined that the disclosure of proprietary,confidential information of mays,that was not otherwise available to its public stockholders,would place mays at a substantial competitive disadvantage and would be contrary to the best interests of mays and its shareholders.the special committee,through counsel,advised weinstein of its determination by letter dated june,
stay granted pending appeal 
weinstein filed a motion to stay pending appeal.the court of chancery granted weinstein motion to stay,noting that mays is a separate legal entity with minority shareholders and that the fiduciary duties of the mays directors do not run directly to weinstein and weinstein does not have the unfettered power to tell the mays board of directors what to do.
section amended in 
the paradigm setting for the application of section is a case where the plaintiff seeks to inspect the books and records of the corporation in which he or she owns stock.section is intended to provide to stockholders of delaware corporations an economical and expeditious mechanism for the inspection of documents if such stockholders can demonstrate a valid purpose.prior to the amendment to section,stockholders of a parent corporation were not entitled to inspect a subsidiary books and records,a bsent a showing of fraud or that a subsidiary is in fact the mere alter ego of the parent in,however,section was amended to provide for inspection of documents of a subsidiary of the corporation upon which the demand for inspection is made.
the statute defines subsidiary 
the parties dispute over the proper interpretation of the amendment to section raises an issue of first impression.the term subsidiary is defined in the conjunctive 
subsidiary means any entity directly or indirectly owned in whole or in part,by the corporation of which the stockholder is a stockholder and over the affairs of which the corporation directly or indirectly exercises control 
that statutory definition required the court of chancery to make a determination not only that mays is an entity directly or indirectly owned,in whole or in part by weinstein,but also that weinstein exercises control,directly or indirectly,over the affairs of mays.there is no helpful legislative history to inform our construction of the definition of subsidiary in section.
weinstein submits that only one interpretation is consistent with section overriding purpose,which is to provide for the inspection of corporate books and records in a timely fashion by a stockholder of a delaware corporation.according to weinstein,subsidiary must be defined to accomplish that purpose while simultaneously protecting the legitimate interests of subsidiary corporations in the confidentiality of their own documents.weinstein and orloff both agree that the amendment must be construed in a manner that is consistent with the actual ability of the parent corporation before the court of chancery to cause the subsidiary corporation that is not before the court of chancery to make its documents available for inspection.
establishing that an entity is a subsidiary of the corporation that is before the court of chancery is a condition precedent to invoking the amendment to section.as in this case,usually the extent of the parent corporation direct or indirect ownership will not be an issue.therefore,the dispositive inquiry in making that determination will be whether the stockholder controls the affairs of the corporation.
importantly,section is not limited to subsidiaries.a parent corporation may control a corporation that it does not wholly own and even one in which the parent has less than a majority stock interest.even a cursory examination of how subsidiary is defined in other contexts shows that the range of control may start as low as ownership,ann.tit.
weinstein controls mays under section a 
as the foregoing discussion indicates,the term control does not have a fixed legal meaning.its definition varies according to the context in which it is being considered,fiduciary responsibility,tort liability,filing consolidated tax returns,sale of control for that reason,control or its frequently used to describe a judicial conclusion that is reached after a fact specific analysis.
as professor deborah demott has noted,control assumes very different forms in the paradigmatic relationship between equity investors and a corporation.
shareholders control is often latent and indirect in form.corporate law itself allocates to shareholders only the power to elect directors,and under some circumstances,to remove directors once elected,and to adopt or reject fundamental transactions proposed by directors.holding a majority of voting power does not in itself place a shareholder in a position of active control.if the shareholder assumes no additional role within the corporation,the shareholder is not a direct participant in operational decisions or in the formulation of strategic policy.nonetheless,shareholders hold power to control in a latent form because they may be able to remove directors,and in all events may replace the incumbents if they resign or when their terms expire 
in the context of imposing fiduciary responsibilities,it is well established in the corporate jurisprudence of delaware that control exists when a stockholder owns,directly or indirectly,more than half of a corporation voting power in addition to the election of directors,many of the most fundamental corporate changes also require approval by a majority vote of the stockholders,mergers,consolidations,sales of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation and dissolutions 
conversely,a stockholder that owns less than half of a corporation shares will generally not be deemed to be a controlling stockholder,with concomitant fiduciary responsibilities for a stockholder that owns less than a numerical majority of a corporation voting shares to be deemed a controlling stockholder for purposes of imposing fiduciary obligations,the plaintiff must establish the actual exercise of control over the corporation conduct by that otherwise minority stockholder 
in this case,the court of chancery ruled that mays was a subsidiary of weinstein for purposes of invoking the amendment to section a.that ruling was based upon the of mays stock that weinstein owned,plus the six or seven percent of stock that the weinstein foundation owned.the court of chancery also concluded that e ven without the f oundation,given the fact that there is no other substantial shareholder,i have little trouble concluding that weinstein enterprises,exercises direct or indirectly the power to control the affairs of mays.
we hold that the court of chancery correctly concluded that whether weinstein controlled the affairs of mays,for purposes of being a section a subsidiary,must be determined by applying the concept of control normally used for the purpose of imposing fiduciary responsibility the fiduciary definition.applying that definition,because weinstein had the power to control the affairs of mays as distinguished from actually exercising that power,weinstein controlled mays for purposes of establishing mays status as a subsidiary of weinstein.
parent corporation production duty 
that threshold determination,however,did not conclude the analysis required by the statute.the parent corporation statutory obligation to produce the subsidiary documents is qualified.that obligation exists only to the extent that the subsidiary documents are in the parent actual possession and control or to the extent that the subsidiary documents that are in the subsidiary possession and control can be obtained through the parent exercise of control over the subsidiary.thus,section b provides 
b any stockholder shall,upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof,have the right to inspect for any proper purpose,and to make copies and extracts from 
a subsidiary books and records,to the extent that 
a.the corporation has actual possession and control of such records of such subsidiary or 
b.the corporation could obtain such records through the exercise of control over such subsidiary 
the court of chancery did not determine that weinstein was able to exercise control over the affairs of mays for purposes of causing mays to produce its documents that weinstein did not already possess.indeed,the court of chancery determined to the contrary.it recognized that as a practical matter weinstein may not be able to cause mays to produce the documents without taking extraordinary steps and that a lthough weinstein may not be able to,i think the court of chancery has power to do so by issuing another process.
control and ownership 
when it stated that,as a practical matter weinstein may not be able to cause mays to produce the documents without taking some extraordinary steps,the court of chancery may have been referring to weinstein ability to replace some of mays board members with persons who might be more willing to produce the subsidiary documents.to the extent that was what the court of chancery had in mind,its approach is inconsistent with a legal proposition even if a controlling stockholder is able to elect a majority of the subsidiary board of directors,that ability,without more,does not automatically establish that the parent controls the affairs of the subsidiary corporation for purposes of causing the subsidiary to produce its books and records.
for publicly held corporations,the delaware general corporation law contemplates a separation of control and ownership the board of directors has the legal responsibility to manage the business of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders this court has consistently held that the fact the directors of a corporation are elected by the majority stockholder does not relieve those directors of their fiduciary duties to the corporation and its minority stockholders as professor demott has observed 
the parent,once having elected directors,does not have a right thereafter to interfere.to impose a duty of obedience on directors,moreover,would conflict with the fundamental point that corporate law assigns ultimate managerial power and responsibility to directors.the parent thus lacks the right to assert control through interim instructions,a defining hallmark of a legal relationship of agency.this is not a point of merely formal or definitional significance.as the preceding discussion illustrates,the distinction between a right of control and the effective power to control often has practical consequences.in the absence of a right to control the directors it elects,the parent must either disregard their existence,a move disrespectful of the corporate paraphernalia that jeopardizes the corporate veil insulating the parent from liabilities,or the parent must take steps to exercise its power by coercing the directors or removing them,moves that have drawbacks of their own 
mays is a new york corporation that is separate from weinstein.its directors have an independent duty to protect and further the interests of mays.the court of chancery recognized this when it granted a stay pending appeal,stating that mays is a separate legal entity with minority shareholders and that the fiduciary duties of the mays directors do not run directly to weinstein and weinstein does not have the unfettered power to tell the mays board of directors what to do.although the court of chancery correctly acknowledged that independent duty,its interpretation of section b b did not give that duty appropriate legal deference.
section b b requires actual exercise of control 
the court of chancery held that weinstein controls mays.we agree that,as amended in,section a requires an application of the fiduciary definition of control for purposes of determining subsidiary status.but the fiduciary definition of control does not carry over into,and govern,the quite different operative provisions of section b b,which require that the parent be able to exercise its power of control to cause the subsidiary to produce its books and records.for that reason,the court of chancery erred in applying the fiduciary definition to determine the meaning of the term control in the context of section b 
the use of the same term control in the quite different contexts of both sections a and b b renders the amended statute ambiguous.as noted earlier in this opinion,the meaning of the term control depends critically upon the context in which it is used.section b b requires an actual ability on the part of the parent corporation to exercise control and thereby cause the subsidiary to produce the subsidiary documents that are not in the parent possession.under section b b,the inquiry in each specific case is not whether the parent has the power to control the affairs of the subsidiary,but whether by exercising actual control,the parent corporation alone can cause the subsidiary to produce its documents.
although it was decided before the amendment,frank engle illuminates this distinction.there,the court of chancery was required to decide whether a parent that was a party before the court was required to produce documents of a subsidiary that was not a party before the court.there,the plaintiff sought documents of indiana financial investors,which was owned by a defendant,hickory furniture after noting that indiana was owned by hickory,the court of chancery stated f or the purposes of this motion,plaintiffs have failed to show that indiana is controlled by a defendant over whom i have personal jurisdiction.the court held the request is denied as it pertains to indiana because indiana is not named in this action,and plaintiffs have made no showing that indiana is a wholly owned subsidiary or alter ego of a named defendant.thus,even where the parent corporation owned of the shares of the absent subsidiary,that parent corporation did not have control for purposes of compelling the absent subsidiary corporation to produce its documents.
to summarize,a relationship is established by applying the fiduciary definition of controlling stockholder but that relationship,once established,only forms the predicate for the court of chancery to order the parent corporation to produce the subsidiary books and records.for even then,the court of chancery can do so only to the extent that the parent corporation has actual possession and control of such records of such subsidiary or,if the books and records are in the possession of the subsidiary,only where the parent corporation could obtain such records through the exercise of control over the subsidiary.that is,establishing that the subsidiary is a subsidiary under the fiduciary test of control,does not provide an ipso facto basis to order the parent corporation to produce documents in the
