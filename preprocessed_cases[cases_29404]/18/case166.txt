plaintiff gloria steginsky,a former minority shareholder of xcelera,appeals the dismissal of her securities fraud claims by the united states district court for the district of connecticut stefan underhill,district judge.her complaint alleged that xcelera insiders purchased xcelera stock by making a tender offer through a shell corporation without disclosing any information about xcelera financial state.we hold that the duty of corporate insiders to either disclose material nonpublic information or abstain from trading is defined by federal common law and applies to unregistered securities,and that the district court thus erred in dismissing plaintiff insider trading claims.we vacate the dismissal of her insider trading claims under sections b,a,and a of the securities exchange act,and of her pendent nonfederal claims for breach of fiduciary duty.however,we affirm the dismissal of her market manipulation claims,and of her insider trading claims under section e of the securities exchange act.
background 
because the district court dismissed plaintiff claims on the pleadings,we must accept the complaint factual allegations as true for the purposes of this appeal.see atsi commc ns shaar fund,cir.plaintiff gloria steginsky was a minority shareholder of xcelera who sold her shares in pursuant to a tender offer for per share.she alleges violations of securities law and breaches of fiduciary duty by six defendants.defendant xcelera is a cayman islands holding corporation,based in connecticut,with operating subsidiaries and financial interests in the computer and software industries.at all relevant times,xcelera has been controlled by the three vik defendants alexander vik is chairman of the board and chief executive officer gustav vik is director,executive vice president,secretary,and treasurer and vbi corporation owned by alexander and gustav father,erik vik is xcelera majority shareholder defendant ofc is incorporated in malta and was created by the vik defendants in as a vehicle to make a tender offer for xcelera shares.finally,defendant hans eirik olav is an xcelera director who was listed as the ofc contact person with respect to the tender offer.
according to the complaint,xcelera common stock traded on the american stock exchange for a high of in during the dotcom bubble.in,after the price plummeted to around,the vik defendants began to refuse to make required filings with the securities exchange commission sec.because of this,the american stock exchange delisted xcelera stock in,and the price then dropped to around share.in,the sec revoked the registration of all xcelera securities.since,none of the defendants have disclosed any information concerning xcelera financial condition.
after the of xcelera securities by the sec,investors were told by the company that they could sell their stock back to xcelera for share.in december,ofc made a tender offer for xcelera stock,listing olav as the contact person,at share.the complaint alleges that ofc is only a shell company,and that the tender offer was in fact orchestrated by xcelera and the vik defendants,who have previously used maltese companies to conceal their identities.no information about xcelera financial conditions was disclosed in connection with the tender offer.in april,plaintiff sold her shares of xcelera common stock to ofc pursuant to the tender offer.
in february,plaintiff filed the complaint in this case,alleging breach of fiduciary duty and violations of sections b,e,a,and a of the securities exchange act through both market manipulation and insider trading.in june,xcelera and the vik defendants moved to dismiss,and plaintiff sought a default judgment against ofc,who had failed to appear the district court properly applied an identical standard in assessing the two motions and accepted all of the complaint factual allegations as true.see.b trans world airlines,hughes,cir a default judgment entered on allegations in a complaint establishes a defendant liability,rev on other grounds,d.the district court concluded,however,that plaintiff failed to state a claim as a matter of law,and therefore dismissed both her market manipulation and insider trading claims.it then concluded that it was compelled to dismiss the pendent fiduciary duty claims without prejudice to refiling in state court.although the district court did not expressly address the a and e claims,it then denied plaintiff motion for default judgment and granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.steginsky xcelera,cv,wl.plaintiff appeals the dismissal of her claims,and defendants the district court decision to not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the pendent claims.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint under rule b,accepting the complaint factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.atsi,at.a complaint alleging securities fraud must state with particularity the circumstances constituting the fraud.b.private securities fraud actions also must meet the heightened pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act pslra.when plaintiff alleges a false statement or omission,the complaint must specify the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading and must state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.additionally,when a cause of action requires proof of scienter,the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.id.b a.
plaintiff raises three types of claims,which we address in turn securities fraud through market manipulation securities fraud through insider trading and breach of fiduciary duty.
market manipulation claims 
plaintiff theory of market manipulation is that defendants manipulated the price of xcelera stock downward by refusing to make required sec filings starting in,causing xcelera to be delisted by the american stock exchange in and then deregistered by the sec in.defendants could then buy back xcelera stock at artificially depressed prices.market manipulation requires a plaintiff to allege manipulative acts damage caused by reliance on an assumption of an efficient market free of manipulation scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of securities furthered by the defendant use of the mails or any facility of a national securities exchange.atsi,at.because a claim for market manipulation requires a showing of scienter,the pslra heightened standards for pleading scienter also apply.id.at.
plaintiff counsel has previously asserted this theory while representing other minority shareholders in a different suit against xcelera and the vik defendants,which described the same refusal to make sec filings.in a summary order in that case,we affirmed the district court denial of leave to amend the complaint to add securities law claims,concluding that a bsent any allegation of a going private transaction,tender offer,or scheme to take advantage of depressed share prices,we can not conclude that the urged inference of scienter is compelling.feiner family trust vbi,app x,cir.in this case,the inference of fraud is strengthened by new allegations regarding the tender offer that were absent from the earlier suit,although the scheme remains somewhat implausible due to the gap between the alleged decision to depress the stock in and the effort to repurchase stock in.
but we need not determine whether the market manipulation claims are adequately pled because it is plain that these claims are not timely filed.a securities fraud claim must be filed not later than the earlier of years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or years after such violation.emphasis added.plaintiff argues that the complaint was filed within two years of the tender offer,which was a fact necessary to establish scienter,and she points to the supreme court discussion of the onset of the period in merck,reynolds,d.but in merck,no one doubt ed that the complaint was filed within five years of the alleged violation.id.at.in this case,the alleged manipulation commenced with the refusal to
