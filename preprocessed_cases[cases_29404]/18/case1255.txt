when this case was previously before this court we held that,to qualify for interest netting,the taxpayer must demonstrate that the statute of limitations was open with respect to both overpayments and underpayments on the date that d became effective july.fed.mortgage ass united states.we remanded only for a factual determination regarding whether the statute of limitations for the underpayment year was closed on july.id.
on remand,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment in favor of the united states because it found that the statute of limitations for fnma tax year had expired before july.fed.mortgage ass united states.because we agree that the statute of limitations for fnma tax year expired before july,we affirm.
background 
section of the internal revenue code generally requires taxpayers to pay a higher interest rate on tax underpayments than it requires the irs to pay to taxpayers on overpayments.see a b,c.in congress amended as part of the restructuring and reform act of,to require interest netting.d.under d,a interest rate applies when there are underpayments and overpayments by the same taxpayer for overlapping tax periods.in addition to applying prospectively from july,an uncodified special rule governs interest netting for tax years before and provides that interest netting is only available if the statutes of limitations remain open.in other words,it is s ubject to any applicable statute of limitation not having expired by july,with regard to either a tax underpayment or a tax overpayment,c,stat,amended by,d,stat.
in and,respectively,fnma made tax and interest payments to the irs to satisfy deficiencies for tax years and,paying interest at the underpayment rate.in,pursuant to a tax court decision,the irs refunded nearly million in overpayment tax and interest for tax years and,paying interest at the overpayment rate.see fed.mortgage ass comm r,wl.on december,after the amendment to,fnma filed an administrative claim with the irs for application of the interest rate and identified overlapping periods of overpayment for and and periods of underpayment for and.on june,the irs denied the request reasoning that the statute of limitations for refund must be open on july,on both the overpayment and underpayment periods.the statutes for tax periods december,and december,have expired.
fnma then filed a refund action pursuant to in the united states court of federal claims.fed.mortgage ass united states.fnma argued that the special rule only requires an open statute of limitations for either the overpayment tax period or the underpayment tax period,but does not require that the statutes of limitations remain open for both.the court of federal claims agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of fnma.id.at.on appeal,we reversed because the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction to grant relief under and held that the special rule for does not apply unless the taxpayer demonstrates that the statute of limitations was open for both the overpayment and underpayment years.fed.mortgage ass n,at see also computervision united states,reaffirming our decision in federal mortgage ass n.because the parties had stipulated that the statute of limitations was open for the overpayment tax years and and the statute of limitations was closed for the underpayment tax year,thus barring an interest netting claim on the basis of the tax year,we remanded only for a factual determination regarding whether the statute of limitations for the underpayment year was closed on july.fed.mortgage ass n,at.
in view of the limited nature of our remand,we confine our discussion of the background facts to tax year and to the question of whether the statute of limitations for the underpayment year was closed on july.id.fnma filed its federal income tax return for the tax year on or before september.after the irs audited the return,it entered into a series of form consent to extend the time to assess tax agreements with fnma that extended the statute of limitations for assessment of tax until march.in november,the parties executed a form special consent to extend the time to assess tax,which extended the statute of limitations for assessment until the occurrence of certain specified events.the first paragraph of form provided that the limitations period for assessment remains open until the day after a the irs receives form,notice of termination of special consent to extend the time to assess tax,from the taxpayer b the irs mails the taxpayer a form or c the irs mails a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer.the second paragraph of form provided this agreement ends on the earlier of the above expiration date or the assessment date of an increase in the above tax or the overassessment date of a decrease in the above tax that reflects the final determination of tax and the final administrative appeals consideration.under c,the form agreement also extended the deadline for fnma to file a refund claim until six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment may be made pursuant to the form agreement.c see also form,the taxpayer s may file a claim for credit or refund and the service may credit or refund the tax within six months after this agreement ends.
on december,the parties executed a form offer of waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of deficiency in tax and of acceptance of overassessment settlement agreement in which fnma consented to a proposed deficiency of in tax and in interest for tax year.fnma paid the deficiency on december.in the form,fnma reserved the right to timely file claims for refund or credit or prosecute timely filed claims solely on three grounds,each of which related to a tax court proceeding concerning other taxable years.in essence,the parties agreed in the first reservation that if the tax court proceeding was ultimately resolved favorably to the taxpayer,the irs would allow a refund for the tax year.the applicable condition stated if the decision of the tax court upholding the taxpayer position regarding the concurrent mortgage sale issue becomes final under section,gross income for does not include the purchase discount amortization of.after the execution of form,the irs sent fnma a letter stating that it had closed this case on the basis agreed upon and was sending the case file to the service center.along with the letter,the irs enclosed an executed closing agreement form that recited the terms of the settlement.
the tax court decision concerning the first reserved issue became final in and was favorable to the taxpayer.on june,fnma filed an amended tax return seeking a refund of.on may,the irs sent fnma a check for,reflecting the full refund amount plus interest accrued since.
on remand,in a careful opinion the court of federal claims found that,following the forms and,the only issue left open was the possibility of securing a refund for the tax year.fed.mortgage ass n.at.the court rejected fnma argument that form restricts termination of the extension to specific,identifiable events because the second paragraph of form looks beyond the clear notice concept of paragraph one and requires instead an assessment of the parties conduct.id.at.the court noted that the language of the form and the taxpayer limited reservations express a mutual commitment to accept the final determination of plaintiff income tax liability in accordance with the specifications of the reservations.id.thus,the court concluded that the issuance of a refund check in the claimed amount corresponds to the final determination and appeals consideration for plaintiff taxable year and,accordingly,brings to a close,days after the date of refund,the period for the assessment of tax as contemplated by form.id.at.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government.id.at.fnma timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
fnma first argues that this court should reconsider its decision in fed.mortgage ass united states,fnma i,that the special rule requires an open statute of limitations for both the overpayment and underpayment tax periods.in fnma i,this court held that the provision is jurisdictional and a waiver of sovereign immunity because the disputed language in the special rule does not merely relate to the rate of interest the government must pay.rather,it discriminates between those claims for overpaid interest congress has authorized and those it has not t herefore,it is a waiver of sovereign immunity,and,moreover,one expressly made conditional.id.at.as the language at issue in the special rule is ambiguous,we strictly construed the special rule in favor of the government to require that fnma demonstrate that the statute of limitations was open for both the overpayment and the underpayment tax years.id.at.
in computervision,at,we reaffirmed that i n fnma,we interpreted the special rule language to require that the statute of limitations must be open with respect to both the underpayment and the overpayment.because the statute of limitations was closed for both of computervision tax years,we held that computervision claim for interest netting fails to satisfy the requirements for retroactive application of the statute.id.at.in a supplemental opinion on petition for rehearing,we again held that under our decision in fnma,both the overpayment and underpayment limitations period must remain open on july,in order for the interest netting statute to apply retroactively.computervision united states.
a panel of this court is bound by prior precedential decisions unless and until overturned en banc.sacco dep t of justice.nonetheless,fnma argues that we must reconsider fnma i in light of the supreme court intervening decision in arbaugh y h,d,and our intervening en banc decision in fisher united states,en banc in relevant part.fnma argues that,under arbaugh and fisher,the special rule is not jurisdictional and,therefore,we should not adhere to our supposedly flawed analysis in fnma i.we do not read arbaugh or fisher to warrant reconsidering fnma i.in fnma i,we characterized the special rule as jurisdictional,holding that it represented a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be strictly construed.fnma urges that the special rule is not jurisdictional,relying on arbaugh and fisher as setting forth new standards for determining when a statutory provision is jurisdictional.these cases are not pertinent because they do not address whether,in cases against the government,limitations periods are jurisdictional or whether they must be strictly construed.the supreme court in arbaugh held that the provision of title vii that limits the term employer to those having fifteen or more employees was not jurisdictional.at see also b.likewise,our en banc decision in fisher addressed the standard for determining whether a statute is money mandating,thus conferring jurisdiction under the tucker act,but did not consider limitations.see fisher,at.
the decision in fnma i that the statute of limitations is jurisdictional and must be strictly construed applies a well established principle supported by a long line of supreme court cases.the supreme court has repeatedly stated that u nder settled principles of sovereign immunity,the united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit,save as it consents to be sued and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.united states dalm,d quoting united states testan,d sea also united states sherwood.the supreme court in dalm concluded further that a statute of limitations requiring that a suit against the government be brought within a certain time period is one of those terms that defines the court jurisdiction.dalm,at.see also united states mottaz,d in particular,when waiver legislation contains a statute of limitations,the limitations provision constitutes a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity.internal quotation omitted.thus,the supreme court has consistently held that statutes of limitations must be strictly construed in favor of the government.see,dalm,at.badaracco comm r,d statute s of limitations must receive a strict construction in favor of the government.internal quotation omitted dupont de nemours davis.statutes of limitation sought to be applied to bar rights of the government,must receive a strict construction in favor of the government.the special rule is a statute of limitations and must be strictly construed.we see no reason to reconsider either fnma i or our decision reaffirming it in computervision,even if we had authority to do so.
the more difficult question concerns fnma argument that the statute of limitations for the tax year had not run by july.our decisions in fnma i and computervision did not explore at length the question of when a statute of limitations for a particular year will have expired,though we held in computervision that the filing of a refund suit did not extend the limitations period as required by the statute.computervision,at computervision,at.we assume without deciding that if the statute of limitations remains open by agreement for any relevant purpose other than claims of fraud or misrepresentation,no matter how limited,the statute will not have expired within the meaning of the special rule.the parties appear to agree that the limitations period for additional deficiency assessments or refunds for the tax year would have expired long before were it not for extensions of time.the sole issue therefore is whether those extension agreements kept the limitations period open until for further deficiency assessments or refunds.
fnma filed its federal income tax return for on or before september.as noted above,the irs entered into a series of form agreements with fnma to extend the statute of limitations for assessment until march.in november the parties executed a form agreement extending the limitations period for assessment until certain events occurred.
the history of form manifests concern over the need for clarity in terminating waivers of statutes of limitations.the irs began using form in,but at that time the agreement could only be terminated when the irs mailed a notification of termination of appeals office consideration or upon receipt by appeals of notification by the taxpayer of election to terminate the agreement.see field serv.advice,fsa lexis at.in,to address problems interpreting the notification of termination requirement,the irs modified the first paragraph of to provide that notification of intent to terminate the indefinite extension was to be made on a specific document,form.id.at.the same year,the language of the second paragraph was added to form to address a government accounting office recommendation that the irs add a statement that the waiver period will end on the agreed date or after assessment,whichever comes first.id.at.
here the first paragraph of form provided that the limitations period would remain open until the day after a the irs receives form,notice of termination of special consent to extend the time to assess tax,from the taxpayer b the irs mails the taxpayer a form or c the irs mails a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer.the second paragraph of form provided this agreement ends on the earlier of the above expiration date or the assessment date of an increase in the above tax or the overassessment date of a decrease in the above tax that reflects the final determination of tax and the final administrative appeals consideration.
the parties agree that the first paragraph of form is inapplicable here neither party has sent a form terminating the limitations period nor has the irs issued a notice of deficiency for.the question is whether the conditions of the second paragraph occurred
