this case was brought by minority shareholders of mineral energy and technology metco,against its directors and lawyers.the complaint alleged that the defendants violated the civil racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,when they arranged to transfer metco assets to an australian corporation.the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim,and they appeal.
we conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing under rico to assert shareholder derivative claims allegations of securities fraud do not establish predicate acts under rico and the continuity requirement of rico is not satisfied by the allegations in the complaint.
accordingly,exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.
background 
according to the complaint,defendants duncan,sapper,and malone were directors and majority shareholders of metco,a new mexico uranium mining company together with karl meyers,another director who is not a party to these proceedings,they negotiated a trade of metco uranium mining claims to subsidiaries of defendant uranium king,ukl,an australian corporation.defendants duncan,sapper,and malone were also directors of ukl.ukl subsequently merged with another australian corporation,monaro mining nl monaro.
plaintiffs alleged that the transfer of mining claims provided for metco to receive million and for metco to receive stock in ukl in exchange for metco uranium interests.the ukl stock was then to be distributed among the metco shareholders on a pro rata basis.according to plaintiffs,after defendants duncan,sapper,and malone transferred the metco uranium claim deeds to ukl,ukl abandoned the agreement and paid neither the money nor the ukl stock to metco.consequently,plaintiffs lost the value of their investment in metco.in addition,plaintiffs claimed that duncan,sapper,and malone were highly compensated for arranging the transaction.
based on this conduct,the minority shareholders contend the defendants defrauded them of their share of the ukl stock and rendered their metco investment virtually worthless.plaintiffs also aver that the merger was a fraudulent means of transferring the mining claims to a third entity.the remaining defendants,foster,comeau,fish,and gibson,were attorneys who allegedly represented the other defendants for the purpose of filing frivolous lawsuits against plaintiffs to keep them from pursuing claims to metco assets.
plaintiffs claim defendants conspired to deprive them of the value of their metco shares by a series of predicate acts based on the conduct,in violation of rico.the district court granted motions to dismiss filed by defendants ukl,comeau,and foster,ruling that plaintiffs complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,pursuant to.b the district court held that plaintiffs did not have standing to bring rico claims on metco behalf and that the private securities litigation reform act pslra precluded rico claims based on securities fraud.the court then ordered plaintiffs to show cause why their claims against the remaining defendants should not be dismissed for the same reasons.after reviewing plaintiffs response to the order,the district court dismissed the remaining claims 
plaintiffs appeal,arguing that the district court applied an incorrect standard to grant dismissal failed to grant a default judgment against defendant malone even though evidence showed that he evaded service of process and had actual knowledge of the lawsuit and was biased in defendants favor in applying an incorrect dispositive standard and construing the facts in defendants favor,thus violating plaintiffs due process rights.
although the first argument is ostensibly a challenge to the standard of review applied by the district court,it is more fairly characterized as two distinct challenges the first to the determination that plaintiffs alleged injuries were due to their status as minority shareholders of metco the second to the court application of the pslra.we start with the standard of review,and consider each contention in turn.
ii.standards of review on appeal 
we review de novo the district court rule b dismissal.see christy sports,llc deer valley resort,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d.w e assume the factual allegations are true and ask whether it is plausible that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.gallagher shelton,cir.t he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.iqbal.at.
we also review de novo the legal issue of plaintiffs standing to bring their claims.see law mohawk constr.supply,cir.
iii.dismissal for failure to state a claim 
rico standing 
the district court held that plaintiffs,as metco minority shareholders,lacked standing to bring a rico claim based on the diminution of the value of their shares.we agree.
rico provides a cause of action for those injured in business or property by reason of prohibited racketeering activities.c see sedima,imrex,d if the defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner forbidden by a c,and the racketeering activities injure the plaintiff in his business or property,the plaintiff has a claim under c.a plaintiff has standing only if his injuries were proximately caused by the rico violation.gillmor thomas,cir see also holmes sec.investor protection,d holding plaintiff lacked standing to bring rico claims because there was no direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.
in general,the law is that conduct which harms a corporation confers standing on the corporation,not its shareholders t he shareholder standing rule is a longstanding equitable restriction that generally prohibits shareholders from initiating actions to enforce the rights of the corporation unless the corporation management has refused to pursue the same action for reasons other than business judgment.franchise tax bd.of alcan aluminium,d.an exception to this rule allow s a shareholder with a direct,personal interest in a cause of action to bring suit even if the corporation rights are also implicated.accord grubbs bailes,cir.plaintiffs claim to fall within this latter exception.
plaintiffs allegations,however,merely assert the minority shareholders suffered a diminution in value of their corporate shares without receiving the same monetary compensation the majority shareholders received.such an injury is not direct and personal for rico purposes but is,rather,an injury to the corporation.to avoid this fundamental problem,the minority shareholders assert that their claims are based on injury to them,rather than the corporation.specifically,they contend that defendants actions caused their proportionate corporate ownership to be diluted,and that defendants have pursued abusive litigation against them in an effort to coerce them into abandoning their interests in metco 
in support of this contention,plaintiffs point to a district court case,lochhead alacano,as supporting the proposition that defendants conduct led to the dilution of their proportionate corporate ownership.in lochhead,the court first noted the distinction between a claim of a diminution in value of a shareholder stock,for which an individual shareholder lacks standing to bring a direct cause of action,id.at,and a corporate transaction which dilutes a shareholder proportionate ownership,which a shareholder has a direct right to attack,id.at quotation omitted.the plaintiff alleged that by their fraudulent conduct,the defendants received proportionally more stock than plaintiff did in a merger of the corporation into another corporation,thus diluting the value of his shares.id.at.therefore,he had individual standing to maintain his relative status as a stockholder and to protect his proportionate ownership interest against fraudulent dilution.id.at.
plaintiffs argument here is based on their allegations that the majority shareholders received personal compensation for arranging the transaction,while the minority shareholders,including plaintiffs,did not.this argument fails to show that plaintiffs corporate ownership was diluted because they have made no showing that more shares were issued or that the value of the majority shareholders shares increased more than theirs.rather,they allege that the majority shareholders received compensation for agreeing to the transaction,not that those defendants shares in metco increased in value disproportionately.therefore,plaintiffs have not shown that their proportionate corporate ownership was diluted as set forth in lochhead.
plaintiffs suggest on appeal that they could have avoided these standing problems by amending their complaint to omit their allegations of securities fraud and insider trading.we conclude that amendment would have been futile because withdrawing the specific allegations of securities fraud and insider trading would not have altered the essential nature of plaintiff claims,which were based on their status as minority metco shareholders whose shares lost value see anderson merrill lynch pierce fenner smith,cir holding amendment to withdraw some counts of complaint would have been futile because all substantive counts were precluded by statute.
next,plaintiffs claim that they were injured by the frivolous lawsuits defendants filed against them in order to force them to abandon their interests in metco.because this claim is not based solely on their status as metco shareholders,t o determine whether plaintiff s properly alleged an injury to their business or property,we first examine the alleged predicate acts that purportedly caused the injury.deck engineered laminates,cir.plaintiffs assert that defendants litigation tactics were extortionate,with the purpose of coercing them to accept defendants allegedly fraudulent acts.we have refused to recogniz e abusive litigation as a form of extortion because doing so would subject almost any unsuccessful lawsuit to a colorable extortion and often a rico claim.id.at.therefore,plaintiffs claim does not state a rico predicate act.see id.
because plaintiffs injuries were based on the diminution of the value of their metco shares,and not on direct injury to them,we conclude their claims are derivative of the corporation.this conclusion accords with the uniform holdings of other circuits that have considered this question.according to these decisions,corporate shareholders do not have standing to sue under the civil rico statute for alleged injuries to the corporation.see craig outdoor advertising,viacom outdoor,cir holding shareholder lacked standing to pursue rico claim for alleged injuries to corporation,cert.denied,d bivens gardens office,barnett banks of,cir same frank,cir same whalen carter,cir holding shareholders lacked standing to assert a direct rico claim because their alleged injuries derived from injuries to the corporation,and louisiana law provided that sole cause of action accrued to the corporation in re sunrise secs,cir holding shareholders lacked standing to bring rico claims belonging to corporation applying florida law to determine that action was derivative flynn merrick,cir holding shareholder lacked standing to pursue rico claim for alleged injuries to corporation sparling hoffman constr,cir same ncnb bank of tiller,cir same,overruled on other grounds by busby crown supply,cir roeder alpha,cir same rand,cir same.
we agree with these circuits.therefore,the district court correctly held that plaintiffs do not have rico standing.
pslra standing 
the pslra amended rico to provide that no person may rely upon any conduct that would have been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities to establish a violation of rico,stat,amending c the ninth circuit has applied the pslra amendment to bar a rico claim alleging fraud in connection with the sale of securities.swartz kpmg llp,cir.there,the court rejected the plaintiff argument that the allegedly fraudulent securities transactions in question were intended to be a swap agreement,rather than a sale of securities,because the transactions relied on the sale of stock to effect their purpose.id.similarly,the third circuit has held that the pslra amendment precluded a rico claim based on a ponzi scheme that was accomplished by the purchase and sale of securities.bald eagle area sch.dist.keystone,cir 
in particular,section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and sec rule,are directed at fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.with these provisions in mind,we consider whether the amendment to the pslra barred plaintiffs civil rico action.
plaintiffs contend that the pslra exception to rico does not apply because their claims did not involve the purchase or sale of securities.although the minority shareholders did not purchase or sell their metco shares as part of the alleged wrongdoing,their allegations that defendants defrauded them from receiving ukl stock as provided in the transaction,and the subsequent allegedly fraudulent merger of ukl and monaro,describe a purchase and sale of securities,d s hareholders purchased shares in a new company by exchanging them for their old stock.accord realmonte reeves,cir when an exchange of shares facilitates the merger of two separate and distinct corporate entities,that exchange constitutes a purchase or sale for purposes of bringing a rule action.similarly,plaintiffs claim that defendants transferred metco uranium interests to ukl with the intent not to honor the corresponding agreement to issue ukl stock to metco or its shareholders,also describes a violation of rule.see wharf holdings united int l holdings,d holding the defendant sale of a security in the form of an option to purchase shares while secretly intending from the very beginning not to honor the option falls within b policy of full disclosure.
plaintiffs also attempt to avoid the pslra bar by arguing that most of their alleged predicate acts do not describe securities fraud.they maintain that their allegations that defendants committed mail and wire fraud,bank fraud,extortion,obstruction of justice,and interstate travel in support of racketeering,described conduct not covered by the pslra such conduct may well constitute illegal and fraudulent acts,but it was also undertaken in connection with the purchase of a security.thus,it can not support a civil rico claim after enactment of the pslra.bald eagle area sch,at.allowing plaintiffs to engage in surgical presentation of the cause of action would undermine the purpose of the rico amendment.accord gatz ponsoldt,d,a plaintiff can not circumvent the pslra exclusion of securities fraud as a rico predicate act through artful pleading.
therefore,we conclude that plaintiffs claims fall within the pslra and thus can not form the basis of a civil rico claim.
rico continuity requirement 
finally,an additional ground supports dismissal of the complaint.it does not state a claim of continuity of the alleged rico scheme.although the district court did not rely on this ground,we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record.hayes whitman,cir.defendants raised this ground in the district court,thus providing plaintiffs an opportunity to address it.
a rico claim must allege a violation of,which consists of four elements conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.gillmor,at quotation omitted.a pattern requires at least two predicate acts.in addition,t o satisfy rico pattern requirement,a plaintiff must allege not only that the defendants had committed two or more predicate acts,but also that the predicates themselves amount to,or that they otherwise constitute a threat of,continuing racketeering activity.hall witteman,cir quotation omitted.
a viable rico claim requires a showing of continuity plus relationship.sedima,at.quotation omitted.the relationship test is not a cumbersome one for a rico plaintiff.a showing that predicate acts have the same or similar purposes,results,participants,victims,or methods of commission,or otherwise are interrel
