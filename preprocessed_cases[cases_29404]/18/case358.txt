plaintiff shareholders appeal the district court order dismissing this securities fraud class action under the private securities litigation reform act,c,which contains a safe harbor for statements.we find the alleged misrepresentations which form the basis of plaintiffs claims are protected by the safe harbor because they are and immaterial as a matter of law.we will therefore affirm the order of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
lead plaintiff varma mutual pension insurance company seeks to represent a class of investors who purchased securities of aetna,between october,and july.the consolidated class action complaint names as defendants aetna and four of its officers employed at the time of the alleged fraud john rowe,ronald williams,alan bennett,and craig callen aetna,a pennsylvania corporation with operations in multiple states,provides medical insurance and health care benefits to more than million customers.
the complaint alleges a fraudulent scheme wherein defendants misled investors about aetna pricing of insurance policies and then sold shares of aetna stock before the scheme was revealed to the public.in particular,plaintiffs claim that defendants falsely characterized aetna pricing of medical insurance premiums as disciplined,which,plaintiffs claim,refers to a conservative underwriting practice of setting premiums in a fixed proportion to expected future medical costs.within the health care industry,this proportion is known as the medical cost ratio mcr according to plaintiffs,investors rely on mcr as an indicator of profitability.
plaintiffs claim the fraud began in september,when aetna allegedly relaxed its underwriting criteria in an effort to underprice competitors and gain market share.plaintiffs claim that defendants knew this would adversely affect aetna mcr and stock price so that defendants concealed the relaxed underwriting criteria by publicly touting a disciplined pricing policy.in february,rowe,bennett and callen sold substantial holdings of aetna stock on the open market at prices that plaintiffs claim were artificially inflated by the fraud in april and july,aetna reported two consecutive quarterly increases in mcr,which plaintiffs attribute to aetna supposedly secret policy of underpricing premiums.
during the class period,the price of aetna stock fell from to.the loss of shareholder equity occurred when the alleged underpricing was revealed by aetna reporting of quarterly mcr data.plaintiffs claim that defendants statements about disciplined pricing artificially inflated aetna stock by leading investors to believe that mcr would be lower and that profitability would be higher.
to corroborate their allegations,plaintiffs cite contemporaneous reports by financial analysts and journalists who speculated that aetna was boosting its market share by underpricing premiums.plaintiffs also proffer confidential witness statements by aetna employees who claim to have implemented the relaxed underwriting criteria.other confidential witnesses stated that they personally observed the individual defendants managerial style,from which plaintiffs impute actual knowledge that aetna was underpricing premiums.
defendants statements 
the complaint identifies numerous statements which allegedly misled investors all statements pertain to aetna disciplined pricing of medical insurance premiums.we summarize the relevant statements below.
on october,rowe stated on an analyst conference call,regarding pricing,we continue to adhere to a disciplined pricing policy of achieving premium yields that are in line with medical cost trends.during the same call,williams stated,w e are pricing very clearly in line with our medical cost trend w e have a very strong amount of pricing discipline what we are doing is making certain that we are pricing appropriately as best we can,to be certain that we meeting our shareholder expectations.
on february,rowe and williams participated in another analyst conference call plaintiffs claim that rowe continued to stress aetna disciplined approach to pricing while williams emphasized aetna commitment to profitably grow market share and earnings through disciplined pricing and noted that o ur pricing discipline is unchanged.plaintiffs claim that rowe and williams misled investors by publicly touting a disciplined pricing policy while secretly underpricing premiums to boost market share.
plaintiffs claim that in april,when aetna reported financial results for the first quarter,it concealed the alleged underpricing by falsely attributing an increase in mcr to higher medical expenses 
this increase in the medical cost ratio for the first quarter of reflects a percentage increase in per member medical costs that outpaced the percentage increase in per member premiums,due to higher medical cost trends for inpatient and outpatient facility and physician services offset by a moderation in medical cost trend for ancillary and pharmacy services.
aetna form.plaintiffs claim that this disclosure was misleading because the increase in mcr was caused by the underpricing of premiums,not by higher medical expenses.
on april,williams discussed aetna first quarter results on an analyst conference call and stated,w e continue to adhere to our pricing discipline.on the same call,bennett stated,w e expect a quarterly pattern to reflect a slightly higher mcr in the second quarter compared to the level.plaintiffs claim that williams statement was false because aetna pricing was not disciplined and that bennett statement was misleading because he knew underpricing would cause the second quarter mcr to increase substantially,not slightly.on april,aetna stock price fell by more than,causing a market capitalization loss of billion.
on may,williams discussed aetna first quarter mcr performance on an analyst conference call and stated 
in addition,some have questioned our membership growth and said that we must be pricing aggressively 
of the total fully insured additions,are medicaid advantage,were in student health,in src and in individual.that leaves growth of members from our main customer markets of national,middle and small group.this is solid and balanced growth that is representative of our dedication to pricing,as well as the broad diversification of markets we are actively pursuing.
i will end my comments by reaffirming to you my personal commitment to continue to maintain discipline and rigor in everything we do at aetna.
compl,emphasis and alteration in complaint.
on may,williams spoke at a health care conference and stated 
we also continue as a priority to exhibit commitment to discipline pricing.i think it is important to understand that the management incentives and discipline that we have are aligned to profit increases.we operate a set of fully allocated profit and loss p ls throughout the company where general managers are incented to achieve a discipline level designed to help maximize those margins and not simply to support membership growth.given a decision,we will always take profitability over growth.
compl,emphasis in complaint.plaintiffs claim these statements were false and misleading because williams knew aetna was underpricing premiums and sacrificing profitability for growth.
on july,aetna announced financial results for the second fiscal quarter,including a quarterly increase in mcr.plaintiffs claim that,contrary to bennett april,prediction of a slightly higher mcr in the second quarter,the actual increase of was substantial.that same day,aetna stock price fell by,causing a market capitalization loss of billion.
based on these occurrences,the plaintiffs filed a complaint asserting three causes of action under the securities exchange act of count i alleges violations of exchange act section b,count ii alleges violations of exchange act section a,and count iii alleges violations of exchange act section.
district court dismissal 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,which the district court granted with prejudice.in its thorough and opinion,the district court held that all statements which form the basis of count i were and therefore protected by the statutory safe harbor,c.the court dismissed count ii as derivative of count i,and held that count iii was barred by the statute of limitations.plaintiffs only appeal the dismissal of counts i and ii.

standard of review and jurisdiction

securities exchange act of section b 
the securities exchange act of section b,and regulations promulgated thereunder,prohibit fraud in connection with the sale or purchase of securities.b.b parties injured by securities fraud may bring a private cause of action under section b,which requires proof of six elements a material misrepresentation or omission scienter,a wrongful state of mind a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance,often referred to in cases involving public securities markets cases as transaction causation economic loss and loss causation,a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss.mccabe ernst young,llp,cir citing dura,broudo.this appeal involves only the first element,whether defendants made a material misrepresentation or omission.
federal securities fraud litigation is governed by the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat,which congress enacted a s a check against abusive litigation by private parties tellabs,makor issues rights.the pslra imposes two exacting and distinct pleading requirements for securities fraud actions.first,the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.second,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this title,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.
under the pslra,alleged misrepresentations are not actionable if they fall within the safe harbor for statements.c.the issue on appeal is whether defendants statements were immunized by the safe harbor.
pslra safe harbor for statements 
the pslra safe harbor for statements provides in relevant part 
i n any private action based on an untrue statement of a material fact or omission of a material fact necessary to make the statement not misleading,a person shall not be liable with respect to any statement,whether written or oral,if and to the extent that 
a the statement is 
i identified as a statement,and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actua results to differ materially from those in the statement or 
ii immaterial or 
b the plaintiff fails to prove that the statement 
i if made by a natural person,was made with actual knowledge by that person that the statement was false or misleading or 
ii if made by a business entity,was 
i made by or with the approval of an executive officer of that entity and 
ii made or approved by such officer with actual knowledge by that officer that the statement was false or misleading.
oral statements.in the case of an oral statement,the requirement set forth in paragraph a shall be deemed to be satisfied 
a if the oral statement is accompanied by a cautionary statement 
i that the particular oral statement is a statement and 
ii that the actual results might differ materially from those projected in the statement and 
i the oral statement is accompanied by an oral statement that additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the statement is contained in a readily available written document,or portion thereof 
ii the accompanying oral statement referred to in clause i identifies the document,or portion thereof,that contains the additional information about those factors relating to the statement and 
iii the information contained in that written document is a cautionary statement that satisfies the standard established in paragraph a.
thus,the safe harbor applies to statements that are as defined by the statute provided that they are identified as such,and accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements or immaterial or made without actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.
statutory definition of statement 
our threshold inquiry is whether defendants statements fall within the broad statutory definition of statement,which includes,inter alia,projections of future performance,plans and objectives for future operations,and assumptions underlying statements about future financial,economic or operational performance.i we recently construed the statutory definition in institutional investors group avaya,cir.there,shareholders alleged a fraudulent scheme wherein executives of avaya,a telecommunications company,denied the company was offering unusual price discounts and that its profit margins were being impaired,and then publicized financial projections that could not be achieved because of the price discounting negative effect on profitability.id.at.the shareholders filed suit under section b and alleged two types of misleading statements 
first,there are pricing pressure statements,in which defendants are alleged to have falsely denied avaya was offering unusual discounts and facing significant pricing pressure from market rivals.second,there are statements,in which defendants projected financial results such as operating margin and revenue growth and made positive portrayals,notably the statement that avaya was on track to achieve its goals or projections.
the pricing pressure statements were made by avaya chief financial officer,who denied that deteriorating demand adversely affected the market price for the company products the statements contained projections,but described those projections in language.for example,defendants stated,our first quarter results position us to meet our goals for the year w e are on track to meet our goals for the year,even though there were some aspects to our performance that are below our expectations and that we are working on to improve.id.at.we concluded that such a mixed statement is not entitled to the safe harbor with respect to the part of the statement that refers to the present.id.at.however,when read in context,the statements,we are on track and first quarter results position us could not meaningfully be distinguished from the future projection of which they are a part,avaya future goals.id.to the extent that those statements contained assertions about the present,we found the assertions of current fact are too vague to be actionable.id.
as we noted in avaya,it was distinguishable from cases in which the allegedly misleading statements contained separately discernable references to the present.id.for example,in makor issues rights,tellabs,the statement that sales were still going strong was not because it would be misleading if defendant knew that its sales were about to collapse,cir.in in re stone webster,securities litigation,the statement that the defendant has on hand and has access to sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated needs was not because t he part of the statement that speaks of the quantity of cash on hand speaks of a present fact,cir.
in the case before us,the allegedly misleading representations consist of vague and generalized statements about disciplined pricing the district court properly began its analysis by ascertaining what factual assertions were conveyed by those statements.according to the court,the parties had agreed that disciplined pricing referred to aetna expectation of achieving premium yields that are in line with aetna medical cost trend.based on this understanding of the term disciplined pricing,the court concluded that the statements were because they expressed expectations about aetna medical cost trend,a specific measure of future performance.so construed the representations were within the safe harbor definition of statement.see i b statement of the plans and objectives of management for future operations and c statement of future economic performance.applying avaya,the court found that,while certain elements of defendants statements were partly historical and partly,statements such as remains consistent,is unchanged,and we continue to adhere to,those elements could not be distinguished from the statements assertions about the future.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court misunderstood what defendants meant by the term disciplined pricing.plaintiffs contend that,by engaging in disciplined pricing,aetna is telling investors that,based upon what the company currently estimates costs to be for the policies it is writing,these policies will be profitable.plaintiffs argue that,although the statements contain projections about future profitability,they also convey information about current pricing which is necessarily based on historic data.plaintiffs also assert that the district court overlooked the allegedly misleading statement in aetna first quarter form,which contained an allegedly false,explanation for the increase in mcr.
defendants contend that plaintiffs characterization is wrong because aetna explicitly defined disciplined pricing as a policy of achieving premium yields that are in line with its medical cost trend.they argue that the disciplined pricing statements are classic statements because whether aetna succeeds in achieving premium yields in line with our medical cost trend can not be confirmed until future particular,actual medical costs incurred on known.defendants assert that the statements are not actionable because they are vague projections of future profitability.regarding the allegedly misleading form disclosure,defendants argue that the explicitly stated the fact that plaintiffs claim was fraudulently concealed,that for some insurance policies,medical costs outpaced the percentage increase in per member premiums in other words that aetna underpriced some of its policies 
our examination begins with a determination of which aspect of the statements are false.see in re stone webster,at.plaintiffs claim that defendants misrepresented aetna underwriting practices during the class period by referring to its pricing as disciplined.however,whether aetna pricing was,in fact,disciplined could not have been determined at the time defendants made the statements.the term disciplined pricing describes a policy of setting prices in relation to future medical costs.at the time the statements were made,the medical costs had not yet been incurred and could not be ascertained until later.
thus,to the extent that disciplined pricing said anything about the current price of premiums,it did so in the form of a projection.this is evident from plaintiffs own understanding of the term.as noted above,plaintiffs contend that by engaging in disciplined pricing,aetna is telling investors that,based upon what the company currently estimates costs to be for the policies it is writing,these policies will be profitable.statements about future profitability and assumptions underlying management expectations about the future fall squarely within the definition of statement.i a and d.
plaintiffs further claim that aetna april form disclosure was misleading because it falsely attributed the first quarter increase in mcr to higher medical costs without revealing the underpricing of premiums.while we agree that the safe harbor does not apply to this statement because it is historical rather than,we find the statement itself contains no falsity.even accepting plaintiffs allegations about underpricing as true,the statement asserts the very fact allegedly concealed,that the increase in medical costs exceeded the increase in premium revenue.aetna need not adopt plaintiffs characterization of underpricing in its financial statements to avoid liability for securities fraud 
for these reasons,we hold that the allegedly misleading assertions regarding aetna disciplined pricing policy fall within the safe harbor definition of statement 
meaningful cautionary statements 
the safe harbor provides that statements must be accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement.c a i.this aspect of the safe harbor is analogous to the bespeaks caution doctrine,which holds that cautionary language,if sufficient,renders the alleged omissions or misrepresentations immaterial as a matter of law.ep medsystems,echocath,cir.cautionary language must be extensive,specific,and directly related to the alleged misrepresentation.gsc partners cdo fund washington,cir.cautionary statements disclosed in sec filings may be incorporated by reference they do not have to be in the same document as the statements.in re merck.sec,cir.
plaintiffs argue that the cautionary language,which aetna provided in financial reports filed with the sec,was insufficient because it failed to disclose the alleged practice of underpricing premiums,and only addressed risks related to medical cost projections.the cautionary statements included the following language 
our ability to forecast and manage health care costs and implement increases in premium rates affects our profitability.our profitability depends in large part on accurately forecasting health care costs and on our ability to appropriately manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria 
our ability to forecast health care and other benefit costs,detect changes in these costs,and achieve appropriate pricing affects our profitability.we continue to be vigilant in our pricing and have increased our premiums for new and renewal business in.premiums in the health business are generally fixed for periods.accordingly,future cost increases in excess of medical cost projections reflected in pricing can not be recovered in the contract year through higher premiums.as a result,the company results are particularly sensitive to the price increases it projects in advance of renewal of the business.there can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of medical cost projections assumed for pricing purposes,and if the rate of increase in medical costs in were to exceed the levels projected for pricing purposes,our results would be materially adversely affected.
this language provides clear warning to investors that the accuracy of medical costs can not be assured,actual medical costs may exceed projections assumed for purposes of setting premiums,medical costs in excess of projections can not be recovered through higher premiums,and inaccurate medical cost projections can have a materially negative effect on profitability.we find this language adequate under c a i because it provided meaningful,extensive,and specific caution directly related to the statements concerning disciplined pricing.
materiality 
the safe harbor applies to statements that are not material.c a ii.a statement or omission is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to act.tsc industries,northway.see basic levinson,expressly adopt ing the tsc industries standard of materiality for the b and rule context.a material misrepresentation or omission is actionable if it significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic,at quoting tsc industries,at.
