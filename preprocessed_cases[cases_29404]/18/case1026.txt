we explore once again the sometimes complex relationship between state and federal civil proceedings when parties in the midst of litigation on one side of the divide file factually related proceedings on the other.understandably concerned with judicial economy and respect for ongoing state proceedings,the district court dismissed the federal suit under the younger abstention doctrine.determining that abstention was not required,we return the matter to district court to allow appellant diversity action to proceed.
facts and procedural history 
in,donald roden roden was hired as president and chief operating officer of bergen brunswig corporation bbc,the predecessor company to amerisourcebergen corporation abc.at this time,roden and bbc entered into an employment agreement the agreement providing that roden would have his employment with bbc consistently extended monthly on a rolling basis and would not be fired except for cause,as defined in the agreement.additionally,the agreement provided that roden was entitled to participate in bbc supplemental executive retirement plan the serp,as well as its loan program the loan program.
four years after he was hired and two years after being promoted to chief executive officer ceo,roden was given written notice of bbc intention to terminate his employment for a reason that apparently did not qualify as cause under the agreement and on terms that may have conflicted with those provided for in the agreement.roden thereafter filed a complaint against bbc in the superior court in orange county,california the california superior court claiming that bbc breached the agreement and that roden was therefore entitled to his full salary for three years past his termination date and was,in all other respects,entitled to be treated as bbc ceo until that date 
specifically,roden claimed that he was entitled to estimated future benefits under the serp of no less than and a due date and based on a november,termination date for the loan he took out under the loan program 
shortly thereafter,roden and bbc entered into a settlement agreement,and a judgment incorporating its terms was entered on july,the judgment,as follows 
in favor of roden in the amount of,less legally required deductions 
continuation of the benefits provided in sections d which includes participation in the serp,e and i which includes participation in the loan program of roden employment contract and 
reasonable attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined by the court.
believing bbc had not fully complied with this judgment,roden sought to force compliance in california superior court.after briefing and argument,that court ordered implementation of the judgment first order finding,in relevant part,that roden entitlement to benefits under the serp had vested and that roden loan was not absolved by the judgment but would not become due until november.the first order continued emphasis added 
bbc is required to accord roden the same treatment as the other senior officers of bbc who received loans from this november loan program with respect to any forgiveness,extensions,payment of interest and the like.
bbc appealed the first order to the california court of appeal,which unanimously affirmed.th,d.
when roden attempted to enforce the first order and collect his serp benefits,bbc opposed his request,claiming that roden was entitled to a lesser sum under the serp plan than he had alleged.roden appealed this determination pursuant to company policy,and the final administrative review of the matter yielded a decision that roden was entitled to in serp benefits.apparently with an aim of pursuing his rights under allows an erisa plan beneficiary to pursue court action if he is dissatisfied with an administrative determination of his erisa benefits,a,requested discovery from abc which,by this point,had stepped into bbc shoes regarding the amount of benefits he was entitled to receive under the serp.
at this point,abc sought to remove roden bbc from the california courts to federal court claiming that roden discovery request had transformed the case into an erisa action,which is removable to federal court at the defendant request.see metro.life ins.taylor,d.the district court rejected this argument and remanded the case back to the california courts 
undeterred,abc filed its own action in federal district court,requesting both a judgment that roden breached his contract with abc by failing to repay his loan count i,as well as a declaration of abc duties and obligations to roden under the,for a proper calculation of roden serp benefits count ii.the district court dismissed abc two claims relying on the basic premise that resolving abc claims at the federal level would interfere with ongoing state court proceedings regarding overlapping issues abc appealed to this court,arguing that the district court erred in dismissing its claims.
shortly before oral argument took place in this case,the california superior court entered a second order implementing the judgment second order.the second order declared that roden was entitled to in serp benefits but was not entitled to any forgiveness of the loans he had taken from abc under the loan program.both parties have appealed the second order to the california court of appeal.
in light of these recent abc agrees will squarely resolve the issue of roden entitlement under the concedes that the district court was within its discretion to decline to entertain count ii.see in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction,any court of the united states may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party emphasis added gov t employees ins.dizol,cir en banc if there are parallel state proceedings involving the same issues and parties pending at the time the federal declaratory action is filed,there is a presumption that the entire suit should be heard in state court.we are thus called upon to decide only whether the district court properly dismissed count 
discussion 
if the district court had the same discretion to decline to hear claims for monetary damages as it does to decline to hear claims for declaratory relief,we would surely uphold the dismissal of count parties should be strongly discouraged from attempting to drag federal courts into disputes already significantly underway in state courts.
moreover,we regret the significant to the parties and to the two already overburdened court by abc decision to file its breach of contract claim in federal court when it could have just as easily filed the very same claim in the california courts,which have been competently handling these matters for over six years.
nevertheless,we are aware of the virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them.river water conservation dist.united states,d,and must decide whether the district court properly understood the scope of this obligation when it dismissed count i under the doctrine announced in younger harris,d.we conclude that it did not and that count i was improperly dismissed under younger.we also conclude that dismissal of count i can not be affirmed under either the act,or the doctrine.we therefore reverse the dismissal of count i and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
younger abstention 
the younger abstention doctrine,as originally articulated by the supreme court,forbid s federal courts from stay ing or enjoin ing pending state court proceedings.younger,at.roden argues that allowing abc breach of contract claim to proceed in federal court would be the functional equivalent of enjoining the ongoing postjudgment proceedings in roden bbc and,thus,that the younger doctrine required the federal court to abstain from considering,and thereby dismiss,count 
abc counters that,although its breach of contract claim may create a potential for conflict with the enforcement of a single state court judgment,this is an insufficient basis for federal court abstention under younger.specifically,abc argues that the district court incorrectly stated the younger doctrine elements and improperly expanded the important state interest and conflict elements to encompass minimal state interests and potential conflicts.after reviewing the district court dismissal de novo,see gilbertson albright,cir en banc,we agree and hold that the district court had a duty to adjudicate the controversy properly before it,champion int l brown,cir,even if adjudicating this particular controversy would have amounted to little more than a ministerial entry of judgment based on the collateral estoppel effects of decisions already made by the california courts.
abstention and the younger elements 
the district court dismissed count i after concluding that o n balance,it appears that all three elements of younger abstention are met.
however,when a federal plaintiff seeks monetary damages rather than injunctive or declaratory relief in a case requiring abstention under younger,dismissal is not the appropriate procedural remedy.see gilbertson,at.as the gilbertson court held,although younger principles apply to actions at law as well as for injunctive or declaratory relief,federal courts should not dismiss actions where damages are at issue rather,damages actions should be stayed until the state proceedings are completed.id.emphasis added.accordingly,even if abstention under younger were required as to count i,the district court should have stayed abc federal suit pending the conclusion of roden bbc in the california court system,rather than dismissing count i altogether.
in addition,balancing the younger elements,rather than determining whether each element,on its own,is satisfied,conflicts with the requirement that federal courts abstain only in those cases falling within the carefully defined boundaries of federal abstention doctrines.new orleans pub,council of city of new orleans,d nopsi.as virtually all cases discussing these doctrines emphasize,the limited circumstances in which abstention by federal courts is appropriate remain the exception rather than the rule,green city of tucson,cir en banc quoting nopsi,at,rev on other grounds by gilbertson,at,and,thus,when each of an abstention doctrine requirements are not strictly met,the doctrine should not be applied.see middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d abstaining only after determining that each element of younger doctrine was satisfied nopsi,at.not abstaining when one element of younger doctrine was not satisfied.
finally,there are actually four elements that must be satisfied before the younger doctrine requires abstention.the district court recognized only three of them,apparently taking cues from a number of our cases that have focused on only the three middlesex elements and agreeing with roden that,to the extent a fourth element ever existed,this court en banc decision in gilbertson did away with it.see gilbertson,at en banc w e recede from our statements in green city of tucson,cir en banc,that direct interference is a threshold requirement,or element,of younger abstention.according to the district court,abstention is required whenever there are ongoing state judicial proceedings the proceedings implicate important state interests and the state proceedings provide the plaintiff with an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims,meredith oregon,cir citing middlesex,at,even if the federal action does not enjoin the ongoing state court proceedings or have the practical effect of doing so.
this is incorrect.as gilbertson makes clear,while there are only three threshold elements to application of younger,there is a vital and indispensable fourth element the policies behind the younger doctrine must be implicated by the actions requested of the federal court.in the language of the gilbertson court 
if a proceeding is ongoing,and if it implicates important state interests,and if the federal litigant is not barred from litigating federal constitutional issues in that proceeding,then a federal court action that would enjoin the proceeding,or have the practical effect of doing so,would interfere in a way that younger disapproves.
at emphases in original.thus,once the three middlesex elements are satisfied,the court does not automatically abstain,but abstains only if there is a reason to,if the court action would enjoin,or have the practical effect of enjoining,ongoing state court proceedings.id 
accordingly,abstaining under younger as to count i was proper only if all four younger requirements were strictly satisfied.abc concedes the first and third threshold elements,and we agree they were both met here the proceedings in roden bbc were ongoing,and abc had an opportunity to raise its federal claims in these state court proceedings as to the second threshold element and the fourth element,however,we find that they were not met here and,thus,that younger abstention was improper in this case.
younger abstention improper because no important state interest implicated 
the second threshold element of younger is satisfied when the state interests in the ongoing proceeding are so important that exercise of the federal judicial power would disregard the comity between the states and the national government.pennzoil texaco,d.the district court reasoned that,because california has an admittedly important interest in the enforcement of its judgment and orders,and because resolving abc breach of contract claim in federal court could potentially create a conflict with the first order which partially resolved roden obligations under the loan program,the second threshold element weigh ed in favor of abstention.
the supreme court has noted that states have important interests in administering certain aspects of their judicial systems,and that,in particular,states have an interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of their courts.pennzoil,at.taken out of context,these statements suggest that california interest in enforcing the judgment in this particular case is of sufficient importance to meet younger second threshold element.but we have made it clear that t he importance of the state interest is measured by considering its significance broadly,rather than by focusing on the state interest in the resolution of an individual case.baffert cal.horse racing,cir see also champion int l,d at a challenge to only one order,not the whole procedure is not a substantial enough interference with a state administrative and judicial processes to justify abstention.
accordingly,binding precedent prevents the court from finding that california interest in enforcing this one particular opposed to a state wholesale interest in preserving its procedure for posting an appeal bond,see pennzoil,at,or its interest in retaining a particular contempt of court scheme,see juidice vail,d qualifies as sufficiently important to satisfy younger second threshold element.
cognizant of this reality,roden argues that california interest in adjudicating conflicts in a timely evidenced by its express goal of resolving percent of civil cases within a year of filing,see cal.gov t code cal.rules of,std.f should qualify as sufficiently important for younger abstention purposes.to support this argument,roden cites a number of california and federal cases for the that courts have an interest in prompt resolution of the cases on their dockets.
while true,this is not the type of important state interest that animates the younger abstention doctrine.the goal of younger abstention is to avoid federal court interference with uniquely state interests such as preservation of these states peculiar statutes,schemes,and procedures.roden cites no case,nor could he,holding that federal courts should abstain in favor of state courts when a universal judicial as the prompt resolution of at stake because neither california interest in enforcement of a single state court judgment nor its interest in judicial efficiency is sufficiently important to satisfy younger second threshold element,the district court erred when it found this element satisfied.
younger abstention improper because ongoing state court proceedings would not be actually or effectively enjoined 
although we would be obligated to find the district court decision to abstain under younger erroneous based solely on the lack of an important state interest,see supra part,we also think it wise to address the district court implicit finding that a potential conflict with ongoing state court proceedings is sufficient to meet the fourth element of younger abstention as the supreme court has held,the mere potential for conflict in the results of adjudications does not,without more,warrant staying exercise of federal jurisdiction,much less abdicating it entirely.river,at.rather,abstention is only appropriate in the narrow category of circumstances in which the federal court action would actually enjoin the ongoing state proceeding,or have the practical effect of doing so.gilbertson,at.
here,deciding count i would neither enjoin,nor have the practical effect of enjoining,the proceedings in california superior court after all,roden has not yet filed any motion in california superior court disputing his obligation to repay the loan,and abc has not yet filed a counterclaim in the state court proceedings attempting to enforce its right to receive repayment.thus,the district court finding of an conflict based on a potential for conflict was erroneous.
roden the requisite interference with ongoing state proceedings occurs whenever the relief sought in federal court would,if entertained,likely result in a judgment whose preclusive effect would prevent the state court from independently adjudicating the issues before also been rejected.as explained by this court in green,at,rev on other grounds by gilbertson,at 
t he possibility of a race to judgment is inherent in a system of dual sovereigns and,in the absence of exceptional circumstances.river,at,d,that possibility alone is insufficient to overcome the weighty interest in the federal courts exercising their jurisdiction over cases properly before them.
indeed,the supreme court has rejected the notion that federal courts should abstain whenever a suit involves claims or issues simultaneously being litigated in state court merely because whichever court rules first will,via the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel,preclude the other from deciding that claim or issue.see vendo,d atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d.kline burke const.see also noel hall,cir bennett medtronic,cir.although abstention to avoid concurrent,duplicative litigation is available in some very limited particular,when the requested relief in federal court is a declaratory judgment,see wilton seven falls,d the general rule remains that stated in kline,at.
each court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time,without reference to the proceedings in the other court.whenever a judgment is rendered in one of the courts and pleaded in the other,the effect of that judgment is to be determined by the application of the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel by the court in which the action is still pending in the orderly exercise of its jurisdiction,as it would determine any other question of fact or law arising in the progress of the case.
thus,as long as the action requested of the federal,issuing an ordinary judgment requiring an individual to pay breach of contract not enjoin or have the practical effect of enjoining the ongoing state court,california proceedings in roden abstention is not warranted.see gilbertson,at.it is clear to us that retaining jurisdiction over,and proceeding with,count i would not have enjoined or in any way impeded the ongoing litigation in roden bbc.rather,the roden bbc proceedings would have been free to continue simultaneously with the federal suit,and abc would have simply been bound by the rulings of the california state courts under the doctrine of collateral estoppel to the extent the state courts decided the relevant issues before the federal court did concurrent consideration,not abstention,is the solution,and the district court therefore erred in finding that the potential conflict was one the younger doctrine required the court to avoid.see.river,at.
for the reasons discussed above,the district court erred in dismissing count i on the basis of younger abstention.as the following two sections explain,although this court may affirm on any basis supported by the record even if the district court did not rely on that basis,count i can not be dismissed under either the act,or the doctrine.united states washington,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted 
the act prohibits federal courts from grant ing an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.whereas the younger doctrine has been expanded to prohibit federal courts from issuing an injunction or its functional equivalent when doing so would interfere with an ongoing state court proceeding,the plain language of speaks only to actual injunctions.count i of abc federal complaint does not request an injunction thus,the act does not require its dismissal.
moreover,even if the statute still applies to certain requests for declaratory relief,see heinz owens,cir a remedy closely related to a formal certainly does not apply to requests for money damages that,if granted,would render state court litigation nugatory due to preclusion doctrines.this could arguably be the province of the judicially created younger doctrine,but is certainly not the province of an unambiguous statute that says nothing about the type of relief abc requests in count because abstention is improper under younger,it is a fortiori improper under the act,and this theory of dismissal is rejected.
iii.doctrine 
the doctrine provides that federal district courts lack jurisdiction to exercise appellate review over final state court judgments.henrichs valley view,cir see also rooker fid.trust.feldman,d.roden argues that this doctrine prohibits the district court from entertaining abc breach of contract action because doing so would effectively reverse the california superior court decision that a federal interpret and enforce the original judgment in roden bbc.
roden argument is incorrect and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the doctrine.abc did not ask the district court to interpret or enforce the roden bbc judgment,nor did it seek to reverse any of the california superior court decisions indeed,count i makes no mention of the state court judgment whatsoever.rather,the most abc has asked a federal court to do is redress an injury,its alleged loss of plus interest that the california court has chosen not to redress as this court recently explained in henrichs,at,p reclusion,not,applies when a federal plaintiff complains of an injury that was not caused by the state court,but which the state court has previously failed to rectify.quoting noel hall,cir.
thus,even if all of abc contentions with regard to its breach of contract claim had been resolved adversely to abc in state scenario belied by the first and second orders issued by the california superior court,which have both come out in abc favor with respect to roden obligations under the loan would not bar abc federal claim rather,res judicata or collateral estoppel would.accordingly,this theory of dismissal is rejected,as well.
conclusion 
it appears that abc federal action is an attempt to secure a binding and enforceable court judgment requiring roden to repay the loan previously extended to him by bbc.although most of the essential issues have already been decided in state court and thus collateral estoppel will presumably forbid relitigation of these issues in federal court,there is no legal doctrine preventing abc from asking a federal than a state enter an enforceable judgment against roden,if one be appropriate.while abc offers no explanation for its choice of,it seems that it would have been equally effective,and far more efficient,for abc to seek a breach of contract judgment in state court is powerless to prevent abc from exercising its right,as a plaintiff,to choose its forum.indeed,because dismissal of count i can not be justified under younger,the act,or the doctrine,the district court order must be reversed in part,and count i must be remanded to the district court for further proce
