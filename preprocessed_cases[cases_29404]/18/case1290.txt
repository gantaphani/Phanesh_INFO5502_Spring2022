in this action for recovery of unpaid overtime compensation,the question presented is whether plaintiff has stated a cause of action against any of eight individuals who were officers or directors and shareholders of the delaware corporation,or its california subsidiary,that owns the automobile painting business for which he formerly worked.the court of appeal upheld the trial court sustaining of a demurrer.we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
background 
plaintiff steven reynolds,on behalf of himself and those similarly situated alleges he was employed by defendants earl scheib,and earl scheib of california,hereafter jointly scheib,or the corporate defendants,and by defendants bement,buchalter,colburn,helm,kyman,seigel,sunkin,and smith hereafter collectively the individual defendants,as a shop manager and an assistant shop manager at several locations of defendants automobile painting business.defendants own and operate approximately automobile painting shops in california.
the individual defendants are shareholders of the corporate defendants and have at material times been agents officers or directors of the corporate defendants.plaintiff alleges the individual defendants each directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employed or exercised control over wages,hours,or working conditions of class members.each individual defendant authorized,directed,sanctioned,consented,cooperated,approved,aided,instigated,assisted,participated in,and voted for tortious and unlawful acts of commission or omission which have operated to the prejudice and injury of the class,including but not limited to causing the corporate defendants to violate the overtime regulations found in the applicable wage order and commit other statutory violations.notwithstanding each individual defendant knew or reasonably should have known that his conduct conduct under his control was injuring the class,each failed to take or order appropriate action to avoid the harm.
according to plaintiff,defendants had a policy and practice to require their shop managers in their earl scheib automobile paint shops to work long overtime hours without overtime compensation.defendants allegedly misclassified class members as exempt employees and deprived them of statutory overtime compensation in order to maximize defendants profits and income.as a consequence of defendants actions,plaintiff and those similarly situated have not received statutorily guaranteed overtime compensation that is owed to them.
plaintiff initially filed a complaint only against scheib,seeking damages as well as equitable relief on behalf of himself,the general public,and similarly situated employees who worked at scheib automobile painting shops in california from march,to the present.plaintiff subsequently added as a defendant scheib president,christian bement,who and removed the case to federal court.after the case was remanded to state court,plaintiff named the seven remaining individual defendants,who thereafter demurred.the trial court sustained the demurrers with leave to amend.
in the operative first amended complaint,plaintiff alleged numerous causes of action,including claims denominated as failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of labor code sections,and applicable wage orders,unlawful deduction of wages,and various tortious violations of the labor code.
the individual defendants demurred the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to some causes of action and without leave to amend as to the others.plaintiff did not amend,judgment was entered for defendants,and the entire action was dismissed with prejudice as against the individual defendants.the court of appeal affirmed.we granted plaintiff petition for review.

overview state remedies for unpaid overtime 
an employee wage rights may be provided for in an employment contract and also are closely regulated by statute.the labor code prescribes such matters as the time and manner of paying wages,minimum wage requirements,and mandatory overtime pay cuadra millan cal th,d,see,subd.a.in addition,the industrial welfare commission iwc is empowered to formulate regulations known as wage orders governing employment in the state of california.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,tidewater.the iwc has promulgated orders that remain in force today,relating to specific industries and occupations,one general minimum wage order that applies to all california employers and employees excluding public employees and outside salespersons,and one order implementing the restoration and workplace flexibility act stats,ch.see,tit,et.especially,order regulating wages,hours,and working conditions in the transportation industry hereafter wage order.the latter,wage order,is the iwc wage order applicable to persons employed in an automobile painting business.see wage order,subd.n.
the division of labor standards enforcement dlse,headed by the labor commissioner,is empowered to enforce california labor laws,including iwc wage orders.tidewater,supra,cal th at,d.the labor commissioner is required to determine all matters arising under his or her jurisdiction,including questions concerning the employment status of any wage claimant.post associates cal th,d,citing,subd.a.the legislature also has provided california workers a private right of action to vindicate their overtime rights.see,subd.a.
pursuant to the foregoing scheme,if an employer fails to pay wages in the amount,time or manner required by contract or by statute,the employee has two principal options.the employee may seek judicial relief by filing an ordinary civil action against the employer for breach of contract for the wages prescribed by statute.or the employee may seek administrative relief by filing a wage claim with the commissioner pursuant to a special statutory scheme codified in sections to.the latter option was added by legislation enacted in stats,ch,and is commonly known as the berman hearing procedure,after the name of its sponsor.cuadra millan,supra,cal th at,d.we also have recognized that,in an action brought pursuant to the unfair competition law bus,et,an employee may recover payment of unlawfully withheld wages as a restitutionary remedy.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d.
in addition to the foregoing avenues for the recovery of wages,the labor commissioner or the employee may seek certain civil penalties when the employee is not paid statutorily guaranteed wages,subd.a see,penalty for failure to pay statutorily prescribed wages,penalty for unlawfully withholding wages,penalty for violating chapter or iwc order.under the recently enacted labor code private attorneys general act of et,added by stats,ch,n otwithstanding any other provision of law,any provision of the labor c ode that provides for a civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the labor and workforce development agency or any of its departments,divisions,commissions,boards,agencies or employees may,as an alternative,be enforced,and the penalty recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees,subd.a.
plaintiffs exercises control liability theory 
in a series of regulations concerning employment in a wide variety of industries and occupations,the iwc since has defined employer to include an individual who exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person.wage order,subd.f hereafter the iwc employer definition.noting that section,in obligating an employer to pay overtime compensation,does not define that term,and that section,in providing any employee with a private right of action to recover unpaid minimum or overtime wages,does not specify potential defendants,plaintiff argues we should apply the iwc employer definition in order to determine who are proper defendants here.that definition,plaintiff asserts,includes corporate control figures like the individual defendants.
while plaintiff does not contend any statute expressly subjects corporate control figures to liability,as employers,for unpaid wages,he argues that we can infer the iwc authority to specify appropriate section defendants from its powers to fix a minimum wage and to provide safeguards to insure employees receive the minimum and overtime wages due them.see cal.restaurant clark cal d,discussing iwc power to provide safeguards to insure receipt of the minimum wage.applying the iwc employer definition to corporate control figures,plaintiff posits,is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of section.see agricultural labor relations bd.superior court cal d,see generally,scope of agency authority,validity of regulations.
the individual defendants disagree that the iwc employer definition applies to this case,insisting none of them may be held personally liable for any overtime or other compensation owed to plaintiff by his corporate employer.they argue that california labor statutes do not impose personal liability on corporate officers and directors for unpaid wages owed by a corporate employer and that common law principles protect them against incurring civil liability,as employers,for economic harm plaintiff corporate employer may have caused him.
in resolving the question,we look in the first instance not to the iwc authority nor to the asserted necessity of its employer definition,but to the iwc intent in promulgating the employer definition.the best indicator of that intent is the language of the provision itself.williams superior court cal th,d.as plaintiff acknowledges,the plain language of wage order defining employer does not expressly impose liability under section on individual corporate agents.nor can we infer that the legislature,simply by amending sections and several times after the iwc adopted its employer definition,impliedly intended to incorporate that definition into a unified remedial scheme comprised of those statutes and the regulations 
a statute will be construed in light of the common law unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally indicates otherwise.california of health facilities department of health services cal th,d.we agree with the individual defendants that,had the legislature intended to depart from the common law by engrafting wage order onto section,it would have more clearly manifested that intent.neither section nor section contains any reference to the iwc employer definition section in detailing certain obligations of an employer leaves that term undefined section,without mentioning employer,simply provides that any employee receiving less than the applicable legal minimum wage or legal overtime compensation is entitled to recover the same in a civil action.in this statute referring to employees without defining the have generally applied the common law test of employment.metropolitan water dist.superior court cal th,d,discussing,subd.b.california courts have applied this interpretive rule to various statutes dealing with public and private employment.metropolitan water,supra,at,d,see also id.at,fn,d,citing cases.
under the common law,corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency are not personally liable for the corporate employer failure to pay its employees wages.see,oppenheimer robinson d,see generally fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations perm.ed.supp.this is true regardless of whether a corporation failure to pay such wages,in particular circumstances,breaches only its employment contract or also breaches a tort duty of care.it is well established that corporate agents and employees acting for and on behalf of a corporation can not be held liable for inducing a breach of the corporation contract.shoemaker myers cal d.and d irectors or officers of a corporation do not incur personal liability for torts of the corporation merely by reason of their official position united states liab.ins,cal d.
for the foregoing reasons,we agree with the court of appeal that plaintiff can not state a section cause of action against the individual defendants.had the legislature meant in section to expose to personal civil liability any corporate agent who exercises control over an employee wages,hours,or working conditions,it would have manifested its intent more clearly than by mere silence after the iwc promulgation of wage order.
the dlse,as amicus curiae,warns that the court of appeal failure to accept plaintiff theory of corporate agent liability based on the iwc employer definition may pose an obstacle to the labor commissioner ability to recover some wages owed to california employees.apparently it is existing dlse practice in wage claim actions prosecuted or informally heard and determined by the labor commissioner to apply the iwc employer definition,including its exercises control prong,so as to permit the naming of certain corporate agents as joint defendants with corporate employers.the dlse,concerned lest its practice in this regard be called into question,urges that we recognize plaintiff theory and direct california courts to apply it in private court actions as the dlse apparently does in the administrative context in light of federal cases determining,on the basis of economic reality,who qualifies as an employer under the flsa et.
we previously have determined that the dlse administrative policies are not due general interpretive deference unless they are promulgated in accordance with the administrative procedure act,section et of the government code.see tidewater,supra,cal th at,d.and while it is true that f ederal decisions have frequently guided our interpretation of state labor provisions the language of which parallels that of federal statutes building material construction teamsters union farrell cal d,where the language or intent of state and federal labor laws substantially differ s,reliance on federal regulations or interpretations to construe state regulations is misplaced ramirez yosemite water cal th,d.while the flsa contains an express definition of employer d section does not.
in any event,we have no occasion in resolving this private dispute to address questions concerning the dlses use,in administrative proceedings,of the iwc employer definition.nor are we persuaded that our narrow holding that plaintiff can not employ the iwc employer definition to state a section cause of action against the individual defendants will have the sweeping effect the dlse fears.defendants concede the dlse may utilize the iwc employer definition in exercising its prosecutorial discretion to determine who are appropriate wage claim defendants.and while the dlse in its adjudicatory role see generally berman hearings,tit,is of course obligated to follow the substantive law,subd.a,there is no question that iwc wage orders are among the valid sources thereof,subd.a.
we also disagree that our holding today poses an obstacle to the labor commissioner recovering wages owed california workers.imposition of individual civil liability under the iwc employer definition is not the only means by which an employee can seek recovery against a corporate agent.the berman hearing procedure is designed to provide a speedy,informal,and affordable method of resolving wage claims cuadra millan,supra,cal th at,d,and,as defendants concede,nothing in that process precludes hearing officers from finding individual corporate agents liable for unpaid wages when such liability is proven on established common law or statutory theories.moreover,pursuant to section,subdivision a,any person acting on behalf of an employer who violates,or causes to be violated a statute or wage order relating to working hours is subject to a civil penalty,payable to the affected employee,equal to the amount of any underpaid wages as noted earlier,the legislature has provided that aggrieved employees may under certain circumstances maintain civil actions to recover such penalties,subd.a.
liability under frances village green owners.
in frances village green owners cal d,frances,we recognized that corporate directors may be jointly liable with the corporation and may be joined as defendants if they personally directed or participated in the tortious conduct.id.at,citing numerous authorities.their liability,if any,we noted,stems from their own tortious conduct,not from their status as directors or officers of the enterprise.id.at.director status therefore neither immunizes a person from individual liability nor subjects him or her to vicarious liability.id.at.
we agree with the court of appeal that plaintiff can not state a cause of action under frances t.as noted,frances applies to tortious conduct frances,supra,cal d at,and a simple failure to comply with statutory overtime requirements,such as plaintiff alleges here,does not qualify.see hays bank of america d,applying flsa,noting federal cases have definitely determined that claims for such overtime wages are not ex delicto or founded on tort.
plaintiff boilerplate allegations of conspiracy do not alter the situation.agents and employees of a corporation can not conspire with their corporate principal or employer where they act in their official capacities on behalf of the corporation and not as individuals for their individual advantage.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,fn,d,quoting wise southern pacific d.there can be no liability,moreover,if the alleged conspirator,though a participant in the agreement underlying the injury,was not personally bound by the duty violated by the wrongdoing and was only acting as the agent or employee of the party who did have that duty.doctors superior court cal d,see also id.at,notwithstanding alleged conspiracy,insurer agent not liable where duty is imposed by statute solely upon persons engaged in the business of insurance.
nor has plaintiff alleged that the individual defendants here misappropriated to themselves,as individuals for their individual advantage,the unpaid wages he alleges his former employer owes him.he alleges,rather,that they caused the wages to be withheld by and in the accounts of the corporate defendants for the defendants collective benefit.under such circumstances,california courts have declined to allow actions such as the instant one to proceed.see,oppenheimer robinson,supra,d at,employee not personally liable for nonpayment of wages to fellow employee oppenheimer moebius d,same,where no allegation that defendant employees had any duty to plaintiff to pay his wages or that they were guilty of any wrong.
d.other theories of liability 
the trial court,as noted,sustained defendants demurrer with leave to amend as to some of plaintiffs purported causes of action and without leave to amend as to the others.plaintiff decided to appeal rather than amend his complaint.
it is the rule that when a plaintiff is given the opportunity to amend his complaint and elects not to do so,strict construction of the complaint is required and it must be presumed that the plaintiff has stated as strong a case as he can.gonzales state of california d.see also chicago title ins.great western financial cal d,the plaintiffs failure to amend constrained us to determine only whether appellants state a cause of action,not whether they might have been able to do so.leave to amend further is properly denied when a plaintiff fails to amend to correct defects on the basis of which special demurrers to a previous complaint were sustained.chicago title ins,supra,at.plaintiff concedes the court of appeal below correctly concluded he can not amend the complaint to allege more specific facts respecting his causes of action denominated in the first amended complaint as conversion,negligence per se,negligence,violation of business and professions code section et,declaratory relief,accounting,and injunctive relief.in his petition for review,however,plaintiff asked us to decide whether the court of appeal erred in denying him leave to amend his causes of action for unlawful deductions and for allegedly tortious violations of various labor code sections.
we are not persuaded either court below erred.whether to grant leave to amend a complaint is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.campbell regents of the university of cal.cal th,d.on appeal,the burden of proving a reasonable possibility exists that a complaints defects can be cured by amendment rests squarely on the plaintiff.blank kirwan cal d.we agree with defendants that plaintiff forfeited any further leave to amend by failing to request leave in the trial court or to argue in the court of appeal that the trial courts denial as to specific causes of action was error.
plaintiffs oblique comment at the hearing on the demurrer that i suppose we could state a common law fraud claim can not fairly be interpreted as a request for leave to amend his complaint to include additional factual allegations.see generally witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.nor did plaintiffs assertion in his opening brief below that the standards set forth under section respecting,inter alia,false denial of wages can be imputed to a fraud cause of action and the claim as stated should be interpreted as such,either raise or argue the amendment issue.as plaintiff concedes,not until he petitioned for rehearing did he present to the court of appeal any additional facts that were alleged,that could have been alleged,and could have been reasonably inferred.it is well settled that arguments,including insufficiency of the evidence,can not be raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing.gentis safeguard business systems,th,d.
in light of this record,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining defendants demurrer partially without leave to amend nor did the court of appeal err in affirming that ruling.
disposition 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.
in labor code section,the legislature has given workers a private right of action to recover unpaid overtime wages without specifying who is liable.liability logically should attach to the person or entity owing the unpaid overtime neither in section nor in other relevant provisions of the labor code,has the legislature defined employer for purposes of section.
faced with this lacuna in the labor code,plaintiffs would look to the definition of employer in wage orders promulgated by the industrial welfare commission,the administrative agency to which the legislature has granted plenary power to formulate regulations governing employment in california.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d.as defined in the relevant wage order for purposes of this case,an employer is any individual who directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person,tit,subd.f.armed with this definition,plaintiff contends liability for unpaid overtime wages extends to certain corporate officers and agents who meet the exercises control standard.
as a legal argument,plaintiff position is not untenable,but it has a certain labyrinthine quality that,ultimately,can not conceal the absence of any clear indication of legislative intent that the wage order definition of employer apply to section actions.therefore i concur with the majority.i write separately to bring this issue to the legislature attention.
the underlying question in this case is whether,under certain narrowly circumscribed conditions,workers should be able to sue corporate officers and agents for unpaid overtime wages where the corporate form is being misused to defraud workers of these wages.relevant to consideration of this issue is our recent observation in drug stores,superior court cal th,d,labor code section confirms a clear public policy that is specifically directed at the enforcement of california minimum wage and overtime laws for the benefit of workers.it also bears repeating that overtime pay relates but incidentally to wag
