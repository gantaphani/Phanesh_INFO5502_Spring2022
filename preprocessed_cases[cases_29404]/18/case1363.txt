county of santa barbara county appeals a tax refund judgment entered in favor of david grotenhuis,as an individual and trustee of the grotenhuis family living trust grotenhuis and grotenhuis investments,a closely held corporation corporation.the trial court ruled that grotenhuis,as the alter ego of corporation,can claim a homeowner property tax exemption taxation code,and transfer the base year value of a former residence to a new residence of which corporation is owner of record.there is no statutory provision or precedent for this ruling and we reverse.
subject to certain conditions,a homeowner over the age of may sell a principle residence that qualifies for a homeowner property tax exemption,purchase a replacement dwelling of equal or lesser value in the same county,and transfer the property tax basis of the principal residence to the replacement dwelling,subd.a.the legislature calls this a transfer of base year value,subd.g j.

grotenhuis concedes that corporation is the owner of record of the replacement residence but contends that he is the true owner and qualifies for a homeowner property tax exemption and a base year value transfer.we reject the contention.grotenhuis did not sell the original principal residence,did not purchase the replacement residence,and rents the replacement residence from corporation.
stipulated facts 
grotenhuis and his wife purchased a lot and structure on padaro lane in carpinteria in.they tore down the existing shack and built a house that was used as their principal residence.in,grotenhuis conveyed title to corporation of which grotenhuis is the sole shareholder.county granted a homeowner exemption on the padaro lane property,which was a mistake because corporation was the owner of record.
in grotenhuis refinanced the property,conveying title to himself and back to corporation.grotenhuis notified county that the transfer was to refinance the property and that the property should not be reassessed for tax purposes.county continued the homeowner exemption even though corporation was owner of record.
in,corporation sold the padaro lane property for million and bought a replacement residence on ten acre road,montecito which has an assessed value of million.after title was taken in the corporation name,grotenhuis signed a lease to rent the residence.
on april,grotenhuis filed a claim to transfer the base year value of the padaro lane property which would entitle him to a reduction in property taxes on the montecito residence.county denied the claim because corporation was the owner of record of the original and replacement properties.
appeals board decision 
grotenhuis alone appealed to the santa barbara county appeals board board for an assessment reduction and tax refund.grotenhuis offered imaginary deeds corrective deeds to show that he intended to qualify the montecito residence for a base year value transfer.grotenhuis,however,admitted that he was a tenant of the padaro lane property before it was sold.grotenhauis also introduced evidence that he signed a year lease on april,that was backdated to october,the date the montecito residence was purchased to somehow show that the property was eligible for a homeowner exemption.
board denied the application for changed assessment and tax refund,rejecting grotenhuis mistake and estoppel arguments.it found that grotenhuis was sophisticated enough to know that corporate transfers of real property did not qualify for transfers of base year value and that he did not inform the assessor of this fact even though the corporation enjoyed the benefit of the homeowners exemption for about to years.instead of supporting his claim for equitable relief,his continued enjoyment of the homeowners exemption when he was not entitled to it undercut his claim for equitable relief.
tax refund complaint 
grotenhuis and corporation filed a complaint for a tax refund and asked the trial court to consider the administrative record and a joint statement of stipulated facts.see.the trial court ruled that grotenhuis was the alter ego of corporation and entitled to section property tax relief.county was ordered to refund excess property taxes paid after october,but only if title to the montecito residence is transferred to grotenhuis.it also ordered that grotenhuis is entitled to receive continuing relief under revenue taxation code providing the title remains in his name individually or as trustee.the trial court theories,premised upon equitable considerations,are inapposite in the property tax context.
failure to exhaust administrative ego standing 
ordinarily a taxpayer seeking relief from an erroneous assessment must exhaust available administrative remedies before resorting to the courts.citations.stenocord city of san francisco cal d.it is uncontroverted that corporation did not file a tax refund claim and was not identified as an applicant in the administrative proceedings.the appeals board only reviewed grotenhuis claim as an individual.the trial court,however,found that grotenhuis is grotenhuis investments,incorporated and as its president and sole owner,represented himself and the company in the administrative proceeding.
the trial court erred in relying on a corporate alter ego theory to confer standing.grotenhuis imaginative alter ego theory can not be sustained.the alter ego doctrine arises when a plaintiff comes into court claiming that an opposing party is using the corporate form unjustly and in derogation of the plaintiff interests.citation.mesler bragg management cal d.grotenhuis has come to court claiming that the very corporation he formed should have its veil pierced so that he,as an individual,can obtain a tax advantage.the essence of the alter ego doctrine is that justice be done.id.at.there is no injustice here.grotenhuis tax predicament was by grotenhuis.
grotenhuis elected the corporate form for business reasons unrelated to tax.he who takes the benefit must bear the burden.grotenhuis should not be able to weave in and out of corporate status when it suits the business objective of the day.the laudatory goal of section does not afford property tax relief to an individual who has made a business decision to transfer a residence to a corporation.
section provides that a tax refund action may only be brought by the person who paid the tax and exhausts his or her administrative remedies.the statutory limitation on standing in tax refund actions has existed since.ibm personal pension plan city and county of san francisco th.the statutory provisions could not be more clear no other person may bring such an action but if another should do so,judgment shall not be rendered for the plaintiff,at.
grotenhuis paid some of the property tax installments approximately and corporation paid other property tax installments approximately.there is no evidence that corporation paid property taxes as the alter ego of grotenhuis or that county invoked section to ignore what happened before the appeals board.see,cat partnership county of santa cruz th,section not a bar where administrative decision listed and referred to corporate partner as applicant for tax relief.w here an administrative remedy is provided by statute,relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act.abelleira district court of appeal cal d.
