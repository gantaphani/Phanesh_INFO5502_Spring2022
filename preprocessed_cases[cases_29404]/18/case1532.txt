between january of and august of,respondent associated aviation underwriters,aau,insured the pacific airmotive corporation,an aircraft engine repair business in burbank.pacific airmotive parent corporation,purex corporation,ltd,was a named insured with respect to liabilities arising out of pacific airmotive business activities.in the,the insured corporations were reformed and restructured in varied and interesting exact nature of those transactions is in dispute here.by the,neither purex california nor pacific airmotive existed.what did exist were lawsuits alleging that pacific airmotive business activities during aau policy periods caused damages.
appellants unc pacific airmotive corporation,and unc,collectively,unc and a corporation the parties refer to as new pii new p urex i ndustries i nc.were sued in those actions.they sought coverage from aau.appellants contended that they were the successors to pacific airmotive insurance rights and new pii contended that it was the successor to the purex corporation insurance rights.
aau filed this action for declaratory relief,seeking,inter alia,a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify either appellants or new pii with respect to claims arising out of the burbank site.in large part,appellants were found liable for damages,and new pii was not.appellants for breach of the insurance contracts and for declaratory relief.court trial was held on a single issue,whether appellants new pii were insureds under the policies the trial court found that new pii was an insured and that appellants were not,and entered judgment on the complaint and on that basis.the question of new pii status as an insured is not before us.as to the ruling regarding appellants,we reverse.
first,the nomenclature the parties refer to the pacific airmotive corporation as,that is,pacific airmotive california,in recognition of the fact that a corporation called pacific airmotive was later formed in delaware,and refer to purex corporation,as purex california,in recognition of the fact that corporations with for our purposes regrettably similar names were formed later.we adopt those usages here.
was the named insured on the first aau policy,which took effect on january.in,purex california bought as a wholly owned subsidiary and the aau policy was endorsed to include purex california as a named insured with respect to operations,properties,and exposures.the policy for the following year insured both corporations,for operations.
both policies were aviation liability policies which obligated aau to pay all sums which the insureds became obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury or injury to or destruction of property,caused by an occurrence as defined arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of any aircraft the ownership,maintenance or use of any premises and all operations which are necessary or incidental thereto.the policies included a standard assignment clauses which read assignment of interest under this policy shall not bind the insurer until its consent is endorsed hereon.the parties here agree that aau was never asked to consent to any assignment of the policies,and never did so.
in,purex california became a subsidiary of a new,publicly traded corporation called purex industries,old pii,a holding company whose sole asset was the stock of purex california.
more complicated transactions took place in.appellants characterize the transactions as a management,or leveraged,buyout,and a de facto merger.aau characterizes them as the sale of a business.each party introduced evidence in support of its position,but the basic facts were undisputed.they involved the creation and demise of holding companies,the creation of new,mirror subsidiaries,and the restructuring of the remaining corporate entities.they are also in large part irrelevant to our disposition.
the relevant facts may be briefly summarized in july of,in anticipation of the merger or sale,merged into purex california and became the pacific airmotive division of purex california.in august,numerous additional transactions took place.by the end of that month,the assets and liabilities of the pacific airmotive division of purex california had been transferred to a corporation called pacific airmotive delaware.did not exist,and neither did old pii.instead,was a subsidiary of the new parent company,purex industries pii 
the next significant transaction took place in november of,when new pii sold the stock of to unc,retaining substantial insurance rights in the transaction.new pii and unc also entered into an environmental matters agreement which allocated responsibilities for certain pending environmental matters.it did not address the environmental matters underlying this lawsuit,apparently because the parties were not aware of the problem.
the underlying litigation 
appellants sought insurance coverage for a lawsuit brought by in federal court,and lawsuits brought by individuals in state court.the individuals brought tort claims alleged to have arisen out of environmental contamination in the san fernando valley.defendants included lockheed,appellants,and new pii.most or all of the claims were settled in.
the suit had its origin in an action by the united states environmental protection agency which resulted in agreement to treat groundwater contamination in the san fernando valley superfund site.in,sued appellants,seeking contribution for the cost of remediation at a property in burbank which had sold to lockheed.the lawsuit was assigned to district court judge mariana pfaelzer.
in may of,appellants filed a third party complaint against new pii in the lockheed federal court action,alleging that new pii was liable to lockheed to the extent that appellants were.new pii tendered the claim to aau,which provided a defense.appellants later filed a similar suit against new pii in state court,also alleging that new pii had breached the sales agreement and made misrepresentations of fact.
in june of,judge pfaelzer issued findings of fact in the lockheed federal court action,finding appellants responsible for certain past and future costs of remediation and cleanup.
in january of,appellants and lockheed settled the federal court action.in june of that year,appellants and new pii entered into a settlement of appellants third party complaint against new pii in the lockheed federal court action and of appellants state court action against new pii.as part of the settlement,the new sales agreement was modified to provide that both appellants and new pii would pursue coverage from aau and that new pii agrees,to the extent necessary,to modify the acquisition agreement for the sole purpose of allowing the unc parties to exercise their rights as provided herein to insurance coverage for indemnified claims.
the arguments in the trial court in this litigation 
the trial court ruling was based in large part on the application of two cases which considered questions of insurance rights after mergers or sales of businesses,quemetco pacific automobile ins.th,d and westoil terminals harbor ins.th,d we briefly summarize in quemetco,the original insured sold all of its assets to an unrelated corporation.years later,that corporation sought coverage for cercla claims alleged to have arisen from the original insured acts.the court of appeal held that when a business is sold in an asset sale,insurance policies do not pass from the seller to the buyer by operation of law.id.at,d,see also general accident ins.superior court th,d.
quemetco noted that the rule is different where the transaction is a merger or a de facto merger,rather than an asset sale.id.at,d.westoil found a transfer of insurance rights through a de facto merger.in westoil,the shareholders of the original insured traded their shares for partnership interests in a new partnership.all the assets and liabilities of the original insured were transferred to the partnership,although there was no specific mention of insurance.westoil,supra,th at,d.the westoil court found that,under the facts before it,the transaction was a de facto merger and the insurance coverage was transferred.id.at,d.
