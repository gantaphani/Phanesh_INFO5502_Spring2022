leah woskob,the debtor in bankruptcy,appeals from an order of the district court determining that she did not timely exercise her option to purchase her late husband victor interest in their real estate partnership,the woskob legends partnership the legends partnership.under the partnership agreement,leah had days from the date of an act of dissolution or days from the death of a partner to exercise the option.she ultimately exercised it about two weeks after her husband died in an accident.
the bankruptcy court held that leah had properly exercised the option.on appeal,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court decision,determining that the partnership had already been dissolved well before victor death by any one of the following three events victor exclusion of leah from partnership proceeds leah exclusion of victor from management and income during their pending divorce action and victor bankruptcy filing.accordingly,the district court held that leah had not timely exercised her option to purchase victor interest.
we conclude that none of the three events cited by the district court caused the dissolution of the partnership,and that the partnership was dissolved only upon victor death.thus,we will vacate the order of the district court and will remand the case so that the district court can properly determine,consistent with this opinion,whether leah validly exercised her option to purchase victor interest in the partnership following his death.
leah and victor woskob formed the legends partnership in for purposes of constructing,owning,and operating the legends,an apartment building in state college,pennsylvania.leah and victor,who were then married,each held a interest in the partnership under the terms of the partnership agreement.as partners,leah and victor retained sons,a business owned by victor parents,to construct and later manage the legends property.
in january of,leah and victor separated,and leah filed for divorce.during the divorce proceedings,victor prevented leah from receiving any distributions from the legends partnership.however,on april,the pennsylvania court of common pleas of centre county granted leah petition for special relief and awarded her the exclusive right to manage and derive income from the legends.on june,leah terminated the management agreement with sons and hired another management company.on that same day,victor filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.he stated in the petition that he owned of the partnership.victor voluntarily withdrew the petition nine months later.the partnership tax returns for and,both signed and filed by leah,continued to list both victor and leah as general partners of the legends partnership.
on january,victor died in an automobile accident.in his will,he had named his four children as beneficiaries of his estate the estate.he had also named his parents,alex and helen woskob the woskobs,as executors.within fifteen days of victor death,leah notified the woskobs that she intended to dissolve the legends partnership and to purchase victor interest in the partnership pursuant to paragraph of the partnership agreement,which states in relevant part 
on death of partner 
xix.the surviving partner has the option to dissolve the partnership on the death of a partner.the surviving partner shall have the right within ninety days from the date of death of the deceased partner to purchase the interest of the deceased partner in the partnership and to pay to the personal representative of the deceased partner the value of that interest as provided in paragraph of this agreement the estate of the deceased partner shall be obligated to sell his or her partnership interest as provided in this agreement if the surviving partner does not elect to purchase the interest of the deceased partner,the partnership shall terminate.
app.at.based on the written opinion of the partnership accountant,leah advised the woskobs that victor interest was negative in the amount of and,thus,that the estate was not entitled to any payments for the purchase of victor partnership interest.the woskobs opposed the sale of the legends partnership to leah.
on april,leah filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the common pleas court,seeking an order declaring that the estate interest in the partnership terminated because it had been purchased by leah pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement.the woskobs filed a separate complaint in the same court on june,alleging that the partnership had been dissolved in prior to victor death in.accordingly,they requested the appointment of a receiver to wind up the affairs of the partnership,a complete accounting of the partnership affairs,and the fixing of damages for amounts alleged to have been wrongfully taken from the partnership by leah.
after leah filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code,both actions were removed to the united states bankruptcy court for the middle district of pennsylvania.the woskobs contended that leah attempt to purchase victor interest after his death in was untimely because the legends partnership had already been dissolved in by any one of three events,including victor alleged exclusion of leah from partnership after the marital separation,the order of the court of common pleas granting leah the exclusive right to manage and derive income from the legends,and victor bankruptcy filing.if the partnership had been dissolved in,then leah attempt to purchase victor interest in would have been untimely pursuant to paragraph of the partnership agreement,which reads 
option to purchase terminated interest 
xvii.on dissolution of the partnership by the withdrawal or other act of a partner,the remaining partner,on written notice to the other partner within thirty days of the dissolution,may continue the partnership business by purchasing the interest of the other partner in the assets and goodwill of the partnership.the remaining partner shall have the option to purchase the interest of the withdrawing partner by paying to this partner or the partner personal representative the value of the interest determined as provided in paragraph of this agreement.
app.at emphasis added.
on june,the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of leah,finding that the partnership was dissolved only upon victor death in,and that leah properly exercised her option to purchase victor interest in the partnership.
the estate filed notices of appeal in both cases with the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.the district court disagreed with the bankruptcy court as to the date of dissolution,finding that any one of the three events cited by the woskobs was sufficient to cause the dissolution of the partnership in.accordingly,the district court held that leah attempt to exercise her option to purchase victor interest in was untimely and reversed and remanded the two cases to the bankruptcy court.
leah now appeals from the decision of the district court.
the district court had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction under d and.our standard of review over a district court bankruptcy decision is the same as that exercised by the district court.see in re continental airlines,cir citing brown pennsylvania state employees credit union,cir.accordingly,we review the bankruptcy court factual findings only for clear error,but exercise plenary review over any legal determinations.see in re,cir.because leah and victor formed and managed the legends partnership in pennsylvania,and because pennsylvania was the partnership principal place of business,we apply the law of pennsylvania in determining the partnership date of dissolution.see restatement second conflict of laws.
the uniform partnership act upa,as adopted by pennsylvania,defines the dissolution of a partnership as the change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in the carrying on,as distinguished from the winding up,of the business.the timeliness of leah attempt to exercise her option to buy victor interest in the legends partnership under the partnership agreement depends upon the partnership date of dissolution.
dissolution can be caused by decree of court or automatically through operation of law.dissolution by operation of law and dissolution by decree of court.when dissolution occurs through operation of law and without the need for a judicial decree,the date of dissolution is the date of the first effective act of dissolution.see girard bank haley,holding date of dissolution to be date of partner expression of will to dissolve partnership,not date of partner subsequent death.when a partnership is dissolved by decree of court,the date of dissolution is ordinarily the date upon which the court decrees the dissolution,unless the court specifies otherwise.see scheckter rubin.
although no court ever decreed the dissolution of the legends partnership,there is no doubt that the partnership was eventually dissolved through operation of law.if the partnership was not dissolved before victor death,it was certainly dissolved upon his death under,which provides that the death of any partner causes the dissolution of a partnership.the question before us is whether any other events had already served to dissolve the partnership through operation of law prior to victor death.
the estate contends that three separate events,each of which occurred more than a year and a half before victor death,were sufficient to dissolve the partnership.the first event was victor alleged exclusion of leah from the partnership after the marital separation.second was leah alleged exclusion of victor after the court of common pleas granted her petition for special relief.the third event,according to the estate,was victor filing for bankruptcy in june.for the reasons set forth below,we find that none of these three events caused the dissolution of the legends partnership.
a.the exclusions 
in finding that the alleged exclusions or expulsions from the partnership of leah and then victor were each sufficient to dissolve the legends partnership,the district court observed that a dissolution in these circumstances can be effected before a court ever gets involved,and a partnership can be immediately dissolved by a wrongful exclusion.app.at.in other words,the court found that a wrongful exclusion can dissolve a partnership automatically through operation of law.
before it becomes necessary to determine whether the events described by the estate constituted wrongful exclusions from the partnership,we first consider whether the district court was correct in finding that such exclusions are sufficient to dissolve a partnership through operation of law and without the need for a judicial decree.
in support of its finding,the district court relied primarily on in re crutcher,a case in which a debtor was wrongfully expelled from a partnership,and then,a year later,petitioned the court for dissolution of the partnership.id.at.the crutcher court held that the partnership had dissolved as of the date of the debtor expulsion,and that the filing date of the debtor petition for dissolution was irrelevant to the date of dissolution.id.the court explained 
to determine the date of dissolution,it is necessary first to consider the cause of dissolution.under the pennsylvania uniform partnership act pupa,specifically.iv,dissolution is caused by the expulsion of any partner from the business 
id.regarding the act of expulsion as the cause of dissolution,the court treated the date of expulsion as the date of dissolution.unfortunately,in failing to quote and consider the second half of iv,the court improperly broadened the scope of that subsection.
in its entirety,iv provides that dissolution is caused,without violation of the agreement between the partners,b y the expulsion of any partner from the business bona fide in accordance with such a power conferred by the agreement between the partners.iv emphasis added.the full text makes clear that not all partner expulsions are sufficient to cause automatic dissolution through operation of law.only those expulsions that are in accordance with an expulsion power conferred by the partnership agreement will cause an immediate dissolution.
the court in crutcher failed to differentiate partner expulsions that automatically cause the dissolution of partnerships from those that merely serve as potential grounds for dissolution by judicial decree.the latter category lies within the purview of a,which provides the following general rule 
on application by or for a partner,the court shall decree a dissolution whenever 
a partner has been declared a lunatic in any judicial proceeding or is shown to be of unsound mind.
a partner becomes in any other way incapable of performing his part of the partnership contract.
a partner has been guilty of such conduct as tends to affect prejudicially the carrying on of the business.
a partner willfully or persistently commits a breach of the partnership agreement or otherwise so conducts himself in matters relating to the partnership business that it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with him.
the business of the partnership can only be carried on at a loss.
other circumstances render a dissolution equitable.
a.it is not difficult to see how the acts of one or more partners to exclude another partner from the partnership could serve as grounds for dissolution under the broad language of a or a.such acts of exclusion by a partner would likely tend to make it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with him.a.further,it does not seem farfetched that the expulsion of a partner would constitute a circumstance that render s a dissolution equitable.a.
the key point,however,is that when such acts of exclusion are not committed in accordance with an expulsion power conferred by the agreement between the partners,they do not result in the instantaneous dissolution of the partnership.they merely serve as grounds by which a court can decree a dissolution under.see herman pepper,noting that t he exclusion of one partner by another is undoubtedly ground for dissolution by a court of equity emphasis added see also potter brown,observing that it is well settled that the exclusion of a partner is a ground for dissolution.
in this case,because the alleged acts of exclusion from the legends partnership by leah and victor were not in accordance with an expulsion power explicitly conferred by the partnership agreement,they did not cause the dissolution of the partnership.at the very most,such exclusionary acts could have served as grounds for dissolution if either leah or victor had applied for a dissolution by decree of court pursuant to.since neither of them did so,the claimed exclusions are irrelevant to the partnership date of dissolution.that being the case,there is no need for us to determine whether leah or victor had ever actually been wrongfully excluded from the partnership.
b.the bankruptcy filing 
the estate next contends that,even if an exclusion of leah or victor did not cause the dissolution of the legends partnership,the partnership was dissolved when victor filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.this argument raises the question of whether the bankruptcy of a general partner results in the dissolution of the partnership.
at first glance,pennsylvania law appears to provide a clear answer.under,the bankruptcy of a partner,unlike the general expulsion of a partner,does in fact cause the automatic dissolution of the partnership.our analysis would end neatly right here if our concerns extended only to the application of pennsylvania law.we must also consider,however,the role of federal bankruptcy law and the impact of its interplay with state partnership law.as a survey of the case law reflects,in attempting to reconcile the bankruptcy code with state law on this issue of partnership dissolution,courts have been largely divided.compare,in re nizny,holding that filing of federal bankruptcy case by partner does not dissolve general partnership in re hawkins,same in re todd,same in re corky foods,same in re safren,same,with phillips first city,in re phillips,cir holding that partner federal bankruptcy filing
