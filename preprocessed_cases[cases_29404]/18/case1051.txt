section b of the exchange act bars corporate insiders,such as directors,from profiting on trades,defined as the purchase and sale of stock within a period.b.rule d,promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec,exempts an insider from b liability when the transaction takes place with the issuer and is specifically approved by the issuer board of directors or majority of shareholders.d.
thomas dreiling,a shareholder in infospace,alleges that american express travel related services trs violated section b by engaging in a trade in infospace stock.dreiling claims trs was an insider,specifically a director by deputization,because a trs executive officer sat on the infospace board during the trade.the district court dismissed dreiling complaint,concluding that rule d exempted trs from liability because the infospace board approved the stock grant to insider trs.
on appeal,dreiling argues that the sec lacked the authority to promulgate rule d or,in the alternative,that rule d can not apply to trs because the infospace board did not know that trs was a director by deputization.the sec filed an amicus curiae brief,siding with trs as to the validity of rule d but agreeing with dreiling that trs would not be entitled to the protection of the rule if it were an undisclosed director by deputization.
we agree with the district court that the sec had authority to adopt rule d,and that we owe deference to the sec interpretation of the rule to cover directors by deputization.these are legal questions appropriately reached on appeal.whether the trs executive was a director by deputization and whether the infospace board was knowledgeable as to that relationship are questions of fact that defeat dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.we thus reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
trs and the merger 
in the late,trs,a subsidiary of the american express company,made strategic equity investments in various companies.during this period,trs became a significant minority investor in prio.in december,prio entered a merger agreement with infospace in which infospace agreed to issue million shares of stock,worth about million,to buy prio from its former shareholders.infospace provides infrastructure services for wireless,wireline and broadband platforms.
david house joined the infospace board of directors in january,which was after the merger agreement was executed but before the merger closed.when appointed to the infospace board,house was a trs executive officer who had served as a prio director just before the merger was announced.house served as an infospace director for months,through may.before joining the board,house himself owned no shares of infospace.
the merger closed february,and prio was integrated into infospace.as of the merger,trs owned about of prio,but after the merger,trs owned less than of infospace shares.according to dreiling,just after the merger agreement,infospace share price increased by,only to lose almost in value during the six months after the merger was completed.
ii.dreiling b action 
dreiling first amended complaint alleged that w ithin periods of less than six months,trs engaged in purchases and corresponding sales and or sales and a corresponding purchase of infospace stock and that trs should disgorge any gains.after the merger announcement but before closing,dreiling bought shares of infospace,which he has held ever since.in september,dreiling submitted a demand letter to infospace,asking it to bring a b action against trs.infospace advised that it would not pursue an action against trs because trs was not a director on the infospace board although house was an executive officer of amex during that time period,the facts show that he did not in any way represent amex on the board of directors of the company.accordingly,amex was not a director by deputization and was not subject to section of the exchange act.
after this rejection dreiling filed a complaint in november,alleging that trs was a director on the infospace board,and thus an insider pursuant to b,and that trs had profited from a trade in infospace stock in violation of b.although trs itself was not on the infospace board,dreiling claimed that it had deputized david house to represent trs interests on the board.dreiling also alleged that trs acquired infospace stock on february,and sold much of it sometime before august.as a remedy,dreiling sought disgorgement of profits trs received from trading infospace stock.
trs moved to dismiss under rule b.the district court dismissed the complaint on the basis that rule d exempted trs from b liability,as trs had acquired infospace shares directly from the issuer with the approval of the infospace board.the district court declined to hold,as dreiling urged,that rule d applied only to compensatory grants of stock to officers or directors,and rejected the argument that rule d was an invalid.
dreiling argues that the sec had no authority to promulgate rule d because it was contrary to b alternately,he urges that rule d does not apply to trs because the infospace board failed to explicitly approve the stock grant to trs as an through director david house,who had access to inside information and who,as a director by deputization,effectively represented trs interests on the infospace board.
statutory and regulatory framework of insider trading under b and rule d 
overview of b 
congress enacted b as part of the securities exchange act of to prevent corporate insiders from exploiting their access to information not generally available to others.kern county land occidental petroleum,d.section b reads in relevant part 
for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner,director,or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer,any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale of any equity security of such issuer within any period of less than six months shall be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner,director,or officer in entering into such transaction of holding the security this subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction or transactions which the commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.
b emphasis added.
in passing the statute,congress recognized that speculation by stockholders with advance,inside information would threaten the goal of the securities exchange act to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets.kern county,at.quoting.section b flatly prohibits a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great,id.at,and does so by impos ing a strict prophylactic rule with respect to insider,trading,provident sec,d.the statute identifies three classes of,officers and beneficial makes them liable,without fault or intended wrongdoing,for trading in their company shares.b.
section b does not,however,reach all insider trading,at.congress itself limited carefully the liability imposed by b.the statute imposes strict liability on insiders only for shortswing,a coupled,or purchase,completed within six months.b courts have recognized that b is a blunt instrument,at once both over and.see citadel holding roven,cir section b is a relatively arbitrary,flat rule quoting reliance emerson,d.the statute is in that it imposes strict liability regardless of motive,including trades not actually based on inside information.kern,at.noting that b requires disgorgement of profits without proof of actual abuse of insider information,and without proof of intent to profit on the basis of such information.it is in that there is no liability for trades made on inside information if more than six months transpire between purchase and sale,at.even an insider may trade freely without incurring statutory liability if,for example,he spaces his transactions at intervals greater than six months.
in response to the statute,congress exempted two classes of transactions from the flat rule of liability.see b exempting from liability securities acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted and transactions in which a beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale,or the sale and purchase.aside from these specific transaction exemptions,congress provided an delegation to the sec,authorizing it to exempt other transactions not comprehended within the purpose of b.id.b.
overview of rule d transactions 
before,rule and its rule exempted only transactions,approved by the board of directors,that were related to officer or director compensation.the revision of rule exempted all grants or awards of stock or options by an issuer to an insider,compensatory or not,if the transaction was approved by the board or majority of shareholders.d.in relevant part,the rule reads 
d acquisitions from the issuer.any transaction,other than a discretionary transaction,involving an acquisition from the issuer including without limitation a grant or award,whether or not intended for a compensatory or other particular purpose,shall be exempt if 
the transaction is approved by the board of directors of the issuer,or a committee of the board of directors that is composed solely of two or more directors 
the sec adopted the version of rule d as part of a number of amendments to rule to present a simplified,flexible approach to insider transactions.ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,june.the sec exempted trades because they do not appear to present the same opportunities for insider profit on the basis of information as do market transactions by officers and directors,and where the issuer,rather than trading markets,is on the other side of an officer or director transaction in the issuer equity securities,any profit obtained is not at the expense of uninformed shareholders and other market participants of the type contemplated by the statute.id.the sec based these observations on its experience with the section rules,and concluded that transactions between an insider and an issuer that satisfy objective conditions are not vehicles for the speculative abuse that section b was designed to prevent.id.thus,the sec enacted rule d because board or transactions were not contemplated within the purpose of b.
the sec decision to revise rule d in was founded not just on its years of experience making rules under rules.at,but also,according to the sec amicus brief,careful study,notice and public comment.the sec received letters in its solicitation for comments on early versions of rule d,mostly positive.id.at.rule d also reconciles competing policies 
finally,rule d implements certain of the objective conditions,such as approval by the issuer board of directors or ratification by a majority of shareholders.d.in identifying these conditions,the sec noted that a lthough the new rule would not prohibit directors or the full board from awarding themselves grants of issuer equity securities,such grants would be subject to state laws governing corporate.at.
ii.validity of rule 
because the statute explicitly delegates to the sec the authority to promulgate other transaction exemptions,the question is not whether rule d can be found explicitly in the text of b rather,the more nuanced question is whether rule d exempts transactions not comprehended within the purpose of b.this posture,in turn,requires us to discern the limits of the expression of congressional intent that is b.in analyzing rule d,we give the sec view controlling weight unless the regulation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute because congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill.chevron,natural res.def.council,d 
the sec has publicly and carefully considered the issue of speculative abuse before finalizing rule d.consequently,we give significant weight to the sec determination that transactions were not vehicles for the speculative abuse that section b was designed to prevent.at,and hold that rule d was validly promulgated.chevron,at.noting that agency interpretation of statute entitled to deference when the regulatory scheme is technical and complex,the agency considered the matter in a detailed and reasoned fashion,and the decision involves reconciling conflicting policies.
dreiling challenges the sec authority and argues that rule d is contrary to the purposes of b to prevent speculative abuse and harm uninformed market the following reasons the sec may only exempt transactions for which there is no risk of speculative abuse empirical evidence indicates that rule d immunizes transactions likely to result in speculative abuse certain hypotheticals suggest that rule d exempts speculative abuse and the sec enacted rule d for reasons unrelated to speculative abuse.
dreiling attempts to place the burden with the sec to show that any transaction exemptions under b give rise to absolutely no possibility of speculative abuse,citing kern as support.see at.in other words,according to dreiling,the sec may not exempt certain transactions otherwise subject to b merely because these transactions give rise to a diminished risk of speculative abuse.imposing such a burden on the sec is inconsistent with both the statute and chevron deference.
dreiling position demands an airtight solution with no possibility of abuse.neither b nor its judicial gloss suggests,as dreiling does,that the sec may only exempt transactions for which there is zero risk of speculative abuse.rather,the supreme court has indicated that the sec is free to exempt transactions for which the possibility of abuse is not believed to be intolerably great.reliance,at.emphasis added.the sec need not show that the transactions exempted from b pose absolutely no risk of speculative abuse,at.finding unsatisfactory the argument that the court must reject any reading of a statutory exemption to b that misses some possible abuses of inside information id.at.s erving the congressional purpose does not require resolving every ambiguity in favor of liability under b.the relevant question is whether rule d exempts transactions for which the risk of speculative abuse is intolerable or,more broadly,in the words of the statute,whether the transaction is not comprehended within the purpose of b.b.
as a second prong of attack,dreiling purports to identify empirical evidence showing that the risk of speculative abuse for,transactions is intolerable.as we explained,the sec came to exactly the opposite conclusion in adopting rule d.after notice and comment,the sec determined that transactions between an issuer and an insider were unlikely to result in speculative abuse,and that the risk of such abuse was therefore tolerable.as amicus curiae,the sec adds that in considering rule d,it found that transactions did not pose an intolerably great risk of abuse because b oard or shareholder approval will remove the timing of the acquisition from the control of any one insider and also tend to assure that the acquisition is for a legitimate corporate purpose.see also gryl shire pharm.group plc,cir.
yet dreiling claims to refute this conclusion by identifying empirical evidence that rule d immunizes transactions for which the risk of abuse is intolerable.as evidence,he cites a single article that shares his general concern with certain transactions but explicitly says that b and rule d are of limited relevance to the award of executive stock options.thus,dreiling offers nothing substantive to challenge the sec analysis and conclusion that,trades do not give rise to an intolerable level of speculative abuse.see.at based on its experience with the section rules,the commission is persuaded that transactions between the issuer and its officers and directors that satisfy other objective conditions are not vehicles for the speculative abuse that section b was designed to prevent.id.generally,these transactions do not appear to present the same opportunities for insider profit on the basis of information as do market transactions by officers and directors.
dreiling also argues that certain hypotheticals show that rule d shields abusive transactions.he posits a set of imagined,though plausible,facts leading to trs use of inside information in selling
