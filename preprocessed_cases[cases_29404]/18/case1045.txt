background 
johnson is a citizen of alaska.columbia is a limited partnership organized in ohio.its two partners,cp anchorage,gp,llc,and csc holdings,llc,are limited liability companies llcs,also organized in ohio.the two llcs are owned by a kentucky corporation by an ohio corporation and by a trust whose sole trustee is a bank incorporated in delaware with its principal place of business in minnesota.
columbia managed the construction of the marriott hotel in anchorage between and.in august,dave mueller,columbia project manager,entered into a contract with johnson,an independent contractor,under which johnson agreed to provide crane services.on august,johnson sent a proposal to mueller for rental of a crane,as well as for wages for a crane operator and an oiler.brian prince,a project engineer for columbia,replied on august,accepting the proposal and summarizing the agreement between johnson and columbia.prince letter stated that johnson would provide the ton truck crane to columbia per your proposal of to dave mueller.also,t he crane will be required probably sometime in and be required probably through the end of the year,and periodically after that.the letter further noted that no other agreements such as purchase orders,contracts,will be sent unless you specifically request one.the letter concluded that,unless prince heard back from johnson to the contrary,i will assume that we have reached an agreement for your services to be provided as we need them.the letter did not mention any billing arrangements or any other equipment or services.
johnson states in his affidavit that in august and september of he and mueller discussed other lifting and hoisting services johnson could contribute to the marriott hotel project,and that he sent mueller his rates for the rental and operation of and cranes and a forklift.johnson states that,based on these discussions,the parties made oral modifications to the agreement summarized in prince august letter,expanding the range of services that johnson would provide to columbia.johnson affidavit summarizes what he contends were the final terms of the agreement,concluded in late september 
when requested,johnson would provide the appropriate crane or hoist to satisfy columbia requirements both parties would maintain ordinary job records,time cards and daily logs,but there was to be no contemporaneous exchange of such records,nor any requirement for signatures or written acknowledgment of receipt of services at the conclusion of the project johnson would invoice columbia for his services columbia would review his notice and the parties would attempt to resolve any question or discrepancy if there was a conflict between his invoice and columbia job records and the invoice or invoices would be due and payable promptly after submittal,and if unpaid,would draw interest from the invoice date.
johnson stated in his affidavit that he provided crane services during four periods beginning in late september he provided a crane on four different occasions from september,through december,he provided the crane described in the august letter for one month beginning on december,he provided a crane from january,through august,and he provided the crane from july,to august.
according to johnson affidavit,he submitted a handwritten summary of his work logs to mueller shortly after he finished providing the crane services on august.johnson states that he provided the summary so that i could prepare an invoice once columbia looked over the logs for any problems or questions with my summary.johnson stated that mueller never got back to him about the summary.as described below,johnson did not send an invoice to columbia until sometime in january.
according to johnson affidavit,mueller was replaced by andy king as project manager sometime in mid to late.in february,king contacted johnson and asked him to perform cleanup work in a storage yard at ship creek,a location near the port of anchorage and some distance from the marriott hotel.johnson states in his affidavit that king understood his earlier agreement with columbia,and he implies that king intended the marriott crane services contract to cover the ship creek cleanup work as well.king remembers the transaction differently.he states in his affidavit that the cleanup project was covered by a contract,and that he and johnson did not discuss any terms of any sort from any preexisting or ongoing agreement.johnson used a forklift and a crew of manual laborers to perform the cleanup work at ship creek.he used no cranes.johnson completed this work on february.
johnson sent columbia an invoice totaling in january.this invoice covered all the services he had provided to columbia,including the crane services at the marriott hotel and the cleanup at ship creek.on february,king responded by expressing surprise at the size and the lateness of the bill.he asked for documentation for the ship creek job.there is no indication in the record whether johnson responded to the request for documentation.on february,over a year after submitting the invoice,johnson filed this suit for breach of contract in alaska state court.
columbia removed the suit to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.columbia then moved for partial summary judgment on all claims for payment for crane services provided at the marriott hotel,contending that they were barred by alaska statute of limitations.the district court granted columbia motion.johnson then moved to remand the suit to state court for lack of diversity jurisdiction,contending that columbia was owned in part by an alaska citizen.the district court denied the motion.johnson then successfully moved for summary judgment on his remaining claim for payment for the cleanup at ship creek.finally,although the district court determined that columbia was the prevailing party,it declined to award attorneys fees.
johnson appeals the partial summary judgment in favor of columbia on the crane services at the marriott hotel,and the denial of his motion to remand to state court.columbia the district court refusal to award attorneys fees.

iii.subject matter jurisdiction 
columbia is a limited partnership in which the two partners are limited liability companies,or llcs.because a partnership is a citizen of all of the states of which its partners are citizens,johnson motion to remand to state court for lack of diversity jurisdiction turns on the citizenship of the two llcs.the citizenship of an llc for purposes of diversity jurisdiction poses a question of first impression in this circuit.
the federal court basic diversity jurisdiction extends to all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds and is between c itizens of different states.a.in cases where entities rather than individuals are litigants,diversity jurisdiction depends on the form of the entity.for example,an unincorporated association such
