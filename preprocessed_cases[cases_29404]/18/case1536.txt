the dispute underlying this appeal arose out of a series of real estate transactions in which developer craig caldwell,one of the defendants below,persuaded respondent lawrence saks,to invest.saks financial involvement with caldwell began in may and ended a few months later in august.during that time,saks became embroiled in approximately half a dozen land deals and invested over million,over million of which was ultimately lost.
reverend sam steel,former pastor and president of appellant charity mission baptist church the church,had been involved with caldwell since or,lending his name to more than one of caldwell development schemes.reverend steel,who was also a defendant below,died during trial.caldwell appeal was dismissed.the primary issue on appeal concerns whether the church,the sole remaining appellant,should be held liable for reverend steel actions in support of caldwell machinations.specifically,should the church be required to pay two promissory notes,one for and one for,signed by reverend steel and made payable to saks after saks advanced to purchase property located on figueroa boulevard in the church name.
saks sued the church under both breach of contract and fraud theories,contending that the church was liable because reverend steel signed the notes in the name of the church,and induced saks to pay the to escrow by promising that he the church would repay it.in its defense,the church maintains that it was being used by the other three parties as a conduit to obtain a loan or grant from a city of los angeles city agency.as soon as the anticipated loan or grant was received,the parties planned to use the city funds to repay saks,and then immediately transfer the figueroa property to a partnership owned by caldwell,saks,and possibly reverend steel.the church believes that because it was never intended to be the true owner of the property or otherwise obtain material benefit from the funds,there is no reason for it to be held liable on the notes,particularly since the property ended up in saks hands after nonjudicial foreclosure saks does not deny that the parties ultimate goal was to transfer the property to a partnership which excluded the church,but contends that because things did not work out as planned and the church retained title to the property after close of escrow,he had the right to enforce the notes in accordance with their terms.after trial,the jury agreed with saks,finding in his favor on both breach of contract and fraud theories,and rejecting the church defenses.
we believe that where an officer of a corporation is openly using the corporation to obtain a benefit for himself and his cohorts in a transaction,in which the corporation will ultimately not benefit,the other parties to the transaction can not later seek to hold the corporation liable for his actions.the uncontradicted evidence at trial established that reverend steel and caldwell in their discussions with saks made no secret of their plan to use the church as a front to obtain a loan or grant from a governmental agency.saks at no time expressed any disapproval of the plan or unwillingness to participate in the proposed subterfuge.accordingly,we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the jury verdict and reverse the judgment.
procedural backgrounda.saks complaint case no.
on april,saks filed a complaint naming only caldwell as defendant,asserting claims for violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,constructive fraud,conversion,breach of contract,bad faith denial of existence of contract breach of covenant,money lent,unjust enrichment,and constructive trust.the complaint described a series of investment schemes in which caldwell persuaded saks to participate during a period in,only one of which is directly pertinent to this appeal.for background purposes,we first briefly summarize the facts pertinent to the prior transactions before turning to the pertinent transaction involving the figueroa property.
saks prior transactions with caldwell 
the first transaction described in the complaint involved a building on pine avenue in long beach.in may,caldwell allegedly persuaded saks to purchase the second deed of trust for without disclosing that the holder of the first deed of trust was attempting to foreclose or that the company which owned the,a corporation owned and controlled by filed for bankruptcy.caldwell subsequently persuaded saks to reconvey the second deed of trust to be used as a down payment to purchase the building and applied in saks name for a loan to fund the purchase.in august or september,saks allegedly learned of the bankruptcy and the threatened foreclosure,and refused to go forward with the purchase.the was never repaid.
in may,caldwell also allegedly induced saks to buy real property located on manchester boulevard in inglewood in order to deed it to a partnership to be called charity senior suites for development into senior citizen housing.saks took out a second mortgage on his home in order to obtain million needed as a down payment and also obtained a bank loan for million.saks believed he was purchasing the property from reverend steel,but just prior to the sale,reverend steel secretly deeded the property to altamirco,another company owned and controlled by caldwell,and the money from the sale went to caldwell and altamirco.unaware of this,saks deeded the property to the partnership in accordance with the parties understanding.caldwell repaid the million through altamirco,which shortly thereafter went into bankruptcy.saks was threatened with suit for recovery of the payment as a preference in september in addition,the lender sought repayment of the million loan from saks in connection with this property,saks paid unreimbursed mortgage interest,architectural fees,and development costs totaling approximately.
in june,caldwell allegedly persuaded saks to pay to join in the purchase of property on seville in huntington park on which caldwell said he planned to build senior housing.in addition,saks paid caldwell for a share of development costs in connection with that transaction.caldwell allegedly told saks that saks name could not be listed as a buyer as this would require a change in escrow instructions and risk loss of the deal.later,caldwell falsely claimed that saks was a personal loan to caldwell and that saks had no interest in the huntington park property and that he never agreed to develop the property with saks.
the figueroa property transaction 
according to the complaint,the figueroa property was brought to saks attention in july or august.caldwell allegedly invited saks to participate on the following basis first,reverend steel and the church would purchase the property from community baptist church cbc then reverend steel who was under caldwell control,would transfer the property to a partnership in which saks and caldwell would be partners.the complaint contended that saks was to provide for the down payment through an unsecured note from reverend steel and the church.an additional would be provided and secured by a note and deed of trust on the property.according to the complaint,caldwell told saks that the loan would be repaid to saks one month after the close of escrow.caldwell further allegedly told saks that he caldwell would be responsible for repayment of saks in loans for the purchase of the property.
caldwell and reverend steel both allegedly told saks that the city of los angeles had already approved a loan for to buy and develop the property,that the loan had been in favor of p p home for the elderly and that the city was in the process of transferring the loan papers from p p to the name of reverend steel and the church.caldwell alone allegedly told him the process would be completed within a month of the close of escrow.caldwell also allegedly told saks that he would make the payments on the note from reverend steel and the church to saks,which would be repaid in full by august.no payments had been made on either note,resulting in a loss of.
caldwell filed a against saks alleging that saks had reneged on a promise to buy the long beach building for million causing the property to be lost to the first trust deed holder failed to make lease payments owed by the peninsula athletic club to the partnership comprised of the two men and otherwise breached various agreements between them.
c.the church complaint case no.
on may,a complaint in a separate lawsuit was filed by the church and reverend steel as plaintiffs,naming saks as defendant,asserting claims for breach of contract,equitable estoppel,declaratory relief,injunction,and reformation the breach of contract claim alleged that in august,p laintiffs entered into a partnership agreement with caldwell for the purchase of real property.according to the complaint,saks and caldwell were to own a percent interest each in the partnership under this agreement,while p laintiffs were to own the remaining percent.according to the complaint,with respect to the figueroa property,the church purchased it from cbc for.plaintiffs executed a note secured by a deed of trust to secure the amount of in favor of cbc.the community redevelopment agency cra had purportedly earmarked a grant of million for the development of the property into a senior citizens home.saks was to advance the church money to purchase the property in the following manner was to be given to the church as a tax deductible charitable contribution and was to be lent to the church and repaid after cra funds became available.on august,the parties executed a written note and deed of trust in favor of saks securing the sum of.
in february,saks gave notice of default and intent to sell the figueroa property by nonjudicial foreclosure.the complaint alleged that this constituted breach of agreement in that the understanding of the parties was that the note was not to be due until days after funding by the cra.the complaint sought reformation of the note to reflect this understanding and an injunction preventing the foreclosure from going forward.the complaint also sought to equitably estop saks from taking action until after the cra payment and declaratory relief had sorted out the parties respective rights and duties and determined the validity of the alleged agreement.
saks first amended complaint 
in apparent reaction to the church complaint,saks filed a first amended complaint fac on august,adding reverend steel and the church as defendants.the following new allegation was contained in the fac although caldwell originally told saks that steel and the church would not be partners,caldwell later told saks that steel and the church,who we re under caldwell control,would be partners.
the promissory notes were not the basis of any claim in the original complaint.in the fac,the breach of contract cause of action included the allegation that saks agreed to lend and steel and the church agreed to borrow on an unsecured promissory note bearing interest at the rate of prime plus percent and due august,and on a promissory note bearing percent interest and due september,toward the purchase of the figueroa property for defendants benefit.the fac further alleged that reverend steel and the church were in default of their obligations under the note in that they have anticipatorily breached their obligations by stating that they have no intention of fulfilling those obligations steel and the church filed a complaint in the superior court alleging that they were not obligated to repay,and had no intention to repay,the loan or the loan unless and until the cra someday funds a grant to defendants for the figueroa property.
in the fraud cause of action,the fac alleged that defendants obtained the funds used to purchase the figueroa property by falsely representing that cbc was the owner of the property,by concealing the existence of two prior lis pendens,by falsely stating that caldwell would repay saks loan to steel,and by falsely stating that they had arranged a loan from a government agency,which would repay saks loans.underscoring deleted.saks stated in the fac that defendants,presumably meaning both caldwell and reverend steel,had represented to saks that the process of obtaining city funds would be completed within a month after close of escrow.previously,saks had attributed this statement to caldwell alone.
triala.testimony 
the legal and equitable issues were bifurcated,and the legal issues tried to a jury in may and june.saks was the primary witness at trial on liability issues.because we are required to evaluate the evidence in favor of the prevailing party,we concentrate on his testimony rather than that of the defendants.
concerning his relationship with caldwell,saks testified that he met caldwell in while treating caldwell family in his medical practice.caldwell was also a neighbor and social acquaintance.he appeared to be very wealthy and successful.on one occasion,caldwell told saks he was making to per month through various business dealings,which included operating a mortuary chain and buying troubled businesses out of bankruptcy.
prior transactions 
peninsula athletic club 
in,before becoming involved with caldwell,saks bought the peninsula athletic club,in part through a note secured by a deed of trust.in april,saks told caldwell that he was having tax problems and financial problems with the athletic club.caldwell offered to take over operations of the athletic club,and renegotiate the note.caldwell was made a partner in an agreement signed by the parties,but told saks that he would not take any money out of the business unless he was successful in lowering the amount due on the note.caldwell advised saks to stop paying on the note,which eventually caused the holder to foreclose.
la brea property 
while this was going on,caldwell persuaded saks to invest in two separate land ventures involving property located on la brea and manchester.reverend steel was,at least nominally,a part owner of the la brea building,and caldwell introduced saks to reverend steel in connection with the la brea transaction.they met at the mortuary operated by reverend steel on the manchester property,and drove to look at the la brea property.saks did not have any substantive discussions with reverend steel in connection with the transaction.saks was essentially told by caldwell that saks credit would be used to obtain loans so that entities in which he and caldwell held interest could be used to purchase the properties.caldwell told saks that he had some problems with city hall and it would be better if his name was not included.after the sale on the la brea property closed,saks was shown as a percent owner of the partnership that owned the property and reverend steel a percent owner.later,percent of the partnership was transferred to caldwell.saks suffered no losses as the result of the la brea transaction.
manchester property 
to purchase the manchester property,caldwell borrowed million from saks,which caldwell repaid a few days later through altamirco.saks also signed the promissory note for a million bank loan.the seller of the property was identified as reverend steel,although caldwell told saks that he caldwell controlled it.the buyer was identified as saks.per the parties understanding,saks immediately transferred the property to the charity senior suites partnership,comprised of himself and altamirco.saks paid caldwell approximately for expenses incurred by the partnership and made one or two mortgage payments totaling before the property was lost to the lender.he spent in attorney fees defending his right to the million repaid to him against a bankruptcy preference claim.
long beach building 
after these deals were underway,caldwell presented the long beach building,telling saks that he had negotiated the second trust deed down to and wanted saks to purchase it.caldwell said the money would be paid back in two or three months along with a very high amount of interest.saks gave caldwell a check for,but never got a signed agreement for repayment.caldwell had the second trust deed assigned to saks.caldwell did not tell him the first trust deed holder was foreclosing or that the entity that owned the building was in bankruptcy.caldwell then proposed that saks use the trust deed as a down payment on the property.saks signed escrow instructions stating that he was going to buy the building for million.saks never received repayment of the spent on the note.
seville property 
caldwell next got saks involved in a property on seville in huntington park.caldwell said he intended to build a small shopping center and senior citizen housing on the site.saks gave caldwell towards the purchase of the property and another to cover disbursements for the proposed development.caldwell did not add saks name to the escrow as a purchaser,claiming that any changes would cause the sale to fall through.the sale did not take place,but none of the money was repaid.
figueroa property 
around the end of july,caldwell started talking to saks about the figueroa property.caldwell told him that the property had been earmarked for a loan by the city for which would go to the developer to help pay for the land.the approval for the loan was in the name of another church,and caldwell was reportedly working on getting it transferred.a few weeks later,caldwell told saks there would be in city funds available to a nonprofit organization.caldwell initially assured saks that if he lent towards purchase of the property,it would be returned in to days,and the other or would be repaid when the construction loan funded.in a later conversation,caldwell told saks that he would get the back in days,and the rest of the money in six to months.caldwell showed saks a letter from the city approving a loan for the site.caldwell assured saks that he would personally be investing in the purchase.there were no discussions about what would happen if the city did not fund the grant or loan.
after a few more meetings with caldwell,reverend steel showed up at saks office to pick up the check and sign the note.at that time,reverend steel either acknowledged that the money had to be repaid in a year or said he would pay the money in a year.this was only the second time saks recalled having any interaction with reverend steel.a few days after that,caldwell called and asked for the.saks testified initially that he could not remember whether he gave the second check,made payable like the first to valley escrow,to caldwell or reverend steel.later,he testified that reverend steel came to pick up the check and stated at that time that the note would be paid in days but admitted having trouble recalling for sure whether that event occurred.still later,he testified that reverend steel definitely came to pick up the check and told saks that he and the church would pay the money in days.that was the last conversation saks had with reverend steel until sometime after escrow closed.
during,it was brought out that at his deposition,saks had testified as follows concerning the figueroa transaction the deal was i would have would,it really not a loan.i would deposit or i would invest to reverend steel and his church and that would be repaid when another grant would be received by the reverend and caldwell and if you read the notes there a pledge to pay it back in three to six months,to pay half of the money back,in three to six months when a secondary loan on the project was obtained,and then the other would be paid back when a construction loan to build the building would be negotiated which would probably take a year.when the deposition was given to him for review,he struck the phrase well,it really not a loan,explaining at trial that what he had said was a mistake and that it really was a loan to the church rather than an investment in the partnership.
saks testified he had an oral agreement with caldwell which encompassed buying the land.he testified to the following terms the deal was when he caldwell first brought it to me that we would be partners in developing the property.before we got to be partners in developing the property i would have to loan the,loan the.he would loan.we get most of that money back and then in six to months we would have a partnership to do the construction loan where me and caldwell would be partners in the profits of the construction and the development saks admitted that his response to caldwell proposal did not indicate disagreement with any aspect of it i did object to it.i said yes,i did object to it.
saks further explained at trial that he did not believe there was an agreement whereby the ownership of the figueroa property would be split between him,caldwell,and reverend steel because the existence of such an agreement was contingent on his getting repaid the.in his own words we would build out the project,and when we would build out the project which was six,months down the line,then the reverend would have percent and it would be transferred into a partnership with the but in this time in august none of those things will happen because the first part of the transaction never completed.i never got the back saks further testified that when caldwell brought up the subject of reverend steel being given an interest,it would be,i do know,one,two,three years later.reverend steel would be partner when the loans were paid off,the was paid off.then we get a partnership,and we do some construction,and then we have a building and steel would run it,then he be a partner.saks denied that they reached an agreement that this partnership,when it came into existence,would be called charity senior suites,after the church.
saks was clear in his testimony that the church was never supposed to be part of any partnership,and that its name was added in order to obtain a city funded loan or grant originally,when we started talking it was caldwell and i to buy the land and then he said we need to put it in the name of the church because they were transferring that loan from the city or the cra or the cdd from one church to another and that why the church was buying the property.
because the note was secured by the figueroa property,saks was able to foreclose on the property through nonjudicial foreclosure in september or october,bidding at the trustee sale.he still owned the property at the time of trial.
saks never met anyone associated with the church other than reverend steel and possibly his wife.he had never been to the church.he attested to his understanding that reverend steel was a pawn for caldwell and that caldwell was the decision maker on all the transactions.
reverend steel testified that there had been a meeting with saks at a restaurant in the summer of.at that meeting,the details of the partnership were discussed and orally finalized,including an agreement that the obligation on the notes was conditional on receipt of city funds.saks denied categorically that such a meeting had taken place or that such a promise had been extracted from him.
motion for nonsuit 
at the close of saks case,the church moved for nonsuit on the rico and fraud claims.the court granted the motion.the court stated at that time i do think the c hurch committed any fraud on saks.steel did it all.if there any fraud or any acts or any misdeeds,steel did them all.the next day,according to the court minute order,the church motion with respect to the fraud cause of action was withdrawn 
saks then recalled reverend steel,who testified that the church was a nonprofit corporation and that he was the president.he also testified there were nine deacons who functioned as the board of directors.he never obtained the approval of the board or the other officers to get involved with the figueroa property transaction or any of the other transactions.he told the parishioners only that there would be a senior citizens project named after the church.when asked why he had not sought the necessary approval or informed anyone of what he was doing,he testified it was because the church was the one who was really purchasing the land,the partnership was the one.his understanding was the land was never going to belong to the church,and that the church was involved in the transaction because of its name and nonprofit status.
c.the special verdict 
the jury was instructed on rico,fraud misrepresentation,intentional concealment,and negligent misrepresentation,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,and money had and received.
the jury found by special verdict that all,reverend steel,and the rico the jury awarded damages of,and further found that of that amount was attributable to losses on the note secured by the trust deed.
on saks claims of fraud,damages of were assessed against caldwell damages against reverend steel and the church were assessed at.the jury further found that all defendants breached a fiduciary duty owed to saks,and awarded damages in the same amount as were awarded on the fraud claims.
on the claim for money had and received,the jury found that caldwell received,and reverend steel and the church received.the jury found that reverend steel and the church had not converted any funds belonging to saks,but that caldwell had converted.the jury found the defendants liable for breach of contract,awarding as to caldwell,and as to reverend steel and the church 
finally,the jury found for saks and against the plaintiffs on all of the claims and against him,finding specifically that both reverend steel and the church were liable on the two promissory notes.as will be discussed further in part iiid.post,the trial court,in proceedings,granted jnov to the church on the rico claim,denied jnov to the church on the fraud claim,and granted the church motion for new trial unless saks agreed to a remittitur reducing damages to.saks agreed to the remittitur.the church filed a notice of appeal on march,judgment in favor of saks was entered in accordance with the court ruling on the church equitable claims on february,and the church noticed a second appeal.we consolidated the two appeals.
discussion 
although the church contends in its brief on appeal that numerous procedural and substantive errors marred the judgment,the most significant issue concerns whether substantial evidence supports the jury finding that the church was obligated to pay the notes under either a breach of contract or fraud theory.because we believe the jury verdict was unsupported by the evidence,we need not address the remaining issues asserted in the brief.
breach of contract 
when a disputed factual matter is resolved by the jury,the appellate court reviews the determination under the substantial evidence rule.winograd american broadcasting th,d.when a trial court factual determination is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial evidence to sustain it,the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the determination,if such substantial evidence be found,it is of no consequence that the trial court believing other evidence,or drawing other reasonable inferences,might have reached a contrary conclusion.citations.bowers bernards d,italics omitted.substantial evidence is evidence of ponderable legal significance,reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value.citations.id.at,italics omitted.it is not synonymous with any evidence.ibid.
we begin our analysis of whether substantial evidence supports the jury finding of liability on the breach of contract action by pointing out that a promissory note is a form of negotiable unconditional promise to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay,payable on demand or at a definite time.see cal,and cal.com,reprinted at west ann.cal.com code pocket supp.foll.a promise to pay money contained in a note is legally binding in accordance with the established rules governing negotiable instruments contained in article of the california uniform commercial code.unlike a contract,a note is one sided it tells us what the promisor is obligated to do pay a certain sum of money on demand or by a certain date but does not indicate what the payee has done or undertaken to entitle it to the promised payment.in a commercial setting,the payee promise or obligation is often the subject of a separate agreement which can be oral or written.it is therefore not surprising that under the california uniform commercial code,a note is subject to the defense that a separate agreement between the obligor and the person entitled to enforce the instrument has modified,supplemented,or nullified the obligation to pay where the instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same transaction giving rise to the agreement.according to the comments to this provision,t he separate agreement might be an agreement that contradicts the terms of the instrument.for example,a person may be induced to sign the instrument under an agreement that the signer will not be liable on the instrument unless certain conditions are met.cal.com,west ann.cal.supp.foll.
in addition,negotiable instruments are subject to the defense of failure of consideration,subd.b.a promissory note is presumed to have been given for a sufficient consideration and in an action thereon,the introduction of the note in evidence establishes a prima facie right to recover according to its terms.the burden of showing a want of consideration is cast upon the party seeking to avoid it,and if he fails to make this showing,the presumption prevails and furnishes sufficient evidence to support a finding that the note was given for a good and valuable consideration.meyer glenmoor homes,d.at the same time,t he absence of consideration is always a defense to a suit on a promissory note citation and since an instrument lacking in consideration is invalid,this fact may be shown by extrinsic evidence.citations.where the evidence produced by the plaintiff reflects the absence of consideration it is proper to grant a nonsuit.citation.id.at.accord,fpi development,nakashima d.a general denial puts in issue the question whether consideration was given for the note which recites that it was given for valuable consideration.citation.such a defense,because it challenges a facial claim of the note,is not subject to the parol evidence rule.
a note may also be subject to the defense that it was intended to be void,a sham not intended between the parties as a jural act.fpi development nakashima,supra,d at.this defense is also exempt from the proscriptions of the parol evidence rule however,it must be pled as an affirmative defense and is not encompassed in a general denial.id.at.
our review of the record reveals that the church attempted,somewhat inartfully,to establish all three defenses that there was a separate agreement under which the obligation of any party to pay the notes was conditional on receipt of a loan or grant from the city that there was no consideration flowing to the church from the parties agreement or the money loaned by saks and the notes were a sham,put together in order to fool the city,intended to have no legal impact as between the parties.
concerning the condition precedent defense,saks denied that he had agreed to forego repayment until a loan or grant could be received and further denied that there had been any discussion between the parties concerning what would happen if the city funding did not materialize within days.apparently no such discussions seemed necessary because,as saks further testified,he had been led to believe by caldwell that the city funding was a certainty due to the fact the city had already approved funding to build senior citizen housing for the prior owner.saks was persuaded that it would be a simple matter to transfer the approval to the church when it became the titular owner.the defense disputed this evidence,testifying that at a meeting at a restaurant in,the parties orally agreed to forego repayment until after the city funded the loan or grant.saks denied that such a meeting occurred or that such a promise was extracted from him at any time.his testimony provided substantial evidence that there was no condition precedent and supported this aspect of the jury finding.
this evidence does not,however,resolve the church separate defense that there was no consideration given to the church in exchange for the promise to pay contained in the notes,and that all expected benefits flowed to caldwell,saks,and possibly reverend steel.the uncontradicted testimony established that the expressed intent of the parties to the transaction was to put title to the property in the church name for only as long as was needed to persuade the city to fund a grant or loan.if all went according to plan,reverend steel,acting under the control of caldwell,would then immediately transfer the grant or loan money to saks and transfer the property to a partnership.there was a dispute about whether reverend steel would or would not be part of the partnership along with caldwell and saks there was no dispute that the church itself would end up with no interest in either the property or the partnership.saks was particularly adamant in this regard,testifying that the parties had not even agreed to use the church name in connection with the proposed partnership 
as we understand his theory,saks believes that although the parties ultimate plan was to transfer the property from the church to the partnership or partnership,because that never occurred due to the city failure to fund and the parties subsequent falling out,the church should be held liable on the notes as if this were a straightforward loan transaction.this line of reasoning has a certain superficial appeal.the church did end up with title to valuable property paid for by saks money.it overlooks a basic principle of contract law t he consideration for a promise must be an act or a return promise,bargained for and given in exchange for the promise.citations.in the words of section of the restatement of contracts consideration must actually be bargained for as the exchange for the promise the existence or of a bargain where something has been parted with by the promisee or received by the promisor depends upon the manifested intention of the parties the fact that the promisee relies on the promise to his injury,or the promisor gains some advantage therefrom,does not establish consideration without the element of bargain or agreed exchange.citation.meyer glenmoor homes,supra,d at,italics added.
the facts in meyer aptly illustrate this principle.plaintiff deceased husband had been a director and of defendant corporation along with two other individuals.a parcel of property formerly owned by the corporation had been transferred to the three individual who wished to obtain a loan on the property.in order to accomplish this,they needed quitclaim deeds from their spouses.plaintiff husband,to persuade her to sign the quitclaim deed,gave her a note for purporting to be from the corporation.the other directors did not discover the existence of the note until after death of the plaintiff husband when plaintiff sought to collect on the note.at trial,plaintiff conceded that the quitclaim deed she was persuaded to sign named her husband and his two associates as the grantees rather than the corporation.meyer glenmoor homes,supra,d at.nevertheless,she believed the corporation should be held liable because decedent represented the deed was for the corporation and because she offered to sign the quitclaim deed if the corporation would give a note for her interest.id.at.the court concluded that these facts would be material on the question of ostensible agency and equitable estoppel,but do not show,in the absence of authority in the decedent,that the corporation in fact bargained for the conveyance that was made.ibid.
plaintiff in meyer also sought to predicate the existence of consideration for the note on the incidental benefit to the corporation from a contract it later entered into with the three individuals to construct an apartment building on the land in question.meyer glenmoor homes,supra,d at.the court disagreed.although admittedly the loan obtained by the individuals was a loan to replace the short term bank financing for construction with a permanent loan,there was nothing to show that defendant corporation bargained for or received any of the proceeds of the loan that was obtained by the individual grantees.ibid.thus,the court concluded plaintiff attempts to show that the defendant corporation bargained for the detriment which she allegedly suffered founders on the lack of authority of the decedent to pledge the corporate credit and assets to pay for a conveyance to himself and others individually for their sole benefit.id.at.
similarly,there was no evidence presented at the underlying trial that the church received any of the,or that reverend steel or anyone else purporting to act on behalf of the church expressed a desire on the part of the church to receive ownership of the figueroa property in return for a loan from saks the uncontradicted testimony from all of the parties involved in the discussions was that the church name was put on the title in lieu of the names of the true,saks,and possibly reverend a nonprofit organization was necessary to their plan to obtain a city loan or grant.according to the evidence,saks was induced to enter into the agreement by caldwell assurances as to the certainty of the city funding the project.there was no discussion of what would occur if the city failed to fund,and certainly no agreement that,if that turn of events came to pass,the church would keep the property and pay off the notes from its meager resources.given the nature of the discussions between the parties,no one involved in the transaction had any grounds for believing that the church was bargaining for an interest in the ownership or a right to develop the figueroa property on its own.
saks may well have been fraudulently induced to enter into the deal by caldwell false assurance that city funding was a sure thing and would definitely happen within days.but his remedy for this wrong is to recover from the party who induced him to part with his money by virtue of an overly optimistic prediction of the future.he can not force the church to pay for property it never sought to own.we conclude that the uncontradicted evidence established the church defense to the breach of contract action that the notes lacked consideration 
the jury awarded damages identical to the amount awarded for breach of contract on saks fraud claim against the church.the only misrepresentations attributable to the church were statements made by reverend steel to the effect that the notes would surely be paid off within days.we now examine whether due to the position of authority bestowed on reverend steel by the church,the church should be held liable for his actions in encouraging saks to go through with the figueroa transaction and assuring him that the money was available and would be repaid within the time specified on the notes.the doctrines of respondeat superior,ostensible authority,or equitable estoppel could provide a ground for imposition of liability on a fraud theory see meyer glenmoor homes,supra,d at.rutherford rideout bank cal d,employer may be liable for fraud of employee acting in accordance with the general scope of his duties even if the employer receives no benefit and the employee was acting solely for his own purposes.
ostensible authority and equitable estoppel are proven in the same manner the california cases hold that under civil code section and a plaintiff can not recover on the basis of ostensible authority without a showing of facts sufficient to raise an estoppel citations i ts essential elements are representation by the principal,justifiable reliance thereon by the third party,and change of position or injury resulting from such reliance.citation.meyer glenmoor homes,supra,d at.under the doctrine of respondeat superior,an employer is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of the employment.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital cal th,d.saks contends that by placing reverend steel in his position as pastor and president,the church cloaked him with ostensible authority and justified saks reliance on reverend steel assurances that the notes would be paid.alternatively,saks believes the church should be held liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.
the court in meyer examined whether to apply the doctrines of ostensible authority or equitable estoppel where the party who gave the supposed corporate note to the plaintiff was a director and of the corporation,but the act undertaken by the a quitclaim deed in favor of the corporate directors as benefited the individuals only.the court noted the whole of the evidence disclose d not only a situation where there was no actual authority or authority implied in fact,but also a transaction,which because it purported to obligate the corporation to pay a debt incurred personally by its officer and director,could not be ratified by the corporation meyer glenmoor homes,supra,d at,and applied the following rule an agent can never have authority,either actual or ostensible,to do an act which is,and is known or suspected by the person with whom he deals,to be a fraud upon the principal.a corporation is not chargeable with the knowledge of an officer who collaborates with an outsider to defraud it meyer glenmoor homes,supra,at.
this describes the situation before us.according to his own testimony,saks was told in no uncertain terms by caldwell that the sole point of putting the property in the name of the church was to obtain funds from the public treasury,and that as soon as the funds were secured,title would be transferred to a private partnership.saks was also bluntly informed that caldwell controlled reverend steel and that reverend steel would do caldwell bidding in this regard.saks was familiar with this manner of doing business because in the earlier transaction involving the manchester property,saks name was used to purchase the property,and it was thereafter transferred to a partnership in which caldwell held an interest.saks may have been unaware of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the proposal to obtain public funds through a false front but he was clearly not ignorant of the ultimate goal of the parties pact to benefit the individuals through use of the church name.the fact that he remained silent during his conversations with caldwell,neither expressing approval nor disapproval,and accepted the notes from reverend steel without comment,does not transform saks from a coconspirator into an innocent commercial lender.by his own admission,he acquiesced in a scheme to wrongfully use the name of an eleemosynary corporation to obtain financial benefit for himself and his partner s.the mere fact that the plot was unsuccessful,does not justify transferring the financial burden of the scheme to a charitable corporation which stood to gain nothing from it.
the same analysis precludes application of respondeat superior liability.saks knew that the figueroa property was being purchased for the exclusive benefit of himself and the other individuals,including potentially reverend steel.under california law,the employee motive to benefit himself personally rather than the corporation is one factor,albeit not the determinative factor,in the application of respondeat superior.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital,supra,cal th at,d.the general rule we apply is that the tort must foreseeably arise from the employee duties.id.at,d.in the situation before us,because reverend steel was openly acting for the benefit of himself and the other individuals involved,it should have been obvious to all concerned that his actions did not arise from his normal conduct of pastoral duties on behalf of the church.this is particularly true since there was no evidence that the church regularly engaged in real estate development transactions of any type.we fail to see how reverend steel actions in embroiling the church in the figueroa property transaction could be deemed foreseeable.
as the supreme court explained in lisa,the primary question which must be determined is whether in the context of the particular enterprise an employee conduct is so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among the other costs of the employer business.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital,supra,cal th at,d,quoting rodgers kemper constr.d.there is nothing fair or equitable about permitting a third party to attribute a corporate employee acts to the corporation where the third party is engaged in a conspiracy with the employee to use the corporation to obtain a benefit for himself.
corporations code section 
one final matter we must examine is whether the corporations code prevents the church from asserting the defenses which,under our analysis,should have resulted in grant of the church motion for nonsuit or jnov.section of the corporations code provides no limitation upon the business,purposes or powers of the corporation or upon the powers of the shareholders,officers or directors,or the manner of exercise of such powers shall be asserted as between the corporation and any third person with certain exceptions not relevant here,subd.a,fns.omitted.corporations code section provides subject to the provisions of subdivision a of section,any note,mortgage,evidence of indebtedness,contract,share certificate,initial transaction statement or written statement,conveyance,or other instrument in writing,and any assignment or endorsement thereof,executed or entered into between any corporation and any other person,when signed by the chairman of the board,the president or any vice president and the secretary,any assistant secretary,the chief financial officer or any assistant treasurer of such corporation,is not invalidated as to the corporation by any lack of authority of the signing officers in the absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the signing officers had no authority to execute the same.italics added.
in snukal flightways manufacturing,cal th,d,the supreme court explained at common law,the party seeking to enforce a contract with corporation generally had the burden of establishing the contacting officers authority to bind the corporation.id.at,d.for the party seeking to establish the validity of a contract at common law,formerly a corporate seal affixed to an agreement,although not essential to the validity of such contract,provided presumptive evidence that the officer executing the agreement had the requisite authority to bind the corporation.id.at,d.t he presumption was subject to rebuttal by affirmative evidence establishing the absence of actual authority,requiring the party seeking enforcement based upon ostensible authority to establish justifiable reliance upon the agreement.id.at,d,italics omitted.then,corporations code section was added,specifying that an instrument entered into by a corporation is not invalidated by any lack of authority on the part of the officers executing the instrument if it has been executed by the designated officers,and the other party does not have actual knowledge that the signing officers lacked authority to execute the instrument.snukal flightways manufacturing,at,d.
it is apparent that,if its criteria are met,corporations code section precludes the invalidation of an instrument entered into by a corporation,despite the presentation of evidence demonstrating that the signing officers lacked authority to execute the instrument on its behalf.thus,the statute provides a conclusive,rather than a merely rebuttable evidentiary presumption of authority to enter into the agreement on the part of the specified corporate officers in addition,corporations code section applies so long as the other party does not have actual knowledge that the executing officers lack authority.because the statute applies even when the other party should have,but does not have,actual knowledge of the officers lack of authority,that party is relieved of the burden of establishing justifiable reliance upon the authority of the executing officers.thus,this statute provides greater protection to the other party than does corporations code former section the presumption of the latter statute was rebutted by evidence of a lack of actual authority,the other party was required to establish ostensible authority,including a showing of justifiable reliance upon the apparent authority of the executing officers.section limits the burden of proof,insofar as the third party knowledge is concerned,to a showing that he or she did not have actual knowledge of any lack of authority on the part of the signing officers.in so providing,the statute purpose is to permit the third party to rely upon the assertive authority of the officers designated by the statute.snukal flightways manufacturing,supra,cal th at,d.
saks contends that he had no actual knowledge that under the church bylaws reverend steel lacked authority to enter into real estate transactions or sign notes on behalf of the church.is he therefore entitled to an irrebuttable presumption that the note was valid we are not convinced that the actual knowledge referred to in the statute and the supreme court snukal opinion is limited to knowledge of the contents of a corporation files.in discussing the similar presumption contained in section of the corporations code,witkin has said it seems clear that if a third party knowingly participates with officers in a fraud upon the corporation,he is not entitled to the protection of this section.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.corporations,accord,ballantine sterling,cal.corporation laws ed,i f a third party knowingly participates in the perpetration of a fraud upon a corporation or in any abuse of authority by its officers or directors,it would seem that,as under former law,that knowing participation would be a defense or ground of invalidity at least as to such third party.since no corporate officer could have authority to pledge the corporation assets to a deal which benefits the promisee and possibly the officer,but not the corporation,knowledge on the part of the promisee that he is involved in such a transaction should suffice for purposes of the corporations code.
at the risk of belaboring the point,saks knowingly participated in a scheme to obtain money from a public agency and real property for himself and his cohorts through use of the church good name.to permit him to rest on his lack of actual knowledge of the contents of the church bylaws to support a recovery against the church would result in an injustice unsupported by any law.
procedural error 
although our decision to reverse based on lack of substantial evidence to support the jury verdict on saks breach of contract and fraud claims against the church essentially renders the other issues raised on appeal moot,we can not avoid commenting on several instances of substantial error,any one of which would have justified reversal.
unsubstantiated rico claim given to jury 
as was noted above,the jury was asked to find whether the church had violated rico,although the court had previously granted the church motion for nonsuit on the rico claim.the trial court attempted to correct this,ruling in a postverdict order that i n light of the court prior order made june,wherein defendants motion for as to defendant church and the rico claims was granted,the court finds that the special verdict rendered by the jury is inconsistent and the issue was not one for determination by the jury.but the damage had already been done.permitting the jury to believe that there was sufficient evidence to connect the church with a racketeering organization when there was not,could have prejudiced their consideration of the evidence of fraud and breach of contract,as well as the affirmative defenses raised by the church.
discrepancy in final judgment 
on december,the trial court purported to enter a judgment on the jury special verdict,although there were equitable issues which had yet to be resolved.the document entitled judgment on special verdict consisted of two parts,a verbatim transcript of the jury special verdict and a final order which stated that saks was entitled to judgment against caldwell,reverend steel,and the church in the amount of judgment against caldwell individually in the amount of and judgment against reverend steel and the church in the amount of.having said that,however,the order ordered,adjudged,and decreed that plaintiff lawrence saks,shall have judgment against craig caldwell,sam steel,and the church,jointly and severally,in the amount of this figure represented the rico damages the court should not have purported to enter judgment when there were still claims to be resolved,but having chosen to do so,we can not fathom why the court entered judgment on the rico claim only and why the judgment on the rico claim initially included the church,given the court earlier rulings.
the church then submitted its motions for new trial and jnov on all claims.one of the arguments made was that judgment should not be entered against the church for fraud because p rior to submission of the case to the jury,the court granted the church motion for directed verdict on saks fraud intentional misrepresentations and fraudulent concealment claims against the church.following further discussion with the court,the church withdrew its motion for directed verdict on the plaintiff fraud claims thereby allowing plaintiff intentional misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment claims to proceed to decision by the jury.the church withdrew its motion for directed verdict,and gave up the benefit of the court favorable ruling thereon,upon the understanding that,if for any reason the jury returned verdicts against the church on plaintiff intentional misrepresentation fraudulent concealment claims,the court would grant the church post trial motions for new trial and jnov consistent with the court earlier ruling that the church was entitled to have such claims dismissed.the church further argued that in view of the uncontradicted evidence that saks,caldwell,and reverend steel used the church name in order to facilitate their plans to finance their ownership and development of the figueroa project with money from the city,the underlying transaction represented a fraud on the church,and that there was no evidence to sustain a finding that reverend steel was acting as an agent for the church rather than in pursuit of his own personal interests.
after hearing these motions,the court ruled that it was changing the prior judgment in two respects.first,the judgment filed december,is hereby amended to include the following,only the following is added plaintiff lawrence saks,shall have judgment against defendant the church for breach of contract in the sum of.italics added.second,the judgment filed december,is ordered vacated and set aside in the following respect only recovery by the plaintiff against defendant the church in item of the judgment the judgment on the rico claim is vacated and set aside and plaintiff judgment in item is only as to the other named defendants therein.
concerning the jnov,the court stated the motion of judgment notwithstanding the verdict is denied as to defendants craig caldwell and the estate of sam steel.the motion is granted as to defendant the church as to the first cause of action rico in keeping with the court minute order made june,wherein it granted a motion for on behalf of defendant church on the rico claim.as to the remaining causes of action against defendant church the motion is denied.
the court stated it was denying all defendants motions for new trial,except as follows the motion for new trial is granted with respect to defendant the church,only,on the issue of damages only,unless the plaintiff will accept a remittitur of to conform with the evidence whereby the jury found in the special verdict that foreclosure by plaintiff saks of the real property at south figueroa street had a value of.
as a result of these various motions and rulings,there was a judgment entered against the church in the amount of for breach of contract,and a jnov in favor of the church on the rico claim.the fraud claim against the church was,however,in limbo the court had denied the church jnov,but at the same time had entered no judgment on fraud that we can find.in addition,not one word had been said in the order about the allegation that the court had essentially promised to rule favorably to the church on the fraud claim if the church withdrew the previously granted motion for nonsuit 
on july,the court held a hearing on a motion to correct a clerical error brought by the church.although we do not have the moving papers in the record provided to us,apparently the church counsel contended that the minute order contained an error and that the court must have intended to grant the jnov on the fraud claim due to the fact that no judgment was entered against the church on the fraud claim.the court denied the motion stating,let it ride,t est it over across the street without any further explanation.
on this record,we would be unable to affirm the jury verdict on the fraud claim even if it were supported by the evidence.the discrepancy in the record we have noted was brought to the trial court attention,and the court refused to correct the record or explain its actions.affirmance would be impossible because there is no way of knowing whether the clerical error was in failing to enter judgment against the church on fraud or in denying the motion for jnov for fraud.
ruling on equitable claims 
trial to the court on the equitable issues commenced in july.the court identified the equitable claims to be tried as a claim for declaratory relief establishing the existence of partnership and the rights and duties under the partnership agreement and possible breach of contract by saks a claim for rescission of the two notes a claim for reformation of the two notes and a claim that saks should be equitably estopped from enforcing the notes 
during this portion of the trial,oritta williams,a member of the church board of trustees,testified that reverend steel never asked the board of trustees to approve the purchase of the land.the church bylaws required property transactions to be approved by the board of trustees.ronnie hillman,another board member,similarly testified that reverend steel had no authority to borrow money in the church name.he testified that the church board and membership did not hear about the transactions in which reverend steel was involved until sometime long after the lawsuits were filed.carl steel,chairman of the board and reverend steel brother,testified that information about the transaction came out after the jury verdict.
angela basile,caldwell former secretary,testified that she had a conversation with saks about the figueroa transaction during the relevant time frame.saks stated during the conversation that there were certain things that he wanted from caldwell.basile wrote down some of his comments.these comments were on a document which was placed into evidence.the notes referred to saks desire for a letter confirming a partnership split percent of fees and profits to him and to caldwell and returned in days when cdd referring to community development department funds.
at the equitable trial,saks denied having had that conversation with basile.he testified he was never involved in a partnership to purchase the land on figueroa.he said he agreed to loan money to the church and reverend steel secured by the property,that the bulk of the money would be paid back in days and the rest in one year,and that he and caldwell would talk about forming a partnership to develop the property after the money was repaid.he said he had no understanding as to how the note would be paid,and no one represented that the source of the funds to repay the note would be a loan or grant from the city.although there was talk about a loan or grant and caldwell told him he would get repaid when the city funded a loan or grant,he did not rely on it there was to be a partnership at some point in the future comprised of him and caldwell,but not reverend steel or the church.
saks further testified that when reverend steel came to sign one of the notes,he told saks that he or the church would make interest payments,and that he or the church would make good on the note.saks could not recall which note.
saks called two additional witnesses who testified that shortly before his death reverend steel had admitted lying during his testimony about the meeting at a restaurant at which the details of the partnership agreement were supposedly worked out 
during the course of this testimony,the trial court repeatedly made comments to the effect that the evidence had already been presented to the jury,or,with regard to new evidence,that the testimony should have been before the jury.at the end of the trial,the court stated the evidence was given to people on the jury that made this decision in that case.i not about to substitute my opinion,frankly and i am not going to substitute my opinion for the credibility of saks and reverend steel and the rest of them that the jury decided.
the church contends that these statements indicated that the court abdicated its responsibility to determine the equitable claims.saks maintains that the court was merely exercising its right to adopt the jury advisory findings,and that in any event all of the equitable claims were subsumed by legal claims for which there was a right to trial by jury.
there can be no question that there may be an advisory jury in an equitable action,and that a trial court has the discretion to submit issues to a jury and adopt the jury findings on factual matters.nelson anderson th,d security pacific nat.bank d.clearly,however,no such procedure was followed here.instead,the court elected to bifurcate equitable and legal issues and hold a separate trial on the equitable claims after the trial on the legal claims concluded.the court thus implicitly agreed to consider not just the evidence presented to the jury,but also any additional evidence offered during the equitable trial.the church brought in new witnesses who,according to the trial court repeatedly expressed belief,presented a stronger case for the church lack of complicity in the figueroa property transaction than had been presented to the jury.in addition,saks credibility became subject to question due to basile testimony concerning his demands to caldwell and his own testimony professing ignorance about the source of funds to repay the both his earlier testimony and the allegations of his complaint.having encouraged the church counsel to expect a separate court trial on equitable claims,the court chastised him for not presenting all of the evidence to the jury.then,the court disregarded the new evidence and entered a judgment based on the jury earlier findings,although it had previously expressed doubt concerning the accuracy of these findings on both the fraud allegations and the intention of the parties concerning the promissory notes 
where a trial court indicates that it disagrees with the jury but nevertheless enters judgment or equitable claims based on the jury factual findings,the matter should be remanded for clarification and proper exercise of independent judgment.posey leavitt d.court denied injunction seeking removal of condominium deck extension because it was not inclined to set aside the jury verdict that the deck was neither a nuisance nor a trespass but stated i f the court really had any equitable power it could use,the best thing it could do would be to put the clock back security pacific nat.bank,supra,d at.it is beyond dispute that while a jury may be used for advisory verdicts as to questions of fact,it is the duty of the trial court to make its own independent findings and to adopt or reject the findings of the jury as it deems proper.had our decision on the fraud and breach of contract claims not rendered the equitable issues raised by the church moot,application of this rule would be particularly appropriate here where the court not only expressed disagreement with the verdict at the end of the first part of the trial,but heard additional evidence which cast further doubt on the jury findings.
statement of decision 
on august,during the trial on the equitable claims,the court apparently showed the parties a tentative ruling on a number of pending matters including the motion for clarification discussed above.during a colloquy with counsel,the court volunteered to provide a statement of decision,incorporating its previous orders and the tentative ruling.counsel for the church expressed concern over whether the court intended to make an independent determination of the facts.the court stated that it would do a statement of decision orally here in court and try and do a written statement of decision.
on september,both sides rested,a
