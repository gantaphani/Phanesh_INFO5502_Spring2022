in this appeal,clothing retailer pacific sunwear of california,pacsun appeals a trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of olaes enterprises,olaes in pacsun breach of warranty lawsuit.the lawsuit alleges that olaes breached the warranty contained in section,subdivision of the california uniform commercial code hereafter section,which requires certain sellers to warrant that their goods are free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like.pacsun seeks monetary damages for the alleged breach to compensate it for litigation expenses incurred in defending against a third party trademark infringement lawsuit that arose out of pacsun sale of purchased from olaes.
the trial court granted olaes motion for summary judgment on the ground that the third party claim did not constitute a rightful claim of infringement under the california uniform commercial code and thus did not breach the section warranty.the trial court reached this conclusion,as a matter of law,after analyzing a federal district court ruling on the third party request for a preliminary injunction in the underlying trademark infringement litigation.in particular,the trial court highlighted the district court finding that there was not a likelihood of confusion between the allegedly infringing and the third party trademark.
as we shall explain,the trial court interpretation of rightful claim was erroneous.a rightful claim under section is not synonymous with a claim that ultimately will prove successful in litigation.rather,as we will define for the first time under california law,a rightful claim under section is a nonfrivolous claim of infringement that has any significant and adverse effect on the buyer ability to make use of the purchased goods.under this standard,the trial court could not properly conclude on the evidence before it,as a matter of law,that the third party infringement claim against pacsun was not a rightful claim,and consequently we reverse.
olaes supplies pacsun with imprinted with graphic designs for resale in pacsun stores.in pacsun purchased hot sauce monkey from olaes.these depict,on the front,a monkey drinking a bottle of hot sauce and,on the back,the same monkey in apparent pain,expelling fire.centered underneath each of the images is a caption on the front,the phrase smile now on the back,the phrase cry later.
a.the hawaii litigation 
on may,clothing maker smile now cry later sncl filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of hawaii against another clothing maker,yakira,llc ecko,as well as a subsidiary of pacsun,pacific sunware stores,for trademark infringement.the complaint alleged that ecko had manufactured shirts that infringed on sncl trademark,and sold the shirts in its retail stores.sncl included in its complaint a copy of its registered trademark,which depicts two masks in the style of ancient greek theater masks.one of the masks is smiling and the other is crying.underneath the corresponding masks are the words smile now and cry later.sncl complaint also contained an example of the allegedly infringing design manufactured by ecko.
on january,sncl amended its complaint in the hawaii litigation to include pacsun as a defendant and to add an allegation that the hot sauce monkey violated sncl trademark.in the ensuing litigation,pacsun,with cooperation from olaes,defended itself,denying that the hot sauce monkey infringed sncl trademark.
in the course of the trademark litigation,sncl filed a motion for a preliminary injunction barring further sales of the hot sauce monkey.the district court issued a order denying sncl motion.in the order,the federal court analyzed sncl trademark infringement claim under an test utilized by the ninth circuit to determine likelihood of confusion,whether the similarity of the marks is likely to confuse customers about the source of the products t he core element of trademark infringement.brookfield communications west coast cir.the district court determined that sncl failed to carry its burden with respect to five of the eight factors,and had not established a likelihood of confusion between the hot sauce monkey and sncl trademark.in june,all parties to the hawaii litigation entered into a settlement agreement.the settlement was filed under seal.
b.the instant action 
in may pacsun filed the instant action in superior court.the complaint alleged a single cause of action that olaes breached the statutory warranty that the hot sauce monkey were free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like.after olaes answered the complaint,pacsun and olaes filed for summary judgment.
the trial court denied pacsun summary judgment motion and granted olaes summary judgment motion with respect to olaes motion,the court ruled that sncl underlying claims of infringement were not rightful claims under section and thus olaes did not breach the warranty provided for under that section.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that rightful was not defined in the california uniform commercial code,and that the parties had failed to present any case law expressly construing the meaning of that word as it appears in section.consequently,the court examined the usual and ordinary meaning of the term rightful by reference to various dictionary definitions,such as valid,just,appropriate fitting right or proper to determine whether the claim was rightful under these definitions,the court proceeded to review the federal district court preliminary injunction ruling.highlighting the fact that the federal district court found that sncl failed to meet its burden as to five of the eight factors required to establish a claim of trademark infringement,and that there was not a likelihood of confusion,the trial court concluded as a matter of law,that the underlying claim does not meet the plain meaning of the word rightful,valid proper appropriate or just.the court also note d the fact that pacsun continued selling the after being put on notice of the infringement claim,suggesting that pacsun itself believed the claim was not rightful.pacsun appeals.
discussion 
pacsun contends that the trial court erred in ruling,as a matter of law,that sncl trademark infringement claim was not a rightful claim.pacsun argues that,at the very least,there is a disputed factual issue as to whether the claim is rightful,precluding summary judgment.we agree.
california uniform commercial code section states as follows 
subject to subdivision there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the seller that 
a the title conveyed shall be good,and its transfer rightful and 
b the goods shall be delivered free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge.
a warranty under subdivision will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a third person may have.
unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.
california uniform commercial code section is identical to section of the uniform commercial code,which has been adopted in almost every american jurisdiction.see,east river transamerica delaval,fn,d noting that the uniform commercial code has been adopted by states hricik,remedies of the infringer the use by the infringer of implied and common law federal rights,state law claims,and contract to shift liability for infringement of patents,copyrights,and trademarks.tech,recognizing that section of article of the uniform commercial code has been e nacted by virtually every state.the statutory warranties contained in uniform commercial code section are derived from the implied warranty of title that emerged at common law as an exception to the caveat emptor doctrine.see dudine,warranties against infringement under the uniform commercial code state bar.
at issue in the instant appeal is the applicability of section and,specifically,whether the trial court properly ruled on a motion for summary judgment that the section warranty did not apply because the trademark suit filed by sncl was not a rightful claim of infringement.
in interpreting section,the parties suggest widely divergent definitions of the phrase rightful claim.olaes suggests that a rightful claim is a valid claim,one that has proven,or will likely prove,meritorious in litigation.see dudine,warranties against infringement under the uniform commercial code,supra,state bar,a rightful claim is one where the buyer or seller reasonably believes that a third party infringement charge would probably be upheld by the courts.by contrast,pacsun argues that any claim in the form of litigation constitutes a rightful claim regardless of its underlying merits.we believe the correct interpretation of section lies somewhere in between these positions.lumber mrk technologies,d,if claims of patent infringement are seen as marks on a continuum,whatever a rightful claim is would fall somewhere between purely frivolous claims,at one end,and claims where liability has been proven,at the other.
despite the widespread adoption of subdivision of section of the uniform commercial code,there are few reported cases discussing the provision and little precedent regarding the definition of a rightful claim.see phoenix solutions,sony electronics,cir,wl,dist.lexis bonneau ag industries,cir,recognizing that there is very little case law regarding this specific section.there are no california cases on point.thus we take up the question on a relatively clean slate,applying the familiar rules of statutory interpretation.
the role of the courts in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.people wright cal th,d.because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of that intent,we look first at the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.ibid.i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.allen contracting cal th,d.if,however,the statutory language is ambiguous or reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation,we will examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes,and we can look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.people jefferson cal th,d.
the phrase rightful claim is not defined in the california uniform commercial code,and is not a legal term of art that can be interpreted by reference to existing california statutory or case law.in addition,due to the multitude of definitions of rightful in common usage as noted by the trial court,the term is ambiguous with respect to its application in the current context.thus,the phrase is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation,and we must turn to extrinsic aids to discern its meaning.people jefferson,supra,cal th at,d.
the primary extrinsic aid for interpretation of the uniform commercial code is the official commentary to that code.while the statutory text,of course,controls over any inconsistent commentary,courts regularly look to the official commentary to determine the meaning of ambiguous statutory provisions.see,amerus life ins.bank of america,th,d wilson brawn of california,th,d cohen disner th,d see also jefferson jones,recognizing that the official comments are a useful aid for determining the purpose of its provisions and,while not controlling authority,constitute an excellent place to begin a search for the legislature intent when it adopted the code.
as explained below,the commentary to uniform commercial code section demonstrates that,contrary to olaes position,the term rightful claim as used in the statute is intended to broadly encompass any nonfrivolous claim of infringement that significantly interferes with the buyer use of a purchased good.
official comment to uniform commercial code section states that subdivision creates a duty on the part of the seller to see that no claim of infringement of a patent or by a third party will mar the buyer title.comment,par,reprinted at pt.west ann.cal.foll,italics added.the commentary further explains that the subdivision purpose is to reject case law that had required a buyer to be expressly prevented from using the goods by an infringement claim prior to obtaining relief.comment,par,reprinted at pt.west ann.cal,supra,foll.the commentary,thus,explains that under the uniform commercial code,eviction is not a necessary condition to the buyer remedy since the buyer remedy arises immediately upon receipt of notice of infringement.comment,par,reprinted at pt.west ann.cal,supra,foll,italics added.the comment quoted above,by stating that the seller warrants there will be no claim of infringement,and by asserting that the buyer remedy arises immediately upon notice of infringement,well before resolution of the claim,strongly suggests that any significant claim of or not ultimately the section warranty comment,par,reprinted at pt.west ann.cal,supra,foll.
the parameters of the section warranty are further clarified by the official commentary to an analogous warranty in subdivision of uniform commercial code section the subdivision warranty requires a seller to warrant that title to a purchased item shall be good,and its transfer rightful,subd.a cal,subd.a.the accompanying commentary states that the requirement that the transfer be rightful obligates the seller to ensure that the goods are free from any significant claims against simply those claims that ultimately will prove successful in litigation.comment,par,reprinted at pt.west ann.cal,supra,foll.the uniform commercial code section,subdivision warranty thus makes provision for a buyer basic needs in respect to a title which he in good faith expects to acquire by his purchase,namely,that he receive a good,clean title transferred to him also in a rightful manner so that he will not be exposed to a lawsuit in order to protect it.comment,par,reprinted at pt.west ann.cal,supra,foll,italics added.
in line with the above commentary,the majority view of the courts is that the uniform commercial code section,subdivision warranty is not inapplicable simply because the underlying claim against the buyer title ultimately lacks merit.see maroone chevrolet,nordstrom.dist so d,maroone chevrolet agreeing with the majority view that there need not be an actual encumbrance on the purchaser title or actual disturbance of possession to permit a purchaser to recover for a breach of warranty of title,and explaining that this view is supported by the policy that a purchaser should not be required to engage in a contest over the validity of his ownership frank arnold contractors,vilsmeier auction,cir,frank arnold contractors noting that the majority of courts hold that there need not be an actual encumbrance on the purchaser title to permit recovery for a breach of warranty of title,but rather a substantial shadow on the purchaser title is sufficient,and concluding that the majority approach is and firmly grounded in the policy of the statute.this broad interpretation,in the commentary and the case law,of uniform commercial code section,subdivision warranty of a good and rightful transfer of title,carries great weight in our interpretation of the analogous warranty in section.people jefferson,supra,cal th at,d,in interpreting ambiguous statute,courts should adopt the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes hawkland,uniform commercial code series,supra,arguing that the,subd.warranty is violated when a buyer discovers that reasonable grounds for a claim of infringement exist,and noting that t his viewpoint is consistent with the general thrust of section dealing with the warranty of good title,rightful transfer,and no encumbrance,and with the idea that disturbance of quiet possession eviction is not required as a basis for an action for warranty against infringement clark smith,the law of product warranties,just as a cloud on title is enough to trigger liability under,so is notice of infringement enough to justify suit under.
there are also strong public policy arguments that support interpreting the section warranty to encompass all nonfrivolous claims of infringement,and not solely those claims that ultimately prove or are expected to prove successful in litigation.people jefferson,supra,cal th at,d,directing courts to look to the public policy underlying a statutory enactment in discerning meaning of ambiguous text.
as between a buyer and a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind,the burden of infringement claims is most sensibly placed on the seller who will generally have superior knowledge as to the existence of such claims,and a stronger incentive to seek out and resolve potential infringement claims prior to sale.see hawkland,uniform commercial code series,supra,emphasizing that the warranty extends only to merchants who deal in the type of goods sold because they are the ones who know,or should know,of possible patent or trademark violations dudine,warranties against infringement under the uniform commercial code,supra,state bar,recognizing that the infringement warranty is ultimately derived from the presumption of law that a seller has superior knowledge of the title to his own goods,while also pointing out that,subd.extends this presumption even to cases where it is sheer imagination to presume that the seller has superior knowledge.the seller incentive to reduce or eliminate prospective claims of infringement is undermined,however,if the section warranty applies only to meritorious claims,leaving the risk of closely contested,but ultimately unsuccessful,infringement claims to be borne by unsuspecting purchasers.
a warranty against all nonfrivolous claims of infringement also accords with california uniform commercial code section status as an implied warranty,present in every sale involving a merchant who regularly deals in the goods sold,that can be altered by the contracting parties agreement.linear technology applied materials,th,d linear technology noting that expressly recognizes an exception for agreements to the contrary.in the most common,the situation best suited to a generally applicable implied will be unwilling to make a purchase unless assured by the seller that the goods are not subject to any nonfrivolous infringement claims.average buyers simply do not anticipate that their title to and use of purchased goods will be contingent upon their successful litigation of a subsequent infringement action.see chemtron,aqua products,explaining that w hen the goods are delivered and title is transferred,the warranty against infringement serves to provide assurances that the goods sold to the buyer are not subject to third party claims ezer,the impact of the uniform commercial code on the california law of sales warranties ucla,it certainly comports with common understanding that the buyer does not want an infringement lawsuit to accompany his purchase.section best reflects this reality by allowing a buyer to rely on the seller status as a merchant regularly dealing in the goods sold ibid,as demonstrating that the purchase price represents the total cost required for a buyer to use the purchased,that the buyer ultimate use of the goods does not include a hidden litigation cost.see maroone chevrolet,supra,so d at recognizing public policy that a purchaser should not be required to engage in a contest over the validity of his ownership frank arnold contractors,supra,at same lawrence anderson on the uniform commercial code ed,explaining that t he justification for this rule is that the buyer of goods that are warranted for title has a right to rely on the fact that there will be no need later to have to contest ownership.if the purchased goods are not,in fact,available for use without an initial investment of litigation expenses,this should be made explicit as between the parties.the parties can,then,modify the implied warranty factor the anticipated litigation costs discounted by the likelihood of their arising into the purchase price.
the policy rationales discussed above are also consistent with the most unusual aspect of the section warranty the creation of a alternative warranty that runs,in certain circumstances,from buyer to seller.the code provides an exception to the section warranty when the buyer furnishes specifications to the seller for the purchased goods,and an infringement claim arises out of the seller compliance with the specifications,subd.in such circumstances,the buyer must hold the seller harmless against any rightful infringement claim.ibid.
this exception to the seller warranty for claims arising out of specifications comports with the policy rationales we have described above.when an infringement claim arises from the seller compliance with specifications,it is the buyer who is properly required to ensure that the specifications which will generally not have been known to or desired by the seller prior to sale will not generate a rightful infringement claim.if the buyer fails to do so,he or she must bear the costs of defending a resulting claim.on the other hand,when the buyer does not provide specifications but purchases goods as is from an experienced seller,the seller properly bears responsibility for defending later nonfrivolous claims that the goods infringe on a third party intellectual property rights.
the alternate warranties contained in section also set up a clean dividing line delineating which party buyer or seller will be required to bear the burden of infringement claims arising from the use of purchased goods.this dividing line provides a degree of certainty to parties entering into a commercial transaction as to who will bear the costs of potential third party infringement claims.it would disrupt this finely crafted statutory allocation of risk,with little apparent benefit,to refocus the inquiry,as olaes requests,on the ultimate validity of the potential third party infringement that will be difficult to discern at the time of sale particularly for the buyer.
finally,if the section warranty were determined by reference to the ultimate success or failure of third party infringement litigation,the buyer would be placed in an untenable position when a third party sues,contending infringement of a trademark,patent or copyright.only by losing the helping the third party claimant to maintain an appearance of success prior to the buyer preserve the right to recover from the seller under uniform commercial code section this would create a perverse incentive that would undermine the adversary public policy outcome unlikely to have been intended by california uniform commercial code section drafters.cover hydramatic packing,stating that a construction of rightful claim as synonymous with actual infringement would not lead to judicious public policy inasmuch as parties would eschew settlement and be forced to go to trial to discern whether a rightful claim exists under federal patent law,quoted in linear technology,supra,th at,d.
in sum,it is clear from the official commentary,the statutory scheme and the public policy rationales underlying california uniform commercial code section,that the section warranty covers a broad scope of infringement claims and is not limited to claims that ultimately will prove successful in litigation.see hawkland,uniform commercial code series,supra,the warranty of no infringement is breached if the buyer is reasonably exposed to the patent or trademark claims of third persons,even though his use or quiet enjoyment of the goods is not disturbed.as we have explained,the warranty against rightful claims applies to all claims of infringement that have any significant and adverse effect on
