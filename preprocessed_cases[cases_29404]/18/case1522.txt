in the published portions of this opinion sections,and vi.we answer yes to the following question is an attorney equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense in a legal malpractice lawsuit when the attorney advises the corporate client that the failure to comply with required corporate formalities will have no negative impact,the corporate client follows the attorney advice and does not comply with required corporate formalities,and the statute of limitations expires because the corporation fails to comply with corporate formalities 
ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the underlying facts.
leasequip was in the business of equipment leasing and finance.appellant and plaintiff jonathan lampel lampel was the sole shareholder,officer,and director of leasequip.prior to,leasequip hired dapeer to render legal services in connection with numerous matters.
in,bank of america refused to furnish an accounting of the monies it had extended or received,by way of credits,on behalf of leasequip.dapeer advised leasequip it could not file a corporate tax return,because to do so without accurate information could subject it and lampel to fines and lampel to imprisonment for filing false tax returns.dapeer also advised that leasequip need not observe any normal corporate formalities,including,among other things,maintaining corporate minutes or filing the statement of information required by corporations code section.dapeer advised that the failure to observe these mere formalities would result in the corporation being suspended,but that it could be renewed by merely paying the back taxes at any time,without affecting any of the corporation business or legal claims.this advice was rendered periodically from to april.dapeer also advised that lampel could prosecute any legal claim leasequip might have in his own name.dapeer true motive in furnishing this advice was to render it legally impossible for leasequip to pursue claims against dapeer at a later time.
on october,dapeer returned the legal files on separate litigation matters to leasequip.these matters had ended in one way or another prior to october.however,dapeer continued to represent leasequip in two other litigation matters,the partnership liquidity actions and the bank of america action other than in these two litigation matters,dapeer ended his relationship with leasequip on october.
on july,leasequip was suspended by the secretary of state for the failure to file the statement of information required by corporations code section.
dapeer continued to prosecute and defend leasequip in the partnership liquidity actions and the bank of america action.dapeer continued to advise leasequip that it need not observe any normal corporate formalities,and advised that lampel could legally prosecute or defend,in his own name,any legal claim which leasequip may have had or which was brought against it.
on april,dapeer procured court orders permitting him to withdraw from representation with regard to the two matters for which he was attorney of record,the partnership liquidity actions and the bank of america action.
b.the legal malpractice lawsuit and demurrer.
on october,leasequip and lampel filed this lawsuit against dapeer.a first amended complaint was filed dapeer successfully demurred.a second amended complaint was filed.the second amended complaint alleged dapeer was liable for wrongful acts and omissions arising from the relationship.all three causes of action breach of oral contract,legal malpractice,and breach of fiduciary obligations were grounded in allegations of legal malpractice.
the second amended complaint delineated facts relating to the cases.these cases were those whose files dapeer had transferred to appellants on october.in these matters,leasequip or its predecessor in interest prudential capital corporation was either the plaintiff or defendant in a litigation matter.there were allegations that because of dapeer negligence,omissions,or misrepresentations,leasequip was damaged.the allegations of legal malpractice included accusations that dapeer had failed to secure leasequip position as a secured creditor,failed to request a trial de novo after losing an arbitration,failed to seek attorney fees,failed to obtain a writ of possession,failed to obtain authorization before settling a case,failed to respond to discovery requests,failed to make court appearances,and failed to take collection efforts.there were numerous allegations that due to dapeer misrepresentations about the status of these cases,leasequip was foreclosed permanently from protecting itself or from collecting monies owed to it.each of the cases had ended by the time the files had been returned to leasequip on october.
the second amended complaint also alleged dapeer had negligently handled the bank of america action and the partnership liquidity actions.at the time the original complaint was filed,these two litigation matters were still pending and dapeer was still the attorney of record.
dapeer demurred to the second amended complaint.dapeer divided the allegations of legal malpractice into two groups the accrued claims,allegations relating to the cases that had ended by the time the complaint was filed on october,and the pending claims,the partnership liquidity actions and the bank of america action.dapeer argued the following the accrued claims were barred by the statute of limitations because leasequip corporate powers were suspended when the lawsuit was filed and the corporate powers had been revived after the statute had expired the pending claims were either premature or,or no damages could be proven and lampel,individually,could not assert leasequip corporate causes of action.
in opposing the demurrer,leasequip did not dispute that its corporate powers had been suspended on july,but demonstrated that as of september,its corporate powers had been revived.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.an order of dismissal was entered,from which leasequip and lampel appealed.
during the pendency of the action,dapeer filed a separate lawsuit los angeles superior court case no.for unpaid legal fees.this separate lawsuit was filed on may.leasequip and lampel were the named defendants.among other allegations,dapeer alleged lampel was responsible for leasequip debts as the corporation alter ego.dapeer sought more than in unpaid legal fees.it appears dapeer case for unpaid legal fees is still pending 
iii.issues 
the issue we address in the published sections of this opinion sections,and vi.relates to the suspension of leasequip corporate powers and the effect of the suspension on the statute of limitations.dapeer contends the statute of limitations precludes leasequip from pursuing its legal malpractice case against dapeer with regard to the accrued cases.we hold that dapeer is equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations with regard to the accrued cases.
lampel,individually,has also appealed.in the unpublished section of this opinion section iv d,we reject lampel contention that he may assert leasequip corporate causes of action.in the unpublished section of this opinion,we also reject the argument that leasequip may proceed with allegations relating to the two pending cases the partnership liquidity actions and the bank of america action.
iv.discussion 
standard of.
our only task in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer is to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action.accordingly we assume that the complaint properly pleaded material allegations are true and give the complaint a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and all its parts in their context.citations.we do not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law.citation.people ex rel.lungren superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
a demurrer on the ground of the bar of the statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be,but is not necessarily barred.citations.it must appear clearly and affirmatively that,upon the face of the complaint,the right of action is necessarily barred.citations.this will not be the case unless the complaint alleges every fact which the defendant would be required to prove if he were to plead the bar of the applicable statute of limitation as an affirmative defense.citation.lockley law office of cantrell,green,pekich,cruz mccort th,d.
statute of limitations in legal malpractice cases.
the statute of limitations in legal malpractice cases is contained in code of civil procedure section.pursuant to section,legal malpractice claims must be brought either one year after actual or constructive discovery,or four years after occurrence the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first radovich th,d unless these periods are tolled pursuant to the exceptions specified in the statute.
the tolling exceptions are contained in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.subdivision a provides in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that any of the following exist the plaintiff has not sustained actual injury the attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred the attorney willfully conceals the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission when such facts are known to the attorney,except that this subdivision shall toll only the limitation and the plaintiff is under a legal or physical disability which restricts the plaintiff ability to commence legal action.
the parties do not discuss the statute.they agree that the statute of limitations contained in code of civil procedure section controls the disposition of this case.they also agree that since leasequip causes of action are grounded in legal malpractice,the statute of limitations found in section is applicable to all three causes of action breach of oral contract,legal malpractice,and breach of fiduciary obligation.quintilliani mannerino th,d stoll superior court th,d.
the parties further agree that with regard to the accrued cases,leasequip had actual notice of injury on october,when leasequip obtained the litigation files for these cases.the legal malpractice lawsuit was filed within,as it was filed on october.however,on that date,leasequip was a suspended corporation due to the failure to file the required statement of information.leasequip corporate powers were not revived until september,after the statute of limitations would have expired.
the first issue we address is the effect of the suspension on the statute of limitations with regard to the accrued cases.
c.the accrued cases.
the suspension of leasequip corporate powers and its effect upon the statute of limitations.

if a corporation fails to file a statement under corporations code section,fails to file a statement for months,and has been assessed a penalty under corporations code section during the period,then the corporation is subject to suspension under corporations code section.palm valley homeowners,design mtc,supra,th at,d the rutter group,corporations,supra,at,subd.a.the secretary of state notifies the corporation that its corporate powers will be suspended after an additional days.if the corporation fails to comply within days,the secretary of state certifies to the franchise tax board that the corporation is suspended,and mails a notice to the suspended corporation.t hereupon,except for the purpose of amending the articles of incorporation to set forth a new name,the corporate powers,rights,and privileges of the corporation are suspended,subd.c.palm valley homeowners,design mtc,supra,th at,d.
corporations code section,subdivision c makes clear that,except for the purpose of amending the articles of incorporation to set forth a new name,the suspended corporation may transact no business of any kind.palm valley homeowners,design mtc,supra,th at,d.since c onducting litigation is not amending the articles of incorporation to set forth a new name,ibid.corporations that have been suspended for failing to file the requisite information statement are disabled from participating in litigation activities.id.at,d.
in cases involving the suspension of a corporation as a result of the failure to pay taxes and fees,courts have uniformly concluded that while the corporation powers are suspended,the statute of limitations is not tolled.grell laci le beau th,d sade shoe oschin snyder d.aba recovery services,konold d.if the statute of limitations runs out prior to revival of a corporation powers,the corporation actions will be time barred even if the complaint would otherwise have been timely.citations.sade shoe oschin snyder,supra,d at.
dapeer borrows the rationale of these cases to argue that since the statute of limitations expired with regard to the accrued cases while leasequip was a suspended corporation,the statute was not cured by the subsequent revival.for purposes of discussion,we accept dapeer argument that the same rules apply to a corporation suspended for the failure to file the required statement of information.accepting this argument,the statute of limitations would have expired with regard to the accrued cases.
however,even if the statute of limitations expired with regard to the accrued cases,our discussion does not end.
dapeer is equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense with regard to the accrued cases.
leasequip contends that dapeer is equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations.this contention is persuasive 
dapeer is estopped.
e quitable estoppel is not a punitive notion,but rather a remedial judicial doctrine employed to insure fairness,prevent injustice,and do equity.it stems from the venerable judicial prerogative to redress unfairness in the application of otherwise inflexible legal dogma,based on sound public policy and equity.citation.spray,gould bowers associated internat.ins.th,d.
e stoppel is applicable where the conduct of one side has induced the other to take such a position that it would be injured if the first should be permitted to repudiate its acts.citations.four elements must ordinarily be proved to establish an equitable estoppel the party to be estopped must know the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had the right to believe that it was so intended the party asserting the estoppel must be ignorant of the true state of facts and,he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.citation.the doctrine of estoppel has been codified in evidence code section whenever a party has,by his own statement or conduct,intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief,he is not,in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct,permitted to contradict it.hills,chopstix dim sum cafe takeout iii,th,d.
here,the legal malpractice lawsuit was timely when filed.the only reason leasequip was foreclosed from pursuing its legal malpractice case against dapeer with regard to the accrued cases,was that at the time the lawsuit was filed,leasequip was a suspended corporation,having failed to comply with requisite corporate formalities,and leasequip powers were not revived until after the statute expired.however,it was dapeer who advised leasequip that compliance with corporate formalities was not
