the facts relevant to bohannon sentencing claims are these.on march,bohannon was indicted for knowingly and intentionally using the internet,a means of interstate commerce,to entice a minor into sexual activity,in violation of b.bohannon pled guilty to the charge and proceeded to sentencing.
according to the presentence investigation report psi,a police officer acting in an undercover capacity,entered an online chat room entitled i love much older men.the officer posed as a female named dana,and,shortly after entering the chat room,was contacted by bohannon.bohannon expressed sexual interest in dana,though he said he had never been with a girl as young as her.bohannon then said that he and dana would have to be careful because he was much older and did not want either of them to get into trouble.bohannon asked about dana sexual experience and expressed interest in having both oral and genital sex with her.
about two weeks later,bohannon and dana chatted online again,and,at bohannon suggestion,agreed to meet.bohannon discussed getting a room so they could engage in sexual activities,including genital and oral sex,and again stressed that they had to be careful because he could go to jail for a long time due to her age.the next week,they chatted still again and discussed meeting at a mcdonald on lantana road in lantana,florida.bohannon planned to drive from orlando to lantana and told dana that he would get a hotel room.bohannon also sent dana a picture of himself and indicated that he would bring the hat he was wearing in the picture and a red rose to the meeting at the mcdonald.
law enforcement officers subsequently arranged surveillance at the designated meeting place and time.the surveillance officers observed was identified from the picture he sent to dana during one of his chats and by the vehicle he drove,which was registered in his into the mcdonald,and then arrested him.the police inventoried his vehicle and found several condoms,a package of erectile dysfunction medication,a red rose,the hat he wore in the photograph he sent to dana,and a digital camera.
a search of bohannon house,pursuant to a search warrant,uncovered two computers containing evidence of the chats with dana and chats with numerous other girls who said they were under years old.a photograph of an actual girl was recovered,as were four photographs showing a girl,who had stated in chats with bohannon that she was years old,in various stages of undress.the psi stated that the chats between bohannon and the were very sexual in nature,and that in response to the girl question of whether her age mattered to bohannon,he responded,cool i like young girls.the computers also contained images of bestiality and sexual pictures bohannon took of women he met through the internet and with whom he had sex 
pursuant to,bohannon base offense level was a.the psi recommended a upward adjustment because the offense involved the use of a computer,b,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,a,b,which yielded an adjusted offense level of.with a criminal history category i,bohannon advisory sentencing range was to months imprisonment.because bohannon also faced a statutory minimum term of five years,b,his guidelines range became months imprisonment.see b providing that the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guidelines sentence if it is greater than the maximum of the applicable guidelines range.
seven days after the deadline for filing objections to the psi,the government filed an objection and a motion for leave to file the objection out of time,arguing that the psi should have applied the in c,which directs the application of if the offense involved causing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction.the government asserted that application of the yielded a base offense level of,which should then be increased by levels based on the age of the child.with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,bohannon adjusted offense level would be a rather than the psi recommended.in support of applying the,the government argued that the preponderance of the evidence showed that bohannon intended to take pictures of dana because he had a history of taking sexually explicit photographs,as evidenced by the contents of the two computers seized at his house,and arrived at the meeting place with a digital camera in his vehicle,along with a rose and erectile dysfunction medication.
at the sentencing hearing,the government introduced a police report of the forensic examination of bohannon computers.the report included a list bohannon kept of approximately women,their chat names,and the number of times he had had sex with each of them.the report also contained images which were printed from bohannon computer and showed him engaged in sexual activities with some of the women from the list.the government argued that this evidence,along with the digital camera found in his vehicle at the scene of the planned meeting with dana,established,by a preponderance of the evidence,his intent to take images of sexual activity with dana.
over bohannon objection,the district court agreed,holding that bohannon had intended to take pictures of himself engaged in sexual activity with a girl whom he believed was years old.the district court found that the evidence in the government exhibits demonstrated bohannon propensity to take pictures of his sexual encounters with females.the court noted that although mere possession of the camera would not be enough to trigger the,the combination of the camera and bohannon tendency to catalog his sexual activity enabled the government to meet its burden.
the district court ruled that the applied and calculated a base offense level of,pursuant to.the base offense level was increased by levels,pursuant to b,because the offense involved a minor between the ages of and,and by another levels,pursuant to b,because the offense involved the use of a computer.with the reduction for acceptance of responsibility,bohannon adjusted offense level was,and his guidelines range was to months imprisonment.
after restating his objections to application of the and the enhancement for the specific offense characteristic based on the age of the child,as represented by the undercover officer during the chat sessions,bohannon requested a sentence below the guidelines range,arguing that a sentence
