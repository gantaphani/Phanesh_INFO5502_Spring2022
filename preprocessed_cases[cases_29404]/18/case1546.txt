jeannette franklin,now deceased,and her husband,darrel franklin respondents filed an action for personal injury,premises liability and loss of consortium against several defendants,including appellant usx corporation usx.respondents contended that jeannette had contracted mesothelioma,an cancer,as a result of childhood exposure to second hand asbestos carried home by her parents,who worked at the western pipe steel shipyard wps in south san francisco during world war ii.respondents sought to hold usx liable for their injuries on the theory that it was the successor in interest to wps.by stipulation,the successor in interest issue was tried by the court on a statement of facts that were either agreed to or disputed,along with an documentary record no testimony was presented in this phase of the trial.the trial court concluded that usx was the successor in interest to wps,and was therefore liable for any damages caused by wps.in a bifurcated proceeding,a jury decided the issues of liability and damages,and returned a verdict against usx in excess of million.
usx appeals the trial court conclusion that it was the successor in interest to wps.it also appeals the jury verdict on several grounds.we hold that the trial court erred in finding usx liable as the successor in interest to wps.accordingly,we do not address the issues pertaining to the jury verdict.
general background 
prior to the beginning of world war ii,wps owned a steel fabrication plant in south san francisco,which had been used to build ships during world war i.when world war ii broke out,wps entered into a contract with the united states maritime commission to again build ships for use in the war.the contract required the use of ship building materials containing asbestos.
jeannette franklin was a child during world war ii.both of her parents worked at wps from to.neither of her parents worked directly with materials,but they both worked in areas where asbestos was present.at times,they were exposed to airborne dust during the mixing of mud,during insulation work,and when workers swept up debris.franklin alleged that she was exposed to this dust because her parents brought it home on their clothing and in their car.in,franklin was diagnosed with peritoneal mesotheliama,which she maintained was caused by her childhood second hand exposure to asbestos 
corporate history 
in december,the assets of wps were purchased by consolidated steel corporation of california con cal for over million in cash.in connection with the sale,con cal agreed to assume all of the liabilities,obligations and commitments of wps.

the trial court proceedings 
it was agreed by the parties and the court that the issue of successor liability would be decided by the trial court based upon an agreed statement of stipulated and disputed facts and on stipulated exhibits.in a statement of decision issued march,the trial court first found,consistent with the parties stipulated facts,that in con cal had assumed all of the liabilities of wps.it further found,on several grounds,that usx was the successor in interest to con cal,rendering usx responsible for the liabilities of wps,including contingent tort liabilities.the court held that by virtue of its purchase of con cal business,property and assets,usx had expressly or impliedly assumed the liabilities of con that the transaction between usx and con cal constituted a de facto merger that usx was a mere continuation of con and that usx was the product line successor to con.

discussion 
it has been generally stated that where one corporation sells or transfers all of its assets to another corporation,the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the former unless the purchaser expressly or impliedly agrees to such assumption,the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the two corporations,the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation,or the transaction is entered into fraudulently to escape liability for debts.ortiz south bend lathe d,disapproved on other grounds in ray alad cal d,ray alad.in addition,under certain limited circumstances an exception has been judicially created to provide a remedy against the successor when a person has been injured by the predecessor product.this exception,first enunciated in ray alad,supra,cal d,has become known as the product line successor rule.the trial court found usx liable for respondents injuries under the first three general exceptions to,as well as under the product line successor exception.we consider each ground,and hold that usx can not be found to be the successor in interest to con under any of the theories asserted.
usx did not expressly or impliedly assume the tort liabilities of con 
based upon its interpretation of the purchase agreement and other extrinsic evidence,the trial court found that usx had expressly or impliedly assumed the tort liabilities of con.because no issue of credibility was involved in the trial court determination,we review the agreement and the extrinsic evidence de novo qualls lake berryessa enterprises,th,d with an eye toward giving effect to the mutual intentions of the contracting parties morey vannucci th,d.we first consider the language of the purchase agreement itself,which we conclude unambiguously shows that usx did not assume the tort liabilities of con.see chaknova th,d chaknova.we further hold that,because the unambiguous contract was expressly integrated,it was improper to consider extrinsic evidence to vary or alter its terms.id.at,d.finally,even if the extrinsic evidence is taken into account,it does not show the parties intention that usx assume the liabilities at issue in this action.
pursuant to the purchase agreement,the bulk of con cal business assets were purchased by usx,with con cal retaining certain specified assets and certain existing contracts.with regard to usx assumption of liabilities,the agreement provided the buyer shall not,except as herein otherwise specifically provided,directly or indirectly,by virtue of any of the provisions of this agreement,become liable for any of the debts,obligations,liabilities,undertakings,agreements or commitments of the sellers of any nature whatsoever it further provided that,while usx would assume responsibility for performing all the obligations of the sellers with respect to the uncompleted portion of assumed contracts,orders and subcontracts in no event shall the buyer assume any obligations of the sellers,or any of them,arising out of deliveries of goods,wares or merchandise made by the sellers prior to the closing,including,but not limited to,any claims on account of any allegedly defective goods,wares or merchandise delivered by the sellers pursuant to any such contract or order,or otherwise.italics added.
the quoted language is clear and unambiguous usx assumed only the liabilities specified in the purchase agreement,which did not include the assumption of contingent tort liabilities.it is equally clear that the purchase agreement was an integrated document.it provided that t here are no agreements,contracts,promises,representations or statements between the parties hereto except as contained in this agreement,and this agreement shall constitute the entire and whole contract between the parties hereto.
notwithstanding the quoted language of the integrated agreement,the trial court found the contract documents to be ambiguous,and considered documents extrinsic to the contract in order to resolve the perceived ambiguity.based upon the purchase agreement provision rendering usx responsible for all unfilled sales orders and on an indemnity clause contained in a document entitled bill of sale entered into on august,the court found that the agreement between the parties regarding the assumption of liabilities was ambiguous.the indemnity clause in the bill of sale provided that the seller would use its best efforts to obtain written consent from third parties to all assignments and transfers of leases,contracts,agreements,licenses,options and other property,assets and business assigned and transferred to the respective buyers in order to make effective as against said third parties any such assignment and transfer,it being understood that,if the respective buyer shall assume all liabilities thereunder of the seller to the third party or parties remaining unperformed at the time of such assignment,the seller will save,defend and keep harmless the respective buyer of,from and against such part of such unperformed liabilities as shall relate to the period to and including august.
this indemnity provision was itself clear,and did not render ambiguous the parties intentions with regard to the assumption of tort liabilities,as it had nothing to do with those liabilities.the subject matter of this indemnity clause pertained only to unfinished contracts assumed by usx in the purchase,and to con cal promise to indemnify usx for those parts of the contracts remaining unperformed before the closing date.while usx agreed to assume responsibility to complete those contracts after the closing date,it specifically disavowed responsibility and liability under the contracts to the extent these arose prior to the closing.
in addition,we note that the bill of sale contained specific and clear provisions relating to the buyer general of liability.it stated that t he transfer of the seller business and certain of its property and assets to the buyers is made without the assumption by the buyers of any of the liabilities of the seller except those specifically enumerated below,and the seller hereby covenants and agrees at all times to save,defend and keep harmless the buyers from and against any and all claims expenses and liabilities whatsoever,based upon,arising out of or in any way connected with the seller liabilities except those specifically enumerated those specifically enumerated exceptions were for liabilities on contracts,purchase orders,unfilled sales orders,performance bonds and indemnity contracts arising after august.this provision,as well as the indemnity provision relied upon by the trial court,comport completely with the clear and unambiguous terms of the purchase agreement,by which usx assumed no liabilities for the damages at issue in this lawsuit.we thus conclude that,because the contract language was unambiguous,and the parol evidence created no ambiguity and was consistent with the contract,the trial court erred in considering the extrinsic evidence to vary or modify the terms of the contract.pacific gas electric thomas drayage cal d.
nonetheless,by referring to extrinsic evidence,the court concluded that usx had,expressly or by implication,assumed liability for the personal injury claims asserted by the franklins.in reaching its conclusion,the trial court looked to two other categories of extrinsic evidence.
first,it considered letters written by usx to third parties after the execution of the purchase agreement.in these letters,con cal customers,vendors and subcontractors were informed of the sale of con cal business and operating properties to con del,and were told that t he change of ownership will not in any way affect the fulfillment of the contractual obligations of the selling company.all undelivered orders and uncompleted contracts of that company will be assumed by the acquiring company and will be performed by it in strict accordance with their terms.in similar letters,various governmental entities were informed of the sale,and advised that con del will continue to operate the transferred facilities and business without material change in present personnel,management or business policies.
the trial court concluded that the business policies referred to in these letters included,among others,consolidated california policy to assume wps debts and liabilities of any nature.the fundamental problem with this finding is that it finds absolutely no support in the record.these letters speak for themselves they were written to inform the recipients of the change in ownership,and assure them that the change would have no effect on the fulfillment of the seller contractual obligations.based upon the evidence in the record,the letters were not susceptible to the trial court interpretation.
the court also looked to a navy contract that usx assumed as part of the purchase agreement.this contract was the one under which wps had agreed to build ships during the war,resulting in the employment of jeannette franklin parents.the trial court found that the navy contract imposed on wps the obligation to maintain and repair the premises at its south san francisco shipyard,that all of usx potential liability in this premises liability case arises out of wps operation of the shipyard under this contract,and therefore arises directly out of the fulfillment of this contract that usx specifically assumed,and that had wps fulfilled all of its obligations under this contract,jeannette franklin parents likely would not have endured the asbestos exposures at wps shipyard that are the subject of this lawsuit against usx.from this analysis,the trial court concluded that usx expressly assumed the tort liabilities of con.again,our review of the document and of the evidence in the record does not support the trial court conclusion.
the navy contract in question imposed upon wps the responsibility to maintain and repair the facilities prior to their transfer to the government.it made no mention of any obligations that could be interpreted as inuring to the benefit of shipyard employees and their safety.thus,even if considered for the purpose of shedding light on the intent of the parties with respect to assumption of the seller tort liabilities,the navy contract contributed nothing.in addition,there was no evidence in the record to support the trial court finding that wps had not fulfilled its obligations under the navy contract,or that had it done so jeannette franklin parents likely would not have endured the asbestos exposures.
there was no de facto merger or mere continuation 
the trial court also found that usx could be deemed to have assumed the liabilities of con under the de facto merger theory and under the theory that usx was a mere continuation of con cal.although these two theories have been traditionally considered as separate bases for imposing liability on an successor corporation,we perceive the second to be merely a subset of the first the crucial factor in determining whether a corporate acquisition constitutes either a de facto merger or a mere continuation is the same whether adequate cash consideration was paid for the predecessor corporation assets.
no california case we have found has imposed successor liability for personal injuries on a corporation that paid adequate cash considerati
